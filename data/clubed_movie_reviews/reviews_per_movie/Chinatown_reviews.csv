Example of Masterful Film Noir!,"Over the years, people have called Chinatown one of the best movies ever. I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.As I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.This movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.This film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.Even though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction. But we also have a great but sad, trumpet-infused score from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from John A. Alonzo that captures the L.A of old in a very effective way. Let's not forget about the award-winning screenplay from Robert Towne. Nominated for 11 Oscars, this film is worth a watch. This is a fantastic thriller that relies upon excellent storytelling.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This movie got it all: perfectly paced study of human darkness,"I knew CHINATOWN was hailed as the paragon of a film noir, and that's why I finally got down to watching it. However, despite having known about the movie for quite a while, I wasn't really prepared for just how dark it could be. The movie starts slowly, with a private detective taking on what looks like a routine case. But soon he finds himself enmeshed in a web of conspiracy, murder, lies and deceit. The plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soul-wrenching.In a recent New York Times piece, they called CHINATOWN ""a meditation on evil"", which is spot-on. Set in 1937, this movie is just all-round perfect, first and foremost how everything is connected within the grand structure of the movie, that is rich in themes (water, evil, trust, guilt, greed) and even richer in suspense, as the audience—just like our protagonist—tries to find out what is happening. The story is ""complex"" for sure, but it's not ""complicated"". Everything makes sense in the end and the complexity pays off big time.Besides the impeccable screenplay, everything else about this movie is perfect as well. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway carry the movie with sophistication and dignity. Dunaway's stunning performance in particular fills every scene with an aura of mystery as you are trying to find out what her motives are. The set pieces are beautiful, the score is compelling; and camera-work and editing could not be any better. There is a reason this one is called a classic! So, if you're ready to delve deep into a richly layered exploration of the dark side of humanity—enjoy the ride. But don't expect to come back unscathed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Polanski & Nicholson's Finest Work. A Top 20 Greatest Film 💯,"Chinatown sits securely at the pinnacle of the Neo Noir genre. Fueled by Polanski-Nicholson synergy, anchored by one of greatest-ever original screenplays (written by Los Angeles native Robert Towne), brought to movie-life via PanaVision by brilliant cinematographer John Alonzo, and produced by the industry icon Robert Evans, this is one of film's greatest works of art, and being imo one of the top 20 greatest films ever made - it is a must-see movie.Chinatown represents the art of film-making in its finest form, exceeding expectations in every reel.This was Polanski's last film he made in the USA, and the best and last opportunity to see Nicholson's brilliant acting prowess before his characterization method became (to a large degree) a caricature of himself (albeit doing so perhaps better than any other icon-level movie-star).Often, this much talent on one set becomes a disappointment. Not this time.Like many successful collaborations, there were major style differences between Evans, Polanski and Towne - Such ""manageable stress"" can sink a film, but instead served as a positive catalyst in raising the bar of production and execution.For those who haven't seen the film, it is ""required"" viewing. For those who haven't seen it in a while, cue it up, and enjoy - like most great films, it just seems to get better with age.Polanski's style of film making utilizes a classic Noir movie-making ""complete-the-scene"" method before moving on - similar to live theatre (Act I, Scene 1, etc) The benefit is fulfilling each scene's importance to the story and film as a whole - this style works well in Noir films, and his set-up, detailing, and execution is brilliant.The immaculately detailed set designs, wardrobe, makeup, and authentic restored vintage cars were painstakingly orchestrated by Polanski to transport us back to atmosphere and feel of the golden age of Hollywood circa 1937.Chinatown is one of the greatest films ever made making it a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Forget It Jake, It's Chinatown","This is a top ten for me. I have watched this film several times, and each time I see why Jack Nicholson is one of our great American actors. It starts with a story of complexity but accessibility. Nicholson's Jake Gittes, running around with a slit in the side of his nose, put there by Polanski, investigates, gets careless, and realizes what he has stumbled upon. Fay Dunaway as Mrs. Mulray and John Huston and that voice: ""Just find the girl."" There are comic scenes and Nicholson has feet of clay, but he finally puts his personal integrity on the line. He moves into darkness and sees the underside. And then there is Chinatown with its secrets, politics, incest, all of that. It is such an intelligent movies. One of the reviewers said it was compact. That says it all. Every scene is necessary. It's too bad Polanski can't work in the U.S. anymore--he still releases a treasures every so often. To get back to the movie, all that leads to the climactic last several minutes has been prepared for with loving care by the director. It's so nice to know that there are films like this that people will watch into the latter stages of the 21st century. One of finest.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Marvelous,"There is a word, impossible to spell, that describes the alignment of solar bodies like the planets when they all fall into place together. A similar word would describe this film. Everything about it is right. Polanski never directed a better movie. The performers, down to the lowest atmosphere person, are superb. The editing, the score, the sound, the decor, the dialog, all are just about flawless. The photography is peerless. The white garden apartments, the terra cotta roof tiles, the palms and desert sand are all painted with a faint gold, faintly ripe with false promise, like the oranges that bounce from Gittes' desperately speeding car in the northwest Valley.Polanski deserves much of the credit. When Gittes surprises Evelyn Mulwray in her car, after he follows her to her daughter's house, her face slumps forward and beeps the horn briefly. Then, so faintly, we hear a few dogs bark in the background. Not only is the scene itself exquisitely done but it prefigures the ending, as does Gittes' remark earlier to Evelyn that she has a flaw in her iris. The movie is too good to deserve much dissecting. It stands repeated watching. If there is anything wrong with it, it is the serious and tragic ending that Polanski always insists on tacking on. Robert Towne was right and Polanski wrong in this case. Everything came together on this film. It's not only the best detective movie ever made; it's one of the best movies ever made -- period. A marvelous job by everyone concerned.I have to add (6/27/05) that the word I mentioned in the first sentence is spelled ""syzygy."" Man, did I get enlightening email on that. I might as well add two other impressive features of this movie. (1) Polanksi takes his time. Example: Gittes sneaks into Hollis Mulwray's office and begins to go through the drawers of his old-fashioned wooden desk. As he slides each drawer out, Polanksi gives us a shot of their humdrum contents (checkbooks, magnifying glass, and so forth) and we can almost smell the heat and the odor of shellac and sawdust emanating from the wooden containers. The contents reveal nothing of importance in this case. But (2) sometimes irrelevant information crops up that resonates later in the film with its own echo. The detail might be just a word (""applecore"") or an ordinary object (a pair of spectacles found in a pond, immediately after Gittes imitates the Japanese gardener's remark that the water is bad for the ""glass."") Some of the references may be so consistent as to constitute a theme (water). None of this hits you over the head with its significance. It's all very neatly stitched together.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not for me, but if you're into 70s and noir, you'll really like it","Chinatown is supposedly one of the best films of all time and of the 70s. Maybe it is, but it's not for me. You really need to have a taste for 70s filmmaking and noir to appreciate this in its' fullest. I grew up in the 80s and 90s and always had a tough time praising movies of the 70s.The movie has plenty of good qualities such as the style, acting, intricate story lines, surprises, dialogue, and mystery. It's a good film, but I couldn't see all the universal praise it gets unless it's from people who grew up in the 60s or 70s.I fell asleep on consecutive nights while trying to get through it and finally finished it on the third try. While it is interesting and very intriguing, it didn't necessarily ""grip"" me the way that a mystery/crime drama/thriller would be expected to. The most gripped I was during the whole movie came on my third try to finish it when Nicholson basically domestically abuses Mrs. Mulwray and she reveals something very disturbing. Shocks like this are always riveting, but I was more disturbed than impressed with the reveal. Maybe this was gratifyingly controversial and provocative for 1974? It didn't really work for me.While the film has classic qualities, without a doubt, by the end, for all the light it had shown at times for me, it sort of dimmed down a few points and I'll settle for a solid 7/10. It's a classic crime drama story and film that I highly recommend for that genre's list of originals, but outside of the hype, which by now appears to be bandwagon, I don't see how it's considered one of the best movies of all time. Good, but not great. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Prettied up, lots of familiar twists, but well done, surely, and with Nicholson in top top form","Chinatown (1974)Not so much a film noir in style or character, but a period crime drama, set in the familiar 1930s of many noir films, and featuring a noir fixture, the loner detective.I say this right away because Chinatown is sometimes called the last great film noir. After this point, noir films (or pseudo-noir, whatever your definition) become either thoroughly modern or openly derivative. The term ""film noir"" has itself loosened up to include almost any moody 1940s-style film with crime in it, which starts lose it's descriptive usefulness.But Jack Nicholson is, really, a great detective in the Raymond Chandler mode--sassy, fearless on the surface but actually wary and a little scared in the end, playing by his own set of rules, and working mostly alone. As well made as this movie is in many ways, it's Nicholson's physical presence that makes his scenes really work. He's such a natural actor for the camera, hesitating just long enough to demand attention but not so long it becomes affected, he becomes definitive. And that's enough to make Chinatown classic.The plot, too, is great dramatic stuff. Based in L.A., with lots of night scenes and period interiors, it circles around pretty women and rich men and corrupt politicos and dubious cops. And around water. In a way, this makes the movie prescient, almost--water being no new topic for Los Angeles but increasingly pertinent in the 1970s. Water is also a MacGuffin in the plot, a device we don't care deeply about compared to the interpersonal intrigues, the incest, the murders. All this other stuff keeps the movie, and Nicholson, going, and it's snappy and well done. It isn't exactly brilliant, though, and anyone really looking at the screenplay and following the plot might raise an eyebrow now and then, or question some of the hyperbole around the movie.It's fun seeing director Roman Polanski appear as a jerky, power-hungry kind of thug, because maybe it fits him (though his friends say otherwise). He has confessed to raping of a young teenager long ago, but I have never heard of him actually apologizing for it. (I know that's supposed to stay outside of the analysis of the movie, and he did do 42 days in jail.) Digging further in, you can maybe see John Huston's role as a little strained (though I love Huston in general, and his presence is meant to let us connect to a previous generation of Hollywood) and Faye Dunawaye, for all her fame, is slightly cold at times, a little decorative. The movie has lots of strong effects this way, and you know that Polanski is a movie lover, and the result taken whole is a kind of bowing down to this kind of crime film from earlier on. And in that sense, every doubt I have for the movie above could be countered with a simple, ""It was intended that way."" And the clichés and familiar plot twists are part of an homage to the medium.Which then begs the question--why isn't it filmed with more energy, with less prettiness? It doesn't in fact, adapt to a rigorous, stark, shadowy film noir aesthetic, but instead layers a very well done but slightly 1970s perfect, technically excellent color. Not that it should have been black and white, and not that Farewell My Lovely (filmed the next year in a really vivid, visual, film noir style in color, in L.A.) is the only way to go. But there were options to avoid making it actually too pretty, and too tame.All of this is relative nitpicking. I go back to Nicholson. If you can focus on his role, his lines, his performance, capital P, you will be mesmerized and impressed, again and again. It is a strong movie, and an interesting one, which is a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gittes gits it done.,"Truly deserving of its title as one of the greatest films of all time, Chinatown delivers in spades. Everything about the film shines, and it looks better now than it probably did in 1974; of course, there's a lot of junk in the theaters these days. Acting, cinematography, script, atmosphere, it's all 10s baby. The story of a struggling P.I. getting a case that has more twists and turns than a mountain road is still one of the most crafted storylines ever concocted. Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, John Hillerman, and everyone else deliver superb performances. Robert Towne's script, John A. Alonzo's camerawork, and Polanski's direction all make this a classic. You can't be a movie buff if you haven't seen this one.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Great 'modern' film noir,"Set in late '30s Los Angeles this 1974 film opens with a woman, identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray, asking private detective Jake Gettes to find out whether her husband, chief engineer of the LA Water and Power Company, is having an affair. He follows him and ultimately photographs him with another woman. Somehow these pictures end up in the papers and he is approached by another woman who it turns out is the real wife of Mulwray... and she intends to sue. He continues to investigate Mulwray and suspects some odd goings on at Water and Power... then Mulwray turns up dead; drowned during a severe drought. His continued investigation brings him closer to the real Evelyn as well as into real danger as he learns the truth about Water and Power's activities which could make some people very rich at the expense of other, poorer, people.This film may have been made about a quarter of a century after the classic era for film noir but it perfectly captures the feel of those films. It has morally ambiguous characters inhabiting a murky world that contrasts with the bright Los Angeles sunshine. The story has many twists and turns without feeling unnecessarily complex or confusing. The cast does a great job; especially Jack Nicholson who is in every scene so that the viewer doesn't know anything Gettes doesn't know. Faye Dunaway is solid as Evelyn Mulwray and John Huston is suitably menacing as her father; a man standing to make a lot of money with many dark secrets. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good mystery or fans of film noir.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
noir.,"Polanksi's 'Chinatown' stands as one of the classics of 1970s American cinema, the last classic period in American cinema. It's a great reminder of how utterly engaging cinema can be without the special effects, flimsy plots and outrageous stunts of many major studio productions now, not evening mentioning the obvious marketing tie-ins.The cinematography and screenplay could be considered almost economical in its minimalism as it is really the story, script and characters that drive this movie forward.Chinatown tells the story a detective, confidently played by Jack Nicholson, who gets embroiled in an investigation involving the mysterious murder (suicide?) of the head of the Water Board. During the investigation, he gets involved with Evelyn Mulwray, the wife of the murdered man who appears to want to get to the bottom of the mystery but during the course of the movie demonstrates that she is not telling the whole story and has something to hide.Everything in this movie works from already mentioned tight editing down to the costumes and sets.Nuff said!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A noir masterpiece, possibly even a timeless classic...","While I don't care too much for Roman Polanski's style of direction(maybe I'll grow to like it eventually, maybe not), I can't deny that this is a truly great film. Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role, and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character... his shark smile, his voice, his tone... all of it, perfect. I always thought, when watching films with Nicholson, that he'd make a great lead in a noir film, so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir, I naturally saw it as soon as possible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected, but apart from that minor detail, it was flawless. The plot is great, and thoroughly interesting and involving. The pacing, while not fast all the time, is more than acceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting. The acting is great... like I said earlier, Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own. The characters are well-written and credible. The special effects are well-done and still hold up pretty well. The dialog is very well-written and memorable. There are quite a few quotable lines, as well. The cinematography is good, and even when the plot doesn't move a lot, Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background, while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us. While Polanski certainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does, he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots, and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance, much like Kubrick. The film has a few twists that are quite good, and they come as surprises... I don't think I really saw them coming, and I doubt anyone would be able to. Of course, some might not find the twists to be that impressive, but the story stands on it's own nicely as well. This is a great movie, which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it(it's more than just casually adult in nature, even though there's not that much violence or sex in it). I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir, watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailor-made for him, a good mystery, Roman Polanski's direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
watered down noire,"A film about LA and water set in the l930's during a drought with a dark incestuous subplot and some stunning performances by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson, and superb cinematography that seemed to capture the essence of LA.

Read Cadillac Desert to know about LA's water grab but see Chinatown for its brilliant allegory of water and corruption, both public and private.

An excellent piece of filmmaking.,"If it wasn't for the fact that most of the cast would have been too young or not born yet, this movie could have been made in the 1930's or 1940's. It reminds one of the film noirs that Hollywood used to make during that time period. It is a superb example of film making, certainly among the 20 best movies I have ever seen.Jack Nicholson is private detective Jake Gitties, who can be as hard-boiled as Humphrey Bogart's Phil Marlowe. But Gitties is different: He is intelligent, dresses well and has associates whom work with him. Gitties is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate into an extra-martial affair she believes her husband is having. However, the investigation leads into bigger things involving the water supply of Los Angeles, which is in the middle of a drought. A series of double-crosses, murders and plot twists all lead into a climatic showdown in Chinatown which has a surprising conclusion.If the saying `They don't make them like they used to' was ever more true, it was with this movie. Sex is only suggested between the Nicholson and Dunaway characters, yet it is convincing enough. And although Faye Dunaway is a beautiful woman, we never see frontal nudity of her (Directors today would do just the opposite). Some of the plot twists also would not be possibly made today, especially the ending (Which, if you haven't seen the movie, I cannot reveal).Nicholson is a tour de force in his role as Gitties, but the rest of the supporting cast (Including John Huston as Mulwray's deceptive father) is equally superb. As to how Nicholson could loose the Best Actor Oscar to Art Carney in Harry and Toto is beyond me. Faye Dunaway was also nominated for Best Actress, only to loose to Ellen Burstyn for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Fortunately, Nicholson and Duanway have both won Oscars since. In addition, the film itself received nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for Roman Polanski (Who has a cameo in the movie as the knife-welding thug who cuts Nicholson's nose), but those Oscars would be lost to The Godfather, Part II. The only Oscar won was for Robert Towne's screenplay, which is today considered the model for film writing. After watching the movie, one will know why. From the stellar performances to the sharp direction to the superb screenplay, this is a cinema treasure.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Let's talk about Dunaway,"By now it's only redundant to heap more praise on this film. The writing, acting, cinematography, direction, editing, etc. seamlessly come together as if predestined. And yes, I think Polanski's decision to go with a downbeat ending was the correct choice - that final scene is unforgettable.What I'd like to focus on is Faye Dunaway's remarkable contribution to the film. She reportedly did not get along with Polanski, in fact, was labeled ""difficult"" on several of her movies. Yet she turned in an incomparable, complex performance. Starting with her look. Hitchcock placed great emphasis on each character's outward appearance, which told us just about all we needed to know. Here Dunaway takes a page from his book and immerses herself in the trappings of a wealthy woman of the 1930s. Compare the way she looked in ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" also set in the 1930s. The eyes and hair are straight out of 1967.Keep in mind that she was 33 when she made 'Chinatown."" That's a knowing performance from someone so young. Her cool demeanor when we first meet her turns out to be misleading. She embodies the classic femme fatale until just toward the end, in her famous ""She's my sister. She's my daughter"" scene, when we suddenly understand she's the only character with an ounce of integrity. There's been quite a lot going on beneath the surface.Next time you watch this film, pay close attention to Dunaway. You won't find a better female performance anywhere.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An important film in the evolution of film noir,"Original noir films drew heavily from post-depression and post-war cynicism. The protagonists, often failures living on the outskirts of society, retreat into drinking heavily and feeling nostalgia for their past -- career success, lost loves, old friends, etc. -- and look to the future as something dark and threatening. They've already been beat down by the time the story begins, and the arc tends to reinforce that state.Jake (Jack Nicholson) is a completely different animal. He runs a successful business with a staff, he's a known name around town, and he's charming. Sure, he drinks and has complicated feelings about his police experience in Chinatown, much like a traditional noir protagonist, but that doesn't stop him from basically being a success.But over the course of the investigation, Jake's worldview changes. Observing John Huston's plots to abuse both his power in the system and his power over his daughter shows that the world around Jake is full of evil and corruption. No longer can he just function as a cog in part of that society -- his optimism makes him want to stop these abuses. However, he realizes that no matter how principled and skilled he is, he has no possibility of stopping the powerful from doing whatever it is that they want to do.Similar to public reactions to Vietnam and Watergate, Jake no longer has trust in the system of which he has been a part. By the end, Jake is broken down as his understanding of the world and his place in it has been fundamentally changed by his investigation. Jake ends the film in a similar place to where most noir protagonists begin -- he has been beaten down by the world and knows that the future stands little chance to improve.This is an important document in the evolution of the medium of film noir because it gives a realistic weight and reasoning to the pervasive feelings of melancholy that are its hallmarks. And this is an important thing for the evolution of film as a whole because of how pervasive the aesthetics and themes of noir are in American cinema.So at least from my perspective, it's easier to understand Chinatown's place in the film pantheon if you focus more on its thematic and generic aspects than its plot functions.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hardboiled crime, just the way I like it","CHINATOWN is a 1940s-era film noir updated to the 1970s, with added sex and violence to appease audiences. The ever-excellent Jack Nicholson adopts the role of J. J. Gittes, a man who finds himself investigating a conspiracy surrounding Los Angeles's water supply, no less.In the hands of auteur Roman Polanski, CHINATOWN is a great movie. Although it's slow moving for the most part, it's also ultra stylish and the director keeps your attention throughout. There are also nice performances from the whole cast, not least Faye Dunaway's alluring femme fatale and John Huston as the elderly patriarch.Despite its laidback appeal, CHINATOWN contains some shocking material, most of which seems quite tame these days but which must have packed a punch when it first came out; I'm thinking the final twist in particular. Nevertheless, bolstered by strong performances and good direction, this is a minor classic of its genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very impressive,"So I finally watched one of the most iconic films ever made. The mystery and suspense in Chinatown is fully-blown as a neo-noir film. It perfectly captures the time period in which it takes place, and its central story is very well-written. The performances are fantastic, the highlight being Faye Dunaway, whose only other performance I have seen is Network and she plays both characters with such precise distinction and force. The cinematography, art direction, and music give it the right mood as well, and the ending is quite brilliant, in fact, perfect. Overall, I don't know if I would say I loved it, but this is a film I can see revisiting in the future no doubt about it.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Polanski's brilliance strikes again,"Roman Polanski's Chinatown is definitely one of the best crime thrillers when it comes to both its fantastic structure and complex character study. It's his fascinating take on the corruption, greed and violence that lead people to become inhumane and brutal towards one another. It's like this real, and metaphorical 'Chinatown' in every bigger town in the USA – a place where everything happens on its own rules. Or even better, there aren't actually any rules, just the law of the jungle, one might say. Of course the rule applies as much to a single district, as to a whole city, or even country.J. J. Gittes has to cope with one of the hardest cases that he had ever encountered. Normally, it all comes down to a few pictures of a cheating spouse (that's his business all right) to end a chapter. But this time it's something much bigger and more dangerous. He embarks on a path, which heads toward the discovery of a scheme that concerns the whole city of Los Angeles and its huge water supply. What's more, in all this crazy, dizzying mess Gittes meets a very fascinating and troubled woman, with a difficult mystery attached to herself.After spending time with her Gittes is able to realize how pathological her family really is. And pathology is a right word in this context, as the amount of incest and other closely related themes is enormous.The uncontested brilliance that Polanski has shown in Chinatown is contained in its complicated storyline and great use of symbolism, connected to every thing water-y. Almost everywhere you can sense the impact put on various connotations regarding water, not only in dialogues but also in the aspect of sensual experiences. For example, tapping water in the sink plays great with the overwhelming silence in the scene, where J. J. discovers a dead body on the floor.I really admire Jack Nicholson for his marvelous work in every picture that he stars in, but his role in Chinatown is for me the definition of his career. The way he plays Gittes just makes you want more of his on-screen time (even though he is the main character). He sometimes shows a very serious side of his nature, but he can also come up with a fine amount of great jokes and insults. He is sacrificing his own life to terminate a case, which he wasn't even supposed to be involved in. Nicholson shows a bunch of acting skills that make his act very believable and entertaining. Faye Dunaway gives a decent performance as this classy, but very disturbed woman trying to help herself cope with the peculiar problems of her strange family. Note: Don't miss the very funny cameo by Polanski, who plays this scary, tiny man with a knife. Many laughs assured!Polanski also makes a great use of the plot device known as a MacGuffin. The murder, which occurs in the beginning of the film isn't actually the thing that drives the plot later on. Even though Gittes is trying to find the killer, the picture is more about an insight into the characters and their profiles to provide a definitive explanation of this gruesome story.All in all, I highly recommend Chinatown as one the best avant-garde crime movies ever directed and one of the finest, freshest takes on the pristine noir genre. Great directing, thrilling storyline and many detailed puzzles hidden in it account for a most memorable experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Cinematic Slug to the Gut,"Of the films this reviewer has seen (and that is quite a lot) this film is one of the select few to come as near to cinematic excellence as possible. From the first shot to the infamous final line, you belong to Polanski; in his hands for the whole ride - and those hands, I think it safe to say, are the hands of a master. The film features a phenomenal cast with Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes, the beautiful Faye Dunaway as femme fatale Evelyn Mulwray and the excellent director John Huston in an acting role as one of the most horrifying villains in the history of cinema: Noah Cross. Now this is one of those films where little of the plot can be revealed because it's all just far too complicated BUT it's also a film you aren't likely to ever forget. Ever. With beautiful cinematography, a heart- pounding story line, fantastic acting and one of the most atrociously heart-rending finales this reviewer has ever seen, this film is an absolute must. My rating 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great noir,"I've often said that if I had the use of a time machine that probably the first place I would go would be California in the 1970's, when filmmakers like Polanski, Altman, Spielberg and even George Lucas were in full swing in their crafts. The 1970's was possibly the last fantastic decade of cinema, where the films were adventurous and the directors were iconoclastic. One of the most revered and famous films from this great decade is Roman Polanski's 1974 crime thriller ""Chinatown"".Set in the 1930's, ""Chinatown"" stars Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes, a private detective who with two associates, seems to specialize mostly in adultery cases. When a woman comes into his offices and introduces herself as Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray, he initially turns down her request to tail her husband. He finally gives in, however, and begins to look into Mulwray's deal. It turns out that he is the chief engineer of the water department, and times are tough right now because of a drought. Jake is confused when he sees Mulwray looking at several parcels of land, but finally meets his objective when he is able to photograph Mulwray with another woman. When the story breaks that Mulwray (currently a controversial figure because he refuses to build an unsafe structure that the public at large thinks is a good idea) is stepping out on his wife, Jake gets a visit from Evelyn Mulwray threatening to sue. Except this Mrs. Mulwray (Dunaway) is completely different, and is the ""real Mrs. Mulwray"". When Mr. Mulwray turns up dead shortly thereafter, Jake finds himself in the middle of several mysteries, all which seem to point toward the direction of Evelyn and her father, one of the city's richest and most corrupt businessmen, Noah Cross. (John Huston) The greatest element of ""Chinatown"" is in my opinion, also something that could serve as a deterrent to some. I really liked the slow, drawn out plot. Polanski and Towne did not seem to have a problem taking their time with the pacing on the film, something that I personally found to be refreshing. Instead of rushing to the conclusion, or having fantastic fillers, it is clear how comfortable Polanski is with the material and his actors in that he takes as much time as needed to provide pertinent backgrounds and details. The decision to remove Nicholson's narration and simply have the audience discovering all of the clues along with him was brilliant. Though narration can be a very effective tool, unfortunately it is a device that was done to perfection in the 1940's (and some of the films of the 50's) and emulators don't always do the best job with it. Anyone who is looking for flash and rapid-fire cuts are not going to get that with this film. What one gets is a bright and colorful California setting, where some scenes look like Hockney paintings if they were set in the 1930's. It is hard to describe how lush the cinematography is, but if I had to put it into words, non-sensically I would compare it to butter; that everything looks velvety and soft. Only at night does the scenery turn sharp and slightly harsh.The acting in ""Chinatown"" was as good as I expected, and that is to say superior. Nicholson, one of the greatest actors of the past four decades, put together a low key, almost introspective performance as Gittes. Though he is indeed mischievous (how could he not be with those eyebrows and that grin, used to full effect in this film) Nicholson seems to temper his normally explosive style. Faye Dunaway, an incredibly talented actress, who, even if she hadn't played her in an infamous film, evokes the memory of Joan Crawford before she started doing her weird films in the 1950's & 1960's, was the perfect counterpart to Gittes. At times icy enough that you would expect her to spit cubes, and other times violently passionate, she shows some of her best work in this film and is achingly gorgeous to boot. The third main figure is probably the best because his performance was most surprising, and that was John Huston's. He not only directed one of the greatest early noir films (""The Maltese Falcon"") and is one of the greatest directors of the 20th century, but he really puts in a dark and gritty performance as Noah Cross; and he's REALLY convincing. I was absolutely delighted in the choice to cast him, because while there are admittedly a lot of actors who could have done this role, it was still really cool to see Huston do it.All of this is not to say that I adored ""Chinatown"". Frankly, I thought it was a good movie, but probably in the same way that people scratch their head at why ""Citizen Kane"" is often called the best film of all time, I kind of did the same in terms of why say, Entertainment Weekly would name it the #4 film of all time. However, even though I definitely liked it, despite not loving it, I can see its importance in film history and I can really appreciate the technical aspects that made up the film. That is why I have no problem rating it a 7/10.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Yes, this really is the best movie ever...","From the first 10 minutes of the first time I saw this movie in the theatre, I've truly loved it, more any other movie I've ever seen. Why? Well, that easy, it's just so... PERFECT!Obviously there are many other great movies, and many other movies I personally also love, but Chinatown has a real spell over me. Other fans have commented here on the story and the spellbinding way that the forlorn and utterly mysterious story unfolds. I certainly agree.Chinatown's cinematography and editing? Yes, I agree again! IMO, it's breathtaking, with pacing so tight that I sit straight up thru the whole movie and my nerves become completely raw every time I watch, listen and FEEL it again.I don't think anybody has commented yet on the great choice of the many supporting actors. Each one so well cast and very believable in their roles! You've got the entire cast credits list (thank you IMDb) so I won't list them here but there are so many memorable performances here! It would be unfair to highlight one, two or three! Good cops, bad cops, ugly rich, up-and-coming, downtrodden poor, the very honest and very crooked with all shades in between! Each and every role a character study in and of itself and together they make a living ""time capsule"" of the forties that we can revisit for generations to come.And then there's that sound track which hooked me on great trumpet players and the Est Coast Jazz sound of the era. I just love that music and way it interweaves with the ongoing theme - it's perfectly united with the faithful and compelling use of the film-noir style.I saw this movie first in Chicago and heck, back then I knew nothing about LA, though I've since moved to and lived in the area for years. Once relocated, I quickly discovered the historically interesting side to the story and then appreciated the movie from yet another compelling angle. No question, the plot is fundamentally sound with many totally unexpected and yet quite plausible turns. But I later understood that it's within the realm of believability from factual standpoint, as well as intellectually/emotionally.Geez, I'll never forget that first confrontational scene at the Albacore Club! The study in absolute raw and evil power as masterly portrayed by John Huston. In the very same scene Jack Nicholson skillfully paints the subtleties of his cautious, cynical, small-time hustler character. The air crackles! I must have played this scene in my mind a thousand times. When I visited Catalina Island for the first time in about 1985, not knowing its significance to the movie, I walked by the Albacore Club (The Tuna Club in real life) and froze transfixed. I recognized it instantly of course, and I must have stood there gawking for 20 minutes not saying a word. I could literally HEAR the Chinatown theme - the memories were that clear and fresh!In closing, I guess then what does it about Chinatown for me (why I feel so strongly that it is the very best movie of all) is that every facet of the movie construction, from the opening scene to the ending credits, somehow fits together in a homogeneous, complete and absolutely flawless way.I find it fascinating to analyze the characters and their makeup. To imagine the reasons they did what they did. But there is NOTHING I would change. Nothing.",,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Polanski's best...,"No scratch that. Chinatown is actually my personal favourite of Roman Polanski's movies. It is a wonderful movie, as well as an affectionate and inspired homage to film noir, with a lot to love about it.Roman Polanski's direction is superb. He always directs with such precision in this movie and it shows loud and clear.The production values are terrific. Chinatown does look ravishing, the costumes, detail, scenery and cinematography are all exemplary.I am a big Jerry Goldsmith fan, since seeing The Wind and the Lion and hearing his amazing score for that. His music score up here is up there with his best, it doesn't feel hackneyed or generic in any way, it really shows a master at work.The script is brilliantly organised. In fact along with Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve I think Chinatown has one of the best screenplays ever written.The story is never less than compelling. It is a wonderful story thet has just the right amount of intensity without being too convoluted and paced really well.The acting I also can't fault. Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances and he is terrifically supported by a ravishingly beautiful Faye Dunnaway and a truly terrific John Huston.Overall, a wonderful movie and one of the best of the 70s. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Bit Confusing But Always Fascinating,"No sense going into a detailed review describing what this film is about because there are enough reviews already. I'll just say it took me several viewings to finally figure out what was going on. It's not an easy to story to follow. It's also unusual: a crime story dealing with rights to water. To many people, that's odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California.There is nothing confusing about how this film looks. It's a treat for one's eyes, especially if you love that 1940s look, which I do. This movie just drips with Los Angeles film noir atmosphere: a rich-looking piece of cinema with great period detail.What stands out in most people's memory of this film is another odd thing: a man's nose getting sliced. Here, it's Jack Nicholson getting a ""nose job"" courtesy of some thugs. Jack, playing ""Jake Gittes,"" will forever be known (among wild roles) as the guy with a bandage on his nose, thanks to this movie. As interesting as he is, along with Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast, I always get a kick out of seeing John Huston in here. I love the way he sounds and acts, and I'm sorry he had such a short role.Overall, an always-fascinating film no matter how many times you watch it or how well you understand it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Water, Corruption and Murders","In 1937, in Los Angeles, the private investigator J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired by a woman called Evelyn Mulwray to follow her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling) to know if he is having an affair. Hollis is the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Chief Engineer, who is refusing to create a new water reservoir that he considers unsafe. Soon Gittes sees Hollis with a girl and photographs them. Then he follows Hollis, and he sees water being released from the reservoir during the night. On the next morning, his photos of Hollis are published on a newspaper but when he returns to his office, he meets the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) with her lawyer to sue him. Gittes realizes that he was deceived by someone that wanted to harm Hollis Mulwray, but soon he finds that the chief engineer was drowned in the reservoir. His further investigation shows that the water supply is disrupted to the local farmers and someone is buying the cheap lands to profit in the near future.""Chinatown"" is a neo-noir directed by Roman Polanski with a complex story of corruption and murder based on the California Water Wars that happened in the beginning of the 20th Century. The film has excellent screenplay and magnificent performances of Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway and is almost unanimously acclaimed by the critics.

a classic that improves with every viewing,"Roman Polanski's wide screen, Depression era detective story is more than just another anachronistic homage to the film noir gumshoes and femme fatales of yesteryear. The serpentine labyrinth of corruption uncovered by tough but intelligent private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) involves nothing less than the consolidation of greater Los Angeles itself, where the most tainted currency of thieves isn't money, but water. This is one of those rare productions where every element seems to fall into place, from Robert Towne's exciting, original screenplay to a definitive performance by Nicholson to John Huston's unlikely but effective portrayal of what must be one of the most depraved villains in screen memory, a man who, by his own chilling admission, ""is capable of anything."" Music, art direction, editing and photography are all first class, but the true test of any classic is longevity, and in this regard the film passes with flying colors by actually improving with each viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"I hate Roman Polanski, but his movie is solid","I have a hard time separating the art from the artist when it comes to Roman Polanski. On the one hand, he raped an underage girl and then fled the country, only to be showered with praise for his filmmaking and win awards, despite being a wanted criminal. On the other hand, he's a rapist criminal on the run.Chinatown was the last picture he completed before fleeing the US for Paris, and has since been held up as one of the great gumshoe detective stories in American cinema, but does it maintain that appeal?First and foremost, I think that credit should be given where it's due- Robert Towne (screenwriter of Bonnie and Clyde ('67), and the first two Mission Impossible films) was the academy award recipient for the screenplay for Chinatown. He wrote the screenplay after turning down an offer to write a script for The Great Gatsby, which would ultimately be handed to Francis Coppola, starring Mia Farrow and Robert Redford- a well remembered film, but perhaps not as revered as its same-year-premiering neighbor, Chinatown. Point being, less credit to Polanski's direction than to Towne's screenwriting.Jack Nicholson (somehow almost 40 when this movie was made, he's old) stars as hard-nosed Private Investigator Jake Gittes, opposite the lovely Faye Dunaway as the wealthy, newly widowed Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. Both give excellent performances in the film, particularly Dunaway as an emotionally precarious, manipulative woman with an agenda. The film is largely seen through Nicholson's private eyes and is revealed to the audience through his incessant questioning of any and everyone. It's not exactly clear why he's so interested in the case of the murdered man, but I guess we can infer that the film leans on its noir origins and he takes the case to completion because of the beautiful woman. The plot is mostly forgettable and largely irrelevant except for the relationship that forms between these two characters, but the ending is certainly one that few would expect, and probably why this movie is regarded as well as it is- even spawning a Godfather III-esque sequel 16 years later (the same month, in 1990!). The largest plot beats are mostly a path well trod by films many years prior to Chinatown's release, but I will note that much of the intrigue and complexity of the story that is introduced early and hints at a larger political conspiracy is never really seen through, and is instead passed up for a very heat-of-passion type scene.A decent movie, but definitely pretty far down my list of neo-noir films. Watch LA Confidential instead. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Classic neo-noir,"One of the penultimate film-noir films and one of the best Jack Nicholson movies as well. Chinatown is a slowly unraveling mystery story at its best, each scene slowly building the suspense, offering hints to the final solution, yet that final twist is there to left us gaping in horror and awe.The movie's greatest strengths are its iron tight script and its cast. The story takes place in the early 20th century LA, during a time of great drought. J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Nicholson), a private detective of some skill, is hired to spy on one of the players in the so called Water Wars. Not everything goes as planned and Gites finds himself pulled deeper into the mystery, mostly against his will, as it often happens. Along the way he encounters murder, corruption, old feuds, high class women, rich tycoons and misleading answers. It's considered one of the classic film-noir movies for a reason, yet it updates the formula somewhat in good neo-noir fashion by deviating from the old character stereotypes - a welcome change.Jack Nicholson is also on a roll in this movie. He has been born to play characters such as these and Gites might very well be one of his best. He's everything. Arrogant, sly, quite the ladies man, intelligent, witty, too large for the world and all around bad ass. The rest of the cast are up to the task, with special mention going to old Hollywood legend John Huston, playing one of the water tycoons.Chinatown is a must see for all ones of detective and mystery stories. It's an all around well-acted, -produced, -directed and -executed film. One of the classics.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"To tell you the truth, I lied a little.","Film Noir is my favorite genre and I'm ashamed to admit that until now I have never seen Chinatown. The fact that it's not technically a Film-Noir and more accurately defined a Neo-Noir is irrelevant because had this exact film been released in 1954 instead of 1974 nobody would have argued its classifications.I really enjoyed Chinatown. Jack Nicholson did an excellent job playing Jake Gittes and got me vested in a story that could have bored me to tears if not executed just right. Too many melodramas rely so much on their characters being over the top that they neglect to give them depth and make them interesting and make the audience care about the same things they care about. This is where Chinatown really succeeds. The dialog was overdone and outside of the remembered film closure, unforgettable, however the characters throughout make this film legendary.Visually, Chinatown looks amazing. It doesn't physically look like your prototypical noir film because there are so many bright scenes, but the mood is there even when the contrast is not. The lighting does not prevent this film from feeling dark throughout.Upon the film's conclusion, my first thought was that I needed to watch it again. I know I missed subtleties and that my first viewing was only a primer to prepare myself for the second go around. It's easy to see why Chinatown is always on best films of all-time lists.

"Interesting neo-noir with a great lead performance, but perhaps too much of a slow burner","Chinatown is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time, arguably the best neo-noir. For me, being a twenty something filmgoer born roughly forty years after this movies release, I'm afraid a lot of the praise is lost on me. I don't require my movies to have egregious amounts of action setpieces, but I do appreciate it when things actually happen in scenes, beyond character A going to a place and talking to character B.Chinatown is incredibly slow-paced and dialogue-heavy, perhaps by the largest margin I have ever seen in a film before. Jack Nicholson gives a fantastic and effortlessly charming lead performance, and I do like the concept of him slowly unfolding a labyrinthian mystery much larger than he will ever be. Music is great, and the entire film is far less stylish than I thought it would be - very grounded and real (the scene where Jake has his nose slashed was brutally realistic). I also love the setting, but the titular location only appears at the VERY end for about 5 minutes! Rather disappointing. The ultimate twist also doesn't do much for me.Hopefully I'll be able to see what so many others see in this film upon subsequent reviewing, but as of right now, and I may be committing heresy saying this, but this film was just kind of boring for me. I went in expecting a stylish, surreal, escapist crime thriller, and what I got was a very blunt, grounded mystery film. Not a bad movie by any means, just not really what I was looking for.Chinatown is definitely one of those films which isn't a surface level watch, and film analysts have probably had a field day with this, so this isn't really my kind of film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Dark, gripping, and enthralling","It's very odd, but I get the impression that Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"" (1974) is one of the best private-eye dramas ever made, and I've only seen a few in my life. That's the kind of imprint this film leaves.Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are perfect in their roles as a cynical private detective and a mysterious and beautiful femme fatale, respectively (of course). I thought the lighting was suiting, the camera-work was appropriate, but not over the top. The score wasn't unusual, so it wasn't all that important, but who cares? It's a dramatic film, and a predictable dramatic score is fitting. The actual music involved is jazzy and well-placed. The plot is gripping and riveting; so seeing this film is definitely an interesting way to spend an evening.Overall, an enthralling film that couldn't possible bore anyone, and a fun dramatic movie to watch if you like that sort of plot.

John Huston's performance is a guilty pleasure, and Perry Lopez is rather underrated but appreciated in this film.

But one film in particular stood out from all the rest and it shows why that was one of AFI's 100 top films of all time.The year was 1974. The motion picture is ""Chinatown"". This was the movie that cemented Jack Nicholson as a bonafide superstar throughout the entire decade of the 1970's. This was the movie that started it all.Jack Nicholson graduated from star to superstar playing a gumshoe in this marvelously intricate film noir of the 70's directed by Roman Polanski,who has a memorable cameo as a sadistic hood,gives Nicholson the most famous nose job in motion picture history. Robert Towne's Oscar winning script(whom they used in some acting and writing classes as a learning tool in some colleges)brilliantly depicts 1940's Los Angeles as a glittering cesspool of murder,incest,and corrupt land deals. Faye Dunaway steals the picture with a haunting performance as the film's alluring female fatale,and John Huston,as her creepy millionaire father,will make your skin crawl. The stunning finale still packs an emotional wallop. ""Chinatown"" was the apex of what the cinema of the 1970's was about to become,and this was the prime factor of that as well.The film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture and won three for Best Original Score(Jerry Goldsmith),Best Screenplay(Robert Towne),and Best Supporting Actor(John Huston).",,Anonymous,Mystery
Film Noir wishes it was like Chinatown,"Every now and then there are some truly perfect films that shine with every scene, every action, line, camera shot... Chinatown is one of them. Wonderfully directed by Roman Polanski showing us the brightly lit but disturbing look at late 30's Los Angeles.One of the greatest performances of all time goes to Jack Nicholson as private investigator Jake Gittes. Think of him as a more laid back Philip Marlowe from the Raymond Chandler books. Nicholson appears in every scene of the film and oozes with intensity and suaveness. Words cannot describe how amazing he is in the film. But it isn't just a Jack Nicholson vehicle. Noteworthy supporting performances include the wonderful Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray; an incredible femme fatale and film noir innovator John Huston as Noah Cross who is one right evil bastard and also Perry Lopez as Lieutenant Escobar is terrific.One can't just say the performances made Chinatown legendary without mentioning the outstanding cinematography and view of Los Angeles. Never have I seen such a hauntingly beautiful look at L.A. Some films have done it (Lynch's Mulholland Drive, Wilder's Sunset Blvd...) but Chinatown's look and feel really delves you into 1937 and doesn't stop for over two hours.It's a hard-boiled, dark detective story featuring Oscar-worthy performances, splendid direction and an ending 40's and 50's film noirs wouldn't dream off.

Chinatown dares to take its time to establish its story and while it may test the patience of some, those engrossed by the films atmospheric ambiguity and mystery it is definitely worth the wait. A dark, brooding detective story, entwined in a wicked conspiracy. It has all the traits of film noir, but ignores many of the clichés.Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"" is masterfully crafted and directed from beginning to end.

Romans Noir Is High Class,"This is yet another example of 1970s movie making in America. Another great movie from the greatest movie making decade..in U.S.A. history. Roman Polanski directs brilliantly, and Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston are simply superb in there roles. This was the era when special effects was lighting a cigarette. So tragic that now we have sunk to middle--earth, and we actually watch C.G.I. garbage. (I don't ). This is one of those films where everything fits. The music by Jerry Goldsmith is lush and with great depth. What is it that separates ""great directors"" from the others? I think it is a single minded-ness. They can see the finished product in there minds...and simply work towards it. That was the view of Hitchcock, and i am sure he is talking for most great directors. Anyway, here is a high class film noir to enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""You can't eat the Venetian blinds. I just had them installed on Wednesday.""","Roman Polanski's decision to take on the film noir genre after it had given birth to so many timeless classics was a bold choice. He was diving in to a deep sea of talent and ingenuity decades after the grandmasters of film had sold their souls to Satan for the black magic necessary to take the limited and restrictive technology available at the time and make the delicious oreo visuals that made great films even greater despite something like technicolor visuals still being the fever dream of a schizophrenic whisper. But despite the Vesuvian challenge lain out before them, the people responsible for Chinatown managed to make a film so great that there's no doubt in my mind it could go toe to toe with any of the classics and end up absolutely busting its sorry face. I'm talking a good old fashioned jaw- ripping, tooth necklace making face busting. That is to say if Chinatown were faced with a ""Two films enter, one film leaves"" type situation, my money's on Chinatown.First of all, you cannot deny that Chinatown's screenplay is absolutely immaculate. It's a known fact that when da Vinci painted The Last Supper, he had looked into the future and found his inspiration in Chinatown. By the time I reached the credits I couldn't even handle how totally and completely impressed I was by how excellent the story had been. The events were so cinematic, yet it never stopped being believable for a single solitary moment. This was a story that spent the film's entire 130 minute runtime twisting and gnarling into an incredible mystery. It was like a political thriller mixed with a horror movie. J.J. Gitties was sent through a labyrinth of despair. The man was so broken and beaten when the credits started rolling, if he was a real person I wouldn't be surprised at all to hear he had collaspsed and died from the mental exhaustion. This brings me to the ending. I wouldn't even hesitate to say this film has the best ending in the history of film. It's so satisfyingly tragic I felt like all my emotions had been emulsified into a gray caustic sludge and tossed into the ocean. The look on Jack Nicholson's face when Walsh tells him ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown."" is going to be burned into my mind forever. I thought his performance in Cuckoo's Nest was amazing, but he was just perfect in this role. This movie is the juice. The juicy juice.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Delightful,"J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective, gets fooled into outing the alleged affair of Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the head of the L.A. water department. Gittes, wanting to know why he was tricked so, decides to look further into the set up. This brings him into contact with Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) and what a quagmire she was. The more Gittes sleuths the more he finds and the plot only got more and more layered.I liked this mystery drama. There was quality acting and a quality story. With mysteries you want drama, intrigue, and cohesion. This had all of that plus a bombshell or two.

A marvellous film with lots of marvellous things,"Rating-9/10Chinatown is a classic movie that is still talked of today as one of the very best. To be fair there is no doubting that this is superbly acted and the same goes for the writing and directing which all together makes this a fine film in cinema history. It also stays a mystery and never gives up the ending easily and leaves you not only guessing but also thinking about all the intricate details going on.Now Chinatown doesn't have the most exciting story, or maybe the premise doesn't seem exciting but the movie itself is good when it comes to the depth involved. The story is so well researched and so well put together, you don't need big thrills and gunshots everywhere to be made to enjoy this piece. I think one big thing about the plot is it's level of detail as mentioned as it is just overly detailed and really makes the plot thicker if anything.Jack Nicholson portrays J.J. Gittes with a certain ease In his demeanour and a kind of worked out character that seems planned and as if Nicholson put a lot of work in before taking the role. Cast such as Faye Dunaway do a top job too here and she seems calm and yet her character is very complex and hard to figure out what's going on with her, the certain chemistry if you will between Nicholson and Dunaway could be analysed over and over and you can really see Gittes does not understand her fully.Robert Towne the writer creates a script that is considered among the very best in cinema, and I mean worldwide. It is calm and calculated and Towne makes a screenplay something more than well, a screenplay, he creates drama and intrigue in all the right places. The script is slow but somehow Towne makes it exciting in a way and lets you watch with an air of what's next around the corner, just a top job from a top writer.The neo-noir style is in abundance, but it is safe in it's pickings of where to put it, it isn't overused in any case and when the biggest examples of neo-noir are seen, they work very well. I felt the score that is in line with the neo-noir style is a fine one and the late Jerry Goldsmith does a magnificent job in making quite bland and ordinary scenes seem yet again, exciting and also gives a lovely air of mystery even in the music.You know many films we see the cinematography over looked and not really thought of as one of the highlights, but here it very much is the case and a big one. John Alonzo was nominated for an Oscar for his work but the fact that when people mention this they only go for the directing, writing and acting is an insult to the beautiful craft Alonzo creates. The shots are just so well timed and the close ups and very few cuts make this ahead of it's time in camera work for movies.Overall I felt it to be firmly a brilliant movie and one that should stay with the viewer no matter what they felt about it. I do feel this is overrated and without shooting me here me out, I can see why people love this and it definitely isn't a mystery why, it is just I didn't find this exciting enough to be flawless, but is still a wonderful and glorious movie that even with just what I say, is still near the very top.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An enigma,"One of those classics that earned their reputation at a time when character development was an excuse for lacking in everything else, including a title that actually makes sense. As I am catching up with quite a few of these old movies I never managed to watch at their time I see a pattern emerging. With Chinatown it's clear within 20 minutes that this is not going to pick up pace and actually care about storytelling. Instead you're supposed to be drawn into the characters. The rest is an incredulous string of events that could go on forever or end right here without making any difference.I very much appreciate film noir as a genre but this is not film noir. I am aware that I'm in the minority here but the boredom that this movie creates deserves no more than two stars. Good acting though but as said, you should develop characters for a purpose. Enough said.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overrated Mystery,"I had heard so much about this movie from word of mouth that it was one of the best films ever created and possibly the best film noir ever. I had extremely high expectations for this movie, and when it was over I considered it a piece of trash.The story is about city curruption and making money by taking over the water for the growing city of Los Angeles in 1930. It doesn't even sound interesting. Jack Nicholson is great as his role and it's fun to watch him in any movie, but that didn't make up for the screenplay. The biggest shocker in the movie was that Faye Dunaway's daughter was her sister as well, and her father, the man who was racketeering the water was the father. I could absoluetely care less, the child could have been anyone's and still had a zero effect. Nicholson is repedeatly chased by his old partner who secretly wants to arrest him because he thinks he murdered Faye Dunaway's wife, who was a city worker in charge of water, although Nicholson had absoluetely no motive, because he didn't know Dunaway before he took the case. The ending is horrible as well, it doesn't really matter.If you want to see a good movie made in 1974 see Godfather Part II, it made Chinatown look like a pile of sh*t. Very overrated movie, doesn't deserve to be anywhere near it's place (#19) on AFI's top films of all time.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Pure Cinema,"Chinatown is a masterpiece...plain and simple. It is a one of a kind film that is without flaw. I'm sure some would argue with me, but in my honest opinion it is a perfect work of art. The direction by master-class helmsman Roman Polanski is incredible, creating demanding images and performances by those involved. Jack Nicholson as the against-type private detective Jake J. Gittes depicts a hero that none have seen before or after. Faye Dunaway is in an unrivaled performance as Evelyn Mulwray, a mysterious beauty who hides a lot more than she can handle. Really, though, John Huston manages to become a scene-stealer as the vile aristocrat Noah Cross, who creates a villain so memorable, it puts so many to shame. The story by Robert Towne is crafted with great precision and pacing, using the water scandal of Los Angeles in the 1910's and 20's as a backdrop to the main story. Gittes is approached by a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray (Diane Ladd) and asks him to investigate her husband, Hollis Mulwray, the city's chief engineer of the water department. After a bit of small sleuthing and following Mulwray, he catches him with a blonde and the photographs he's taken become a treasure for the press. In steps the real Evelyn Mulwray (Dunaway), who threatens to sue Gittes for his investigation into her husband, which she didn't warrant. Unfortunately several days later, Hollis is found dead in the reservoir and thus begins the investigation as to who framed him and killed Hollis Mulwray. Usually in the hands of any other director or writer, this could've turned into a run-of-the-mill whodunit, but Towne's scripts adds so many unexpected twists and turns throughout the story, leading the audience to unexpected places. Evelyn's shocking revelation is just one of the great surprises that bombards the viewer. The thing that really brings the film together, though, is the ending. Towne had something much more upbeat in mind, but Polanski, who had gone through a great trauma 5 years before the film's production, decided a more human ending was necessary, which makes the film so much greater. ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown,"" will ring in the viewers ears even after the credits have rolled. Ah, I almost forgot to mention Jerry Goldsmith's score, which brings the film a great atmosphere, much akin to that of The Maltese Falcon, another great crime-noir (which was directed by John Huston.). In concluding I say that Chinatown is pure cinema. And I mean PURE CINEMA. You just can't get any better with Chinatown.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Past and Future Tense,"***User reviewer Sergio_Falco (""What to say?"", Sergio_Falco from Australia, May 2012) has an interesting commentary that mentions the layers of evil. Mr Ghostface (""A wonderful, classic film"", Mr Ghostface from London, England, 8 October 1999) has good background info.***Chinatown (1974, Roman Polanski), a homage to Film noir, is one of the world's great film treasures. Many reviewers describe it as one of the elite film noirs. (I would disqualify it for not belonging to the genre well enough.) ""Chinatown"" is often used as curriculum in film schools. This is high art, and is particularly great fun to view it on the big screen when the opportunity exists.Robert Towne is credited with the original screenplay. Although it was inspired by the water wars that occurred in LA in the early twentieth century, it is set decades later (1937). The director, Roman Polanski, changed Towne's desired ending. The plot meanders and has holes, but there isn't a dull scene. The entire cast functions very well. Polanski makes a director's cameo that rivals any other. The supporting characters fit in effortlessly. (My favorite is John Hillerman as Yelburton.)The principal three characters are all at a high level. I am fond of Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulray; same with John Houston as Noah Cross. However, Jack Nicholson is masterful as J. J. Gittes. Towne wrote the screenplay for Nicholson, and Gittes appears in every scene. Nicholson's Gittes is a smart, acerbic, dogged private investigator who breaks rules without hesitation while making his share of blunders. He is also a magnet (i.e., almost always the center of attention).The acid-tongued Gittes is haunted by an event that is never revealed to the audience. It occurred when he was a beat cop in Chinatown. While Gittes is irked with civil servants generally (e.g., the man at the Hall of Records), he has obvious contempt for his former police colleagues. There seems to be a connection between the intensity of Gittes's loathing of each cop with that character's contribution to the conclusion. So, there's no need for us to know what happened in Chinatown previously because it is the same destination as the future.Personally, I can't respect Towne's decision to have Gittes slapping Evelyn around before she reveals her secret. I don't think it is very challenging for a filmmaker to show a stronger man beating up a woman. On an unrelated note, it is also kind of hilarious to imagine people nonchalantly smoking everywhere in 1937, including government offices.(BTW, ""Chinatown"" repeats the phrase, ""as little as possible."" This is in response to the question, ""what did you do there?"" This line can be explained by making what today is likely construed as a racist statement: A white policeman working Chinatown will find the locals so inscrutable it is impossible to know whether law enforcement is causing or preventing a crime. So, the beat cops do the least amount of policing that is required of them.)Above all else, ""Chinatown"" is dazzling because of Polanski's vision. He uses the entire frame, and is conveying point of view. (My favorite image is probably the final one of Yelburton; Gittes suggests he is due for a great future and it appears the reverse is in store.) Polanski is expert level at varying the size and position of Gittes, while employing a very precise focal length. (It is worth noticing when the background is blurry.)Polanski also employs a visual leitmotif. He frequently shoots Gittes from the back while Gittes is spying on someone else. The frequency of watching Gittes from behind, with Gittes seemingly making no effort to be discrete, makes the audience feel like a voyeur. Considering the film's pivotal surprise, the voyeur feeling takes us closer to experiencing the sordid details.""Chinatown"" is too good to miss. Cinephiles are encouraged to head over to the nearest revival theater to see it again, steering clear of whatever diminutive, maniacal, switchblade-bearing directors that are encountered.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Riveting and gorgeous classic film with evocative settings , wonderful cinematography and rousing  soundtrack","Fascinating mystery thriller in the Dashiell Hammet-Raymond Chandler style about an eye private who becomes involved into a complex criminal intrigue centering municipal corruption, and uncovering corruption , land sell , incest and murder . 1930 , City of Los Angeles , a private detective named Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is contracted by a woman (Diane Lane , Laura Dern's mother) claiming to be a Mrs. Mulwray to spy on her husband . As Jake investigating an adultery case stumbles on to a scheme of murder that has something to do with water . Shortly after Gittes (Jake Gittes was named after Jack Nicholson's friend, producer Harry Gittes) goes to the Town Hall where he learns about ¨The Van der Lip Dam disaster¨ is a reference to the collapse of the St Francis Dam in 1928, 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, which had been designed by self-educated engineer William Mulholland , the consequent flooding killed at least 450 people, a loss of life that remains second only to that from the San Francisco earthquake and fire in California's history . Later on , he is hired by the real Mrs. Mulwray (Femme Fatale Faye Dunaway, after Ali MacGraw was discarded as she lost the role when she divorced him for Steve McQueen, producer Robert Evans wanted Jane Fonda for the part of Evelyn Mulwray while Roman Polanski insisted upon Julie Christie ,when Christie passed on the script , then was to Faye) who appears in his office threatening to sue if he doesn't drop the issue immediately. Gittes goes on his mission anyway, slowly uncovering a vast conspiracy centering on water management, corruption , real estate, and involving at least one killing . After that , there appears a hood (Polanski who knifes Nicholson) who slits Jake's nose (it was extremely complex to shot by using a specially-constructed knife with a short hinge that they began to claim Nicholson's nose was actually cut).It is a splendid film in noir tradition and considered to be one of the best film about this genre . This exciting movie packs mystery, tension, nail-biting scenes, strikingly suspense and colorful images . Interesting and thrilling script by Robert Towne who wrote the screenplay with Jack Nicholson in mind and deservedly won Oscar for the best original screenplay . The Chinatown screenplay is now regarded as being one of the most perfect screenplays and is now a main teaching point in screen writing seminars and classes everywhere. This was the first film of a planned trilogy about corruption in the development of Los Angeles. It was set in the 1930s and was about the water department and in the original script, no scenes took place in Chinatown at all. . The second film, The Two Jakes, was directed by Jack Nicholson in 1990 and was set in the 1940s and was about the gas company. The third film of the trilogy was about the building of the massive freeway system and was to be called ""Cloverleaf"", named after the famous interchange in downtown L.A., but it was never filmed. Awesome acting by Jack Nicholson ,because this film was the first of a planned trilogy, Jack Nicholson turned down all detective roles he was offered so that the only detective he played would be Jake Gittes. At the time of filming, Jack Nicholson had just embarked on his longstanding relationship with Anjelica Huston , this made his scenes with her father, John Huston, rather uncomfortable. Secondary cast is frankly magnificent such as Burt Young , John Huston , Diane Lane , Perry Lopez , James Hong , Bruce Glover , among others . Roman Polanski wanted William A. Fraker as his cinematographer, having successfully collaborated with him on Rosemary's Baby, but this notion was blocked by producer Robert Evans .Cinematographer Stanley Cortez was fired soon after production began because his classical style did not match the naturalistic style Polanski wanted for the film and proved too time consuming , Polanski had to find a replacement in only a few days and chose John A. Alonzo. Emotive as well as sensitive musical score by Jerry Goldsmith , including unforgettable leitmotif ; though Phillip Lambro was originally hired to write the film's music score but it was rejected at the last minute by producer Robert Evans, leaving Jerry Goldsmith only ten days to write and record the new score. The motion picture was stunningly directed by Polanski (Repulsion , Rosemary's baby , The pianist , Bitter moon, Frantic, Dance of vampires) . This is the last movie Roman Polanski filmed in the US and resulted to be the 15th biggest grossing film of 1974. And 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #21 Greatest Movie of All Time. And ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Mystery"" in June 2008 .",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Jake Gittes, Right Up There With Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe","In Chinatown, Jack Nicholson gets one of his best roles, definitely in the top five as Jake Gittes, a throwback private eye to the forties of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. Had Chinatown been made in the Forties Humphrey Bogart who played definitive versions of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe would definitely have been cast in the role of Jake Gittes. Nicholson however is one worthy successor to Bogey.Very little action takes place in Chinatown in Los Angeles and only some peripheral characters are oriental. What Chinatown is here is a metaphor for a place you don't want to go and a culture and way of life you cannot penetrate or understand. Back when Gittes was a cop he was stationed in Chinatown and always felt alien there. He couldn't do his job because he didn't understand the people.Gittes goes back to Chinatown so to speak when he's hired by Diane Ladd to shadow her husband. It's the kind of peep job Nicholson is used to and he does. Later the husband turns up dead and it turns out Ladd was posing as the wife. The real wife Faye Dunaway shows up and threatens to sue him.Nicholson keeps on digging and he comes up with a juicy political scandal involving a scheme to defraud essentially the whole city of Los Angeles with their water supply. But he comes up with far more than that involving Faye Dunaway's personal life.The lead villain here is John Huston in probably his greatest role before the camera with only The Cardinal as a rival. Huston is Dunaway's father, a rich gazillionaire who can just about buy everything and everybody and usually does. But as it turns out he's far more malevolent than that, a truly terrifying evil soul.Faye Dunaway does a great job playing a woman carrying one huge burden on her soul. Look for good performances by Perry Lopez as the dogged police lieutenant trying to keep everyone happy and Diane Ladd as the hapless fake Dunaway.Chinatown is one timeless film and will be getting raves centuries from now.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Best Polanski? Yes, you bet!","Polanski's cynical noir-ish tale, CHINATOWN forces himself to retread the sad place of Los Angeles, where her pregnant wife Sharon Tate (along with several other friends) was brutally murdered in 1969. Ever so unfalteringly, he sticks to his guns, renders the whodunit mystery with an unadulterated tragic ending, as an acerbic retort to a patriarch society inundated with dyed-in- the-wool corruption both morally and economically, in memory of those innocently victimised.J.J. Gittes (Nicholson), a copper-turned-private-eye, is swindled to investigate the hanky-panky of Hollis Mulwray (Zwerling), the chief engineer of L.A. Department of Water and Power, will soon discover something much bigger and sinister than that, after Hollis' sudden death and the involvement of Hollis' wife Evelyn (Dunaway), Gittes is intrigued to unearth the truth, which also implicates Evelyn's father Noah Cross (Huston), a magnate once was the business partner of Hollis. But, sometimes, human vice is so unspeakable and rotten-to-the-core, having almost lost his nose, Gittes would finally realise that he is still wet behind the ears in his profession, his heroic act seems astute and intrepid, but in the end of the day, it can not tip the scale, like his unspecified past in Chinatown, where he was an officer of the law, he again miserably fails to save the good and innocent from the hands of death and evil. The soul-shattering upshot is a rarely seen defiance in the mainstream cinema where a director holds sway of the final say, and its aftershock hangs around, that's why CHINATOWN is so unique and groundbreaking.Uniformly, the film is hailed as one of the finest productions out of Hollywood, Robert Towne's Oscar-winning script delineates a conspiracy theory based on the true story which grants the story a tangible relevance, but also dives into a more personal matter of shocking taboo, to establish cinema is really a voyeuristic projector of all the dirty corners in our universe, A minor bellyaching is that, Gittes' function in the plot feels somewhat contrived, if Noah is so intent on locating what he is looking for, why on earth he would leave Evelyn out of his sight? Which is only for the benefit of storytelling that Gittes can always precede everyone else, he remains the sole source to tell audience what is the truth, that's something may or may not bother you.There are plenty of memorable shots with distinctive flair, whether it is shot from a telescope lens, or a rearview mirror, the camera extends as a furtive, ambiguous onlooker with no further engagement, brooding and spying. Jerry Goldsmith's iconic score (made only in 10 days) lures viewers into that vintage era and then entraps them in the melancholy, suspense and thrill.Nicholson's Gittes, who appears so competent and sharp-witted most of the time, conceals the star's smug persona and conveys a engaging commitment of the happening as the plot thickens, one of my personal favourite performance from him, simply because one literally sympathises for his vulnerability and powerlessness when he is held to face the bleak music; Dunaway, whose inscrutable mien reveals a little bit of something, each time her Evelyn comes under the spotlight, is she a femme fatale? a partner-in-crime? an insider? or just a victim? She keeps her secrecy until the big moment, the astonishing no-sham-slapping spectacles, what can one say? It just blows you away, both the revelation and the two-hander.John Huston, perhaps in his most well-known role in front of a camera, leaves an indelible impression as a seemingly harmless wealthy old man, but actually is a metaphor of what is sickly wrong in our modern society, self-seeking, double-faced, incestuous, callous, unrepentant, with an unhealthy attachment of his own bloodline, a high-profile addition along with the two excellent leads.In all frankness, normally, the blunt exploitation of woman as an easy prey is a big turn-down for my taste, but in this case, Polanski's free pass is too big to fail and the film survives as his most renowned work ever since.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I hate film noir and I always will......,"Film Noir has to be the most overrated style of film being made.  'The Maltese Falcon', 'L.A. Confidential', and now 'Chinatown' are film noir films I have seen that are highly overrated pieces of s**t.  Someone has to say how crappy this style of film is.  But perhaps I am the only one using my brain when I watch these over complicated, yet extremely simple, and most of the time non-existent and forgotten about plots. First of all, the plot twists.  There are too many to count in every one of these.  She could be a daughter, then a lover, then a wife, then a man. It doesn't matter, apparently all of you fools will buy into anything they tell you and call it a masterpiece.  You may as well watch 'Days of our Lives'.  I bet they have great plot twists for all of you to sink your teeth into.  There's sure to be double crosses.  And as long as there are ten or eleven of those, contrived as they all are, you seem to love it.Now 'Chinatown' is no better than any of those.  Jack Nicholson was a million times better in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest', and that had a coherent script.  So I guess thats out.  Plus that had characters that you could have sympathy for, where as in film noir, this film is no exception to the rule, all of the characters are just a tool for the plot twists.  They don't have personalities or souls, they just have surprises, all of which are surprises because they come out of nowhere and don't cohere with the story they initially started telling. And continuity, can I get a little of that, please.  By the end of the movie, the main story element didn't even matter.  All of the plans to move water out of L.A. are forgotten about, and then some contrived soap opera story line takes center stage. I will, however, admit that I did enjoy the scene when Dunaway tell Nicholson her big secret.  It was just so damn contrived and out of nowhere that I found myself laughing a little and with a small smile on my face. All though, that was the only brief amount of enjoyment I got out of it, because the rest was just so slow.  And its built up like we are supposed to be exposed to this great finale, but alas, we are not.  But it was all silly, contrived, out of the blue, and a great plot twist that makes no sense, so I'm sure all of you were breathless when it was all said and done. And I have news for those of you who are so impressed at how good the atmosphere in this film is.  Guess what?  This isn't the only film thats been shot half decently and has atmosphere, all though not much of one.  A lot of films have a great atmosphere.  'The Godfather' has a great atmosphere.  'Das Boot' has a great atmosphere.  But these also have better direction, better stories, and better characters that we can care about. Am I really asking for too much in wanting that.  Those two are great films. This is really more of an attack on the genre on the whole, but this movie is no better than any other ones.  Nicholson was fine, but thats about it.  I'll take a movie with characters I care about from now on, and maybe a cohesive plot and story.  Thats all I ask, and I don't think thats too much.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cynical Tale of the Corruption that Build America,"Roman Polanski's 1974 Neo-Noir Chinatown is a film that helped define both the genre and the era in which it was made.Chinatown centers on a '30s Los Angeles private investigator, Jake Gittes (who turned to the profession after being unable to work as a police officer in the corrupt environment present in his assigned district of Chinatown), who is tricked into digging up dirt on the head of the department in charge of the city's water (a hot issue as Los Angeles was experiencing a drought). When the man soon turns up dead, Jake's investigation reveals a conspiracy much larger than he had imagined. Though the conspiracy itself is intricate and intriguing, and the characters are very compelling, the real draw of the plot is in its themes. Do not go into this film too focused on the minutiae of the plot, but rather look at what the picture as a whole, and particularly its ending, is trying to say about American greed.The acting is terrific, with three great performances by Nicholson, Dunaway, and Huston. The direction is precise and tight yet patient, allowing scenes to develop naturally while always driving the plot along. The filming feels rather restrained and almost classical for the most part, and many shots feel like they could have easily have been from a film from several decades earlier. The music too feels this way, the Jerry Goldsmith composed score evokes instantly evokes the noir films which Chinatown takes most of its cues from.A cynical look at the greed and corruption that shaped America, Chinatown is a classic of '70s American cinema, and a must watch for any fan of film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Expertly crafted neo noir.,"""I don't want to nail you. I want to find out who put you up to it.""A drought-stricken, late 1930's Los Angeles serves as the backdrop to this neo noir starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. What starts out as a seemingly routine job for a private detective of shadowing a cheating spouse, balloons into a murky mystery involving murder, greed, and long-hidden secrets.I had to watch this twice, because the first time I was a bit distracted and didn't get the full experience of the movie. These kinds of films require you to pay as close attention to the details as the detective who's the protagonist of the story, in order to fit all the pieces together. The mystery of what's going on has several layers that are slowly revealed as the story unfolds, Dunaway and Nicholson are brilliant playing off one another, and the ending is truly memorable and perfectly reinforces the theme of the movie. This is a flick that almost any fan of the genre will enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Very good, but not excellent","This was a movie that I had never seen completely until recently. I had really high expectations for Chinatown. From what I had heard and read about this film was that it was as good or better than other 1970s movies such as ""The Godfather"", ""The Conversation"", ""The Sting"", or ""Taxi Driver"". I thought this was a very good movie, but not an excellent movie and definitely not as good as the Francis Ford Coppola movies of this time.Chinatown seemed a bit slow and long to me. I did like Jack Nicolson's performance however, but his acting along with the good directing wasn't enough for me to call it an excellent movie. The performances of the other actors was good, but I didn't think it was great.I'll watch this movie again in a few months, maybe then I'll feel more highly about it.I rate this movie a generous 7 out of 10.

So how does it compare with a 1940s film noir?,"This isn't a homage to the 1930 or 40s, it's not a nostalgic tribute to a bygone age it's more of a condemnation of how we used to be. Although it paints a pretty bleak image of the time and the way things were, I think this can be seen as optimistic and forward looking - the message is: we're better than that now!Despite the brightness of the blazing California sun and the vivid Technicolor, noir seems to have become even more noirish from the 40s to the 70s. In those forty years the perception of ourselves and what entertainment we want became ostensibly less optimistic than during the days of the second world war - the promised utopian new world didn't happen. Like a lot of those excellent and original films by young talented and independently minded filmmakers in the late sixties and early seventies, this is not an obvious feel good movie. Although more character focussed than you'd find in films from forty years earlier, it does have a strong and fast paced story which is more akin to a 1940s film than say a typical moody, miserable 1970s film. It's not just the magnetic presences of Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway which keep your eyes glued to the screen, the story, the mystery and the perfectly paced intrigue which drip feeds at just the right rate is honed to perfection to hook you in.Ironically this very dark picture is very bright to look at which is not what you'd associate with the late thirties. The overall look, the clothing and art direction clearly gives this film the feel of that time but it's done in a subtle way and the mannerisms, the attitudes and especially the dialogue is nothing like what you'd find in a 1930s or 40s picture. Fortunately it doesn't look like a 1970s film either which makes this picture timeless and accessible. For fans of the old classics, the world this evokes will seem very familiar to us yet just slightly different making this almost a surreal world. Similarly both Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway also seem like people we think we might have known from somewhere. That makes them easy to relate to and engage with but although we're expecting them to be like Bogart and Bacall they're not and that jolts us a little out of our comfort zones - that uneasiness is what cleverly gives their characters much greater depth.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Haunting Atmosphere,"This film reminds me of ""The Big Sleep"" with Bogie and Bacall, although ""Chinatown"" is more enjoyable than the 1946 so-called ""classic"". Both Jake Gittes and Philip Marlowe exude smugness and insolence; both have to contend with, and are inexorably drawn to, classy women with secrets. And typical of movies that feature gumshoe detectives, the stories of both ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Chinatown"" are confusing and convoluted.""Chinatown"" combines power and corruption with sex and murder into a needlessly complex plot, written perhaps deliberately to confound viewers, in keeping with traditional noir doctrine, which espouses that confusion equals arty sophistication.So who did kill Ida Sessions, and how did she get possession of those pictures? Fans of ""Chinatown"" would regard such questions as irrelevant, just as fans of ""The Big Sleep"" would regard the question of who killed Owen Taylor irrelevant. Who cares who the killer was, so long as you have the infallible Nicholson, as heir to the infallible Bogart, to distract attention from the story. Sorry, but I just don't agree that a muddled story can be a film's virtue.""Chinatown"" does have its strengths. Good acting permeates the film, even among minor characters. But the performance of John Huston was inspired (pardon the irony), and should have been recognized as such with an academy award. The music, too, is impressive. The slow, lonely horn evokes a dark and brooding mood totally in sync with the classy cinematography.This film has a haunting cinematic atmosphere and, to some extent, that helps overcome a perplexing plot.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Again, the music is what really makes this movie memorable for me. Faye Dunaway is a great actress, and much underutilized in the overly-competitive SHOW BIZ ATMOSPHERE.

A Hollywood Masterpiece,"Experiencing older Hollywood films, films made in the era when script, direction, cinematography, lighting, musical scoring and acting became melded together in an intricate but cohesive escapist adventure, is like visiting a fine art museum - masters at work creating a living work of art that time only enhances in respect.Such is the case for Roman Polanski's 1974 film noir CHINATOWN. Robert Towne's brilliant script is the baseline for this fascinating story of the Los Angeles and environs of the 1930s, a time when power was wedded to corruption, greed, family secrets of aberrant stature, and manipulation of resources (here the Department of Water and Power, the police, and entrepreneurs). Using the inimitable Jack Nicholson as the smart and daring private detective who pries open a conspiracy in the family of John Huston and his daughter Faye Dunaway whose private life secret is as huge as the water stealing crimes that are at the basis of the story was a stroke of genius that has rarely been matched since. And tying all of this together with one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest musical scores and cinematography that is liquid and redolent of the wastes that were the at the core of Los Angeles' prostitution of sunlight and shadow - the desert by the sea - was part of Polanski's genius for direction.For viewing an example of the finest in film-making, CHINATOWN remains at the top of the list.

"The peak of Film Noir, the start of Neo Noir, and one of the greatest films of all time.","Not only does this film kick off the Neo Noir trend, but it also does so while being one of the best Film Noirs ever.While most Neo Noirs after this took the genre into new eras and places (ex. Blade runner, Mulholland Drive,) Chinatown takes the usual Noir setting, and expands upon it. Adding twists and differences that you wouldn't expect.while the plot seems confusing and hard to follow at first, it all pays off with the reveal in the third act.

Amazing Film Noir,"This is a noir mystery, with a dark, haunting story, great acting and a brilliant direction. Its ambiance is just perfect. In this story, every character has complicated issues that can't be solved, a troubled past and sins they can't atone for. It's all very dark and mysterious, and it gets you in the edge of your seat. The political part of the mystery keeps you guessing and it's incredibly competent, but the character development and their personal issues are even better.The screenplay is mind-blowing. All of its subplots are perfectly developed and are understood just at the right time, they keep you guessing. The characters are all believable and interesting: Gittes (Jack Nicholson) and his obsession, Evelyn (Faye Dunaway) trying to get her life back together and, Noah Cross, the personification of evil, have a convincing, elaborated relationship with each other. They are all, in a way or another, trying to atone but in Chinatown there's no redemption. The dialogs have a lot of meaning and are thought provoking. Some show the hypocrisy of people and others just their weakness, always in a tense, disguised way. There are a bunch of quotable lines too. The ending is surprising but well done and very fitting. The themes are spoke of with maturity and sensibility.The acting is great. Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston have a very believable, amazing chemistry between them, they seem to be always messing with the other's mind, trying to mistake him and convince him. All this is noticed just by a gaze, a movement or a blink. It's very subtle, but it makes the performances outstanding. Jack Nicholson creates a haunted character, strong but human. Faye Dunaway makes her character remarkably vulnerable and sad, even if at the same time a bit of a femme fatale. John Huston is evil, in his two scenes he's just perfect. All the secondary actors are talented and they make this movie better.I highly enjoy Polanski's way of shooting, all the angles and camera movements he tends to use. He does a great job once again. The movie never gets tiring and some of the shots are breathtaking. They are a beautiful homage to older noir movies, even if still have their originality.The music is haunting and it gives a movie a touch of originality. The editing pays homage to the noir movies from the 40's, showing the many layers of the story slowly and there's not one minute tat shouldn't be there. The cinematography, glossy but dirty, with an harsh, dark lighting creates the right ambiance. Just brilliant and unmissable.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not an engaging story, but fine production","Chinatown is one of those classics I've been meaning to get round to for literally decades. I still try to go in with neutral expectations. Sometimes I'm blown away by the magnificence (like with Lawrence of Arabia), other times I'm very disappointed (like with Casablanca) and with Chinatown I'm kinda like...meh...it was alright.Very nicely filmed, expertly acted, clever dense script, decent action when it comes around. But the story was simply not that interesting: a dispute about water supply in 30's Los Angeles being the backdrop for a murder mystery is as dull as it sounds. And the scene immediately preceding the ending didn't make much narrative sense considering how otherwise careful & calculated Jake had been up until then.Also...why is it even called Chinatown? There's barely 5 minutes set there, and the only Chinese present are a couple of near-wordless bit-parts.Hard to recommend if you're also considering striking this famous film of your watchlist. I highly rate other Polanski films too, so did feel a little disappointed that arguably his most lauded work felt a bit flat. Maybe noir fans might get more out of it.For completists however it's still worth a watch because of the fine quality of the production.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Masterpiece of Noir Cinema,"Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown,"" released in 1974, stands as a timeless classic in the realm of neo-noir cinema.

What begins as a routine investigation into infidelity quickly escalates into a dangerous game of power and intrigue, with Gittes uncovering dark secrets that threaten to consume him.At its core, ""Chinatown"" is a scathing commentary on the manipulation of public resources by the wealthy elite, drawing inspiration from real-life conflicts over water rights in California's history. The film's noir aesthetic, characterized by its intricate plot and morally ambiguous characters, adds depth and complexity to its narrative, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats until the very end.Jack Nicholson delivers a career-defining performance as the wise-cracking yet deeply flawed J.

Opposite him, Faye Dunaway shines as Evelyn Mulwray, a woman caught in the crossfire of power and greed, her vulnerability and resilience making her a compelling and unforgettable character.John Huston's portrayal of the enigmatic Noah Cross adds another layer of menace to the film, his charismatic yet sinister presence casting a shadow over every scene he inhabits.

An Excellent Neo-Noir Film,"This is a movie that the first time I saw it was in college in one of my film classes. I had already seen Rosemary's Baby and The Ninth Gate, so I knew of Roman Polanski. This is one that I hadn't seen since then, but having become more of a cinephile, it was one that I knew I would come back to eventually. For that, I need to thank Duncan and his show of Where to Begin With Film Noir/Neo-Noir.Where I'll start is that for the over two-hour runtime, it doesn't feel like it. I got sucked into the story and just seeing Jack Nicholson as J. J. Gittes is on point. The arrogance he brings to the role is spot on. It is a movie like this that makes me realize how good of an actor he can be at times.We have a great story here. I like that Jake knows there is more to what he sees. He gets hired by Ida, who he believes to be Evelyn Mulwray. What gets him going down this path is clearing his name and then ultimately, solving the case. His eye for detail is on point. This movie embodies being a neo-noir film, while still feeling as if it could fall in that original stretch of film noir. J. J. Is a great hard-nosed PI. Faye Dunaway is a different take on the femme fatale. We even have Polanski himself doing his Alfred Hitchcock impersonation as a thug, which is interesting with Hitch making some of the best films in this sub-genre.The acting here from our leads and the supporting cast is great. The story is as well. I didn't remember everything, but it came back to me as things fell into place. I love how the cinematography makes it feel like it's from the 1930s but being in color.

His wise guy determination not to be screwed over makes the perfect foil for Dunaway's worldly innocence. All of the supporting actors pitch their tents on this base and none come up wanting. Of course Polanski was the genius behind the curtain and no matter what his personal foibles he gave us Chinatown, a period piece, humanistic commentary, railyard gristle, and detective story up with the best of them.

Neo noir classic,"Polanski's classics didn't age too well, but ""Chinatown"" is still a pleasure to watch. It stinks of the trademark bleakness and cynicism of the seventies while still evoking the smoky atmosphere of old noir films. It might be amongst his most conservative, but it goes along well with Robert Towne's captivating script, which continuously plays with the genre's conventions and cliches to lead both the characters and the viewer down the wrong track.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fiendish but sophisticated classic that demands revisits,"Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN has classical film-noir elements, but the beating heart of the movie lies in Polanski's own bag of tricks and oddity; he twists schoolbook-stuff around and adds misguiding, bizarre moments and characters, adding to the movie's intelligent narrative. Because anyhow, Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes is a gritty feature, he's experienced failure from back when he was a policeman in Chinatown, something that we only get through mysterious hints. Ad Jake's a well-dressed, humorous and classy man, but also cynical and impulsive and doesn't affect by walking around with a bandaged-nose most parts of the film. This is a hard-boiled detective-mystery which spins its complicated puzzle into something disturbingly dark, in which Faye Dunaway's terrific performance as the elegant Evelyn holds the movie's dark core as she acts like a classy femme fatale, with suspicious motives. CHINATOWN is one of those conspiracy-thrillers that demands a revisit, not only because its twirled plot is so intriguing, but because of Polanski creating a unforgettable, dark atmosphere of originals and one of Nicholson's greatest performances as he investigates his way down through greed, murder and incest.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Still the Noir Classic No One Can Touch,"Roman Polanski's 1974 neo-noir mystery is about as perfect a pastiche of the dark-hearted genre as there ever has been. In fact, in the half-century since its release, I think it's one of the best detective movies ever made, period. Starting with Robert Towne's meticulously compelling screenplay, the labyrinth plot encompasses the Southern California water wars that threatened the future of LA and weaves an intense psychological drama that leads to one of the most memorable climaxes in cinema history. Polanski moves the deeply involving story with a consistent sure hand, an unerring attention to period detail and a judicious amount of grisly violence. Jack Nicholson plays cynical gumshoe J. J. Gittes in his characteristic style and with a welcome depth of dimension, but it's Faye Dunaway who impeccably conveys the glamor and mystery of the classic femme fatale and adds a startling Method edginess as things start to unravel. Channeling Gene Tierney and Kim Stanley at the same time, Dunaway does her best movie work by a mile here. Thanks especially to John Huston's cunning vulturish performance, the ending is a haunting knockout.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Pretty good crime detective film, with a hidden plot that has the viewer guessing. And one of the better and darker films of the 1970's.","""Chinatown"" is certainly one of the better films of the 1970's, though the plot is at first a little hidden causing the viewer to search for it. Only this ends up being a pretty dark and clever mystery. ""Chinatown"" is set in bright and sunny Los Angeles, California during the 1930's, and many scenes are memorable from the sets used like the houses, and the backdrop of the California skyline and desert. Jack Nicholson is Jake Gittes a veteran private eye who takes cases of people who believe that their significant other has cheated. Only one day he finds a funny thing is about to happen when he receives a report from a Mrs. Mulwray that her husband is cheating. Only later Gittes finds out that this wasn't the real Mrs. Mulwray! And soon upon investigating this claim, he learns that Mr. Mulwray is tied to a dispute over land and water in the L.A. valley, and as was so common in the 1970's this is tied to political corruption and civil servant scandal. More light is shed after Gittes finds the real Mrs. Mulwray(Faye Dunaway) and the discovery of Mr. Mulwray dead only deepens the mystery. Just when the plot seems to be clear the film throws the viewer off again showing that Mrs. Mulwray's father is playing a clear role in this torrid land and water mess as John Huston gives a fine performance as Noah Cross. Mostly ""Chinatown"" is a film of secrets, and political corruption with a plot that keeps the viewer guessing, certainly one of the better and darker films of the 1970's. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as always making this a classic because his performance was straight to the point, and Roman Polanski did a fine job directing this it was well adapted from Robert Towne, and one of the memorable scenes of all time is when Polanski's character cuts Jack's nose with a knife! Overall a pretty good detective mystery film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""You know what happens to nosy fellows?""","Roman Polanski's landmark, marvelously complex, classic film noir masterpiece, which is a fascinating mystery which is set in 1930s Los Angeles.

One of the other things that makes this film great is an unforgettable music score by Jerry Goldsmith who should have won the Oscar in 74 for this score.

Noir Without the Code,"An LA p.i. gets caught up with a spider woman and a land stealing scheme that uses water diversion during a drought.In short, the movie's the best noir since the genre's golden age. From muted colors to shaded performances to uncompromised ending, the movie's a worthy successor to the 40's classics. And that's despite the 130-minute length, twice the average. Plus, director Polanski doesn't have to meet Code requirements that compromised many a 40's feature. Thus, we get an ending that befits the general storyline, no matter how much of a downer it is for the audience.Note that amidst a prevaricating world, Nicholson's J.J. Gittes is no noble truth-seeker in the manner of a Marlowe or a Spade. Instead, he's in it strictly for the money. So when he's trapped in the spider woman's (Dunaway) little web of deceit, it's hard to feel sympathy. In fact, Gittes is neither very likable in personality, methods or ethics. Thus, it's a tribute to screenwriter Towne that we stay involved with the storyline, despite the general absence of anybody to identify with. Then too, the plot is not so much a mystery or whodunit as it is a web of intrigue leading to someone or somewhere. That central referent of 'Chinatown' remains something of a puzzler. I interpret it as a place where bad things are done in the name of the good while everyone ignores the discrepancy. Thus, the ironical ending.Anyhow, the movie's a first-rate noir that makes a lasting impression, and as an LA resident I'm reminded to check my lawn. I think it needs water.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Chinatown...,"This is where Jake Gittes once worked for the Los Angeles DA's office, before becoming a private eye. His job there: to do ""as little as possible,"" because, as everyone eventually learns, everything is a mystery, and nothing is as it seems.But now Jake is a successful PI doing ""matrimonial work"" for the city's elites. The wife of the city water commissioner hires him to catch her husband cheating, when suddenly the commissioner drowns under suspicious circumstances, and his supposed mistress disappears. A few twists later, Jake becomes involved with the widow, as he tries to find out what her sinister father may have to do with the case, and why everything seems to be about water.But this is a Chinatown case, metaphorically at least. He is told quite directly that ""You may think you know what's going on, but, believe me, you don't,"" but this warning is unheeded. Jake is good at what he does, and we can see his skill as he slowly untangles the mystery. But just like Jake, we see that at every turn the evidence has misled us, and all our intuitions were wrong. This is the story of a smart, competent man utterly confounded by events and people, leading to a tragedy that we could somehow feel coming, even if we couldn't quite see how. And all he's left with at the end are his assistant's consoling words, ""Forget it, Jake, it's ... Chinatown.""This movie works on so many levels. The acting is superb, especially John Huston as the quite realistically creepy villain. The casting is inspired, with Faye Dunaway's slightly stiff acting perfectly conveying the widow's simmering neurosis. Other characters populate the scene, striking just the right notes: the two plainclothes cops, one more corrupt than the other, the fat coroner with the cigarette and cough to match, the annoying clerk at the hall of records, the Okie farmers struggling to keep their land, the Chinese servants who know more than they're telling, and even director Roman Polanski as a punk with a switchblade.Jerry Goldsmith's music is flawless, and even the mysterious incidental sounds plucked on the harp of a piano are unforgettable. The cinematography captures the feel of 1930's Los Angeles through a slight orange filter, like a faded color photograph, the costumes and props are true, the neighborhoods seem real, and the history reflects the actual controversies of the day. The plot itself seems to wind around with all the natural grace of an octopus. This is great film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Chinatown - My Review,"I'm not sure if it was the story that didn't draw me in or the content, but I wasn't as thrilled with it as I thought I was going to be. It had really lovely photography and stunning color, but a lot of what went on didn't hold my attention.The concern for water was a realistic and very appropriate topic that still applies today, so its messages regarding that was promising and well documented. However I found the story hard to follow, even in the two hours it took to explain it. A quick trip to wikipedia didn't help, and it didn't help me keep my interest because of this. Even so, it was interesting to notice how it was filmed, especially when it made the scenes more dynamic with its obvious widescreen bars above and below the screen.It also didn't feel too much like the time period it took place in, too, especially when everything was in color. I felt this would have worked a lot better as a black and white film, and maybe with a little color put into certain scenes depending on the content.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just about perfect..,"Watching Chinatown again recently, it struck me that it is just about perfect.
All the elements of film-making were performed here at an extraordinarily high level, and the result is one of the most satisfying movies...EVER!Chinatown is THE standard against which period mysteries must be measured.
Start with the wonderful script by Robert Towne. His plot, characters and dialogue entertain and intrigue us and the film's brilliant central metaphor, Chinatown, reveals, conceals and resonates long after the credits roll.Next, people the story with a terrific cast led by Jack Nicholson, who despite his worldliness is in way-over-his-head without knowing it. Faye Dunaway as the fragile femme fatale, Evelyn Mulwray, and John Huston as one of the most memorable villains in moviedom as the rich & powerful, ruthless yet seemingly benign, Noah Cross.Brilliant director with an equally gifted cinematographer, Roman Polanski was an inspired choice to direct this film. Polanski is adept at creating tension and dread on film. Chinatown's great success is in the atmosphere and tension and ominous feel of foreboding that overlays the film. Chinatown succeeds because its mystery is actually mysterious, its story complex, its secrets genuinely surprising.Chinatown is beautiful and meticulous. And the music score is so good that it has been imitated MANY times in Chinatown wannabes. Chinatown is about as good as Hollywood can do, meeting both entertainment and craftsmanship of filmmaking at such a high standard that it raises the result to the level of art.Chinatown is a brilliantly unique story and a masterpiece we all have recognized from its initial release.

Chinatown,"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown. One of the most iconic lines in cinematic history can be found in Roman Polanski's 1974 masterpiece Chinatown.Chinatown is almost the perfect movie. The direction is outstanding. Polanski knows how to tell a story as good as anyone. The perfect camera angles and the perfect shots are taken as we take a dive in two the mind of J.J. Gittes a private detective who reiterates that he makes a fair living. He is masterfully played by none other that Jack Nicholson who gives one of his best performance that can be ranked alongside his performances in 'The Shining' and 'Cuckoo's Nest' Nicholson gives a very controlled performance. There is no unnecessary shouting or going over the top. He begins to uncover a terrible plot over in L.A. that involves the water department,incest,adultery and Chinatown. Robert Towne wrote this script in the traditional noir way with voice-over and the like but Polanski eliminated all the voice-over so the audience would uncover the mystery as Gittes would and was that a good decision. The movie is an absorbing 2 hour experience as you get completely lost as the plot unravels and more of the mystery unfolds. It is tremendously quotable movie. It has a noir touch to it that is obvious from the overture but the touch is so light that the movie simply floats on this delightful little script. Recently the movie was named on a list of the seven films to see before you die. Well I generally disagree with such lists because it's the apples over oranges thing isn't it. But Chinatown is a brilliant film. The ending is so powerful that it can knock most films out of the water with just that. It leaves you feeling frightened, challenged and with so many questions that you can debate about it for hours on end. And that is what Art really should accomplish. It should encourage discussion and that is what Chinatown does. You can call the movie anything you want but it sure as hell is a piece of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I would expect great performances from the likes of Nicholson and Dunaway but their performances were just beyond greatness.Another thing that stands out is the original screenplay by Robert Towne. This screenplay is perhaps why this movie is one of the best films ever made.Overall, this is an Oscar-caliber film that is worth watching.

I am very much in minority here,"I realise I am very much in minority here but, I don't rate this movie anything like as much as most people clearly do. It is enjoyable, fairly clever and just about holds the interest but there is a big problem. Probably the very best thing in this is Jack Nicholson, trouble is he virtually is the film. Much as I enjoy watching the man when he is on top form like this, he does distract from the working of the film. Also, good though his performance is, he does not convince of his attraction to Dunaway. Talking of the leading lady, I may as well try an deal with another irritation, this whole mystery surrounding her and its clarification at the end. I think the whole mother/sister incest business is another distraction and just a little too close to home with regard to the director and his known sexual preferences. Basically I think Polanski wanted to make a noir, he loved the idea of using the iconic Nicholson and he got off on the Dunaway secret both aspects subsequently, for me alone it seems, conspiring to defeat him.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

""Chinatown"" is a movie which ends up being an indelible display of how egocentric megalomania supersedes all other emotions! Such abominable behavior reflects a myriad of despicable qualities of many individuals which pertain to the abhorrent aspects of human nature. The director of this film, Roman Polanski, has had a tenuously depraved life. (Including his tragic marriage to Sharon Tate). This movie is considered to be Polanski's best film ever! ""Chinatown"" is based on a true story, one which inflicted a lot of suffering for the city of Los Angeles, and, the vast majority of it's citizens sometime back in the 1930's!! The intensity of agitation in this film is astounding!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this film is remarkable!! Faye Dunaway's performance as Evelyn Mulray is considered by some prominent movie critics, to be the 36th best acting performance in the history of movie making!! This does not surprise me, I felt that Faye Dunaway's performance in ""Network"" was the best acting performance I have ever seen!! The movie, ""Chinatown"" is about people who are unscrupulous and miserable!! Often times, character portrayals about people who are victims of their environment are usually depicted with the indigent or the oppressed, in the movie ""Chinatown"", the environmental victims were the wealthy and the powerful!! Hatefulness, callousness, not to mention the blatant disregard for hard working individuals, as well as their overall well being, all became second nature reactions with the hegemony of Los Angeles. (i.e. Noah Cross and a handful of pork barrel politicians). ""Chinatown"" emanates a subtle tolerance for lethal chicanery by making conspiracy, cover ups, and collusion complete and utter masterpieces of understatement. This film evokes a repugnant display of human intuition by merely divulging some simple, yet, clinically ruthless facts!! Accommodating plausibility translated to dollar signs with everyone in the film. Vindictiveness with all of these plutocratic and nefarious scoundrels in ""Chinatown"" ultimately relegated them to the precarious plight of having to reap what they've sown. Their recriminations became a proverbial case of too little too late. What wound up being the single most appropriate adjective for describing this film, was the cogently riveting one of POWERFUL!! At the end of this film all negative behavioral ugliness patterns propagated a disconcerting state of resonating despair. The directing in this movie is unbelievable. The acting is sensational. The cinematography and melodic genre in ""Chinatown"" is unprecedented, basically second to none!! Most critics rate ""Chinatown"" as one of the top twenty American films ever made, I agree!!

Nicholson at his best. Before he became a Joker,"Jack Nicholson starts his career as a headlined actor in style. The first film in which he takes the lead showed the world exactly what talent this man has. This film, to me, is his best acting experience, especially since it doesn't involve him laughing hysterically but delivering lines from an excellent script with brutality, wit and sarcasm.He plays Jake Gittes, a Private Investigator, specialising in adultery cases. He is approached by a woman claiming to be the wife of Mr Mulwray, the owner of the water supply for LA, a man going through hard times due to the drought currently occupying LA. She believes her husband is having an affair with a younger woman and asks him to investigate. Just as Gittes begins his investigation, the real wife of Mr Mulwray (Faye Dunway) surfaces, threatening to sue Gittes for his intrusion. So what is going on?Gittes pure curiosity into the situation and the arrival of Mr Mulwray's murdered body sends Gittes into a world of deceit and corruption, all stemming down to the importance of the city's water problem and some shocking family truths. The truth to which Gittes is to find, turns out to be darker and more sinister than many will be expecting, a realisation that had me baffled. This reveal, you may feel, has no link with the rest of the movie but thinking back to a few one liners and a strange John Huston, you can see where this back story links in and how important it is to the final outcome.At no point in this movie did I find myself uninterested and it kept me guessing as to what will come in the next scene. This was due to Polanski's brilliant direction. From the first shot of Nicholson spying on Mr Mulwray, I felt myself applauding Polanski's directing. The shots were beautiful and a single frame seemed to reveal so much.Polanski slowly drips information to the audience, giving you enough information to move onto the next scene but not enough so that the answers can be figured out before the credits role. My only complaint about it would be that I would have liked the ending to have been wrapped up a little better but perhaps Polanski felt the need to allow the audience to think about this film passed the end credits. Many others have come to like this ending but I think it ended too abruptly considering the rest of the film reveals itself very slowly. The ending seems rushed and this is not just from the story as the acting in the last five minutes seemed weaker and the camera work became lazy.The film reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock style of filmmaking and I could compare this film to his classic Vertigo (1958) with its long lingering shots that build plenty of emotion and reveal all through the image and character on the screen.The music works well with the film, bringing out lots of tension whether it is when Gittes is help at knife point or is leaning in for a kiss. The music brings the film to its noir roots despite it being recorded in colour.I can see why this film is classed as a classic but the overly rushed ending takes a little away from it. Nicholson though is brilliant as the Private Eye and in my opinion surpasses the Joker (Batman) and McMurphy (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) interpretations audiences love him for.See this film for Nicholson and for the disturbing revelation that caused my jaw to hit the floor.",,Anonymous,Mystery
a classic film noir from the '70s,"The moment you see those opening credits in monochrome brown-sepia, you know you are in for a treat. This is a film by someone steeped in the tradition of the best film noir, and though not a style one associates with Polanski, his sense of drama and of pacing, and his painstaking care to make every shot add to the overall atmosphere, is perfectly suited. Though lacking the distinctive low viewpoints, close-ups and heavy shadows of traditional film noir, this is one of the few later films which manage perfectly to capture the atmosphere and the understated tension of the genre.The writing and the acting, too, is straight out of the best tradition of film noir. Robert Towne's excellent Oscar-winning script, written with Jack Nicholson in mind for the central character of LA private detective J.J.Gittes, is written entirely from Gittes' perspective (I don't believe there's a single scene in which he doesn't figure). If Bogart was the epitome of Chandler's Marlowe in the 40's, then Nicholson is a worthy successor, and I wonder whether Towne ever considered writing another screenplay around the same character. When I first saw this film when it came out, I hadn't seen Nicholson before, and I remember being just blown away (I didn't see Easy Rider until a couple of years later). Faye Dunaway and the superbly cast John Huston complete the triangle, and we only discover their relative roles in the mystery as Gittes gradually pieces the complex jigsaw together, which of course is just how it should be. The supporting actors are more than adequate, secondary to the story but never detracting from it, with Perry Lopez doing a great job as the struggling but confident lieutenant (who of course is a former colleague of Gittes).But for me, Polanski himself is the star of this film (and I don't mean his nice little cameo part). I'm glad he wasn't tempted to shoot in black-and-white, though it wouldn't have been out of place -- the consistently washed-out colour so well delivers the sense of the heat and the desert (only the blue of the ocean and the bright lights of Chinatown itself stand out), and his choice of shot, variety of speed, and attention to detail never distract the viewer, nor detract from the acting and the unfolding tale. It's only after the film is over, when you sit back in admiration, that you realise there really wasn't a single moment when you were impatient to move on, or lost track of the plot, or felt a wrong note had been hit. I regard this, along with his recent superb version of Oliver Twist, to be his best works. And that's not an easy choice to make.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Movie.  I feel it is overrated.,"Let's just say that I have heard so much about this film, so I bought the DVD and finally got to see it. The plot revolves around a private detective who is approached by a woman to investigate her husband, because she thinks that he is cheating. As the movie goes on, the plot gets very intricate and involves murder, lies, money and so on.I thought that the acting was great. I am a huge Jack Nicholson fan and he is good as PI Jake Gittes. I felt that this movie was slow and boring at times. I guess the reason it is so well received is for it's time period, the story is pretty advanced and it is well written. I just don't think this movie even compares to films like the Godfather. Overall, this is a good movie, I think that I was just expecting more. I was not glued to the screen like I am with great films. That is why I feel its overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Don't worry about it Jake, it's Chinatown""","Indeed it was. Chinatown is about a private detective named Jake Ginnis who investigates a deadly case that involves with murder and water. Chinatown is very mysterious and these are the types of films that will unravel everything your looking for, right at the very last moments of the movie. Jack Nicholson did really well in the film along with Faye Dunaway, but the other supporting characters pretty much had no interest to me and were very forgettable throughout the film. The screenplay by Robert Towne was neatly written out along with the good direction by Roman Polanski, with that saying, in being his last film in America. The film was a little confusing, but maybe I have to see it a second time to know everything. The ending was good and the dialogue had some really good lines such as my line at the top, that has become one of the most famous quotes. Overall, a pretty good mystery that made Jack Nicholson shine. I still don't think it's better than L.A. Confidential, but hey, that's just my opinion. I recommend it in ways.Hedeen's Outlook: 7/10 **+ C+",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
highly overrated,"To me Chinatown is a mediocre film noir. I love mistery, I love dark films, and I love tragic endings, but this film contains nothing of these. The only real surprise of the movie is the fact that salt water is not good for grass, all other twists (and there are many) are either hinted at too early in too obvious a way, or they come completely unprepared in a way which is meant to shock, which usually fails. This holds in particular for the daughter-sister-scene - on one hand hand I expect her to say something horrible, on the other hand, I have no clue what exactly she will say. So I am neither surprised, for I had no expectations which could be shaken, nor shocked, because the scene and its aim to shock has been heralded far too early. The ending is logical and would be nice, if Gittes wouldn't have talked to much before. So chinatown was already known as the symbol of ""we destroy what we love while trying to protect it"", and we can only wait and see how exactly destruction will take place.The film is somewhat saved by the superb acting of whole cast, nice lighting and the nose scene. Alltogether a 4.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the greatest films ever no doubt.,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Roman Polanski's Chinatown is a slow, brooding film-noir reminiscent of the 40's. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are perfectly cast, the background score is sublime and the dark detective story is consistently engaging and very, very classy.A well-crafted film-noir, albeit a bit slow but if you don't mind the pacing it's rather riveting in places, especially the second half.Thumbs up for this mysterious suspense-drama if you're in the mood for a good slow-burner.Highest Recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Salt water...velly bad for glass,"Chinatown is in my opinion the greatest movie ever made. It has absolutely everything!It draws influences from classic 40s film noir such as The Big Sleep and the Maltese Falcon and somehow manages to surpass them on every level. In Chinatown too we have the cocky gumshoe, the femme fatale (for once working out of the best of intentions) and of course the labyrinthine plot. We also have a number of other characters who either, act as vehicles or obstructions to help and hinder Gittes on his journey. However, there is also a certain vulnerability to Nicholson's character underneath that confident exterior that isn't as obvious in say Phillip Marlow or Sam Spade.The plot is highly absorbing and Robert Towne deservedly won an Oscar for his screen writing. He somehow manages to make a seemingly mundane political scandal seem interesting by meshing it with a private scandal of the most disturbing kind and every word uttered seems to have major significance in terms of plot and character development.The ending is now legendary and Polanski deserves huge recognition for this. It was he who demanded that it was changed from Towne's original and the pair famously fell out over it. However, Towne has since rightly conceded that Polanski's ending, shocking and tragic though it is, ensures that this film lives long in the memory.Furthermore, the casting and performances are of the highest quality. Nicholson gives a world beating performance as JJ Gittes, while Dunaway plays the classic Femme Fatale to perfection. And lets not forget the legendary John Huston whose rich, charming Noah Cross has a dark hidden secret.Polanski's mainly subjective camera-work deserves admiration as he captures a sun-drenched 1940s Los Angeles to perfection, and his appearance as the ""Midget"" with the knife pre-empts one of the most memorable scenes in movie history.On the whole Chinatown to me represents what constitutes a great film - believable characters with depth and feeling, a great plot-line and magnificent direction.The film, had it not been up against The Godfather Part II, would surely have taken the Oscars by storm.If you haven't seen it - do so immediately and if you have then watch it again and witness a bonafide masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ladies And Gentleman, What You Are About To Witness Is An Exorcism","Roman Polanski's genius is questionable. Whether or not he does possess a certain cinematic genius is neither urgent or necessary to conclude. His body of work speaks for itself, his 1974 magnum opus speaks for its decade, reality in the face of theatricality, and for the sanctity of the cinema itself. Now although it is not completely justifiable to prove whether Polanski is or is not a genius, it is rather important to discuss the life of this idolized and wanted man. Roman Polanski was born in the year 1933 in Paris to Polish parents. When his mother and father were forced into concentration camps for being Jewish, Polanski was faced with the unmeasurable difficulty of surviving the Holocaust on his own. His Mother, ultimately, fell victim to the horrors of Auschwitz. If that's not enough, if you would so melodramatically, fast forward to the year of 1969. To the Summer Of Love. To the end of the small portion of Polanski's life he would later recall as the happiest he's ever had. He had a beautiful, talented, and adoring wife. Her name was Sharon Tate. The baby inside of her, she and Roman would never name. In August of 1969 the Manson Family laid slain to Sharon Tate and the baby inside of her, both terrorizing and taunting, the darkest chapter of Polanski's life was marooned with notoriety and fear. It was only a few years after the death of his wife where Roman would leave his mark on the world forever. Chinatown flows with a lavishly perfected Noir tone, and I should add here, the film is the Neo Noir archetype, the best of its kind and one of the best that Film Noir carries in its respective canon. Also, whenever one sets out to write about Chinatown, one cannot understate the delicacy, the supreme handling of pacing which is to be found in this particular film. Not before, and not since, has pacing been so well thought out, so marvelously calculated, and devilishly crafted. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand immortal in this film, bellowing through the tenement halls inside of every dirty city confined within every Noir film in rotation. If Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand luminous as Kings of their respective Kingdom, then John Huston stands apart; shrouded in darkness, transparent, eager, vicious, immediate. John Huston's 'Noah Cross' exists, alright, and the most dangerous thing about the 'Noah Cross's of the world is that the evil within them is otherwise ordinary, bottomless, and unstoppable. Robert Towne's script is simply impeccable. Flawless storytelling accompanied by snappy dialogue, and a climax that cuts deeper than that of documentary reality. But it is Polanski who is the true star of this picture. You can see him in every shot, peering in through the lens, and directly into your heart. You can taste him in every dry patch of dialogue, smell him in the midst of gun smoke, and fear him as the tension culminates into the wake of tragedy. It is there, in the tragedy, he dares you to hope for the best, he wants to feel safe because films make you feel comfortable. He takes the trust that he'd earned from the audience, and crushes it, oh, and he makes sure it stings. He makes sure it hurts. And in in the aftermath of the his final act, his final betrayal, the ultimate tragedy, he makes sure you can feel him. He leaves you in pain. He leaves you guilty in satisfaction. Knowing that tragedy is the most universal of luxuries, Polanski makes that perfectly clear, and for the first time, his voice is heard, his war cry. Coherent and horrifying.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Chinatown,"I think this might be my favourite role from Faye Dunaway. She is ""Evelyn"", a woman who suspects that her husband ""Hollis"" (Darrell Zwerling) is playing away from home. She engages the services of the cynical PI ""Gittes"" (Jack Nicholson) and pretty soon people are dead and he is embroiled in an internecine story of adultery, corruption and manipulation that proves pretty perilous for a detective who is working with one women he suspects is being a bit frugal with the truth and another whose identity he is desperately struggling to discover. Nicholson is also on super form, his performance is natural and engaging with a solid chemistry between his and Dunaway adding a richness to this rather quirky plot. Roman Polanski has assembled a strong supporting cast - notably John Huston who features sparingly but effectively as her wealthy, untrustworthy, father ""Noah"" and the photography does a great deal to help generate a sense of accumulating intrigue as we gradually make some headway through this complicated and interesting character study. The production looks great - the 1930s costume and motor cars alongside a smattering of the simmering attitudes that prevailed at the time are encapsulated well too. It's a shade over two hours, but it hits the ground running and never really stops until the ending that though not entirely unexpected, still has enough elements of surprise to keep it compelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A modern version of film noir,Chinatown is a more modern version of film noir that included many aspects used in the old genre.

"This is the writer's film, not the director's!","It has always annoyed me when a screenwriter's contribution is overlooked so the director can jump to the front of the credit parade, as far as importance to the project is determined. In his book ""Hollywood Animal"", Joe (Basic Instinct) Eszterhas describes how the man who lensed two of his scripts, Costa Gavras, was talking at a college and the so called film students, who've bought into this auteur theory, didn't really get it that somebody else conceived and wrote the piece in the first place.Robert Towne is a man who apparently is very fast with doctoring others' stories and very slow with the completion of his own scripts. If it really took him seven years to write ""Chinatown"" (as Robert Evans claimed in ""The Kid Stays In The Picture""), then it was worth it for the whole world out there. This is an original work which should be judged differently than adapted projects. In ""Premiere"" magazine a few years ago, there was a list of the best screenplays ever. Well, to be fair, one should separate the ""Chinatown""s of the industry from films that turn plays, TV shows, video games and novels into big screen transformations.Towne's reputation as the guy most young writers look up to is secure, even if he never wrote anything else again. On the commentary for ""Wonderland"", James Cox and Captain Mauzner are practically jumping up and down recalling a meeting they had with Towne, at which he lauded praise on their John Holmes based investigation/exploration.Yes, Towne can create indelible characters and scenarios which actors and even in this case, directors, should kiss his hand for. I see there is a disc out now with a commentary track featuring David Fincher and Towne. Can't wait to hear that!""Chinatown"" was vintage before the recalling of the past was just another cinematic cliché and excuse for young men to wear their grand pappy's old suits. The 1930s are beaming with some promise here and the unscrupulous moguls have a plan to get really rich (as if they weren't already) by screwing whoever they have to out of their fair share of nature's resources.Jack Nicholson and his almost father in law, John Huston, are both perfect in their roles as the detective and the crusty bastard whose evil lies at the heart of this whole display of an era when shame had much more power than it does in today's tell all society.Faye Dunaway has her finest moments in a terrific career in this epic. She shows (and doesn't at key moments) the full range of emotions this resilient lady is always going through and that a woman's world seventy plus years ago was radically different than today's.""Chinatown"" is certainly one of the great works of art from film's first century. Let's hope some other rich in spirit and plotting screenwriter watches this, for the first or hundredth time, and pens something worth being in the same category of quality.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterpiece of cinema dissects the detective film and America itself,"Produced during a time when revisionist films were en vogue, reworking familiar Hollywood genre pictures, westerns, gangster films, love stories, and here detective films, Roman Polanski and Robert Towne's ""Chinatown"" is a masterpiece of cinema that dissects not just the detective film but dissects America itself. Jack Nicholson plays private detective J.J. Gittes. When mysterious woman enters his office one day to hire him to look into a suspected affair by her husband, this small case, in classic Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett style, leads to a Byzantine mystery of murder, sex, money, power, and intrigue. Although this sounds familiar, this is a very different world from that of Chandler or Hammett. Gittes is not Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade. He runs a successful P.I. business. Gittes himself is also the type of guy who will manically giggle at his own dirty jokes (can't picture Humphrey Bogart doing that). And befitting of 1970s cynicism, it's a story of the little guy facing down larger powers, though in this revisionist (i.e. more realistic) of world, the good guys don't always win and Mr. Smith does not always change Washington. However, as with most revisionist films, while the filmmakers spend a good deal of time deliberately blowing up genre tropes, they in equal part pay loving homage to those same tropes. ""Chinatown"" features some of the most sharpest hard boiled detective dialog ever committed to screen, there is gorgeous Hollywood style photography from cinematographer John A. Alonzo, and one of the most lush film scores to ever grace the screen from composer Jerry Goldsmith (Arguably his best score and composed in only 10 days after the original score was rejected. David Lynch says it's his all-time favorite film score.). The story even unfolds in a manner true to Chandler detective story traditions, with the entire film told from the perspective of the main character, Jake Gittes. Towne's script is a thing of beauty. The story and mystery progress with natural logic and makes perfect sense when it reaches its conclusion. Watching the film a second time, you can go back and see that all the pieces of the puzzle were right there in front of you from the beginning. All the clues to the mystery were there in plain sight. All the seemingly unimportant lines and character responses you interpreted to mean one thing now take on much different and deeper meanings. The script for ""Chinatown"" is a master class in storytelling. Beyond plot and story, Towne delivers, in true hard boiled detective fiction fashion, some of the most crackling dialogue you'll ever hear, and dialogue delivered by some of the greatest of Hollywood actors:Evelyn Mulwray: Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Jake Gittes: Well, I've been accused of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.orJake Gittes: Maid's night off?
Evelyn Mulwray: Why?
Jake Gittes: What do you mean, why? Nobody's here, that's why.
Evelyn Mulwray: I gave everyone the night off.
Jake Gittes: Easy. It's an innocent question.
Evelyn Mulwray: No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.orNoah Cross: Exactly what do you know about me? Sit down.
Jake Gittes: Mainly that you're rich, too respectable to want your name in the newspapers.
Noah Cross: Of course I'm respectable I'm old! Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.orMan with Knife: You're a very nosy fellow, kitty cat. Huh? You know what happens to nosy fellows? Huh? No? Wanna guess? Huh? No? Okay. They lose their noses. (slashes Jake's nose) Next time you lose the whole thing. Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.orJake Gittes: But, Mrs. Mulwray, I goddamn near lost my nose. And I like it. I like breathing through it. And I still think you're hiding something.orJake Gittes: In Chinatown.
Evelyn Mulwray: What were you doing there?
Jake Gittes: Working for the District Attorney.
Evelyn Mulwray: Doing what?
Jake Gittes: As little as possible.
Evelyn Mulwray: The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Jake Gittes: They do in Chinatown.There's also a snappy bit when a hired thug asks Jake what happened to his nose, which Gittes' reply is a bit too crass to share here, but it's dynamite. And the casting of ""Chinatown"" is perfect! The part of Jake Gittes was written for Nicholson and he is spot on! Faye Dunaway gives what I would argue is her strongest and most complex of performance. John Huston has his most menacing of role as the powerful Noah Cross, while oozing his John Huston charm to disarm those around him. Supporting players are just as strong, including Perry Lopez, John Hillerman, Diane Ladd (mother of Laura Dern), Bruce Glover (father of Crispin Glover), James Hong, Noble Willingham, Rance Howard (father of Ron Howard), and Burt Young. It's a perfectly cast film to tell this story. Besides script and cast, the contributions by Polanski cannot be understated. Polanski forced Towne, against his wishes, to change the ending of the film to a much darker and cynical of one, which was more in line with Polanski's current world view following the horrific murder of his wife just a few years earlier. Besides the cynicism Polanski brought to the film, he also brought an outsiders sensibility to this most American of genres. It's a European's take on a very American type of picture and story. ""Chinatown"" has an elegance to it that was rarely present in most noir or detective pictures. ""Chinatown"" is west coast noir in vivic color, showing a world of dry river beds, sweaty brows under fedoras, and a parched 1930s Los Angeles. While this could have been a stark raw presentation, Polanski films the story with the same elegant camera moments he brought to ""Rosemary's Baby"" or even his earlier films, like ""Knife in the Water,"" as well as bring lush vivid tones that pop off of the screen in true old school Hollywood fashion. This brings me to the production design work by Richard Sylbert (""The Manchurian Candidate"" ""The Graduate"" ""Rosemary's Baby"" ""Carlito's Way""), who I'd argue is the finest production designed to have ever worked in film. Sylbert brings not just authenticity to the time and place, he brings a color palette of browns and yellows that emphasize the dry barren setting, complimenting the themes of the story, bringing both realism and beauty to the picture. Overall, ""Chinatown"" stands as a masterpiece of cinema and among the finest films every made. The talent in front of and behind the camera were at the peak of their talents and all the pieces landed perfectly into place. This was the final film that Polanski made in the United States before fleeing to France to avoid statutory rape charges and I would argue none of his subsequent films ever reached this pinnacle. The same could be said for the other talent involved, who have all made many fine subsequent films, but ""Chinatown"" stands out as unique and as one of greatest films ever grace world cinema. FUN FACT! Jane Fonda turned down the role of Evelyn Mulwray. BONUS FUN FACT! Polanski was hired after Peter Bogdanovich turned down the film, which he later said he regretted.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Feel strongly then do something!,"Jake Gittes is a former cop turned private detective. When he is contracted by a Mrs Mulwray to find out if her husband is having an affair, he takes to trailing Water Company Executive Hollis Mulwray. Mulwray appears to only have water and a dry riverbed on his mind but eventually they catch him with a young woman, although almost immediately the news gets leaked to the papers and Mulwray goes missing, only to turn up dead. At this point the real Mrs Mulwray comes to Gittes threatening to sue him for his involvement and Jake realises that he had been set up to set up the Mulwrays. He continues his investigation into the murder only to find a conspiracy involving thousands of gallons of water being wasted during a drought and the mysterious presence of Mrs Mulwray's father, Noah Cross.As a fan of film noir and tough detective movies, I am too often put off by modern entries into the genre that try to replace atmosphere and intelligence by just having nudity and swearing; the genre managed atmosphere without these in the forties and fifties but yet modern films seem to rely on them. With Chinatown however, everything works well as a homage to the best years of the genre and, as such, is very well set in the period and is of suitable presentation even if the material and tone is darker and harder than would have been allowed years ago. This is not to say it is just a copy and paste from better films because it isn't and indeed stands out as one of the best detective noirs I have seen in ages. The plot is always going to be the most important thing and it gets it spot on throughout, doing the proper thing of starting with a simple story and continually building it more and more complex as it goes. Unlike some other ""classics"" of the genre, Chinatown manages to do this without ever losing the audience and I found the plot to be both rewardingly complex but yet still very easy to follow.Needless to say, things are very dark and the script is convincingly dark and miserable, leading to an ending that is as depressing as I've seen – not so much in what actually happens but also in the wider implications for the characters that the credits prevent us from seeing. Director Polanski does a great job of putting this story in a lush setting that produces a real strong sense of period but also manages to always be showing us the darkness coming through subtly throughout the movie. Of course it helps that he also has a great cast to work with. Jack Nicholson is iconic in this role and, if I had to pick one film to act as an introduction to Nicholson then it would be this one. He is tough yet damaged, upright but seedy and he brings out his complex character well. Dunaway has less screen time but is just as impressive with a similarly dark role. Huston adds class and manages to ooze menace while also coming across as a harmless old man. The support cast are all fine but really the film belongs to these three, with Nicholson being the stand out role.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Roman Polanski's Caustic Neo-Noir is So Compelling that ""You Can't Forget It""!","It's Los Angeles, 1937. Jack Nicholson's private detective Jake J. Gittes is not a primal masculine archetype, but rather a complicated protagonist. Far from cool and collected, he is simply self- possessed, with a sense of control that's highly illusory and much of the film pivots on undercutting his misplaced self-confidence. The film immediately establishes his less-than-ideal persona via his work snapping pictures of adulterous spouses, a lowbrow form of detective work that is typically beneath the more admirable private eyes. He's looked down on by the law and treated as something of a sordid but necessary evil by his clients, but Jake realizes that's just how the game is played. Soon enough, though, one of those clients, a mysterious woman named Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray finds a way to use Jake's scurrilous reputation to set him up for a fall. His ensuing attempts to clear his name put him on the trail of a case that's bigger, more complex and wide-ranging than anything he's used to, coming up with more rot than he bargained for. One that goes, as they say, all the way to the top!A convoluted mystery that begins with a visit from a femme-fatale, an ironclad cynical detective with a code of honor, and a spider- like villain weaving a web at the center of the story are all familiar elements of a hard-boiled detective film. But trust Roman Polanski to make disillusionment seductive and resurrect the almost dead format! What he does so brilliantly in Chinatown is import the soul-sick paranoia of 1930s Los Angeles into its depiction: the eponymous Chinatown is less of a physical presence than a state of mind - it's a lurid fantasy, an idea that hovers constantly around the fringes of the movie making it an ultimately intangible maelstrom of deceit, regret and confusion in which the only thing you can be sure of is that everything you know is - to one degree or another - wrong. Robert Towne's labyrinthine script keeps the proceedings thrilling, humorous and disturbing at the same time, pepped up greatly by the crackling dialogues.The film also boasts career best turns from its star-cast led by Jack Nicholson, who is absolutely charismatic as Jake Gittes, as we find ourselves solve the mystery alongside him as he follows lead after lead through a labyrinth of sticky situations. His Gittes is a layered character and Nicholson makes his depth visible to the audience. Faye Dunaway's vulnerability constantly tempts us with the notion that she is the victim, rather than the villain, in a performance that still has the power to shock. Outright villainy is instead embodied by Noah Cross, an incredibly vile portrayal by John Huston. He gives Noah a false air of courtly manners that, if anything, only adds to the character's sense of debauchery.Notoriously bleak, yet utterly compelling, Chinatown remains a magnificent dissection of corruption right up to its enigmatic finale. The brute force of its ugly truth is the heart of the film's artistry, and it sticks with us. And it might be just a state of mind, but Chinatown still retains the power to bruise and scar to this day.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Staring a young 30 something Jack Nicholson as a private investigator hired to spy on a local councilman by her husband suspected of having an affair when all is not as it seems that sends the PI down a rabbit hole to uncover seedy corruption and scandals galore. I wanted to score this higher but the runtime really made it feel like a drag. Overly bloated and stretched out way too much to make it appear as a slow burn but it was just too slow at times for me. But the acting, music and twists were pretty solid.

"A Dark, Twisted Trailblazer","A film that is more talked about than seen these days, Chinatown is nonetheless one of the most significant films ever made, and it sits at a unique precipice in cinematic culture. Starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and somewhat hilariously, John Huston, it is the story of a private investigator sent to snoop on a cheating husband only to later find that husband turned up dead, setting off a chain of events that leads to the top being blown off a major conspiracy that runs deep into the roots of early 20th century Los Angeles.   It's a shame that the only part of the film the average film-goer knows about is the most famous line, ""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown."" That's a wonderful line, but out of context, what does it mean? Nothing. You could guess or even infer, but unless you've seen the film, it might as well be sitting out on an island. Even you know the general plot of the film, as I did before watching it, you don't get the full impact of the line.Film quotes stick in the meat of popular culture not just because they're fun to stay or because they role off the tongue, but because they're built up to beautifully and because they hit with a force that sums up the emotions of the moment. Quoting them only works if those present know the film itself. Imagine how absurd it would sound to say, ""May the Force be with you,"" to someone who's never seen Star Wars. They would get the gist of what you're saying, but they wouldn't get the reference or the connotations.The ""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown"" line works much the same way. There are situations when it would be appropriate to say this, but there's no point if no one in your party has seen Chinatown. For those who have, that line conjures up so much rage, frustration, despair, cynicism and tragedy. It carries a lot of weight.Neo-noir films are rarely happy affairs (the word noir even means black in French), but this film goes the extra mile. Back in 1974, the neo-noir film was rare. Traditional noir films had not been popular for some several decades, and even those were limited were the Hays Code and the culture of the time. This was a new animal altogether, and so as the film gets darker and the situation more disturbing, you end up feeling as revolted as Jack by the end. When the last night falls and you see the lights of Chinatown for the first time, you feel like you've come the end of an exhilarating, hideous, psychotic day and want it all to be swept away.A lot of influences went into this film. There were old school noir influences, of course, but there were also influences from the then-cutting edge crime films of the day, as well as the psychological thrillers that had started to proliferate in the late 60's and early 70's. There are also literary influences; I was surprised to learn this was not based off a novel. It is very much a novelist's film.But the most startling influence is that of Westerns. This works in two ways. First, the film takes place close to the turn of the century, a time not too far away from the settings of Westerns. The dark, cynical Westerns this film is most like took place in the 1880's, in the twilight of the West, after the land had been tamed. Second, the noir film had- at least from an American perspective- grown out of the Western: many of the same ideas, concepts, and perspectives are present. The noir was 'replaced' by the second wave of Westerns that came up during the 50s and 60's: Sergio Leone and like. In the 70's, the Western was in a Golden Age. Heaven's Gate had not yet come out. The genre was booming. America still had use for it, particularly in an era when we as a people were feeling rather lost and alone. Chinatown is neo-noir springing up from the second wave of Westerns, just like that second wave sprang up from original noir flicks.The characters and acting in this film are first class, and despite some strange choices here and there, the plot pulls you in deeper into its black heart. This is a mystery in the truest sense of the word. There are so many layers to pull back in the seedy L.A. streets, so many secrets to carve out. The titular Chinatown is used to great effect, first as an idea, then as a place. The characters, particularly Nicolson, are perfectly cast.This is a film that puts its competition to shame. It digs its claws into you and doesn't take them out. It's a definite must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A timeless movie,"Whenever I add a moderately old must-see movie on my watch list, I already know it will take some months before I find the courage to press the stat button.
There is always a subconscious feeling that the movie will be outdated or even boring.
Chinatown was no exception and followed the same fate.
After a year of hesitation I can finally admit ""what a fool I have been"".
It's a movie that cannot undermine the passage of time.
The story may be slow, but definitely not boring or without an intelligent twist. The acting is impeccable - Jack Nicholson is/was definitely not an ordinary actor...

"""It's a flaw--in the iris...""","Seminal classic of '70s cinema, with Jack Nicholson excellent as a mostly-ethical former cop-turned-private detective in 1930s Los Angeles who believes he's been hired by the wife of the chief engineer of the Water and Power Department; she thinks her husband's cheating on her but, as it turns out, she's not the real Mrs. at all, and so propels Nicholson's Jake ""J.J."" Gittes into a tug-of-war between powerful ex-partners, with carnality and family secrets the key to unraveling the mystery. Oscar-winning screenplay by Robert Towne (who also penned the 1990 extension, ""The Two Jakes"") is filled with complicated story threads and characters with chequered pasts--lots of fun, though it is somewhat unfair the script is always two steps ahead of the audience (it would be nearly impossible for a first-time viewer to solve this case on his own; Towne sets up the game and ends up solving it for the rest of us). However, the picture is so deftly orchestrated by director Roman Polanski, one becomes engrossed in the proceedings even while being bombarded with both clues and extraneous matter. Faye Dunaway's performance, as the breathy, mysterious daughter of water-czar John Huston, walks a fine line between melodramatic and campy--still, she's entirely in the spirit of the piece, and an interesting screen-match for Nicholson. The film is assured and entertaining; it pulls the viewer in without giving out enough information concerning the milieu, though this lack of knowledge for our sake doesn't hurt the returns. A cannier, guessing-game approach to the plot may have made the film more commercial (it was a modest box-office hit); however, this presentation, messy though it may be, is still arresting. Repeat viewings are a must. *** from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A text book example of screenwriting,"""Chinatown"" is often sited as one of the best written films of all time. Screenwriting classes use this script to teach students. How right they are. Robert Towne's mystery is a complicated, thought provoking thriller that never loses the viewer even when you think you may not know what is happening. Everything is explained beautifully.Jack Nicholson stars as private eye Jake Gittes who gets thrown into a mystery that deepens into a whole lot more then he bargained for. Faye Dunaway plays the femme fatale who has deep secrets of her own. Dunaway has never looked better then here and the chemistry between her and Nicholson is subtle, yet dead on.The real star of this film is Towne's dialogue. The opening scene is indicative of how great it is. A man looks at pictures of his wife with another man. He collapses against the window in tears almost threatening to rip the blinds down. Nicholson has seen it all before. He remains calm and cool. He looks at the anguished man and, without blinking, says ""You can't eat the venetian blinds Curly. I just had them installed Wednesday.""The look of ""Chinatown"" is one of pure beauty. Had director Roman Polanski shot in black and white it might have been even more effective in evoking the period. Let me also mention the fine supporting performance of director John Huston as Dunaway's father with some deep secrets of his own.But the real star of this movie is the script. It's a pleasure to just listen to the words. And it becomes more pleasurable with each viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best noir thriller ever,"I watched this movie recently for the first time and I'm 26 (I know, shame on me). I didn't know anything about it and didn't even read the cover of the DVD, so it came as a surprise to me. Well, it's an amazing thriller with very good acting all along. First of all, Jack Nicholson portraits a great character, very different from the types we got used to see him playing later on. John Houston is also very believable in a role that could have easily turned into a stereotype. The LA setting in the '30s is very suggestive, and Polanski's direction follows the story with a objective eye that suits the film perfectly.

3.22.2024,"You are not gonna expect any iconic intertwined sleight in Polanski's films and that's why it bored me a little in the middle of the plot, a corrupted, inane, sporadic shady LA, interminably shown by rambling Jack Nicholson and poor, sacrificed Faye Dunaway.In fact you shall take a deeper look in his handle of a script by Robert Towns. Soon you might discover it's more beguiling than Polanski's part in it. Perhaps in some ways, Polanski's beautiful twisted delible cinematography (the okay lighting, okay composition, okay spiritual framing) is the best way of elucidate the comedic Jack Nicholson and Faye Runaway, he let them, the characters by Robert Townes, alive and informative. In this brilliant end (he holds up the story, and left it over, tramping, but transient), we have to admit that how those characters are so vivid and unforgettable.The most astonishing cinema came from these brave, incantatory temperaments of characters fighting against incestuous, phallocentric systems.

Elegantly expressed film noir,"Roman Polanski is one of those directors I just don't trust, much like Lars Von Trier. Controversial, reclusive, scary and you never know what kind of freaky surprise element they're about to present in one of their films. I realise this is not entirely fair but Polanski has just always freaked me out like hell--his attitude, his style. Well, Chinatown is his masterpiece and in spite of its initial controversy in the 1970s, I find it to be one of the 'safer' and more enjoyable films he has directed. This has a lot to do with the presence of Jack Nicholson who adds such a light-hearted, humorous tone to his performance, and it helps make Chinatown more colourful than the average film noir.Nicholson is in fact wonderfully cocky--like James Bond without the campy one-liners--in a way that only he can be, and he brings this attitude to his character private detective Jake Gittes. He is hired by a woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray to spy on her husband, but there is a misunderstanding and suddenly the real Mrs Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) demands that Gittes drop the case immediately. Going against his better judgement, Gittes decides to pursue the investigation anyway and soon is on his way to unlock conspiracies, corruption and murders in the city of L.A.Chinatown is film noir but it is sprinkled and enriched with colour and some truly spectacularly detailed set designs that capture the elegance of the 1940s America. The cast's performances also enrich the film, in particular Jack Nicholson. The only real flaw in the film is its occasionally extremely slow pace. Normally I wouldn't consider this a flaw, but in Chinatown it almost gets to the point when you stop being involved in the plot because it's moving so slowly. But if you ever get bored, you could always feast your eyes on the gorgeous backgrounds and style.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The power of chinatown communication,"""Chinatown"" is not the most beloved, best-known, or most remembered of the films, but ironically, it is one of the most important films of the 70's, ""chinatown"" is not a kind film, and it's not even the best movie of Polanski, but his narrative capacity is absurd, even to this day there is a maxim in entertainment that is not true, that all the stories have already been told, it is up to the interlocutor to tell them in different ways, and that is precisely what this movie does, inspired by the great noir films of the 1940s, it is not a novelty, and at the same time it is unlike anything we have seen, such as ""the unforgivable"" of '92 is the last great act of the western genre in cinema - even out of season, ""chinatown"" does the same thing with the noair genre. The great point that draws attention to ""chinatown"" is his script, he is completely magnificent, I would say, which is a complete synthesis of the perfection of how to script a movie, in 2 hours we have complete development of all the characters, we have a simple plot which gains layers of depth every minute, we have problems that mix with the city, turning into a political and social plot while bringing a classic story of a detective full of twists, who at one point surrenders to the cliché, but then surprises the all showing that in ""chinatown"" there are no spaces for the obvious. The film touches on such as love, police, ethics, society, organized crime, rape, nothing in a very deep way but also nothing is shallow, it gives the introduction to the theme, and the viewer who links the dots, alias, ""chinatown"" is a film that has to be seen and reviewed to be able to connect the points in a more satisfactory way, and to have a broad and complete notion of its history, which is not easy to understand in the first one visited during the film. With a great photo, extremely clear and brings new york life together with an assembly that joins the script to bring a great rhythm to the film, and a soundtrack that combines but is not marked in technical parts, the film has no much to criticize, is not perfect, but is not far behind the artistic part of the film, part that brings jack nicholson who is incredibly in a centered role, and alias, doing a great performance, and the stunning Faye Dunaway, who we love and hate her throughout the film, and she makes the whole story run around her, and she succeeds in behaving like the guiding thread of the script, interpreting many facets.

Although, I watched Chinatown just last weekend and I already forgotten nearly everything about it. It's so slow, that I lost the gist of the what story is even about. The storyline is just too convoluted. It is too dialogue heavy. Had the dialog been interesting, I could forgive that. The setting of Chinatown is the 1930s and it feels like it was filmed in the 30s. There are lot of 30s clichés. There's some suspense and ironic twists. But overall just too bland and boring. It's hard to believe Polanski directed this, because it has little in common with his other films such as Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby, or The Tenant.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Pinnacle of how to Write a Great Script,"What we have here today is truly a powerhouse of a film. Chinatown is a drama about a private investigator Jake (Jack Nicholson) who gets hired by a Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) because she believes her husband is having an affair. Jake quickly gets to work, but when Mr. Mulwray turns up dead and Evelyn not possibly actually being Evelyn, the movie starts messing with you in the best possible way.Before I discuss anything further, I have to talk about the script. It's truly amazing just how good the writing is. It kills me not to discuss any spoilers, and I won't, but you learn just the right amount of details from every scene as the depth to the complexity of the story and the characters slowly unwinds in metaphorical wonder. If there aren't classes that already do this, then scriptwriting classes should always point to this movie when discussing how to essentially write a perfect script. No joke, as experienced of a writer I am, this script is almost as well-written as these reviews.Anyways, Roman Polanski directs this film, and one of his most notable contributions is the tone. The dude had a rough past, especially with where they shot the film, and admittedly this is a formula that does not equal out to a rainbow and smiles kind of movie. And this has got to be the most normal character Jack Nicholson has ever played, and the best thing to say is that it's just a joy to watch an actor take the protagonist and make it his own. The supporting cast shines-I shouldn't even have to say it, but this obviously includes the brilliantly complex performance from Faye Dunaway.Obviously, the most famous line is the one I reference in the title; however, that's not actually my favorite line of the film. What's so much fun is that I actually can't tell you what it is because it'd be too much of a spoiler, so all I will say is that the line is a big reveal I did not by any means expect in the latter half of the movie. It's some deep subject matter, and I say with a smirk that you have to watch the film to understand what I'm talking about.I understand that some movies I review and recommend will not exactly put you in a good mood after watching them... And yeah, this movie isn't different. But if you're prepared for a slow-burner that will shock and entertain you (but not put a smile on your face), then watch Chinatown. Well, that's all from me.

"They should built a shrine for this classic, so that every cinephile can worship it every day in honor of its brilliance...","Every movie lover knows about the brilliance of Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"". If you are reading these reviews you havent seen it yet, which positions you in a place at the gates of heaven. You have not entered heaven yet, but you will once you decide to walk through the gates and watch ""Chinatown"". I am rather jealous of you, because the first time is special, although the great thing about movies is, that the most wonderful stories CAN be relived time and again. ""Chinatown¨ is up there with the all time greatest movies of american cinema history. The absolute pinnacle of genius.That must be enough praise to get you curious. My real advice would be not to read any further. Not my review, nor anyone elses. I just wanted to make sure with my first paragraph that you wont make the unforgivable mistake of passing this movie by. You havent lived without having seen ""Chinatown""...The story takes place in L. A. in the thirties, in the middle of a period of drought there is a big conflict about how to get more water to the city. A previous water reservoir had collapsed and killed 500 innocent L. A. citizens and now they plan to built another one with the same faults that were present in the earlier disaster. Enter Jack Nicholson as a private investigator who at first gets an assignment that seemingly has nothing to do at all with this disaster which cost so many people's lives. He just has to research if a husband is cheating on his wife. What seems like an innocent and tedious job, soon becomes a life threatening case, when Jack Nicholson finds out more than he is supposed to know about the powers that be, that want to build this risky dam, come hell or high water...The story truly is very intelligent, suspenseful and emotionally devastating and has won many awards. The number of awards is mindboggling so I wont start listing them here, but it suffices to say that everything, and I truly mean everything, could be and has been awarded about this movie. I just want to restrain myself, in order to limit the length of this review. No I cant. I just GOT TO mention some of the things that mesmirized me:The acting. Let's start with that. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway and John Huston truly play the roles of their lives. Images so pure and intense that I can see them by just mentioning the name ""Chinatown"". The photography by John A. Alonzo (Scarface) is breathtaking. Almost every scene is shot in the magic hours, when the sun rises or sets and delivers shadows and golden colors that only last for some 30 minutes every day. All the images are bathing in this glow of early sunset. Almost every scene could be a poster, that is how gorgeous the photography is.The music score by Jerry Goldsmith, is simply out of this world. With a minimum of instruments he creates another ""leading role"", because his music is intertwined with the very heart of this movie. Yes, his music score is so powerful and sublime that it is unimaginable to think of ""Chinatown"" without these dissonant piano string chords and gorgeous dreamlike trumpet themes. Jerry Goldsmith's music scores are still being used today, many years after his passing.We have to humbly thank director Roman Polanski for his genius in bringing all these talents together and creating something which will be seen by generations to come. In a time capsule of movie history Roman Polanski's masterpiece will shine as a star among the very greatest that American cinema has ever achieved!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""To tell you the truth, I lied a little""","I have mixed feelings about this film, and I'm sure many people will either love or hate this movie, for I sit roughly in the middle.Firstly the film is slow-paced but carefully calculated. You won't find much action, but the rather drawn-out drama that unfolds steadily throughout the movie. The film's score is brilliant however in certain scenes when Jack Gittes speaks, I found his voice is pitched quite low when intertwined with the background sounds of the film, and it can make some of his dialogue quite hard to hear even with the volume up.The film starts with an entertaining notion. Jack Nicholson, as private eye Jack Gittes makes a living out of exposing adultery. The story delves deeper into a much bigger crime with many different parties involved in both corruption and scandal. The character development is heavily drawn out giving the story a very realistic, and emotional connection.The ending is what it is. Love it or hate it. When the film finished, I was left feeling disappointment and a lot of resentment. My thoughts were firmly set that there should have been some justification for all the wrongs and crimes committed in the film.For many reasons this film is iconic and a classic with an outstanding twist, but for just some moments it falls a little flat, and maybe for that reason it doesn't deserve the outstanding reputation it receives.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the great films of all time,"It may sound a little dramatic to call this one of the great films but I genuinely believe it to be true. I have been going to the movies for over 40 years and I can't think of any way that Chinatown could be improved or made better. I first saw it 25 years ago but watched it yesterday on TV and was again overwhelmed by how good it is. The other thing worth mentioning is that it has hardly dated at all. Certainly Jack Nicholson looks younger than we're all used to seeing him these days (me and him both!) but because the story is set in the 1930s, it could have been made yesterday. The cast, the locations, the script, the direction, the dialogue, the photography and that evocative score are all pretty much perfect.

Chinatown,"Isolation, corruption of police, turning a profit on natural resources, each issue is tackled in brilliant form in the 1974 film by Roman Polanski. Dealing with his own internal turmoil near the time of filming, Polanski opted not for the happy ending screenwriter Robert Towne wanted and fought for, but instead the brutality of real life. Sometimes people die who are not supposed to, and oftentimes, things don't work out as they should and people are worse off than they began. I'm a humanist and a fan of humanistic films (I'm gazing at you, Francois Truffaut) so I appreciate when a film forgoes the ending tying everything up with a bow and opts for the realism that often leaves life less neat than we would like. Chinatown takes place in Los Angeles in 1937 where J.J. Gittes, a private eye is hired to find out if a husband is cheating on his wife. Jake soon realizes he is tailing a powerful man and gets pulled into a web of money and politics he could never have anticipated. Starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and legendary John Huston, Chinatown is a perfect neo-noir, so perfect in fact that lines are often blurred and the film is often referred to as a noir rather than a neo-noir. Chinatown came out over 40 years ago in one of the very best years of American cinema and has persisted as a pinnacle of cinematic art.J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private eye in L.A. who usually handles cases regarding philandering spouses and uses any means necessary to close his cases. Gittes also gains most of his business via what's printed about him in the newspapers, so he's no stranger to bringing publicity upon himself. Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) seeks the help of Gittes due to her fear that her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling) is having an affair. Hollis is the Commissioner and Chief Engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power which means he has quickly become one of the most powerful and influential politicians in the area due to the chronic drought experienced in the Los Angeles area. Gittes doesn't let Mulwray get too far away from him following him as he attends commission meetings and to various reservoirs, aqueducts, dams and waterways. Jake does eventually snap a photo of Hollis Mulwray with another woman. When the story makes the front page of the paper, Gittes is visited by the real Mrs. Mulwray threatening to sue Gittes. With his reputation at stake, Gittes is eager to talk to the real Mr. Mulwray but the Mulwrays are reluctant to talk to him until Mrs. Mulwray finally talks to Gittes and agrees to drop the lawsuit. When Gittes is persistent in speaking to Hollis, Evelyn finally suggests that Gittes tries to locate him at the Oak Pass at Stone Canyon Reservoir. Gittes does find him there, along with the police as he has been killed. Evelyn covers for Jake being at the reservoir so he is not implicated in Hollis's murder. Jake's interest in Evelyn has been piqued, and she is strongly drawn to him, as well. The relationship between the pair grows and leads them down roads of scandal and corruption Jake could have never imagined.From the beginning, Chinatown is a perfect noir. From the font of the credits to the emanating score, Chinatown proves its roots in neo- noir. Polanski's brilliant direction is clear from the beginning as he pays brilliant homage to classic noir films with his apt camera work. There is a zoom shot into the rear-view mirror of Jakes car that is the stuff dreams are made of. We also see a brilliant shot through a pair of binoculars Jake is gazing through creating a captivating view into Jake's work. The perfectly haunting score throughout the film is only eclipsed by the brilliant flawless camera movement. Dunaway leaves no doubt that she is the film's siren as she clumsily reaches for a cigarette only to be reminded by Jake that she's ""already got one going"". The screenplay is incredible, and the interactions between characters are truly divine to experience. John Huston, screen legend, is intensely engaging in his role as land baron Noah Cross. Despite the biblical inspiration of his name, Noah seeks to keep water from surrounding land in order to irrigate it and sell the land he buys at a reduced rate; Huston encapsulates an evil in the guise of overt niceness like no one else could have done. The isolation and loneliness of Gittes are the film's shining takeaway. Reminiscent, probably, of the isolation director Roman Polanski felt just before he fled the country, Gittes is always searching for truth, but even when he finds it, nothing can be done because corruption rules the city. Gittes is no angel, of course, often employing illegal means to close his cases, really drives home the idea that the world is full of gray areas and we are but mere pawns to a system few of us get to actively participate in.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

As close to perfection as you can come.,"With the possible exception of CASABLANCA, this my all-time favorite movie. I am a big fan of the genre (Phillip Marlowe, Sam Spade . . . you get the idea).  Jake Gittes is a really great character and I couldn't imagine anyone else BUT Jack Nicholson playing him.  In fact, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the whole cast as their characters (including Polanski). CHINATOWN can hold its own along with such classics as THE BIG SLEEP, FAREWELL MY LOVELY (or MURDER MY SWEET) and THE MALTESE FALCON. I remember reading that writer Towne and director Polanski fought over the ending.  I'd have to say that Polanski, though still reeling from the murder of wife Sharon Tate, had the right idea.  I could not imagine this film having a happy ending.  It certainly wouldn't have been as memorable. I was surprised that John Huston wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance as evil incarnate. Noah Cross is truly one of the cinema's greatest villains.

Slow-burning Classic; truly one of the best films.,"A strange, one-off film this one. A re-entry to the film noir genre twenty-five years on for Hollywood, that refines and extends the scope of the genre. Certainly up there with ""The Third Man"", ""Touch of Evil"" and ""Rear Window"" in the suspense and mystery stakes; ""Chinatown"" contains so much depth under the surface, and detail, that you'll feel cheated by the mediocrity of today's Hollywood output. A truly impressive script, coupled with vivid, disciplined direction from the skilled Roman Polanski, and ornate photography create a masterful, tangible atmosphere of rich dread. The performances rise to the occasion without being too OTT; Nicholson is a fine, laconic Gittes, Faye Dunaway is just right for this role; she has the right mixture of cold aloofness and tangible sensuality. Of course, the ""She's my sister..."" scene is wonderfully delivered by the wrought Dunaway. Ah yes, and John Huston, who has comparitively minimal screen time, makes a startling impression as Noah Cross; a thoroughly baneful figure. There is so much to savour in this masterpiece for those who can take in it at the correct, languid but progressive pace. The whole look of the film is immensely attractive and the dialogue is clever and often witty. On top of that, it is a serious film about moral and personal decadence, with the viewer left both doleful and exhilarated. The final scene is excellent, with a wonderful closing line, and direction to the close. One of the most ingenious, intoxicating of all films. Rating:- *****/*****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
1974 is rocked by the writing achievement in Chinatown,"As I wrote the title to this post, the year ""1974"" flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I ""convinced"" myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid.My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in ""hammy"" scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life.Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also.Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing.Finally, what makes Chinatown ""Chinatown"".....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past.Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me.Rating: 9.5/10Grade: A",,Anonymous,Mystery
Forget it Jake. It's Chinatown.,"""Chinatown"" directed by the French-Polish director Roman Polanski (Rosemary's Baby) and (The Pianist) is a very good crime-thriller about detective Jake Gittes that starts a new case that doesn't seem so complicated at first, but after several weird situations, a bigger case is beginning, were murder, lies and more lies gets involved. Jake Gittes goes through the twisted crime and it isn't that easy. Polanski knew exactly how to make great suspense. With the thrilling music, great sound effects and building up action, nothing could have been better. Some things could have been better though, but more about that later. Jack Nicholson is very good at adapting Gittes, he puts in the thinking mind of a detective, as well as the great personality he develops. Gittes mysterious past isn't touched to much in the film, and that was my first argue. I could understand he had a complicated backstory, but at least it could tell more about it, get something more that could make the plot even more interesting. Secondly I just think the film is a little overrated. Because there is the case (That is very good) and the building suspense, as well as very good action sequences to make it more interesting, but it missed that little something. Perhaps something about the ending. You know, I really liked the last dialogue: ""Forget it Jake. It's Chinatown"" as they walk away from the crime scene and the screen fades out, but still, the case didn't felt totally complete (I won't spoil so I won't tell) and I think that was the thing that let the rating down a little. And then comes the technicals. The montage and camera filming was ok, and the costume designs were great! It gave me really the detective film atmosphere, and that is something I have to boast about. So summarizing, Chinatown was a good crime-thriller, some parts could be better than others, but the positives are very dominating here, and I think 7/10 will be the best rating I can give.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A solid addition to film noir,"Chinatown excellently employs color contrasts, masterful use of shadows, and intriguing reflection shots. The cinematography and the meticulously written detective story highlight this movie as unmistakably noir. It is missing a few noir elements such as unusual camera angles and intricately colorful dialogue, but it's still a smooth and refreshing addition.One complaint is the relatively impassive characters. Nearly every character has something to hide, so they act as reserved as possible. It's understandable, but it does make the movie a little tedious when the audience is expected to care about the facts without caring for any of the people involved. Noir films usually have the main character toeing the line between likable and unlikable, while staying emotionally detached as possible, solely focused on unraveling the mystery. Nicholson (Jake Gittes) gives a smooth and flawless performance in this role. He deserves praise for this film, but the rest of the reserved cast leaves a bit to be desired.*Potential spoilers below*Another complaint lies in the conclusion, which doesn't feel adequately resolved. The only ones who can explain the situation are dismissed. The ending sequences makes it seem as if the detectives on the case have no interest in the truth and have a vested interest in letting crimes go unpunished. It's likely that the truth will come out in court, but the presentation of the conclusion leaves a sour taste for no apparent reason.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes.","Chinatown is not so much a movie as it is an experience. To date, it is probably my favorite film. I've always enjoyed film noir, especially the old Bogart films. Chinatown draws strongly from that tradition, but comes from a European director's (Polanski) perspective. The film is highly stylized and seems to draw the classic old detective formula perfectly into the downbeat, sometimes depressing, but artistic style of the 1970s.The story is that Jake Gittes (Nicholson) is an LA private investigator hired by Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray to investigate whether her husband, the head of Water and Power for the city, is having an affair. Mulwray is already the subject of controversy due to his reluctance to build a new dam during a city water shortage. After Gittes uncovers what appears to be an affair, the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes forward and sues Gittes. Gittes quickly tries to persuade her that he was set up and wants to warn Mulwray. However, before he can do so, Mulwray is found dead at a reservoir. Mrs. Mulwray hires Gittes to investigate her husband's death after he convinces her that her husband was murdered.I really enjoyed the interplay between the actors. Nicholson and Dunaway play very well off of each other, but John Huston, who plays Noah Cross, gives a fantastic performance. Mr. Cross is Evelyn's father who hires Gittes to find Mulwray's girlfriend. Huston walks a fine line perfectly of being both charming and brutally dangerous at the same time. Throughout the film, Gittes has to evade goons trying to do him some harm over his investigation into Mulwray's murder and police Lieutentant Escobar (Perry Lopez) who he worked with in Chinatown. Escobar's demeanor towards Gittes definitely indicates that Gittes has a bad past. I also really enjoyed Roman Polanski's cameo as a knife wielding thug, which is a brief but memorable appearance for Gittes.The style of the film adds greatly to its effectiveness. Rather than use voice-over narration, as is often done in detective films, the audience discovers clues at the same time Gittes does. In addition, the richness of the plot keeps the viewer guessing, but does not get distracting as some detective films would. However, to really understand the title, you have to watch the whole film.This film was really a sleeper for everyone involved. Roman Polanski (director), Robert Towne (writer), and Robert Evans (producer) had prior to its release believed they had a colossal flop. However, the film came together beautifully. The cast was excellent, from the lead roles down to the extras. The direction was great and the story, although altered by Polanski from the original script, really put emphasized the downbeat nature of the subject material.This is a must watch for anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A must see noir,"There's a certain elegance that grabs you immediately with this movie. The cinematography is incredible but not showy. It follows the action but never chases it. I was endlessly struck with thought that they just don't make movies like this.After finally viewing this film it's not difficult to see the many movies that borrow from it. I immediately thought of Brick and so aspects of the Nice Guys.That aside, it's just a detective tale that is simple on the surface but once he starts scratching, it's ugly underneath. The 2 leads are excellent and seeing Jack Nicholson in his younger days I was reminded how hammy his performances have become. Faye Dunaway was perfect as well and I could easily forget she was in the Bye Bye Man last year.Not really much else to say other than if you haven't seen this movie, watch it asap.

It's one of the few Hollywood detective stories that I not only can sit through but can watch several times.  My theory is that good detective movies come around about every 20-30 years. Think about it: Maltese Falcon 1941, Chinatown 1974 and LA Confidential 1997.  They all share great actors, great directors and great writers.

A fault in her eye,"As the film scene takes place, one can almost hear the sound of a heartbreak, as the horn locks in place, and the main protagonist witnesses how fate has unfolded its dark wings. In this film noir gem by Roman Polanski, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway played so well together, one can't but flinch at the moment its resolution hits us. It's tragic, dark, unforgiving, and yet we can't look away.Robert Towne's flawless script takes us through one eye-opening experience after another. As we wonder whether any of the scenarios in the film were based on reality, or if it's all the work of a creative writer. Every player does his or her part to the best of his ability, doing justice to every line, every nuance, every tentacle that lurks in the midst of the corruption at the heart of the story. There are so many disturbing pieces, and they all fit perfectly.

multi-layered complexity - eternal appeal,"There is always more to ""Chinatown"" than meets the eye on the first viewing. Like the proverbial onion, one discovers more and more as one peels the outer layers.Jack Nicholson was first-rate as a private eye, and Dunaway provided sufficient support for the acting to be termed ""memorable"". That is till you consider John Huston. He was absolutely magnificent in his portrayal of a crooked father. And with Polanski directing the film with his usual aplomb, it comes up real trumps.The story is quite complex, but you never get the feeling that someone has gone over the board, as you often do with some of the other films of its genre. The tragic ending is chilling, and leaves you feeling vaguely bitter about our world. Nicholson's character makes you feel sad, but you never pity him.

Basically some tedious investigation drama with Jack Nicholson following up leads as to who killed a water company boss or something.

Hollywood at its best,"I know I'm stepping out on a limb here, but here goes: Chinatown is, in my opinion, the finest American film ever made. Yes, I know Citizen Kane and Casablanca are the top favorites of film historians, but I still hold my ground here. Superb in every aspect of film making -- acting, editing, direction, musical score, cinematography and on and on. Polanski captures the 1930's film noir in color, and pulls it off beautifully. Robert Towne's screenplay is used at the USC school of film making as an example of how to write. His work is simply astounding. Nicholson gives his finest performance -- even better than his superb offering in On Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. His Jake Gittes character is at the same time cynical and sympathetic. Dunaway has never been more mysterious, Huston has never been more ominous, and every supporting member of the cast is perfection personified. The closest any film maker has come to capturing such a mood and theme since has been the fine work of L A Confidential. Even if you don't like period pieces, mysteries, private eyes and conspiracy films, this movie deserves your accolades as an example of how films can and should be produced.

finest ever screenplay to emerge from Hollywood,"Robert Townes scripts probably the finest ever screenplay to emerge from Hollywood, once again reaffirming America's choke hold on the summit of film. An unforgettable narrative achievement that gives us something different every time we have the pleasure of sitting down and re-watch Roman Polanski's (Rosemary's Baby) seminal noir pastiche to the 30's made popular by the like of the Maltese Falcon, but still in its own rights; Polanski architects a detective film masterpiece. It was even placed 3rd greatest screenplay of all time, by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) amongst such titles as Casablanca, The Godfather and Anne Hall, which arguably I feel is the greatest of them all. Starring Jack Nicholson in what I believe to be a career defining performance, even surpassing his Oscar winning exploits with One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and even his ever chilling performance in The Shining. Chinatown starts off as just another mundane detective TV drama, as a distraught wife; appear in Jake Gittes office requesting a private eye to solidify her suspicions of her husband's infidelity.But just like in life, nothing is ever what it seems, and just like life, Chinatown is as unpredictable as the English weather, as from that moment in the office, we suddenly swept up in a whirlwind of excitement, tensions, laughs and shocks; as we find ourselves in a ever engulfing circle, consisting of millionaire corruption, murder, sheep, farmers. But when you thought that was it we sprinkled in some incest and water scandals for good measure. As we are placed side by side with Jake on his roller coaster ride through kicks to the head, cuts to the nose and a steamy love affair with a woman Fane Dunaway also from Bonnie and Clyde) who may just be the key to his eventual downfall, helping in laying down the foundation to one of the most ironic ends in film history.They said Michelangelo had a hard time painting the sixteenth carpel in a lifetime; imagine trying to keep a piece of art like Chinatown in a review of 500 words or less, now that is a miracle. Because Chinatown is a magnificent cinematic and technical achievement that may never again be rivalled in American cinema. The film is so good, I feel that it should be compulsive watching in all film schools for all young writers and directors with dreams of a career in the film – actually better yet forget film school, just sit at home and watch Chinatown, that's the only film education you really need.

A classic thriller,"Chinatown is easily recognised as a classic film, being one of Jack Nicholson and Roman Polanski's best films. This film came from a golden age of American age and can easily hold it's own against other classics from that period.Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator in 1930s Los Angeles in the middle of a drought. He is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Diane Ladd) to follow her husband, the Chief Engineer of the city's Power and Water Department, who she suspects is having an affair. Gittes photographs with a young woman it gets leaked to the press. But the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) shows up in Gittes' office, threatening to sue him. Soon Gittes is thrown into a big mystery when Mr. Mulwray is found dead and Gittes uncovers a web involving the water department, real estate deals, political corruption and a dirty family secret.Chinatown has a film noir visual, style and storytelling but does not suffer the restrictions that though films had to go through. Robert Towne was deserving of his Oscar win for Best Screenplay, delivering a complex story, real characters and combined with the acting and subtle direction makes for a very compelling thriller. Polanski keeps the film going at a fast pace and it also feels episodic because of the way the narrative shows how Gittes solves the mystery and uncovers clubs. It could have worked as a TV miniseries, but of course it is a great film anyway. This is a film that is allowed to be a more darker with it storytelling, the type of story it can tell (particularly with the twist) and be able to show more violence.The acting is excellent, Nicholson is great playing a sleazy anti-hero who has a charm about him, willing to use underhand methods but still at heart not evil, a man with some morals and just wants to get his job done. Dunaway starts off as a confidence woman, who personae is slowly eroded as more of her past is revealed, starting with her change of personality because of the mention of her father. John Huston has a real sense of menace every time of he was on screen.Chinatown is a glorious looking film, from the cars, to the art direction and to the costumes. The simple score by Jerry Goldsmith is able to soak you into the story and everything had the feel of film noir, but with the twist of being alike a 70s thriller.

Welcome to Chinatown (You've Been Warned),"With ""Chinatown,"" Roman Polanski did for the detective crime genre what Todd Haynes did for the Douglas Sirk melodrama in ""Far from Heaven."" Polanski created something that was partly an homage to all of those delightfully atmospheric noirs of the 1940s, but went beyond that to deconstruct some of the genre's conventions. Rather than simply making a 1974 film that imitated a film noir from the 40s, Polanski instead made a 1940s film noir infused with the cultural demons of 1974 America.The plot is byzantine and confusing, as any good crime thriller plot should be. But true to the genre, the plot doesn't matter as much as the rotten underbelly of corruption and violence that the plot exposes. No director can do atmosphere (especially rotten atmosphere) as well as Polanski, and he's at his best here. Jack Nicholson gives maybe the best performance of his career as detective Jake Gittes, a hard-boiled seen-it-all tough guy who isn't quite tough enough for the nastiness he uncovers; Faye Dunaway is the elusive and beautiful object of his obsession; and John Huston gives a frightening performance as a monster in everyday clothing.

This movie should be on all top 10 lists of greatest movies of all-time!,"This neo-noir masterwork is a one of the most shocking, and haunting crime thrillers I've ever seen in my life. Chinatown Features terrific lead performances from the Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, enchanting cinematography, a flawless script, and an impeccable, and atmospheric direction that created a rising tension. In addition, Polanski's masterpiece is intense as it's cynical, and full of intelligent twists that keep us always guessing and trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle. I really cannot find enough words of praise. For issues...... wait a second, I have no issues with this gem, I just wanted think it would have been a bit better if our protagonist, Jake, found it a little more difficult as he was searching for some of the clues, yeah there are a lot of littles, bits, and somes here.

one of my favorite,"What happened to your nose Gittes? Somebody slam a bedroom window on it?Gittes: Nope,your wife got excited.She crossed her legs a little to quick. You understand what a mean pal?-Jake Gittes(Jack Nicholson in a memorable role) is a private detective in the late 30s This hero is a loner,righteous and witty,nothing seem to surprise him anymore but he is also a moralist who suffers in a perverse world. In one scene Gittes must defend his profession to another man saying that his job is honest and he's helping desperate people(Gittes specializes in investigations involving divorces and extra-marital affairs).The plot in Chinatown is complex,with sub-plots(the water scandal;a mysterious murder;a powerful old man and his daughter). Evelyn Mulwray(Faye Dunaway) appears and the mystery begins,Gittes is so intrigue and obsess by her that he needs to find out the true, is she a manipulator or a victim? She acts with ambiguity ;why is she so scared Of her father?.One of the must powerful scene is when Evelyn tell the truth to Gittes she confessed the identity of  the young girl:'she is my sister and my daughter! my father and I,'. The real plot in Chinatown is corruption in every aspects; is about the burden of a woman and her horrible secret.The true villain,Noah Cross(a superb John Huston)is a deceiver,perverse, powerful and even charismatic(hey!,Hitler was too)he is the epitome of evil.Chinatown has one of the must uncomfortable and unfair ending in cinema history,but in this case this ending was necessary and realistic(bad things happen to good people).

A thriller-flopperoo,"My opinion is that Mr Roman Polanski is one of the most prominent directors of our time.

I cannot mention a single thing, which I like about the movie. The movie just goes on and on and on, as if the director has nothing to say. As to me, I have certainly nothing good to say. I agree that it is a dark psychological drama but this film being on the top list is not right.It is also an unpleasant movie (not ultimately though). There exist much worse movies and that's why.. .

L.A. is more than just the City of Angels.,"The penetrating direction of Roman Polanski (ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE PIANIST) evaluates what would have been a standard, revisionist noir into one of the most brilliant American masterpieces of 1970's cinema.1937 Los Angeles was just a booming small town in the twilight of the depression and it would take another world war to rise out of that struggle. Jack Nicholson gives a tour-de-force performance as private eye J.J. Gittes who literally sticks his nose where it doesn't belong. As we are given a tour around the historic sites of the City of Angels, Nicholson falls into a quagmire of deception, devastating betrayal, and corporate politics involving the Department of Water and Power. Faye Dunaway gives one of her last great performances as the late chief engineer's wife Evelyn Mulwray with a secret that would lead to the film's shocking twist. The legendary actor/director John Huston is an unforgettable screen presence as Noah Cross, the unscrupulous man behind Water and Power. And guess who plays the man that slit Nicholson's nose?Screenwriter Robert Towne's Oscar-winning script is filled with memorable lines such as ""Let's face it, Jake. You're practically a movie star."" and ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown."" Jerry Goldsmith's score is beautiful and haunting. Richard Sylbert's production design is magnificently flawless. And John A. Alonzo's Panavision cinematography captures the compositions so masterfully that the film must be seen on DVD instead of being pan-and-scanned for television.The film is just one of those movies you watch numerous times in order to discover something new within the story. Complex and intricate, CHINATOWN is one of Polanski's best works and one of the best in the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Best NOIR ever made!,"After masterpieces like ""Knife in the water"", ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"". Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, ""Noir"", in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece!""Chinatown"" tells the story of J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city.Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it ""perfectly"". First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script.The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it.Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance.Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the greatest noirs,"I recently watched this for the first time in a while, and I was blown away by it. I don't think I ever realized how terrific it is. In fact, I'd place it behind only L.A. Confidential as far as pure film-noirs go. The story is typical of the genre, but the way that it is homaging the classic films of its type as well (from little stuff like the comment about the Venetian blinds to the casting of John Huston) is ingenious. And the way that they weave real history into it as well makes the story that much more intriguing. The mystery is layered and involving and realistic, and the dialogue is fresh and witty without seeming too stylized. It's impeccably directed and there are great performances from everyone involved, plus there's another great Goldsmith score to back everything up.

Polanski's Noir,"A neo noir classic set in the 1940s, Jack Nicholson delivers a great performance as a detective that is out to solve a murder that could possibly be a suicide. Just like other Polanski films the scenes are a tad long and go into great depth however i believe that this only add more tension to the film leaving the audience begging for more. The film is very minimal as far as sex or violence goes, this i feel is refreshing and cannot be said for many contemporary titles currently being turned out.

excellent excellent excellent,"What is it about this movie? Is it the excellent storytelling? Is it the excellent acting? (Nicholson!Dunaway!Huston!) Is it the beautiful California 40's scenery? Is it the grim atmosphere, the drought, the sweat in 'orange county'? Of course; a combination of all of these ingredients. In this beautiful 70's film noir Nicholson doesn't just deliver a Humphrey B.-rip-off performance, but something darker, more cynical even. Faye Dunaway delivers a glorious two-faced femme fatale and John Huston is both subtle and blunt: evil incarnated. Polanski's filming and his pace are both sublime; cool, distant and reminiscent in every way of the noir-era. Watching the movie makes you feel sort of guilty, as though the filming-crew has washed its hands in blood. 70's movies will do that to you (Taxi Driver, the Godfather, etc). I don't want to be a cynic, claiming this type of film couldn't possibly be produced today. But it is a fact that Spielberg and Lucas and, heck, the eighties with their 'smooth cinema' corrupted the industry in a way, that makes this type of film something of a different era. Let's be thankfull for that era and go watch it one more time. And if you haven't yet: take pity on yourself or haste!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An early predecessor to L.A. Confidential,"Film noir is a genre that consists a sense of pessimism. It is a style in the cinema that can be described as dark, depressing and twisted. In the film noir world, the cops are crooked, the women are devious and the hero is a man who can't seem to understand anything that is being investigated. By the end of this long-lasting journey through intrigue and mystery, you will find the truth and the truth will or can be deceiving.Enter J.J. Gittes. Gittes (Jack Nicholson), is a hard-working private eye, who's specializes in eavesdropping on cheating wives and husbands. His job consists of dropping onto a conversation between the cheating wife or husband and snapping photographs of the two of them together. One day, Gittes finds out that a client wants him to take pictures of her cheating husband. The husband is a chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Learning that he is building a reservoir and that people are opposing his construction of the reservoir, Gittes decides to follow the chief engineer around, taking photographs of him and his adulterous lover. Now, you might think I am telling the first half of the story. Well, I am. The reason why is because the story of Chinatown is a lot twisted than you think.After Gittes finds out about the cheating husband, he soon finds out that the woman he met in his office is not the same woman he met before. Enter the second character of the story, Evelyn Mulwray, (Faye Dunaway). She is the actual wife of the chief engineer. But, who was the client that was in Gittes' office? Anyway, Gittes continues his investigation and winds up having his nose cut from a punk, (Roman Polanski), and having to find out that water is the main clue of the murder. But, wait a minute.... The chief engineer is in control of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Why would someone kill him?The story deepens as Gittes meets up with Noah Cross, (John Huston), during his investigation. Now, there are two people involved in this mystery. More clues start to pop up. And Gittes? Well, he's in way over his head. I guess the truth is going to be hard to get to.Chinatown is in the great tradition of the film-noir movies of the 1940's. In fact, the story takes place in 1937 Los Angeles. Director Roman Polanski creates a very dark and disturbing underworld where sometimes the truth can lead to dangerous circumstances. The set direction and costume design are very well done and builds a certain amount of authenticity as both a period picture and as a film noir movie. The way Los Angeles is portrayed as a city of mystery is great because there is so much going on in this metropolis that we, as the audience, are caught between two ongoing problems: the water issue and Gittes' investigation.Jack Nicholson is perhaps, one of the best and most hard-working actors of our time. He creates, what I think, one of his best and most memorable performances in his career. He portrays Jake Gittes as both a man and a detective, who understands something about bad luck since he been to that place. Here, his presence makes the film works because he can't seem to penetrate this strange and mixed up world that seems different to us since he can't understand everything he's given. The more he feeds himself into this world, the more knowledge he will gained. Every time he gets closer to the clues, he ends up having to be drawn back to himself. One scene that proves this point is when Gittes' nose is cut by Polanski. Every step is dangerous, according to Gittes.I also enjoy and really admired the performances by Dunaway and Huston. Dunaway is stunning as Mulwray, creating a character, who at first, isn't pleased by Gittes' joke, but soon comes to terms and becomes Gittes' helper as she begins to explore the underworld with him. Together, you might think that there's a chemistry between the two, but really, these two characters are somehow locked up in this underworld, where everything is not what is seems to be, according to the characters. John Huston is very convincing as Noah Cross, a man who's questions are startling to Gittes since he is crossing that invisible line between discovery and the truth. In one scene, he advised Jake, ""You don't what you're dealing with. You just don't""Robert Towne's screenplay for the movie is a captivating script that is filled with authentic dialogue, which illustrates the world of 1937 Los Angeles and also creates sharp conversations between all of the characters. There are a lot of great well-written and well-spoken lines in Chinatown that can be dared to be said.I wish more storytellers can tell more stories like this one. It is also equivalent to a great book, one that you can't simply put down. I have had that feeling while watching Chinatown. I just couldn't stop watching and for the most of the time, I was more focused on every bit of detail and aspect that this movie had to offer. The first time you might not understand everything that is being done. But, when you see it the second time around, you will understand how everything falls into place. In fact, maybe we can learn something about the littlest details, like water. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Outstanding,"Roman Polanski's Chinatown is a neo-noir masterpiece that transcends the genre to become a searing indictment of corruption, greed, and the abuse of power. Set in 1937 Los Angeles, the film centers on private investigator J. J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a cynical but ultimately idealistic man navigating a labyrinthine web of deceit and betrayal.The film's brilliance lies in its intricate plot, masterfully crafted by Robert Towne. The initial case of spousal infidelity unravels into a complex conspiracy involving land speculation, water rights, and the systematic exploitation of an entire community. The revelation of Evelyn Mulwray's (Faye Dunaway) tragic past and her brother's ruthless ambition exposes the film's core themes: the destruction of innocence, the corruption of the American Dream, and the inevitable triumph of the powerful over the powerless.Polanski's direction is masterful, utilizing shadows, Dutch angles, and a pervasive sense of paranoia to create an atmosphere of moral decay and impending doom. The cinematography by John A. Alonzo is iconic, capturing the stark beauty and the seedy underbelly of 1930s Los Angeles with stunning visual flair.Nicholson delivers a career-defining performance as Jake, embodying the film's disillusionment and moral ambiguity. Dunaway is equally compelling as Evelyn, a woman trapped by circumstance and forced to confront a devastating truth. The supporting cast, including John Huston as Noah Cross, the chilling embodiment of ruthless ambition, and Perry Lopez as the loyal but ultimately tragic detective, further enriches the film's tapestry.Chinatown is not just a detective story; it's a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and the fragility of human dignity. The film's ending, with its devastating implications for Jake and the city itself, remains one of the most powerful and disturbing in cinematic history. It leaves a lasting impression, forcing viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about the nature of justice and the corrupting influence of greed.Chinatown's enduring legacy lies in its timeless themes and its masterful execution. It is a film that continues to resonate with audiences today, serving as a poignant reminder of the enduring struggle between good and evil, and the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition.Key takeaways:
* A masterpiece of neo-noir: Chinatown transcends the genre with its intricate plot, stunning visuals, and powerful themes.* A searing indictment of corruption: The film exposes the corrupting influence of greed, the abuse of power, and the exploitation of the powerless.* A timeless cautionary tale: Chinatown's themes of corruption, greed, and the fragility of human dignity remain relevant today.* Masterful filmmaking: Polanski's direction, Alonzo's cinematography, and a stellar cast contribute to the film's enduring power.Chinatown is not just a film; it's an experience. It is a haunting and unforgettable journey into the dark heart of American ambition and the devastating consequences of unchecked greed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Didn't appeal much to me,"I can't really list a ton of flaws with this movie, but for some reason I couldn't get engrossed in it.  I don't consider myself to have a short attention span, yet I had problems following the detective story.  Maybe I just didn't find it too fascinating.  So my thoughts on the film are more subjective than objective.  But the film is a little too slow-going at times.  I did like Jack Nicholson's performance, as I always do.  He's one of the best actors of all time.  What can I say?  And I liked the slick dialogue that's typical of film noirs.  For example, I like when Jack says, ""You're right.  When you're right, you're right.  And you're right."" Another one of my favorites when one of the other detectives asks what happened to his nose.  He replies, ""Your wife got a little too excited and crossed her legs too fast, if you know what I mean.""

"Deep, Dark Noir...Sunny on the Surface","Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN, is a must for fans of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, although that film does not hold a candle to this.  Not only does it have style, but it has as much substance, something rare in most movies.  And yes, it is a product of the 1970's, the first decade when films showed the influence of their predecessors.  This is an homage to film-noir, of course, but it elevates the genre to a whole new level because of its deep psychological themes.  I could discuss the plot, which is as thick as a dictionary, but 1000 words is not enough to encapsulate this fantastic movie.Jack Nicholson plays JJ Gittes in an understated, Bogart-type way, however he is still a difficult man to figure out.  The film ends, fittingly, in Chinatown, where Gittes got his start in this business.  We don't know what went wrong with him there, something hinted at while in bed with Dunaway's Mrs. Mulwray, but it must have been messy.  The ending is a stunning payoff to what has transpired.  It is unexpected and it is sad.  Dunaway turns in a deceptively great performance as the tortured femme fatale.  Notice her mannerisms whenever her father is brought up.  First time viewers will cringe when they find out why she acts this way.Legendary director John Huston plays the father, Noah Cross, one of the most reprehensible characters in recent memory.  You sense evil when he's on-screen and he is symbolic of the drought in L.A.  The man is soulless and insane. Polanski brings together a great cast of stars and then unknowns to create an ever-unfolding plot that turns left when you expect a right.  He even puts himself in the mix, taking a piece out of Gittes snoopy nose.It is also beautifully photographed, with golden daylights remembering a more golden age, and serene sunsets and nights.  Underneath is the evil of murder, theft, and incest.  Think of all of the elements.  Its like a Hitchcock filmography of props: B/w photos, dead decoys, bi-focal glasses, water basins, broken taillights, the eye of a fish, bandaged nose, a sister, and a daughter. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score echoes loss and tragedy as everything comes to a rousing, murderous halt in CHINATOWN.(NOTE: This film should be seen in its widescreen format on video.  Each shot is almost portrait-like and watching the pan-and-scan cropped version is like pressing your nose against the glass and watching.)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"One Of The Best Films of the 1970's, possibly of all time","This truly is one of the greatest films of all time, with a plot with such a massive and complex core, which is so well constructed, it is a movie that if paid close attention to will simply take your breath away. Jack Nicholson (in his best role and that says something for one of Hollywood's greats) plays the private detective who is in way over his head when he is hired to spy on the L.A. water commissioner, which leads him to become entangled in a sinister and convoluted case. It is such a complex film I would have to write about a 20,000 word essay before I could really tell you the story, so my advice is just watch it and be fascinated by the story (it may however take two watches before you can fully understand everything). You have a director (Roman Polanski) and a writer (Robert Towne) at the peak of their powers and a film which deserved more awards than the single one Robert Towne receieved (It was just unfortunate to be up in the same year as The Godfather II, another of Hollywood's great films).

a crime drama at its best,"Chinatown is a crime mystery psychological drama film; the screenplay in this 1974 classic is one that is way beyond its time and it will take years before another masterful screenplay can match the Academy Award winning screenplay of Chinatown. The screenplay was done by the Robert Towne (who you will know for his writing in the Tom Cruise Movies The Firm in 1993 Mission Impossible in 1996 and Mission Impossible II in 2000) who decide not to adapt the novel The Great Gatsby (1974) handed to him by producer Robert Evans but Towne wrote his own and Chinatown was the result of his writing.The movie had a tragic ending with Robert Evans the producer, intending the screenplay to have a happy ending but Polanski stuck to his gun for a tragic ending, he is quoted to have said ""I knew that if Chinatown was to be special, not just another thriller where the good guys triumph in the final reel, Evelyn had to die."" Director Roman Polanski (who won the Oscars for Best Director for the 2002 movie The Pianist) won a Golden Globe award for Best Director for this movie, Polanski shut the whole movie from the sight of J.J. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) he was in every scene of the movie and when he was knocked out the who screen went black till he woke up.The movie plot is about a private investigator J.J. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), whose main job is tailing partner's clients who are suspected to be having affairs.He was hired by a woman to help find out if her husband Hollis I. Mulwray is having an affair, he tails him and finds him with another woman, takes pictures of them and releases them to the papers, all to get sued the next day by the woman Mulwary was with, as Gittes found out that the woman who hired him is actually a phony and that the woman he taught was Mulwray's mistress was actually Mulwray's real wife.Polanski also appears in this movie in a cameo as the gangster who cuts Gittes' nose.A sequel to this classic was titled The Two Jakes which was released in 1990. Jack Nicholson reprises his role as J.J. Jake Gittes and also directed the movie, with Robert Towne returning to write the screenplay. The sequel was a total failure though.Chinatown is one of the few mystery films that will keep you on your seat till the very end as you eagerly wait to see where the entire strings tie up, as the movie composes plots and sub plots all leading to a grand and memorable ending.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Chinatown Movie Review,"A long time favorite of mine and a classic that I believe Jack Nicholson can truly be remembered for as his greatest work of cinematic art. Director Roman Polanski and screen writer Robert Towne give audiences a masterpiece of both drama and suspense from the wondering viewpoint of Nicholson's character Gittes, a man who's profession is to find the truth, although the truth might be more than what he'd hoped to discover. Having a dark history in La's Chinatown, Gittie makes his honest living by exploiting the dark secrets few people want out. The secrets usually are born from either rumors or suspicions of affairs. A mysterious women claiming to be Hollis Mularay's wife, Evelyn hires Jake to scoop out the truth and find out if there really is someone else. Jake would've probably thought of old Hollis to be the most fascinating tail he's ever tracked in years, following him to public meetings, beaches, and even a mistress that finishes it all. Hollis is no ordinary guy, being the partner of Noah Cross (Houston), Evelyn's crafty and suspicious father, in the LA water and power department. It doesn't really matter to Jake, all that matters is his objective, and the sweet payday received for his work. His work results in more than just a simple check, but the consequences of widespread publicity, attracting the attention of the real, and truly more sophisticated Evelyn Mulray (Dunaway), who feels both insulted and obliged for the matter to be taken care of courtroom style. It's to Jakes luck and Evelyn's misfortune that he never sees the sight of judge, at the cost of Hollis's life though. The very sight of his body being dragged from a water reservoir, with salt water in his lungs is enough for the cops to call it an accidental death. Jake on the other hand, saw it as murder, believing the pieces in this puzzle all fit. The first piece started with the fake Evelyn looking to bust Mulray with a mysteriously significant mistress, thus reaching the second piece as the real Evelyn sues, then quickly draws back on the lawsuit, ending with the final piece of Mulray's murder. The plot escalates from secrets into answers stemming to the very dark and puzzled world Gittes use to live in. If non of you readers get what I'm talking about, I mean Chinatown, a place where the cops were meant to do as little as possible, never knowing whether they were helping the good or the bad. Chinatown, a place riddled with corruption, drugs, and dark aspiring mystery. Thus, Jakes suspicions place him on a quest to find the whole point of this elaborate plot to bury the truth, following up all kinds of leads that'll make viewers ask more and more questions on the very little, but defining significance they represent. Take for instance the missing mistress of Hollis Mulray. Why is it so important to Noah Cross that she be found? According to Evelyn and several people at Water and Power, Mulray and Cross had a falling out on where the water in LA should go. Either to the City or the People of LA. Many were suffering from the drought, particularly those in the south, raising live stock, with little water, and poisoned wells. It all seems detrimental. More though to the mystery of Hollis's murder, the truth behind it goes to the nature of secrecy that Plagues ""Chinatown"". A little bird (Fake Eveyln) sings a little, giving Jake a few names to look up, only to see their names as the already deceased, leaving him with the conclusion that Hollis knew to much. Jake himself puts himself in the same shoes, as he learns far more about his employer Evelyn than he should know. After a quick, but in the moment and straight to the bedroom romance with Evelyn, Jake's sense to spy leads to the discovery of Hollis's missing mistress, and forcing Evelyn to tell more than she's been saying half the film. Baring the child of your own father, while calling yourself her sister must no doubt be one of the toughest burdens ever, especially when it come to protecting that secret from a man who wants to have the child as his own. Noah Cross, the master mind behind all, reveals not only his place of being Katherine's father, but also the intention of incorporating LA's Northwest valley, and thus irrigating it. As we viewers draw to a close, the films ends in its title of focus, Chinatown. When struggling for the truth, Jake fails to save those he loves at the very remark of ""Forget it Jake its Chinatown"". A magnificent ending to film, that incorporates the elements of historical corruption, love, mystery, thrill, suspense, and furthermore the realistic notion of it's title ""Chinatown"". Chinatown, like general life is what it is, sometimes good triumphs over evil, and the other times, evil triumphs over good to our personal distaste. I honestly see this as one of Nicholson's most trademarked characters, using both his dark and even haunting history, as well as his slick wit to further move himself forward in the films mystery of a story, while collaborating with Dunaway's portrayal of an even more tortured figure. Mulray has gone through the unholy touch of her father at the bedside, hiding his child, and doing all she can to conceal her truth, expressing her partial dishonesty in the very doubt of her voice. Despite his short screen time, John Houston's performance is both as haunting, and yet the least tortured of the film's characters, feeling little regret for his sins, while pursuing his power hungry goals with an almost terrifying form of expressing his want for them. ""Chinatown"" itself, using it's musical romance theme can haunt a fan, almost as much as it's done to the hero J.J. Gittes.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The acting is impeccable, the direction is some of the best I have ever seen, and the story is possibly the most well written screenplay ever turned into a major motion picture.

"It's a hard world. And ""Chinatown"" proves it.","--Author is aware of spelling mistakes--This is an endless masterpiece. From the start to finish I was on my seat. The suspense is all over the movie from the first to the last minute. When Faye Dunaway appears as the real wife, you think that the plot has got it's last twists. Well, you better think again. Just like I had to.The plot ringles as a snake, and it's a ride to hang on. From the beginning you are cousing upp in the sofa, enjoying Nicholson's very fine portrait. At the end you are so frightened, so moved by the moral. You feel so totaly helpless by the end. This is Polanski's without a doubt best movie, and his appearence as the man with the knife is a great pleasure to watch, in the same scene as you see Nicholson soaked as a rat. That's also a big pleasure to watch. Polanski's way to show the incredible heat that surrounds the city is marvelous. Acting is great, to say the least. Nicholson in one of his best roles, even if I'm not really sure wich one of the great ones (""The Shining"", ""One flew over the cucoo's nest"", ""Mars Attacks!"", ""As good as it gets"") that's the best, it's a tough job to say. Faye Dunaway is not really the world's best actress, even if she's good. And I think this is the role of her life, Bonnie Parker gets close, but concidering that overrated BONNIE & CLYDE is about two times ""less good"" (is that an ok term?) than CHINATOWN it gets a bit complicated to say. The plot is nothing else than a 10-pointer and Jerry Goldsmith proves that he's been around quite a while.It is simply a very good, excelent movie with Polanski's brilliance mixed with Nicholson's brilliance. A must-see! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classic Film.,"'Chinatown' is one of those rare film that is absolutely perfect. Sure there are plenty of films that have very few flaws, but they are not as complex as this movie, nor are their plots as brilliantly put together. Many people who dislike the film have called it boring and they do not like the ending. They forget the film is about a serious subject matter and shouldn't be handled like an action movie. Polanski, along with the rest of the cast, handle the story with maturity and precision, the way it should be. Polanski does not insult the viewers' intelligence. He forces us to use our imagination about past events and events that are currently happening. It may take several viewing to put all the pieces together, but with each viewing the film becomes more meaningful. Even though the film ends on an unhappy note, people must understand why the film ended that way. The ending is one of the reasons the film is so powerful and unforgettable. But that will be discussed a little later.'Chinatown' is the story of a private eye detective J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Nicholson) who investigates the extramarital affair of a prominent engineer in Los Angeles. It is set in the 1930s, and the city is suffering a major drought. Even though the city is going through a drought, Gittes discovers that thousands of gallons of water is being dumped at night. He is dumbfounded, but he does not realize he is about to enter a conspiracy involving the elite of the city. This conspiracy stretches out to the farmers in the surrounding land. He is warned on several occasions throughout the film about what he is getting into, but he still enters the lion's mouth full speed ahead. Jack Nicholson gives one of the great performances of his career. Even though all the actors did a superb job, including Faye Dunaway, Nicholson still towers above anyone else. There is a reason he is considered one of the all time greats. So few actors can bring such range into their roles. He is funny as hell when he needs to be and serious and sensitive the story requires it.The film is also carried by its brilliant screenplay. The screenplay has been hailed one of the best of all time, and I find that hard to argue. The dialog is so well written, it is an absolute joy watch time an again. Graphics can become dates, action sequences can become tame, but good dialog is timeless. Apparently, Robert Towne, the main screen writer, turned down 'The Great Gatsby' to instead write 'Chinatown'. He would have made a lot more money writing 'Gatsby', but inspiration won over dollars. He made the right decision because what he gave us was a screenplay for the ages. It is wickedly clever, intelligent, and cynical. Towne must have been at the pinnacle of his career.Many people have voiced their displeasure at the ending of the film. They feel it is depressing. They feel the film should not have ended that way. They feel that people have overrated the film because of the ending. To me, the ending is absolutely brilliant. It should rank as one of the great endings in film history. In the ending, the ghosts of the past coming crashing like a tidal wave. Notice in the ending, it is only time Evelyn and Noah Cross are together in the movie. Notice that in the ending, things are so confusing, hardly anyone can figure out what is happening. Throughout the film, Jake talks about Chinatown, or how he doesn't like talking about it. Jake really does not realize what he is getting into. What he is getting into is destiny. All the money or motivation in the world cannot stop destiny from happening. And this destiny is not always happy. In fact, it can be downright brutal. At times in this life, there are forces beyond one's control. What a phenomenal achievement in film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A bit boring, I did not find this film very engaging at all","So, in my journey through the IMDb top 250 I think that outside of planet Ingmar Bergman I have never encountered a less engaging film than this one: it was truly hard to take on this film, which is different than actually hating it: it is just that I think a film should be more driven by audio-visual processes rather than dialogue: 2001: A Space Odyssey, for instance, is one of such films, another is Apocalypse Now, but this is not one of such films: it seems to last forever and the whole film feels like it was made in the 1930's.Indeed, this Neo-Noir style of film making does not appeal to me. My grandma, though, would probably like this film. But young people (people under 35) of the Star Wars generation will probably not like this film very much. I recommend this film to those that love 1930's and 1940's flicks, such as Casablanca (which also did not impress me).",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Polanski's greatest achievement.,"Chinatown is undoubtedly one of the finest films to emerge from the 1970's, starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunnaway, Roman Polanski has delivered a Noir masterpiece for the ages. Detective Jake Gittes, played by Nicholson, is at a glance, your average private eye snoop. He's sneering, untrustworthy and his reputation in and around Los Angeles is much worse. LA is in the midst of a severe drought, and Gittes, during one of his daily endeavours, has uncovered sinister activity by the Department of Water & Power that has the company reaping unfair financial rewards at the cost of unsuspecting landowners. Then there is the mysterious wealthy socialite, Evelyn Mulwray, played by Faye Dunaway, that comes to Gittes for help, but never quite reveals the full length of her troubles. She's elusive, seductive and tangled up in Chinatowns puzzle more than what she's willing to own up to. The drought of course is public knowledge, but when the Boss of Water & Power turns up dead in a reservoir, the LA community soon learn that foul play runs far beyond the boardroom. One of Chinatown's charms is the audience never knows more than Gittes at that certain point. Our detective is never one step ahead, and neither is the audience. Chinatown is not only a noir mystery film, but it's a superior thriller that keeps the viewer deeply involved from the start, to its tragic end.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As little as possible....,"What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters.That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen.And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The perfect Neo-Noir,"There are a number of different paths to take when creating a neo-noir film. In ""Chinatown,"" Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne went in the then-innovative direction of essentially ""playing it straight"" with their neo-noir. That is to say, there is nothing really ""neo"" about it other than being in color. It's set during the noir period, with noir dialogue and noir characters. However, Polanski executes the film so perfectly that it becomes perhaps the single most essential noir film of all time (or at least in the top two with ""The Maltese Falcon"").The plot is everything a film noir should be--mysterious and somewhat convoluted, following the hard-edged detective Jake Gittes through the dark underbelly of the new city of Los Angeles. While the underlying scheme may seem a disappointment, the seeming banality of it enhances its disastrous effects on those involved even further than they would be otherwise. However, perhaps the strongest element of this film is its incredible characterization. While noir was always loaded (some would say hampered) with stock characters, even the characters who seem to fit the stock roles in ""Chinatown"" have extra layers of depth beyond what one would expect. Gittes is not simply a hard-nosed detective, but a man with an extreme stubborn streak and a need to prove his own intellectual abilities; Evelyn Mulwray is not just the femme fatale or the damsel in distress but an over-dramatic and fascinating combination of the two who seems to vacillate back and forth while she decides herself which she is; Lou Escobar is an intelligent and competent detective who only seems a step behind Gittes because he lacks some of Gittes's information; and of course Noah Cross is one of cinema's all-time great characters, though the details would constitute a spoiler. The dialogue of the film also deserves mention, as it sparkles with noir-speak slang, almost poetic rhythm, and the type of literary edge that always made the language of films noir so interesting.Perhaps the most easily noticeable element of this film is its incredible acting. Jack Nicholson is surprising and thus particularly effective in his relatively restrained, nontheatrical turn as Jake Gittes. He even manages to resist the temptation to take the character out of control and over the top when possible, which is quite an accomplishment for an actor who has made such a career out of doing just that. Faye Dunaway's performance is a fascinating study in duality, as her character seems self-consciously aware of her position as both femme fatale and damsel in distress throughout this film and then vacillates between them as though she is still trying to make up her own mind about who she is, which of course she is. Meanwhile, John Huston simply steals the show in an absolute powerhouse performance as the charming and villainous Noah Cross that ranks as one of Hollywood's all-time great performances.Overseeing this entire process, Roman Polanski directs the film perfectly. Everything from the editing to the cinematography is executed magnificently, resulting in a truly beautiful film in which every shot accentuates the mood of the piece and every scene is told as much with the camera as with the dialogue.All together, Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"" is a monumental film achievement. Years after the death of the film noir, Polanski crates perhaps the ultimate in the genre, following all of its conventions while adding layers of depth that perhaps no other noir can lay claim to. This film might also be the last example of noir played for real rather than for laughs or genre deconstruction, making it an almost priceless piece of cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

When I finally got a hold of the movie through my library, I sat down and was totally captivated for all of the two hours and ten minutes of the film.Jack Nicholson was always one of my favorite actor's because of his sense of humor, cynicism and charm. He was himself in Chinatown, but he wasn't the typical Jack like in ""As Good As it Gets"" or ""The Bucket List."" He made a more serious and grim character that I found amazing.I've never seen Faye Dunaway in many movies, but this is the best one I have seen her in. Her character is seductive, gorgeous, and mysterious. Her and Jack really spun the movie as one of the best mysteries I have seen. The Oscar-winning script by Robert Towne is witty and classic; when I think I've figured the story out, I am wrong. However, it' real brilliance was made by Nicholson and Dunaway.This is the only film I have seen by Roman Polanski. Despite the allegations and hell of a life he's lived, he's one fine director. He added to the mystery of the film by his unusual and sometimes suspenseful camera angles that are in the league of a Hitchcock film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mesmerizing and mysterious and so authentically made.,"Mesmerizing and mysterious and so authentically made.Its hard not to delve into the script right from the first frame, as the reels goes on, characters become more mysterious, more secrets are revealed and more questions raised, is it about water and the power to hold water or something much beyond that, if that's one question, then why is Jake so interested in things like Evelyn Cross.Jake Gittes is played by Jack Nicholson and he is done an exceptional job and so did so many others, in fact all of them must be applauded for acting. Now for such supreme acting to be extracted, the director takes a toll and here we have Roman Polanski at the helm and its his take on the script thats makes it more dark and interesting.Robert Towne has produced a screenplay thats is superbly written, fast paced for its 140 minutes length and becomes more interesting till the last frame, dialogues are written so well, that they are mystique when we hear and are so self explanatory when it happens in the film. The best dialogue that astonished me is ""She is my sister and my daughter"" does anyone expect this all through the film, I very much doubt. The pace holds it up well and is written with enough moments of dark humor, its not sarcastic or finding flaws in system, but finding flaws in person who are a BIG part of the system and are the main drivers of it. So it's psychological more than incident based. I believe, Robert Towne wrote it as incident based screenplay but Roman Polanski who has made even THE PIANIST as an extremely psychological film is who raises above the script and makes it a masterpiece.I will go with 5/5 and a best writing for Robert Towne, best acting for Jack Nicholson and best direction for Roman Polanski are my awards.

One of the Best of All Time,"Chinatown is a movie that combines a superb script with flawless directing. Robert Towne's script is probably the best script of all time. It encompasses all the elements of classical film noirs and uses them to tell a perfect story. The clues are fed to the audience slowly, but carefully. As Jake Gittes discovers more and more of the twisted plot revolving around the death of Mr. Mulwray, a world of disgusting corruption is found. Towne's script is reinforced by two of the greates performances of all time: Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. Dunaway is the perfect femme fatale; she pulls Jake into a case that is bigger than he can handle. Nicholson plays a more thoughtful character than his usual roles. The most interesting part of the Gittes character is his vulnerability. Nicholson's nose is covered with bandages for a good part of the film to reinforce the fact that Gittes is not super-human; he will not and can not solve this case in time to save Dunaway.Finally, Roman Polanski's direction is amazing in Chinatown. His camera is a voyeur in the film. It follows just over Nicholson's shoulder, it is right next to Dunaway's face (which from interviews, I hear really disturbed her and created friction between she and Polanski), and it surveys the young L.A. landscape revealing its superficial beauty. Polanski wonderfully contrasts this beautiful image of early L.A. and the corruption underlying the plot. On the one hand we see the desert and all its stark beauty. But in another scene, the camera is dodging punches or trying to get away from Claude Mulvhill. This move definetely signified a peek in Polanski's career. It is unfortunate that events in his personal life has made him an outcast in America, he truly had a great eye as a director.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Masterpiece that should have beat The Godfather Part II for Best Picture in the Oscar race,"In Chinatown, it is not just the filming or the acting thats good, like in most cases. Everything in this movie is excellent; the writing is the best I have ever seen and I totally believed that it was the prewar 1940's. All of the characters are believable and the story line is great, not to mention the great musical score. This movie has a plethora of famous quotes such as when Gittes is at Mrs.Mulwray's home, Mrs.Mulwray asks Jake what he use to do working for the District Atourney, Gittes replies with, ""As little as possible."" All of the clothes, sets, and cars and any other items on screen point to the times of the 1940's. The film does a good job of sending out a message: Things may be very complicated and no matter how hard you try, you just won't understand them. ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown."" Nicholson was born for the part of Jake Gittes and he is beside Faye Dunaway, who is mostly famous for ""Bonnie and Clyde.""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Inspectors71's pick for the best American movie ever made,"I showed Roman Polanski's Chinatown to my wife about ten years ago and she hated it. It wasn't entertainment, and evil wins. With this in mind, Chinatown and all the people involved on and off screen should be forever congratulated for creating, quite possibly, the perfect adult story that isn't entertainment.I have watched this movie two dozen or more times and I cannot find a flaw in its construction, plotting, artistry, or performance. On top of its perfection, the viewer must appreciate what Candace Bergen once pointed out on an AFI presentation of the top 100 films of all time, that the movie is utterly daring and fearless. The whole idea that a major American film studio would tell the (fictionalized?) story of how LA got big is amazing in itself.Yet, it isn't entertainment, and evil wins.Polanski's creation, his dark image of Depression-era Los Angeles, governed by the thoroughly-corrupted and populated by near-virtuous, real people is so beautiful in its execution, its performances (where do I start with my kudos?--Nicholson, Dunaway, Huston?), and its daring that my praise may turn off prospective viewers--it's some old movie about a private eye, water rights, and incest.Yuck. Who wants to watch that?But if you crave more than entertainment, can stand it when the good guys can only hobble off the field of battle with nothing to show for their bravery but their dignity, and want your time in front of the DVD player to mean something, then accept that Chinatown will deliver to you a meaningful two hours, an appreciation of how good a movie can be.A masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Mystery
In the Asphalt Jungle,"The hard-drinking, hard-hitting private eye has always been a central character in American popular culture. As early as the 1930s, writers like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler wrote about these vice-cracking anti-heroes and their exploits. And it wasn't long before Hollywood realized what a great source of dramatic material this represented. In 1941, Humphrey Bogart played Sam Spade, the seminal private dick, in Walter Huston's ""The Maltese Falcon"".Fast forward to 1974. That year, producer Robert Evans bought a promising screenplay from author Robert Towne. ""Chinatown"" takes place in Los Angeles and deals with precisely the kind of private investigator that Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler used to write about. Right from the start Evans wanted Roman Polanski to direct, but he turned out to be hard to persuade. Polanski was living in France at the time, and the thought of returning to Los Angeles, where his wife had recently been murdered, seemed overwhelming to him.Luckily, Evans did manage to persuade Roman Polanski to return to Tinseltown. Where it transpired that the Polish director was not the only celebrity on the studio floor. The cast was filled with major stars like Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston. Having so many high-voltage personalities in one production does not guarantee that a masterpiece will be created, of course. But, when the cameras stopped rolling on ""Chinatown"", the result turned out to be sensational.Something a united body of critics agreed with. The film received rave reviews, especially for Robert Towne's outstanding screenplay and Roman Polanski's innovative direction. And it didn't stop with that. Today, ""Chinatown"" is considered to be one of the best hard-boiled detective stories ever made. It's even used as a teaching point in movie seminars all over the world. So, Roman Polanski and his team have every reason to be pleased with their work.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Beautifully Tragic, Great Acting, Ominous And Dark, But Has An Initial Pacing Issue, Score Overuse, And A Wayward Character Decision","Pros:
1. The costume design is brilliant, particularly in regards to the detailed three-piece suits which reinforce the noir theme.
2. As per usual, Jack Nicholson (Jake Gittes) gives a fantastic performance, as well as Faye Dunaway (Evelyn Mulwray).
3. The score does a wonderful job at increasing the tension and suspense, as well as every other intended emotion and tone.
4. The violence is not only appropriately dark and gritty, but the action scenes are beautifully choreographed to match that dark grittiness.
5. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the slow camera zoom-ins and movements, in addition to the lighting, in order to help set an ominous mood.
6. Both Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway have amazing chemistry with each other.
7. The plot is really tight, focused, and greatly structured.
8. The ending is exceedingly raw, powerful, and heartbreaking. It's beautifully summarised in one of the final shots where Jake Gittes just stands there staring in disbelief and shock at Evelyn Mulwray.Cons:
1. The first 30 minutes are a bit of a chore to get through as they're far too slow-paced.
2. The score, on a couple of occasions, is a little too overbearing.
3. It seems rather unlikely that Escobar (Perry Lopez) would have allowed Jake Gittes 3 minutes to have some alone time with Evelyn Mulwray, which inevitably led to him escaping custody with Curly (Burt Young).",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hey, have you noticed, if he doesn't get the girl, the film's a classic","Sam Spade didn't get the girl in ""Maltese Falcon"" and Jake doesn't get the girl in ""Chinatown"".  True, they don't get the girl for different reasons but both reasons are superb.

Two important reasons for this are Jack Nicholson and Humphrey Bogart.  Of course both have great supporting casts as well.  In ""Chinatown"" the supporting roles are filled superbly by Faye Dunaway and John Huston (in a devilishly malicious role).  The script by Robert Towne is excellent and intelligent with many memorable moments and twists.  The highlights of this film are the Chinaman joke (easily Nicholson's best and funniest monologues), Dunaway's stunning daughter/sister revelation, Roman Polanski's knife-wielding thug that provides one of Hollywood's most memorable props and the film's surprising conclusion.

As noirish as noir can get,"I read, recently, that, in a joint poll by the 'Guardian' and the 'Observer', Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' was voted the greatest film of all time.Now that may be arguable - I feel that, with the volume of great cinema that's come out of Hollywood over the years, and the variety of genres in which we find excellence, it may be facile to label any individual film as the ""best"" or the ""greatest"" ... Having said that, however, 'Chinatown' cannot but be characterized as representative of neo noir at its tightest and most gripping, with a celebrated screenplay that does not relax its hold on you till the unforgettable final scene - 'Forget it, Jake ... it's Chinatown.'Much has been written about Jack Nicholson's virtuosity as Detective J.J.Gitte, and his gritty portrayal of the acerbic detective rightly deserves a place in every history book of Hollywood. The film, however, at the end, is neither Jack Nicholson's, nor Faye Dunaway's - who matches Nicholson scene for scene -, but, unquestionably, Roman Polanski's triumph - every scene in the film is handled like a Ming vase - touch it and it will break.I read that there was considerable disagreement between Polanski and Stone - who wrote the screenplay - over how the film should end, and that, ultimately, Polanski had his way ... Having seen the film, I feel happy that this was so - there could be no more fitting finale ... after all, it's 'Chinatown'! A tour de force, in every sense of the word.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A good private eye film, even if too long and overpraised","Despite its reputation, ""Chinatown"" lacks the wit, speed and economy of the best movies in the private eye genre: this is no ""Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep."" It's not bad: Robert Towne gives us a cleverly convoluted script with some sharp lines; the color photography is seamy and compelling; the bluesy Jerry Goldsmith score is hypnotic; and Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are the perfect 1970s choices for a 1930s private detective and femme fatale. But these things don't work as well if you're not made to suggest things. Censoring bad language, nudity and violence is not an activity just for prudes and moralists; it also forces filmmakers to work harder. Roman Polanski directs and makes room for his typical grotesquery. One scene in a morgue shows us a naked corpse as set decoration: it just lies there, almost out of sight. Why? If Polanski wanted to shock us, why didn't he give us a full view? Why distract the audience from the main action? Another scene is unintentionally campy. I can't describe it fully without spoiling a surprise, but it's the one where Nicholson repeatedly slaps Dunaway. Her line seems worthy of ""Mommie Dearest.""",,Anonymous,Mystery

Probably the greatest movie from the '70's. Bringing together a great script with the best cast Hollywood had at the time.,"This motion picture brought together a great script by Robert Town, a great cast lead by Jack Nicholson and great directing  by Roman Polanski. The movie is set in Los Angeles in the late 1930's and filmed in the film noir style that made movies like The Maltese Falcon and Out of the Past great films. The key difference is that Chinatown is in color adding to its richness in photography by cinematographer John Alonzo and its spectacular music score by Jerry Goldsmith. My favorite part of the movie is John Hustons portrayal of Noah Cross. Mr. Huston was born to play this part bringing his tough no nonsense attitude and giving it to Noah Cross making this character the most mysterious of the cast. ""You may think you know what your dealing with but believe me you don't"", Noah Cross tells Mr. Gittes at their first meeting adding to this mystery that Mr. Huston brings to his charecter every time he is on screen.

"flawless, a complex combination of beauty and downright seediness","flawless, a complex combination of beauty and downright seediness - works because it is constrained within a coherent narrative - a modernist masterpieceFrom the very beginning one gets the impression of fun and menace within this movie - the awful joke run riotously bad by Geddis regarding the sexual morais of the Chinese and the hopelessly seedy nature of the assignments that Geddis, as a private eye, usually gets, hint of the possibility that things will soon go very pear shaped.Los Angeles is of course the star, but this time it is the hideous beauty beneath the sprawl that wins; something truly gone to seed - The Late Show (1977) meets the Big Sleep (1946).Of course the Jack Nicolson and Faye Dunaway chemistry works brilliantly, but it is the sparing but towering performance of John Huston that steals the show - almost a cameo, he plays the Noah Cross figure at the centre of the whole sordid affair; a figure who is the grotesque freakish abomination at the heart of the plot.Of course one could not leave out Roman Polañski, whose flawless direction, eye for detail and mood, along with a few theatrical embellishments, ensures that a good story succeeds.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But we do not really get that ... well not exactly that is. Any woman can be quite fatal to any male I reckon ... but the character of Nicholson is quite interesting. He doesn't seem to care too much about money ... he does seem to care about solving cases ... but also not poke the bear as they say. Sleeping dogs lie and all that ... he could be one of those. But once you (a)waken him ... well there is no stopping him really.Really great cast here - and the story is well told.

Well this has a neat closure ... well if you want to call it neat ... there is violence and brutal imagery ... the r rating is not for nudity (though there is some minor flashing) ... as much as it is for violence ... be aware and not mad ... mad is not helping anyone ... as one character finds out at the end of the movie too ...",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An unforgettable masterpiece,"Though in my opinion ""Chinatown"" deserved both director and picture Oscars over ""Godfather II,"" the movie still remains one of the most memorable and cinematic movies ever created. Director Roman Polanski (who makes a cameo in the movie as a short mobster who cuts Jack Nicholson's nose) creates a film noir so tense and so brilliant, that it makes any 70s detective drama pale in comparison. ""Chinatown"" paved way for a tremendous respect for Roman Polanski, Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson.The movie takes place in the 1940s where detectives and private investigators were the biggest thing. Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes (pronounced Git-teas) who takes on a job for a woman by the name of Mrs. Mulwray. The job is to find out if her husband is cheating on her. As Gittes spies on her husband he soon realizes that there is much more to the story than just an affair as he finds Mr. Mulwray dead and Mrs. Mulwray is not really his wife. Faye Dunaway shows up as Mr. Mulwray's real wife, Evelyn Mulwray, in one of the best femme fatale characters ever put on the screen. Gittes soon finds himself in a mayhem of murder, betrayal, incest, and greed while uncovering Mr. Mulwray's suspicious death in a backtrack of a place in Los Angeles called Chinatown.Roman Polanski beautifully directs this film to portray the character of Gittes as both ambitious, charming and unafraid. He designs an ongoing feud between the law and criminals to show the life in the '40s. Showing just how brilliantly creepy a storyline can turn out, Polanski sways us into a subtle affair of wrongdoings by carefully illustrating a step-by-step process of a film noir terror. He chooses a brilliant score for the film that helps us feel both the 1940s and the '70s film noir. The cinematography is also great. Each scene is lit with subtle coloring, making it both cinematic and dark.""Chinatown"" represents a typical classic film noir at its finest.

Both Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway were on a roll when they came together for this Roman Polanski-directed work and it shows in this four star movie. The acting by the two leads was reinforced by an excellent script, musical score and a highly polished style that Polanski drew from the mid century cinema of Bogart, Bacall, Garfield, and Greenstreet. Polanski's short scene also makes an interesting sidebar to the plot. The diversion of the Los Angeles water supply during a major drought is the major element with Nicholson and Dunaway crossing paths and then getting ensnared in the unfolding drama.

One of the All-Time Greats,"Chinatown (1974)**** (out of 4)Roman Polanski's stylish noir follows private detective J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) as he tries to solve a man's murder but he keeps getting different stories from his wife (Faye Dunaway) and her father (John Huston). Many film noir fans object to anyone calling CHINATOWN noir because their arguments include the fact that this here isn't B&W and that it was made in the 70s. Many people feel a true noir can only be B&W and come from the 40s or 50s but no matter what label you want to put on it there's no question that this is one of the greatest films of the decade. Robert Towne rightfully earned his Best Screenplay Oscar because there are very few films, past or present, that would be willing to tell the type of story told here. One of the major plot points deals with water and who would have ever thought that water would make for one of the great crime dramas? One of the key elements is the way Polanski brings this dirty world to life. There are many scumbags scattered throughout the film and while I wouldn't call the film confusing the director does manage to make you you can follow it from start to finish and he also makes sure that everything is laid out pretty well. One of the strongest points is the beautiful atmosphere created by the director and the cinematography and music score also help bring this out. There's also no question that we get some superb performances with Nicholson leading the charge. It's really amazing to sit back and see some of the excellent performances this guy gave during this period but his work here is right up there with what Bogart and Mitchum could do in the genre. Nicholson is so laid back and cool about everything that you can't help but love going on this journey with him. Dunaway has a very difficult part but she handles it just fine and plays on the same level as Nicholson. Huston gives the greatest performance of his career and even though he's only in a handful of scenes there's no doubt that once you see him here you'll never forget him. CHINATOWN is without question one of the great films of its type and it's just an example of everything going right for a movie. The screenplay, direction and performances are all top-notch and it makes for a terrific entertainment.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"You never know what's really going on, especially in Chinatown","Philosophically, the story of J.J. 'Jake' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is almost a tragedy: once he was a cop in Chinatown, and made a blunder that cost a woman her life. Now, in this narrative, he's a tough, cynical but fair-minded PI and is about to ignore history  and, as we know, those who ignore it are bound to repeat it...You see, Jake was hired to expose the putative extra-marital affair of one Hollis Mulwray, a big wig with the water Board for the City of Los Angeles. Trouble is, Mulwray doesn't behave like a man on an affair, but more like one on a mission. So, Jake's intrigued, and even more so as the intrigue deepens when Mulwary turns up dead  drowned. And, as Jake discovers further, murdered.Tangled up in the murder is, of course, Mrs Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) who, at first, tries to obstruct Jake but later engages his services to find out who killed Hollis. Along the tortuous way, Jake bumps into Noah Cross (John Huston), Mrs Mulwray's father, who just happened to have been partner to Hollis Mulwray years earlier. Cross, in turn, engages Jake to find the young woman who was supposed to be having an affair with Hollis. Why is Cross so interested in that young woman? Indeed...That's what Jake wants to know too; and the only person he can ask is Mrs Mulwray who, as the story progresses, the LAPD suspect as being the killer of Hollis. But is she? Jake's determined to find out, and so sets an elaborate trap for the person he thinks did the dirty job of killing Hollis; and also devises a daring plan to get Mrs Mulwray to Mexico and beyond the reach of his one-time buddies at the LAPD. Why does Jake do the latter? Because he's in love with her, or so he thinks, and is willing to risk his career, jail, loss of PI license or whatever to make sure she stays free. Trouble is, Jake doesn't realize he's made a terrible blunder again...when he meets her in Chinatown.In the great tradition of film-noir, Chinatown ranks with the best. The period mise-en-scene is picture perfect; the music soundtrack is quintessentially moody; the dialog is cracking with one-liners and irony; the femme fatale is disturbingly haunting, twice over, as you will discover.The overall production testifies to the great expense and detail that brought the whole story and cast together. Add the standout performances from Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston for the icing to a layer cake mystery that will stay with you for a long time.Arguably Polanski's best directorial effort and one, in my opinion, that should have won the Oscar for that year.

Polanski's greatest work,"Chinatown is a thinking man's noir that completely surpasses expectation. Nicholson is at his conniving best as Jake Gittes and there are perhaps no greater villains than Hollis Mulray.Chinatown casts a spell with a tone that is both forlorn and mysterious - the film starts slow and builds an incredible tension that wraps you up until its overwhelming conclusion.Be prepared for raw nerves and the feeling that every character is putting on a show, facade driven like the town itself.The many supporting actors are amazing! Everyone is so well cast and totally believable in their roles, including Polanksi himself, who plays a brief but unforgettable mini-thug who knows how to wield a blade. Every roll is a kind of character study, a breakdown of morality in its varying forms and often the best characters turn out to be the most corrupt or deceitful while the worst characters surprise you with traits that are more noble than expected.Jerry Goldsmith's work on the soundtrack really evokes the era in both its polish and seediness. It drives home the film-noir tone and reinforces the films variation of themes.The first time I saw this movie I was living in Alabama and LA seemed like a distant and foreign place. But a few years later there was a big scandal in the state over parks and wildlife and I suddenly felt this immense connection between the way it was playing out and the feeling I had while watching Chinatown, proving to me how effective this film is from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Detective Perfection,"A private detective (Jack Nicholson) is hired to spy on a woman's husband.

Confidential"", and would be right at home with either (or both). While ""Confidential"" ranks as one of my all-time favorite detective stories, ""Chinatown"" now also gets a spot. It really is an epic and a tale you cannot avert your eyes from.The film marks a turning point in Roman Polanski's career. A step away from art films and British comedies to a full-budget, Hollywood-style film with big name actors. While his other films up until now were for the most part good films, this is the one that probably hit home with American audiences. And considering the script won an Academy Award, it was excellent material to work with. (Of course, ""Rosemary's Baby"" was also a hit, but I suspect this was even more mainstream.)Nicholson is great here, in part because he is subdued. He gets a lot of credit for playing violent or insane characters, but gets much less credit for his work as a protagonist without illness. In some ways, this could be considered Nicholson's best work because he carried the film, presented his character well, and did not have to fall back on the crazy facade he has mastered.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A very nice, if imperfect, homage to Film Noir","While I know that CHINATOWN has a great reputation and has received many 10s from reviewers, as a fan of Film Noir, I saw a few minor problems that kept the score from being a bit higher--though it's still an exceptional film. First, as any devoted fan of Noir knows, Noir is always, and I repeat, always filmed in black and white. The great shadows and camera angles are an important trademark of the style. While this Roman Polanski film is beautifully filmed (with a lot of sepia tones) and it definitely has the look of a late 1930s Warner Brothers gangster film, it just isn't true Noir because it's in color! Second, and this is a problem shared by THE BIG SLEEP, is that the plot is very, very complicated--perhaps a bit too complicated--making the resolution of mysteries and complications a bit too simple. The end, in particular, just seemed too convoluted a solution and left a lot of loose ends. BUT, getting past these factors, the film is still exceptional. Jack Nicholson was terrific and so was the rest of the cast. And the film was definitely interesting and exciting.

But Chinatown is no lazy bundle of clichés  it draws together everything that was great about film noir, and was put in the hands of one of the most talented directors and some of the greatest actors of the day.Story-wise this is very much the archetypal film noir, reminiscent of The Maltese Falcon, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, Vertigo, Touch of Evil and many others, and with a plot equally as complex and skilfully woven as those classics. You have the political corruption, the cynical private eye hero and the femme fatale, not to mention the atmosphere of absolute despair, regret and the terrifying power of evil people. But Chinatown has much more than that  it was made in an era when cinema was shorn of many of its conventions and the burdens of censorship and is therefore more daring and more grown up. The characters are at once stylised references to film noir figures and at the same fully rounded and believable individuals. The dialogue is both memorable and realistic. Robert Towne's screenplay also had some invaluable modifications from director Roman Polanski, most notably a change to the ending, although I won't spoil that here.Two things really stand out about Polanski's direction of Chinatown. First is his use of colour. The bulk of the film is composed in drab browns and greys, which evoke the era, as well as the theme of drought. Polanski had a great talent for being incredibly restrained when it came to colour, and really it's not so much about putting the right colours in, it's about keeping the wrong colours  the bold ones  out. He doesn't let so much as a brightly coloured button sneak into the shot, the exception to this being when he wants to draw attention to something or create a shift in mood. For example the blaring neon lights of the final sequence are a counterpoint to the rest of the film, and really help to ratchet up the power of the finale.The second thing that stands out is Polanski's use of space. Just like Alfred Hitchcock could create suspense out of nothing, Polanski creates a sense of confinement out of nothing. A lot of Chinatown takes place outdoors and in wide open spaces, but by this point Polanski's skill and confidence was such that he didn't need cramped apartments or castles to create claustrophobic spaces. Here he creates the same feeling with shots through car windscreens, Venetian blinds or even just a few carefully chosen items in the foreground. Chinatown is bizarrely shot in scope ratio, but whereas normally the ratio is used to open out the shot widthways, in Polanski's hands it is almost as if it is compressing the image height-wise.Also crucial to the mix is the spot-on casting. These were great roles for Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. This is perhaps Nicholson's career best  a deep, restrained performance in contrast to his comfort zone of playing energetic lunatics. The real masterstroke though was casting John Huston as Noah Cross. Obviously he was a major figure in classic film noir, but he also really gets his teeth into this role. It's also a nice touch to have someone who can make Jack Nicholson look small.Chinatown comes from the beginning of the age in which cinema became more and more retrospective and nostalgic, but nostalgia rarely comes better than this. A lot of people, myself included, didn't like Chinatown upon first seeing it, but it tends to grow on people. It's a very impressive picture.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jack and kill,"I have to confess I absolutely hate Jack Nicholson as an actor. Everyone has their bête- noire I suppose and he's mine, I just see him overacting in everything instead of acting. That goes for ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", ""The Shining"", ""The Departed"", you name it, for me he ruins it. All that is, except this.In Roman Polanski's superb revision of the 40's 'tec thriller, Nicholson is, and I really hate to say it, believe me, nothing short of brilliant. His character is a workaday private investigator, small-fry, but smart and persistent and Nicholson has you following in Jake Gittes every step from the first, which of course is director Polanski's methodology here, to draw in the viewer and hand us the problem, almost at first-hand, of trying to solve the labyrinthine plot, which gets deeper and darker as it progresses.Of course there has to be a femme fatale and here Faye Dunaway is entrusted the Mary Astor/Lauren Bacall role. However I wasn't completely convinced by her, for me she lacked the sexy allure and depths of mystery the part demands. Thus it was that at the famous expository ""Mother! Sister!"" scene, I almost burst out laughing at the fake sincerity (or should that be sincere fakery?) she employs. It was John Huston who got the acting Oscar in the movie, well deserved for his sleazy portrayal of the monstrous megalomaniacal father to Dunaway.Polanski's stylish direction is pace-perfect, unhurriedly but assuredly unfolding and then folding in again the action. The cinematography and depiction of the age couldn't be more accurate at least to these eyes and ears while the rhythmic vernacular of the dialogue is a pleasure to hear. By the time the movie reaches its bloody, tragic, but inevitable climax, you feel like one of the bystanders shooed away by the police at the end, so close have you been to the action.At one point Gittes asks the question ""How do you like them apples?"" I liked them fine, just fine.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Film That I Admire But Don't Love!,"A classic example of its genre(s) that packs in a taut screenplay which is transitioned on the film canvas in a seamless manner by a skilled filmmaker in complete control of his craft and is further bolstered by strong performances from its entire cast, Chinatown is considered by many to be one of the best offerings in the mystery genre and it is indeed difficult to dispute its legacy.Inspired from true events, the story of Chinatown is set in Los Angeles and follows a private detective specialising in matrimonial cases who's hired by a woman to investigate & confirm her suspicion of her husband having an affair but soon finds himself caught in a bigger web when the client turns out to be an impersonator. As he digs deeper into the case to find out who set him up, he uncovers a plot involving deceit, corruption & murder.Directed by Roman Polanski (best known for Rosemary's Baby & The Pianist), Chinatown is expertly crafted with thorough attention given to its setting & timeline, and the story unfolds in a controlled manner. Robert Town's script is a highlight too that's completely focused on its lead character without discarding the secondary ones. The technical aspects are skilfully carried out while Jerry Goldsmith's score is beautiful, poignant & haunting at the same time.The cast comprises of Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Hillerman & others, with all of them turning in a committed performance in their given roles. Nicholson is excellent as the private investigator, plays his character with finesse, and is present in virtually every single scene. Dunaway also puts up a strong show that goes neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the film is at its best when the screen is shared by Nicholson & Dunaway for their spot- on chemistry just works.On an overall scale, Chinatown doesn't seem to do much wrong with its narrative over the course of its runtime and yet I have no clue to why it didn't work out for me. Polanski's no- nonsense direction, Towne's polished screenplay & Nicholson's brilliant work are no doubt admirable but the whole experience of sitting through it was pretty stale, even in moments of big reveal including the soul-shattering climax. One of those films that I admire but feel no love for it, Chinatown is still full of surprises for newcomers and is highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Except for the Ending, this is a classic film!","This film follows Roman Polanski's mindset. By the time, he directed Chinatown, Polanski had survived the Holocaust in Poland and survived the Manson trial. I know Polanski is guilty of molesting a young girl and fled the country. Those events occurred after this film. For the record, Jack Nicholson is brilliant as Jake, a man with a conscious. Fay Dunaway is brilliant as Mrs. Mulray and the legendary John Huston acting as her father is bone-chilling. The film is the story about life in Los Angeles during the great depression when it was nothing at the time before all the development. It's hard to believe that Los Angeles was once a small town that prospered into the entertainment capital of the world. It has become one of the world's priciest places to live in or around. The story is well-known especially about the relationship between Mrs. Mulray and her father, Mr. Cross. But in 1974, they never would have revealed such truths. After all, Huston plays a powerful wealthy businessman and investor. I am giving it a nine because I dislike the ending. It's chilling for me to see the wrong person to be killed and another character on the way to be victimized.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As good as American film gets.,"A boatload of major Hollywood talent is on their game in this intricately complex tale of murder and corruption in 30s LA. Featuring a multi layered script of sub plot and deception by Robert Towne, impeccably translated by the florid cinema syntax of director Roman Polanski.JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a successful snoop dealing mainly in marital discord. When he's hired by a woman posing as the wife of the Water Commissioner, things immediately get ugly as prevarication runs rampant and people get hurt.Chinatown is a perfect blend of form and content. Every shot counts, every camera movement precise and for a reason. All characters resonate no matter how insignificant they may seem. For two hours he keeps both the audience and protagonist Gittes in the dark as he offers up one outstanding set piece after the next in a park, restaurant or a morgue brilliantly transitioning both place and mood as he does in one that starts out in a barbershop. Bloodletting is brief and minimal but about as brutal and jolting as any you will find in film. Leads and misleads are subtle as we literally in some cases tale Jake throughout the whole film since he is in every scene allowing us to watch things unravel in real time.The sardonic Nicholson is tailor made for the role, his smart ass remarks fitting like a glove as he takes his lumps and stumbles upon evidence inadvertently doing more harm than good. Faye Dunaway's fatale is magnificently ambiguous, her icy exterior deceptive enough to allow the mystery to deepen even further into the film's running time. John Huston is tour de force avuncular creepy and Polanski in a cameo an imposing diminutive gimp with a blade.John Alton's cinematography, Richard Sylbert's production design, Sam O'Steen's editing, Anthea Sylbert's costume design and especially Jerry Goldsmith's plaintive moody score all rise in compliment to Polanski's dark polished vision.Arguably the finest American film of the last half century no amount of superlatives can convey the challenge, demand and awe to be found in one's first viewing of this cinematic masterpiece. Subsequent viewings will be void of the mystery that is perfectly shadowed from end to end yet the edifying moments of repeated showings will make the experience no less satisfying. Chinatown easily ranks with The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep as the best detective film in history. It's eloquent masterful telling by Polanski as graceful and well spoken as cinema language gets. Chinatown is film done perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Chinatown, true classic of the crime genre and a piece of art","This is a movie you have to watch at least two times to understand, appreciate and see how big of a masterpiece this movie truly is, with a superb script and a director that brings the story to the screen in a spectacular way and also does a great job at making it like a true detective case with details that are hidden in the scenes. The story is original, we get to see it through Gittes point of view and follow him through the case and it's just everything a detective story should have, a really slow pacing. The characters are well written, realistic and overall great. The soundtrack was perfect, mixing some suspenseful music with some jazz that fits the Era. The filming technique in the movie is truly remarkable, all the shots are beautiful and extraordinary.There is so many famous actors in this movie and everyone in the cast does an incredible job but Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston and Perry Lopez are the ones that stands out. But Jack Nicholson did a breathtaking performance that went down in history. Just wow as he does such a great job as an PI and all the emotion he puts into the role.Truly one of the best movies in the world!
""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the very best...,"""Chinatown"" is the sort of film which could only have been made in the early 1970s--after the veil of censorship was lifted, allowing filmmakers to explore the dark, gritty side of life and address controversial topics, but before the major studios completely lost their old-fashioned class and style.  It is the link between the classic film-noir of the 1940s and the recent renaissance in the genre that has produced films like ""L.A. Confidential"".  It's also a damn good movie... one of my all-time favorites.Jack Nicholson is fantastic as Jake, the anti-hero gumshoe with a checkered past, who uncovers a dark conspiracy.  Faye Dunaway also gives a solid performance in a very complex role, and John Huston plays a wonderfully malevolent villain.  Director Roman Polanski brilliantly captures the atmosphere of 1930s LA, with its stark contrasts: sunshine and dark underworlds, personal freedom and powerful corrupt elites, beautiful people and ugly secrets.  The plot twists and turns wildly but not implausibly.  We follow Jake as he puts together a very complicated puzzle and runs afoul of the wrong people.  The action builds in a crescendo to one of the most unexpected and memorable endings in cinematic history.It's no coincidence that this movie came out in 1974, the year in which the long and sordid Watergate scandal brought down a corrupt and dangerous President.  ""Chinatown"" reflects the mood of the times--the men in power are amoral and self-serving, the police are part of the problem, an individual has little chance against the system.  Yet, with its setting in the fondly-remembered past, ""Chinatown"" clearly carries the message that the American Dream has always had an ugly side...  the happy ending has always been a hollow lie.  Both groundbreaking and timeless, this is one of the truly great films.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
mmm...,"Maybe it is because I am not in a 'particular' state of mind when I saw this film, or if it is because I shouldn't watch this film straight after ""the deer hunter"", I didn't really click with this film. I don't really understand why Chinatown as a title is appropriate. Is the plot that exciting, isn't it just a typical crime story with a slight twist in the end? Jack's performance was good, but I am being very nice here since I would say his performance in ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" out shadowed this many folds. I don't know, maybe it is my own fault, maybe you should never watch anything after the deer hunter.",,Anonymous,Mystery
I've seen Jack so much better.,"Chinatown (1974) -I can see that as a ""Modern"" interpretation of a classic Hollywood film noir story and production, this film may have been classed as interesting at some point. That must be why it made it on to two of the Top 100 film lists that I'm crossing off, but looking at it in 2022 from a purely entertaining perspective, it really wasn't.It's very slow and dull and nothing that I haven't seen many times before and better.I think that Jack Nicholson's Git character solved it in the end, but I was so bored by then that I can't say exactly how.Nobody delivered a performance worth writing about and even the sets and costumes were nothing outstanding.There was a very brief glimpse of Jack's bottom, but not enough to tell whether it was nice or not and if you like women's boobies then Faye Dunaway's get a bit of an airing, however there are plenty of other films out there with nudity and a good story as well.Honestly, the Star Trek episode where Picard and Data get stuck in the Holodeck in a similar storyline, has more going for it than this.*Maybe I did fall asleep and missed something crucial, maybe the reason why it's actually called 'Chinatown', which was really unclear, but I won't be watching it again to find out.

Brilliant Modern Noir,"Film noir doesn't get any better than this.  Gone are the cookie cutter cliches that litter the less imaginative of the genre.  Instead, we have a film propelled by a rare depth, attention to detail, and desire for realism. Thanks to the more permissive cultural environment surrounding filmmaking in the 1970s, we get a movie of haunting power which would be as impossible to make today as it would have been in the 40s.All the elements of classic film noir are present.  We have a tough, gritty private detective.  On the outside, he's a cold man.  But we sense a great weight on his shoulders, and in the end we see that he is motivated more than he lets on by heroic qualities hidden in his own nature.  We have a beautiful, mysterious, and quite possibly dangerous ""femme fatale"".  We have a convoluted plot, which seems to kick off simply enough, but soon spirals out of all control.  We have color photography.Wait a minute?  Black and white photography is a staple of film noir!  How you have film noir in color?  I don't know, but it works.  The film has a kind of dry, parched look to it.  The colors are very dull and muted. Everything is sort of drab and brown.  It's a wonderful look, and it's essential to the ambience of the film.But what really makes this stand out from the crowd is the realism of the story.  J. J. Gittes is a far more real character than Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade.  Like those who came before him, Gittes has a casual, relaxed demeanor, a sharp sense of humor, and a no-nonsense tough-guy persona. But he's not half as slick as those others.  His dialogue, every bit as colorful as Marlowe's or Spade's, has far less of the Hollywood polish and wit to it.The story is really remarkable.  Of course, the censors would have gone insane over this script back in the 40s.  I mean, not only is it a lot too sexually explicit, but the ending is all wrong.  This is what makes ""Chinatown"" such a great film in its own right, and not just another modern homage to great films of the past.  It takes full advantage of the tenor of the times to create a story that couldn't have been done before.The story is very complex and challenges the viewer to connect their own dots.  The big picture is easy enough to understand, but the details are easy to overlook.  Fortunately, ""Chinatown"" stays focused on the story, and never lets the stars get in the way.I'm shocked to see people disapproving of the ending of this film.  I'm even more shocked to see that scriptwriter Bob Towne disagreed with Polanski over it during the production of the film.  How could this film end any differently?  The whole thing is constantly building up this idea of Chinatown, where the best thing to do is as little as possible.  In order for the film to hang together, to stay true to its thematic core, there must be a tragic ending.  This isn't Roman Polanski shooting a dark film to fit his dark mood, this is a capable and astute director filming the only ending that matters.  If the film had ended the other way, you could still say it was a very good film.  I mean, the cast would still be uniformly excellent. The story would still be fascinating and shocking.  The cinematography would have been the same.  But it's heart would have been cut out.  And it could never have been the classic that is today.This is one of the very best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The greatest!,"Having just viewed ""Chinatown"" for the second time, I can call it quite possibly the greatest film ever made--a model of cinematic perfection that may have never been equalled, at least as far as I have seen.  It took a brazenly ambitious concept--a film noir in color--and pulled it off masterfully, managing to incorporate sunlight into the noir milieu and creating a palette that reflected the parched, burned-out atmosphere.  And unlike many old noirs, it does not compromise its mood with a ridiculous happy ending, but rather one that completes its gloomy, desperate vision in a setting that makes perfect thematic sense.  The script, the acting, the music, the costumes--along with Polanski's direction these mesh perfectly together to create a whole and coherent artistic vision.  A masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The best film ever.,"This classic film noir has everything.  The actors are not just playing these parts, these ARE these parts.  How Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunway did not get Oscars for these parts is beyond me.   The script has so many twists and turns you really have to listen to everything.  The way water is used as a symbol in this movie is great.  You must see this.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Water and Power,"What makes Chinatown so good? It begins with Robert Towne's screenplay, which resonates on many levels. The story is about water,  ""Where life begins"", as wealthy businessman Noah Cross (John Huston) tells J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private investigator with more moxie than polish. Who controls water has power. Water runs underground, its ebb and flow controlled by forces that we do not understand.You can think of water as the unconscious, the id, capitalism, the government, the powers that be, insert your own symbolism and it works. It's the classic Noir cosmology: the hero is just a little man in the big city, and there are forces beyond his control that determine his destiny. ""You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me you don't"", Noah Cross tells Gittes. The implications reverberate through the lives of all the characters.The production design and cinematography are beautiful. The locations capture the look and feel of pre-WW II Los Angeles. Jerry Goldsmith's score moves from lush and romantic to sparse and dissonant at all the appropriate moments. Roman Polanski shows that a Pole can understand of the American Private Detective tradition as well as the German Billy Wilder.  Nicholson has the guts to play a romantic lead with a bandage on his nose through half the movie. John Huston uses his small amount of screen time to create a frightening and memorable portrait of corrupted wealth. If there is a false note in the movie, it might be in the chemistry between Nicholson's Gittes and the beautiful but fragile Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). While everyone quotes the last line of the movie, Dunaway has a great Noir line: ""I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes. My lawyer does.""This movie deserves its reputation as a classic. You can revisit it many times, and still have fun exploring the labyrinths of Chinatown.",,Anonymous,Mystery

The plot is simply fascinating -- one cannot help but to be enthralled by the constantly unwravelling story.  Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and John Huston all give brilliant performances which complement the flawless screenplay (which won an acadmey award, unlike the film itself, which lost to the sequel to ""The Godfather"").  The noir style of this film is not simply a throwback to the classics of the 1930s and 40s; it is noir at its best, something to be enjoyed on its own.  I've read some comments here by people who are afraid that today's generation will find this movie slow-moving or boring; I have to disagree with this assertion, as I, at the age of 18, was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time.

Very good but top 250 worthy? Not really,"My summary refers to the fact that this movie has a very high score of 8,3 and it's on IMDB's top 250, meaning that this is a masterpiece. I was curious for years about it because of this and also because being a Jack Nicholson fan, I hope one day to finish all his movies. Last April I finally saw it and I simply liked it, while with such a rating and glowing reviews I expected to love it. I'll be brief as possible since there are more than 600 reviews to date.The story is set in 1937. Jake Gittes (Nicholson) is a private investigator that one day is hired by Evelyn Mulwray for investigating on her husband Hollis's unfaithfulness and Hollis is also the engineer that directs the department for water and electricity in Los Angeles. After lots of investigations and intrigues Jake will finally arrive to the truth.The acting was good by all, not surprisingly by Nicholson. The settings and twists and turns were ok. But what was an issue for me is that from time to time the pace was slow and at 2 hours and 10 minutes, a trimming wouldn't have been so bad.

A woman hires a man to stalk her cheating husband.,"This was an interesting film. I loved the coloring in it, it was vibrant but it wasn't too obnoxious. It made the movie seem more dramatic. The acting wasn't all that great, I feel like the actual plot is what they were trying to portray more than the characters. It was a pretty socially risky plot, too. It wasn't unheard of having a male commit fidelity but a woman was another story. On top of that, she hired someone to watch him which a woman would have never done in that time period. I felt like the meaning behind it was that it takes two to make mistakes in marriages and commit infidelity.

Great Film- Nicholson and Dunaway at Their Best,"I watched this recently though I'd seen it before a long time ago... back before I think I was really mature enough to pick up on all the subtle nuances that make this film so powerful. I get it now.This film requires ALL of your attention and patience. It is easy to miss details that really make the film work. It is easy for it to ""not make any sense"" and get ""boring"" quickly if you don't pay attention. It is basically a detective story and every detail and word counts. Nothing is spelled out for the viewer and not much is obvious at first glance but everything is there for a reason and it pays off in a big way if you can hang with it as the pieces eventually fall into place.It was also helpful that the DVD had a special feature interviewing some of the makers of the film, including the director, Roman Polanski, who actually has a really good cameo role. Some of the details of the film are better explained and make more sense or are more powerful after watching the interviews. For example, there is a lot of mention about ""Chinatown"" and ""doing as little as possible"" while there regarding what happened in the past to the main character, though it is never really explained until the interview of the special feature section. While not much of the film is actually set in ""Chinatown"" and why it would be titled that is confusing in itself. But it makes more sense after watching the interviews... though it still isn't really that big of a thing.Another thing I noticed about this film is that I believe Jack Nicholson was a big influence on Leonardo DiCaprio. Watch this film and see if you don't notice Leo acting in the exact same way in many of his roles. I think Leo has completely absorbed and emulates Nicholson's character in this film. It looks like Leo's default acting style.Anyway, this is such a great film but unfortunately, it is not appropriate for today's masses as they don't have the patience and attention span to watch it. But hey, Shakespeare isn't for the masses today either but that doesn't make his work less brilliant.This is one of the best movies of the 70's (or really of any time). Try to get a version that has the special feature interviews if possible. It will be that much more meaningful.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Depressing but complex and riveting,"A murder mystery set in 1930s Los Angeles. Jack Nicholson plays a private detective named Jake Gittes. Evelyn Mulwray hires him to discover if her husband is cheating on her. What starts off as a simple cases quickly snowballs into an intricate and complex scheme involving a mysterious and possibly deadly woman (Faye Dunaway) and her very rich father Noah Cross (John Huston).I caught this originally at a revival theatre in the mid 1980s. I was fascinated but the downbeat ending depressed me incredibly. I've seen it multiple times since then. I STILL think the ending is not necessary (screenwriter Robert Towne complained a lot that director Roman Polanski changed his happy ending into a horrifying one) but I find the entire movie fascinating. It catches the 1930s perfectly down to the clothes, the houses, the cars--everything. The script is very involved--you have to pay strict attention or you'll miss some of the many twists. The script deservedly won an Academy Award. The acting is just great--Nicholson, Dunaway and Huston are just perfect in their roles. It runs over two hours but I was never once bored. The cinematography and music just add to the 1930s mood. Also this was the last film Roman Polanski directed in the USA before leaving to avoid being jailed on rape charges. Beautifically directed, acted and shot. A 10 all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

He nose you know!,"Chinatown is directed by Roman Polanski and written by Robert Towne. It stars Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, Perry Lopez and John Hillerman. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by John A. Alonzo.Private investigator J.J. Gittes (Nicholson) is working on an adultery case but quickly finds himself embroiled in murder and corruption.The gathering of Polanski, Towne, Nicholson and Robert Evans (producer) put their respective skills together to craft one of the most lauded neo-noir films of all time. It's a searing picture awash with the staples of the film noir and gumshoe detective movies that graced cinema in the 40s and 50s. From the characterisations (suspicious femmes - mouthy coppers - sleazy kingpin - tough protagonist in a whirlpool of unravelling layers), to the hard boiled script, violence, sex and brutal revelations, it's a noir essential that only lacks chiaroscuro and expressionistic swirls to seal the complete deal.Allegories unbound, iconography assured and dialogue now in the lexicon of legends, Chinatown is not to be missed, not just by fans of noir, but fans of cinema, period. 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dark noir,"With reservoir levels dropping to fractions of capacity, California and the American West in a perilous cycle of droughts, and the battle for water resources about to begin in earnest, watching Chinatown could not be timelier. While water diversion provides the basis for the story and that may sound a little dry (sorry, yes I said that), this is about greed, power, and corruption, and if you like your noir super dark, this is probably your film. It's very well made, the pace is good (even if it may be a teensy bit too long at 131 minutes), and story unfolds nicely, without being plagued by contradictions or holes.The types of roles in the film are common to the genre and the casting is strong, with Jack Nicholson as the private eye, Faye Dunaway as the femme fatale, and John Huston as the heavy. It's not all that hard to figure out what's going on, but director Roman Polanski gives us some lovely little wrinkles leading up to an absolutely devastating ending. My only real complaint was the treatment of Asian-Americans, which was poor, including a racist joke, the servant characters with stereotypical accents, and the overtones of the seediness and immorality of Chinatown, even if not much of the film takes place there. Overall, though, one that will stick with you, for its commentary on the way of the world.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
classic modern noir,JJ 'Jake' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a tough private detective. A woman (Diane Ladd) claiming to be Water and Power Chief Engineer Hollis Mulwray's wife wants him to investigate her cheating husband. Hollis opposes the new dam. Jake is able to get pictures of Hollis and a blonde. It gets on the front page of the papers. The real wife Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) confronts Jake and plans to sue. Then Hollis is found dead at the reservoir.Director Roman Polanski creates such a great hard-boiled noir feel. He takes an obscure subject and makes it fascinating.

This isn't a perfect movie but is very good and cinematic gold,"Chinatown (1974) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime for the first time in a long time. The storyline follows a private detective who is hired by a woman to spy on her husband. A few days after he is hired he is approached by another woman and informed she is the wife of the husband and she will be suing him. When the husband ends up dead the woman who plans on suing the detective will now need to work with him. This movie is directed by Roman Polanski (The Tenant) and stars Jack Nicholson (The Shining), Faye Dunaway (Bonnie and Clyde), Diane Ladd (Wild at Heart), John Huston (Casino Royale) and Perry Lopez (Kelly's Heroes). The storyline for this is very intricate with several clever twists and turns. I loved the attire and settings in this and Nicholson was perfect as the main character. I loved his ""fight scenes"" and the beatings he took were hilarious. The dialogue was clever and well executed and the ending was perfect.

One of the Best of the Best,"Noir films were more a part of the cultural mainstream during the 1930s through the 1950s than they are today. Hardboiled detective films used to flood the theaters of yesteryear as superhero films flood theaters today. Everyone from Humphrey Bogart (""The Maltese Falcon"") to Jimmy Stewart (""Vertigo"") to Orson Welles (""The Third Man"") donned the fedora and proverbial magnifying glass. ""Chinatown"" might have arrived thirty years past the primetime of noir films, but it still is one of the best of the genre.
Jake himself is one of the better noir protagonists, because while he might fit some of the detective tropes, he also makes the role his own. One of the main things that make Jake interesting is the journey he takes a character. When we first meet Jake, he doesn't seem particularly content in his work; he seems to be doing it just to make ends meet. But as the film goes on, we watch as Jake's casual approach to his job falls away, and he frantically scrambles to find out what happens. Watching Jake shift from an uncaring and distant detective to a detective so personally involved in the case not only makes him a thrilling character, it makes the ending so much more intense and tragic.
Another thing I really like about this film is that nothing really feels forced as far as storyline. I've read my fair share of mystery novels and seen more than my fair share of mystery movies, and it always bugs me how many overly coincidental moments play into the detective (or protagonist) solving the mystery. Even in some of Polanski's other works, I've taken issue with the way some revelations are handled. For example, in ""The Ghost Writer"", there's a scene where the protagonist (played by Ewan McGregor) gets information only because he gets caught on the other side of an island during a rainstorm and he just happens to stop at a house where a character saw some vital information and was willing to relay it to the protagonist. That whole scene felt incredibly coincidental, yet the film wouldn't have worked without it. ""Chinatown"" doesn't really have any of those moments; instead, the script is drum-tight.
Without going into any details, just know that the last scene of this film is the scene that solidifies its greatness. The ending sells the bleakness of the themes and world in a way that feels tragic but totally unavoidable. No matter what Jake did, the film was always going to end the way that it did, and that really emphasizes the hopelessness of the world that Polanski has so carefully crafted. It might not be a happy film (this is Polanski we're talking about- he doesn't have many happy films), but it is a brilliant representation of the noir genre, and one of the most memorable detective films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Chinatowns influence is still felt today as it has inspired many other more recent films, LA Confidential to name one.

It's as Good as You've Heard (or Studied),"Not just for fans of Jack Nicholson, Roman Polanski's expertly crafted mid-70's riff on mid-40's film noir that takes place in Los Angeles circa the mid 30's is everything it's cracked up to be.  On one hand, it's simply a rock-solid mystery thriller chock full of quotable dialogue (my favorite line is Gettis to a police officer, ""Nevermind, you're dumber than you think I thought you were.""), political intrigue, snazzy private eyes, troublesome dames, grizzled henchmen, and excellent plot twists that service the story and aren't just there for the sake of surprise.  The scene where Gettis is slapping around Faye Dunaway's character in an attempt to get to the truth about the mystery girl is probably the best executed and most brilliantly conceived way to reveal a shocking plot twist in a movie that I have ever seen.  That alone would make it a damn fine film, but helmed by Polanksi, it's also a great work of art in terms of lighting, set design, pacing, and all those wonderful details.Any time you think you spot a cliche or a genre cop-out, just remember this film probably did it first or was weaving and executing it in such a brilliant way as to make the term cliche moot.  The only traditional film noir to even come close to this level of brilliance since is Curtis Hanson's much thicker and twistier ""LA Confidential"" and that was over twenty years later.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A remarkable picture.,"Chinatown is and incredible experience, one of the best in film history. The story is captivating and the direction is perfect as the audience begins to figure out what is going on at the same time Jack Nicholson's J.J. Gittes does. In brief, Gittes is a private detective who is investigating alleged affairs between the water commissioner Hollis Mulwray and some woman. As Gittes continues to search, he finds way more than he bargained for including an alluring, mysterious woman with a dark secret, her rich and psychologically powerful father, and a plan that will forever change the future of the city of Los Angeles. Modeled after the classic film noirs of the 1930s and 1940s, Chinatown perfectly captures that era with wonderful sets, terrific acting, smooth directing, and a script hailed today as one of the best ever written.

Indelibly etched on the noir landscape.,"Even though it was made in 1974, almost 30 years after the 'noir period' in Hollywood could be said to have ended, Chinatown remains as much one of the hallmarks of that classic style as do movies from the golden era themselves (""The Big Sleep"", ""Touch of Evil"" etc)Director Polanski and screenwriter Towne have created a faultless universe filled with some of the most memorable characters ever to grace a cinema screen.  Chief amongst these is embittered private eye Jake Gittes, played expertly by Jack Nicholson.  Gittes has a quick wit and a low tolerance for fools, but he won't rest until he's finally solved a case. When Evelyn Mulray (Dunaway) appears on the scene, it sets in motion an astonishing chain of events that harks back to an era in Jake's life he's trying to put behind him.

Couple of interesting points,"I once took a class in screen writing in Hollywood and there was general agreement that this was the best screenplay ever written. A couple of trivia points that may be of some interest. There was a great scene with the wonderful actor Royal Dano that for reasons never made clear Polanski edited out at the last minute. It happened just before Gittes goes in search of the Orange groves in the valley. That was a mistake by Polanski. There was a scene in the script in which Gittes is in an airplane flying to meet Noah Cross for the first time where the pilot actually tells Gittes that there was a rumor that Cross had an incestuous relationship with his daughter. BIG mistake by R. Towne to foreshadow like that and the right decision by Polanski to cut it out. Also, Polanski and Faye Dunaway absolutely despised each other on the set culminating in the now famous confrontation with Polanski actually dropping his pants and pissing on her script notes in front of her. Just a great movie all around!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Polanski's Peak,"Nicholson is ideally cast as a private detective in the mold of Philip Marlowe who's drawn into a mysterious web of murder, politics, and corruption. Dunaway gives perhaps the best performance of her career as the tormented Femme Fatale with a secret past. The fine supporting cast includes Huston as a menacing patriarch. This is the best film on Polanski's impressive resume and he beautifully evokes 1930s L.A. with a film noir look composed of muted colors, perfectly complemented by Goldsmith's moody score and Towne's Oscar-winning script.

Sensing Jack's thoughts,"This is a true gem among the many superb movies that were made in the seventies. Polanski manages to not only capture the spirit and feel, to say nothing of the look, of film noir movies, but also to make a film noir movie that is riveting and exciting in its own right, about thirty years after the Golden Age of that particular genre. Every scene here is a work of art, every nuance is thrilling, nothing is neglected. You get the eerie feeling of mystery, the milieu and ambience of the thirties, the odd characters and much more. Jack Nicholson's acting here is outstanding. Most of the time he doesn't have to say anything, really. By sheer acting he manages to convey every feeling. Every disappointment, every agony, every curiosity, every witticism. After having seen this movie, you are left with a tremendously exhilarating feeling that you have really seen something special. The movie remains a reliable and wonderful friend. Chinatown richly deserves the rating ""10"" that I have given it. See it if you haven't already!!!

"""Chinatown"" is simple but elegant, a noir for the 70s","The best crime films of all time continue to prove that they're not about the action and the plot twists. While ""Chinatown"" certainly keeps you guessing, it's the style of the film and the acting that make it so good. You don't watch ""Chinatown"" when you're in the mood for a good thriller--you watch it when you want to see fine film-making.""Chinatown"" is about a private investigator named J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) who is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, the wife of the man in charge of Los Angeles' water supply, to find out who her husband is having an affair with. When her husband turns up dead and the woman Gittes thought was Mulwray was actually someone else, Gittes and the real Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) begin an investigation and a relationship in the process of discovering the truth. Gittes eventually finds himself in a bit of trouble as he tries to figure it all out, including receiving a slashed nose (a character played by director Roman Polanski)It is only fitting that the character who scars Gittes is played by Polanski himself. He leaves a mark on Gittes that we see for the rest of the film, that is symbolic of his own marks on the film as a director. First of all, Polanski is at his prime with this film. His semi-first person camera angles and pans seem to really suit the film well. While he had a ton of help from screenwriter Robert Towne (who won the only Oscar the film received), the characters' subtleties are by far their most interesting and important features.Nicholson and Dunaway do some great noir acting. Nicholson is a clever, foul-mouthed, lovably dislikable protagonist and Dunaway succeeds at portraying the fact that her character appears to be hiding something from Gittes in nearly every scene. Both were worthy of their Oscar nominations. The film doesn't work without them both being very interesting characters to watch.As with any mystery that's really not so much about the mystery and more about subtleties, ""Chinatown"" warrants a second viewing. You need to be able to spend more time paying attention to Nicholson's references to his life in Chinatown, for example, and spend less time trying to make sense of the plot. The plot is certainly interesting and the ending really delivers what you've been waiting for in a film where people are getting mixed up in things they shouldn't be.

"Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown..","Roman Polanski's neo-noir ""Chinatown"" presents a nihilistic outlook on mankind.

The bleakness is pretty impressive.The detective himself ain't doing much better, unable to define between right and wrong, and also repeating the same mistakes he made in the past when he served in the police-force in Chinatown. And so it is, the ending brings him back to Chinatown, where his actions damn the people he's supposed to protect. However, it's his detachment which dominates; a cowardly submission to fate; a depression.The ending is great, aided by a moody jazzy soundtrack.

Chinatown: 8/10,"Please note: I saw this movie edited for TV, so my review may have been different if I saw it unedited.Chinatown plays much like an old film-noir, except this is in color, which, for some reason, works very well. In it, Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gettes. He's a private dick and is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to look at her husband, since she thinks he's cheating on her. He then gets involved in a murder case and something with losing water in L.A. (which was quite smaller in the 40's, I learned).Don't watch this alone! Actually, what I mean by that is watch it with someone else so you can ask them questions during the film. I'm glad I had that advantage. It's a really entertaining movie that also keeps you enthralled, not knowing what's going to happen next. Yet, it deservedly won its Best Original Screenply, which includes one-liners like: `Is that your phone number?' `I don't know, I don't call myself that often.' I laughed a couple times, which lightened the mood. I liked the mystery; I kept on guessing, but in the last half hour or so, I decided to just stop and let the entertainment speak for itself.Nicholson did a very good job, what with the sliced nose and all. He made me believe that he was a P.I. The camerawork, though nothing impressive, showed us the timepiece, and I really thought I was in the 40's, set in some old noir that came to color. I supposed that was director Roman Polanski's idea all along. By the way, Polanski has a cameo as the hood who slices Jake's nose. Dunaway seemed to be perfect for the part, at least on what I've seen in the few old noirs I've seen.The reason I didn't give Chinatown a higher rating is that I found myself playing with a paper clip a few times. I also wasn't really `thrilled' much, just into the mystery. The music was scarce but it was effective. I wish I could say more, but my memory's hazy, so I'll leave you with just saying `see it'!My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and violence.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Cross made his millions in real estate and land development with the help of Hollis Mulwary his son-in-law. It's not long after that Mr. Mulwary ends up dead in the L.A reservoir with the L.A coroner concluding that his death was either an accident or suicide!Gittes knowing that Mr. Mulwary was actually murdered in that he opposed Cross' plan to build a dam that will in fact threaten the people, mostly farmers, who live around it goes out of his way to find out who in fact did murder Mr. Mulwary. Gittes suspicions are confirmed in the fact that Mr. Mulwary's lungs were filled with salt water making it impossible that he drowned in the fresh water L.A reservoir.the kicker to this whole shady project, the building of the dam, is soon discovered, with the help of Mrs. Sessions, by PI Gittes in that Cross and his stooges in the L.A City government are buying up the land that's to be irrigated by the dam dirt cheap from the hard pressed farmers. With a bill later in the year to be voted on by the people of L.A, that's sure to pass, the valley will become part of Los Angeles proper and be worth some 30 million dollars! A fraction of what Cross & Co. bought it for!The crooked land deal angle of ""Chinatown"" is really secondary to what the real deal in the movie is and that has to do with the mysterious young woman whom the late Mr. Hollis Mulwary was involved with. It's that young woman that's been kept secret by both Mr. Cross and his daughter Evelyn Mulwary from PI Gittes. In the end she's the reason for both Cross & Evelyn's strange and unnatural actions in the film. That's until her true identity is revealed at the conclusion of the movie which just about blew Gittes mind!Dark and suspenseful film noir with Jack Nicholson at his best as PI Gittes finding out that he bit off far more the he can chew in taking on the powerful and at the same time degenerate Noah Cross. Gittes should have known better that he just can't win in his fight with Cross and the people that he controlled,that included the entire LAPD. It was Gittes' cockiness in that he could derail Cross' plan that lead to the tragedy at the end of the movie that took place in the Chinatown section of L.A.Director Roman Polaski beside making one of the classic film noir films of the post WWII Hollywood era also had a cameo appearance in the movie paying one of Cross' knife wielding hoods. Polanski was the person who sliced open Gittes nose having him go through almost the entire movie with a massive bandage on his face.

A beautifully made mystery,"""Chinatown"" is a very well-made film about two interrelated scandals in 1930s Los Angeles.  Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway play J.J. Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray, a detective and a woman who hires him.  She hires him to find out how and why her husband, Chief Water & Power Engineer Hollis Mulwray, was killed.  The things that Gittes must go through in order to find the truth of the matter will have you frightened and spellbound, perhaps just as much as the character was.The filmmaking here is quite beautiful.  Panoramic views of Los Angeles mixed in with intimate moments inside colorful houses and buildings make for diverse visuals.  The costumes portray the period with brilliant accuracy. The acting is quite believable, and the characters are very similar to those you would find in a Chandler or Hammett novel (i.e. The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity).  Don't be fooled by that though, in this film, nothing is as it seems.  This is one of those movies that stays with you after you see it.  You'll have great debates with your friends about the ending, and you'll want to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Utterly brilliant,"Such an effortlessly perfect film. All the elements are right from the casting (John Huston is an inspired choice) to Polanski's direction (the consistent behind-the-ear shots) to John Alonzo's cinematography to the score to Towne's magnificent screenplay.It comes in an era where nostalgia for this genre was big. Some films like the Robert Mitchum Chandler adaptations were pure nostalgia. Some like Altman's version of ""The Long Goodbye"" pull it into the 70's as a comment on that era.This is neither of those. It's more like a complete retelling of the past to reveal the rot hidden in the older versions.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"My sister, my daughter","CHINATOWN (1974)	****Some films are obligatory for a person serious about cinema. CHINATOWN is one of them. It is the best film Roman Polanski ever directed, and see that is not easy to be better than ROSEMARY'S BABY, REPULSION, THE TENANT and TESS. It is maybe the best mystery film ever made... Yes, tying PSYCHO and VERTIGO... Okay, so it is the best film-noir ever made- and see that is not easy to be better than THE MALTESE FALCON and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. The American Film Institute gave it a glorious place on their list of 100 best films of all time- #19, above the Oscar winner of that year (1975): THE GODFATHER- PART II. That's really fair, at least. CHINATOWN is superbly directed, amazingly acted and perfectly written- in resume, flawlessly made.Presented by Roman Polanski himself as a homage to the film-noir, CHINATOWN is admirable in every scene. The story is so clever, so intelligent, so complex, so carefully built that you can't say you would take something or complain that a thing should have been done this way or that... And what's better: the film isn't dated by any means. Now, in 2000, 26 years after its release, it is as impacting and jaw-dropping as in 1974. So today's audiences can easily enjoy this classic puzzle, if I can say that way.Telling much of the story is not only spoiling, but a crime. The basic is this: a LA private detective named Jake Gittes is visited by a woman named Evelyn Mulwray, who thinks that her husband is having an affair. Gittes thinks this is just another case, but then the husband dies in mysterious circumstances and there's something related to the city's water crisis... The story offers endless twists, but they are intelligent and always come in the right time, making you jump from your seat. Of course it calls for attention, but it is never confusing or difficult. Instead of this, it is tense, suspenseful and entertaining.The Oscar winning screenplay is one of the best ever written, combining classic mystery with some smart twists and turns. I'm not exaggerating, because everything on it is flawless, from the dialogues (with an unusual kind of black humor) to the character development. And Roman Polanski proves that he was once a master. There isn't a needless scene, a disposable character or window dressing. With great film editing, score and cinematography, the climate for a film-noir is perfect.Much of the merit goes to the acting. Jack Nicholson is amazing as always as Gittes- it seems that the character was made for him. Faye Dunaway gives another astonishing performance. She plays a multi-faced Evelyn Mulwray, sometimes cold, sometimes romantic. She's not the kind of character you can always trust in, but sometimes you do. One of my favorite scenes, not only in CHINATOWN, but in films in general, is the one when she explains a certain thing to Gittes: ""She's my sister, she's my daughter..."" Not to talk about John Huston, in a key, memorable role, and a cameo by director Polanski.Perfectly crafted and always surprising, CHINATOWN is a classic and a masterpiece in every sense of the word. It is a film about ambiguity, or about the many meanings a thing can assume, and about the mystery that is human nature: a lover is not only a lover, a father is not only a father, a sister is not only a sister, a murder is not only a murder, a pair of glasses are not only a pair of glasses, a lake in the backyard is not only a lake... Everything will be solved (or won't it?) in the last scene, one of the most memorable moments of cinema. There's no score in the background, the camera gets out of control, just as the characters do. It's when one of the characters gets back to a place where his life was changed years before, and the story seems to be repeating. It's impacting. An unforgettable conclusion to an unforgettable film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

it's those looks that count,"The whole movie gives me a great, warm feeling everytime I watch it. Robert Towne's script is perfectly directed and acted. The scene that epitomizes just how well everything comes together is so simple: Nicholson is waiting in the car for Dunaway after meeting with her daughter/sister. He knows he's been lied to and Dunaway enters the car, startled by his presence. He asks for the keys. She acts surprised. He says, ""It's either that or you drive to the police yourself..."" Again, she acts clueless. It is here where Nicholson makes the slightest of facial gestures, right before saying, ""C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray-- you've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there."" The whole scene is marvelous, and the facial expression makes it.There are so many tiny moments like these--so true to real life--and it heightens everything the movie has to offer.""The district attorney gives his men advice like that?""""They do in Chinatown.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"The Score! and.. it's ""lose"" NOT  ""loose"" !!!!","Another reason to see ""Chinatown"" is for the incredible score by Jerry Goldsmith. The following is something a friend of mine Steve Horowitz wrote to me about the score: ""The film score for CHINATOWN is as famous for the conditions under which it was written as it is for the music itself. Shortly before the film was to debut, producer Robert Evans discarded the score written by composer Phillip Lambro and handed the project to Jerry Goldsmith.Goldsmith had ten days to both write and record a new score before CHINATOWN debuted. The resulting score was extremely sparse, making use of several songs popular during the 1930s and resting upon a single original theme--but it proved the perfect additive to the film, and it is extremely difficult to image CHINATOWN without it Jerry Goldsmith's work on Chinatown may be the best work ever done for a film score. Utilizing an avant garde ensemble (four pianos, four harps, percussion, strings, and solo trumpet) the composer paints a sound-scape both eerie and nostalgic -- imagine listening to thirties jazz echoing through layers of deep water. The cumulative effect of this perfectly organized album is one of quiet, aching despair. The three tracks of source music add to Goldsmith's remarkable achievement. A must for anyone interested in serious instrumental music.""Finally, I would not comment on this except it is literally the fourth time today that I have seen this misspelled. The word is ""lose"" NOT ""loose."" as in ""how Nicholson could loose(sic) to Art Carney..."" PLEASE any one reading this who doesn't know the difference between lose and loose please note: A LOOSE ball that is picked up by the other team can help you LOSE the game.Thanks for your indulgence in this.

Enter the Chinatown!!!!!!!!!!,"This is Roman Polanski at his best. I had seen Roman Polanski's The Pianist before I watched Chinatown. I won't bother attempting to summarize this masterpiece. It would be an exercise in futility and would only detract from the genius of the film. Suffice it to say, the plot is complicated and watching this intricate and deadly web unfold is a source of joy that bears many repeated viewings.This is the film credited with creating the mythic figure that we know as Jack Nicholson. His portrayal of a private detective caught in a conspiracy much greater than he can handle is the maypole that the other characters, both naughty and nice, skip around. His charm and his vulnerability keep the viewer interested in the increasingly complex course of events.And the other characters, while not as prominent, are searingly memorable. John Huston's turn as a man wealthy enough to have a different set of laws apply is frighteningly understated with his power. Faye Dunaway manically switches from serenely confident to skittishly fragile as each layer of protective secrets is peeled away.You need to watch CHinatown many times. Many subtle plot points won't be caught on a single viewing. Also the hypnotic pace that is maintained is all the more powerful when you already know what is going to happen. After repeated viewings the ending in particular seems painfully inevitable and as a result all the more tragic. The cynicism of the climax is not terribly surprising when you come to know that Polanski's wife was brutally murdered by some gang several years earlier.Not long after the success of Chinatown, Roman Polanski fled to Europe avoiding a conviction for consensual sex with a thirteen year old girl. Chinatown is likely to remain the pinnacle of his work and a watershed in American cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Chinatown remains a modern classic,"Chinatown is a landmark film, made during the golden age of cinema. Featuring crisp direction, flawless acting, a taut script and a haunting soundtrack, it is a film that will leave a lasting impression on any viewer. A film noir in terms of style and content, enhanced by colour cinematography, Chinatown is a tense and complex thriller that remains a modern classic.Private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), is approached by (whom the viewer believes to be) the wife of Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwirling), the chief engineer of the Los Angeles Water and Power Company. In a seemingly routine case, Gittes is asked to uncover a marital affair, but his investigations leave him entangled in a web of corruption, murder and deceit. The film beautifully intertwines two storylines - one centring upon Los Angeles' mysterious water drought, the other upon the unpleasant and ultimately tragic life of Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). Gittes, a cocksure former policeman, launches himself into the case with vigour, but with each step, he finds himself increasingly out of his depth, unravelling a unpleasant world of extremities and moral decay. As his enquiries lead him to sinister millionaire Noah Cross (John Huston), the stage is set for an unforgettable night in Chinatown...As Gittes, Nicholson shines throughout. Clearly relishing his ample role - he is seemingly omnipresent throughout the film - the maverick, Jameson swilling Gittes is colourfully brought to life. As in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', this is a part that Nicholson was born to play. As the tortured Evelyn Mulwray, Dunaway also gives a performance of empathy, emotion and sensuality. Similarly, Huston is at ease as the unpleasant and frankly psychopathic Noah Cross. The interaction between the three main characters is a joy to behold. The chemistry between Dunaway and Nicholson is beautifully harnessed by Polanski, and the continual reference to Gittes as 'gits' by Cross provides one of the films' wittiest moments.Polanski directs with atmosphere and style. The heightened volume of incidental sounds - opening of doors, footsteps, taps of typewriter keys - adds suspense to an already atmospheric and tense thriller. Nicholson, Dunaway and Huston impeccably respond to numerous close-ups, providing intimate portrayals of their respective characters. As the plot unfolds, the viewer shares Gittes' assumptions, frustrations and feelings of helplessness, as the situation becomes more sinister and complex. Polanski does not rely too heavily on Nicholson's dynamism in the role, gaining much support from Huston, and the Oscar nominated Dunaway. Robert Towne's script is ably handled, with the viewer escorted through a maze of plots and sub-plots by a well practised guide. The bleak and bloody finale is an apt conclusion to a film that does not offer hope in a city full of decay and free of remorse.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"He who defiles his nose, defiles his face","""Chinatown"" (1974) is the second American production of Roman Polanski. After ""Rosemary's baby"" (1968) he left the USA because too many bad memories were associated with this country after the murder of his wife. A few years after ""Chinatown"" Polanski was accused of sex with a minor and again had to leave the United States.""Chinatown"" is a neo noir, but a willful one. In stead of the usual dark scenes everything in ""Chinatown"" happens in bright daylight, a reminder of the fact that Los Angelos is in fact a town in the desert. A fact which is not unimportant for the plot.Corruption has always been inextricably linked to the (neo) noir genre. Remarkable about ""Chinatown"" is that this corruption does not take place in some sort of flashy industry, but in such a dull sector as a utility. It made me think of the manipulation with electricity (also in California) in the Enron case some 25 years later.With ""Chinatown"" (1974) and ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" (1975, Milos Forman) the years 1974 and 1975 were very good years for Jack Nicholson. In ""Chinatown"" he plays the ""hard boiled"" detective J. J. Gittes. I never knew what the term ""hard boiled"" exactly stands for. Mostof the time this type of detective is less smart than the Sherlock Holmes type, and compensates for this with (a lot of) violence. In ""Chinatown"" J. J. Gittes wears the mark of this violence (a big bandaid across his nose) for most of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the finest pieces of American cinema...,"1974 was just a great year for The Motion Picture. Not only did it produce such works as THE GODFATHER PART II (possible the best movie of ALL time), THE TOWERING INFERNO, LENNY, A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE, and THE CONVERSATION, but added to that esteemed list is the magnificent CHINATOWN, which is perhaps the finest piece of film noir ever created (save for L.A. CONFIDENTIAL).Roman Polanski's thriller/mystery is easily the best film of his fine catalog, though some may argue that THE PIANIST was much more powerful. The direction and style are simply brilliant, and every scene of CHINATOWN's ~210 minute run-time is excellent, and serves a purpose in the telling of the story.The screenplay itself is also excellent, and Robert Towne deserved the Oscar hands-down. There are enough twists and turns here to keep the viewer on edge, and warrant multiple viewings. This film is not for those who find it hard to pay attention unless there is a mindless explosion or chase-sequence every 5 minutes. It is worth noting here that Towne and Polanski had a bitter series of conflicts regarding the ending of the film; a series which Polanski eventually won, much to the delight of film noir enthusiasts everywhere. Towne's ending was less realistic and more pretentious, and years later he realised that the right choice was indeed made.Jack Nicholson produces perhaps his finest piece of work, arguably even better than ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Indeed this was the film that propelled Nicholson to the level of 'superstar', and rightly so. From the start of the movie, the viewer gets the sense that his character is just another generic, super-heroic, super-smart, invincible P.I. who never seems to falter. However, as the character develops, we see that this is not the case, as we discover that the character is actually human; he feels, he cares, he makes mistakes, he even bleeds.Faye Dunaway is equally impressive as the 'femme fatale', and her interaction with Nicholson will keep the viewer intrigued and entertained. John Huston pulls off the greedy wealthy 'super-villain' as effectively as any other actor, yet for some unknown reason fell short of an Oscar nomination.The cinematography and set design are excellent, as Alonzo recreates 1930s Los Angeles in a beautifully flawless manner. The use of colour (which was seen as somewhat 'taboo' in film noirs at that time) was effective, and helped to enhance the picture rather than distract attention from the main plot.This is definitely a film that deserves multiple viewings as mentioned earlier, so that the viewer can piece together the mystery in hindsight, and discover elements that he/she missed on the first viewing. The film and screenplay could potentially work quite effectively as teaching tools in film/literature schools as the efficacy and power evoked in the direction and writing are top-notch. Indeed, the whole notion of 'CHINATOWN' works not only as a locale, but on a more profound level as a state of mind.This is altogether a brilliant movie and garners a place on any serious film viewer's Top 100. It should enter mine at #84 or so. Were it not for the supremely excellent THE GODFATHER PART II, this film would have won the Best Picture Oscar, and Roman Polanski would have won his first Best Director Oscar. (Note: He eventually won Best Director in 2002 for THE PIANIST)4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Unreservedly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Corruption Never Changes,"Roman Polanski delivers an homage to the hard-boiled noir detective movies of the 1930s. The tribute is so effective and well-polished, I half expected Humphrey Bogart to emerge from shadows and spit a grim, gravel-voiced monologue at any moment. Instead, Jack Nicholson provides his own take on the same type of role: Jake Gittes, a tenacious private detective who worms his way around the edges of a seedy murder investigation. Roped into the matter as a simple patsy, he refuses to allow the resultant smear on his reputation and doggedly pushes through a haze of lies and misdirection, finding unpleasant answers whilst dodging bald threats and thuggish violence through a mix of sharp intuition and dumb luck.Chinatown has earned a reputation for its screenplay, allegedly one of the finest ever written. I can't argue. It's a wonderfully efficient picture; every action produces a logical consequence, even if they don't surface until much later. The smart, swerving plot keeps us guessing right to the finish, assisted by a motley cast of would-be (and already-been) crooks. Jake is a magnificent protagonist, and not just in the context of grizzled noir sleuths. Hardened and cynical from years on the job, he's insatiable in his quest for the truth, not because he seeks justice but because he can't help himself. He's just gotta know. Watching Jake work is mesmerizing, particularly where it comes to his arsenal of clever little tricks. Kicking out a brake light so it's easier to tail a lead; sticking a cheap pocket watch under the tire of a parked car to pinpoint the hour it's moved; ad-libbing a phony back-story to justify his presence on private property... clearly, he's been around the block a few times. His proficiencies both inform and delight. Seems like gritty, crime-focused films from this period were big on the nuts and bolts of the work - see Coppola's The Conversation or Mann's Thief - and I just can't get enough of it. At least, not when it's done right.Chinatown does it right. It does most everything right, from the plot to the script to the casting to the historical context and underlying meaning. Enjoyable probably isn't the right word to describe a tale that ends on such a dark series of notes, but I certainly enjoyed the ride. They don't make 'em like this any more. Hell, they didn't make 'em like this in 1974, either.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Bring you down to Chinatown.,"Yet once again Jack Nicholson shows us how it's done by simply doing what he does best, playing himself. Chinatown is a unique and fairly impressive noir piece that I was only recently able to see. Much like L.A. Confidential, CT throws us right into the mix of the old days, very convincingly, through great cinematography and perfect set pieces.Chinatown is fairly effective creating a mysterious atmosphere by using shady characters of questionable backgrounds and a story that holds much more to it than what's merely on the surface. Somewhat hard to follow when compared to most films, you really must pay attention during this one. This is not one to get up and go to the bathroom during unless you hit the pause button. I found this slightly annoying at first, but then it quickly grew on me. I like how everything here isn't spelled out for you in bold letters. One must pay attention and piece things together for themselves, which is exactly how a mystery should be. It keeps you on your toes. You never seem to know which direction the story is going to take you next.Technically, the film is close to perfect. The cinematography, the score, and the acting are all top notch. All of these elements are combined into a screaming mystery flick. Some may be tempted to get bored at some point, but don't, you must pay attention. I personally enjoyed it quite well and think it's an excellent film. My one and only qualm with it though is the seemingly anti-climactic ending that, while realistic, simply comes out of nowhere without warning. I felt a tad let down at the end after all of that buildup, but the more I think about it, the more I actually like it. This, as I have heard from many people, is not a film to judge on it's first viewing, but one that must be viewed several times in order for the viewer to absorb everything. For this reason alone, and the fact that I've seen it only once, I can't bring myself to take too much away from it simply because of my one qualm with it. I must view it again and see if I like it better. I think I will do just that.Overall, a great, beautiful, classic noir that won't soon be forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A classic and timeless masterpiece,"""You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't.""Sometimes things are bigger than ourselves, and despite how much we think we can change the world eventually we are brought down to our reality: we are much smaller than we think we are and there is little we can do against the big corporate giants. That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. ""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown"" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way.Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks.This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences.

The best screenplay ever written,"When thinking of film noir, what comes to mind? THE BIG SLEEP, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, THE THIRD MAN, even L.A. CONFIDENTIAL? How about 1974's CHINATOWN? In my opinion, this is among the best noir films of all time, with those mentioned before. CHINATOWN is a nearly perfect film. The screenplay, by master of the medium Robert Towne is, in my opinion, the best ever written. It is so full of detail, characterization, plot, tone, style, and overall punch, and the fact that it is flawles makes it the best ever written. In fact, it is so flawless that it is used to teach amateur screenwriters how to write.The film itself is also nearly perfect. The acting from Nicholson and Dunaway could not have been better, nor the directing by Roman Polanski. John Huston was very interesting in his small role as well.Technically, the movie is brilliant. The cinematography by John A. Alonzo is beautiful and its bright colors strongly contradict the usual film noir fare of shadows and dark alleys. Jerry Goldsmith's score is haunting and you'll find yourself whistling it all day after you've seen the film (how it didn't win Best Score (Oscar) of 1974 is beyond me).I haven't much else to say about this film, except that I strongly recommend seeing it.My rating: 10/10.Highlights: The whole film (especially Nicholson, Dunaway, Huston, Goldsmith's score, Alonzo's cinematography, Polanski's direction and ROBERT TOWNE'S SCREENPLAY!)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you don't like this, never enter a movie theater again!","Roman Polanski directed this film set in 1940's Los Angeles before his wife, Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson's Family' and before he fled the country to avoid charges of statutory rape of an under-aged starlet.  Jack Nicholson plays a detective who is dragged into the middle of a mystery too large and too strange to describe.  Along the way he encounters Faye Dunaway and John Huston and receives a nasty wound from director Roman Polanski. Lots has been said about the direction of Roman Polanski and the acting of Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston in this classic (and I don't mean to diminish their accomplishments here at all) but major credit has to go to Jerry Goldsmith for the music, John A. Alonzo for cinematography, and Richard Sylbert for art direction.

Film Noir at its very best!,"Sure Chinatown is technically a neo-noir by modern-day standards of Hollywood genre-standards, but this film is a fantastic post-modern update of the classic film noir and telling an Uber dark story on Los Angeles only someone like Robert Towne could have done justice with his air-tight screenplay. And Roman Polanski knew exactly what visual vibes made film noirs of old rock.Chinatown is a cautionary tale; it's a character study; it's a journey into an unusually subversive kind of darkness going all the way with its mystery factor.Chinatown is must-see cinema. 5/5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perfection,"This could be the greatest movie I've ever seen. I first saw it in 1975,expecting a run of the mill Nicholson flick(although back then that was pretty good),but it was phenomenal. There is no other movie I can think of in which everything works...the acting,directing,cinematography,music,editing...everything. The movie requires you to actually think.

Classic!,"There isn't a great deal I can say in praise of this film that hasn't been said before. If you want a worthy review of this film, check out Roger Ebert or one of the other stalwart critics. They're spot on as usual about this one.A few points of praise: all the performances (Nicholson, Dunaway, Huston), the plot (Robert Towne), the direction (Polanski at his best since Repulsion), the score (Jerry Goldsmith, no surprises there)... get the picture? One little gripe is Polanski's tinkering with the ending, which might still be wonderfully tragic, but shouldn't have taken place in Chinatown. The name was not supposed to be the actual place, but a suggestion of a dark place we've been and shouldn't go back to again for the sake of our EMOTIONAL well-being, not the physical... in this case Jake's past, in which he was a beat cop in Chinatown.You might not know that a sequel, The Two Jakes, was made in 1990 with Nicholson (who directed it) and some of the key supporting cast. Most reviews pull it to pieces, except for a very well-considered one by Roger Ebert. Of course, it's not the classic Chinatown is, but it's a damned good movie. It's about the past, how it pervades our lives for the rest of our days, and how we assimilate it into our futures.So there's what I think. Chinatown is one of those movies that should never be forgotten, but one of those that will probably, and sadly, not stand up to the ever-diminishing attention spans of today's audiences.

Perfect in every sense,"After seeing this for 5-6 times in the past few years, I've finally came to the conclusion that this film is perfect for what it does and how it does it. I love how the mystery starts not as big to get overwhelming and not as small to be shaken off and completely thrown out, for detective J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) and for us as viewers. It begins just at a perfect size to get things going and as we get through the scope slowly gets larger and larger and at some point it reaches such amounts that-well you wouldn't to want to know that just yet.I loved how much nonsense was thrown at Nicholson practically by everyone in this film and how he had to bounce back by giving his famous ""do you think I'm THAT stupid?"" looks. It just gets me everytime. If if ever needed a private eye one day, I would like that person to be as persistent and as resilient as Nicholson in Chinatown. I loved the dialogue, its wittiness all around and I felt the characters could verbally fight for days unwavering.Every part of this film has been praised numerous times in its half a century life span. The screenplay is being tought at film schools, the score is on multiple top 10 lists, the acting is so terrific it has become iconic and the direction is just flawless.

If you like the regular, cheesy, big budget movies, the ones that lack depth, the ones you pay 10.00 a person to see in a dirty movie theater with a crowd of noisy strangers just to watch the usual, predictable Hollywood ending, this movie is not for you.  Noah Cross is truly one of the worst villains in the history of cinema, you love to hate him and when you love to hate a character, the writer, director and actor have all succeeded.

The Beauty of Human Mystery,"Life is a mystery, and within that mystery are mysteries of their own. Chinatown is the mystery film of all mystery films, and J.J. Gittes nearly outdoes Sherlock Holmes himself. Yet the mysteriousness that is contained in every waking moment and in every human being is also explored in Chinatown.Chinatown tells the story of Private Investigator J.J. Gittes, who does dirty work for husbands, wives, boyfriends, and girlfriends to find out for them if their significant other is involved romantically with somebody on the side. A woman comes into Mr. Gittes' office and asks him to investigate her husband, who is named Hollis Mulwray. Mr. Mulwray just happens to be a man with a very important position in the city of San Francisco.Mr. Gittes' investigation takes twists and turns, and each one causes the viewer to yearn for more action and mystery. Yet the investigation means nothing without Gittes, who is played quite brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. It is Gittes who seems to be more of a mystery than that which he is trying to solve (even though that which he investigates is captivating indeed), and Polanski's exploration of the human mystery is breath-taking and thought-provoking. Speaking of Polanski, his direction is wonderful, creative, and eye-catching, but not flashy to the point of distraction.The screenplay is very smart as well, and it takes ahold one's attention and attaches it to the story and characters at hand while including enigmatic elements. Further, what I have failed to mention is that the film takes place not in the 1970s, but in the 1920s or 1930s. Roman Polanski's score, the design of the credits, and the accurate set and costume design fit perfectly into that era.The only problem with this film is some acting difficulty on the part of the supporting actors, but these problems are merely a mote of dust on the beautiful waters of Chinatown.

You Gotta Be Rich to Kill Somebody,"In my opinion, one of the best films ever made. This could be my review. Nothing can be said about this, because everything that could be is written in the screenplay. My sheer respect, appreciation, love for this masterwork do not come from the director's unique interpretation-that I found rather normal, nothing truly stood out-but from the utter genius of Towne and his intellectual, masterful and perfectionist screenplay, where every little detail plays a part in the story, every dot, every comma, everything. I was lucky to read the first pages of the script before watching the film. Now I'm gonna finish it to put and end to the Chinatown experience. When you get to the ending, one of the best out there, you get overwhelmed with this sense of inevitability. This film can only end this way. This town is full of corruption. The police are corrupt. The government is. In a journey of silent and unknown companionship between Gittes and the audience, discovering and unveiling together, he, as we, can do nothing but watch the poor and innocent get murdered.You gotta be rich to kill somebody.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Arresting Mystery,"Roman Polanski enjoyed his best film since his ""Rosemary's Baby"" with ""Chinatown.""  An extremely intricate, well conceived crime thriller scripted by Robert Towne and Polanski, this film is reminiscent of (or pays tribute to) a number of cinematic predecessors.John Huston, who has a key role here, enjoyed his own great directorial success with ""The Maltese Falcon,"" and in ""Chinatown,"" the hero (played by Jack Nicholson in a Sam Spade/Phillip Marlow role) engages in a bit of deja vu with Faye Dunaway toward the end.  Nicholson phones the cops in the presence of Dunaway, then begs her to tell him the truth about her spurious ""alabi"" before the fuzz arrives. It's a situation directly from the Huston film (when Humphrey Bogart acts out an identical scenario with Mary Astor).Dunaway played the same type character here as six years earlier in ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" and obviously did it so well that ""Thomas Crown"" served as a shoe-in for her casting in ""Chinatown.""Polanski's ""semi-subjective camera"" honors Robert Mongomery's pioneer work in ""Lady in the Lake"" (1947) as the viewer closely follows the action from the left shoulder of Nicholson as he craftily solves the mystery web.An unusual score with sharp percussive strikes in the low piano register, balanced with a cool trumpet and strings, embroider the soundtrack, and lending an air of both suspense and sophistication to the ambience.The business about private vs government controlled power and water seems a bit complex to fully fathom in a single viewing; still, the impression is that all the pieces of this involved puzzle fit together--the result of very crafty writing.The result is a film that holds up well despite it's forthcoming quarter century anniversary.  This quality piece of work didn't go unrecognized by either critics or public, and it remains an audience favorite occupying a respectable place on most ""all time best"" lists.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Imperfect film noir never gets near the real ""Chinatown""...","It's surprising that for all the slavish attention to period detail that Roman Polanski puts into CHINATOWN, he lets down the audience in the finale which is supposed to take place in the actual Chinatown at night. Instead, it looks (as the original review in The New York Times pointed out), more like Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn with a few neon signs flickering in the background for Oriental flavor, filmed on an artificial, improvised set. It's a letdown when the film's most crucial moments aren't given the careful period flavor that goes into the majority of the piece. It's also unworthy of the film's final line: ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.""Robert Foote's screenplay owes a great deal to Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, both expert writers of crime detective fiction full of sardonic humor and double entendre remarks, usually delivered in deadpan manner by whomever was playing the male detective.In both CHINATOWN and THE MALTESE FALCON, a private eye gets involved in a messy case involving murder and other assorted mayhem, drawn into the case by a cool femme fatale who knows more than she's saying, and a cast of mostly unsavory characters living in the fringes of L.A.'s Chinatown area where crime in the 1930s is rampant.In this case, the cynical, hard-nosed detective is played to perfection by JACK NICHOLSON in the kind of role he excelled in, justly winning a Best Actor nomination. And likewise, the inscrutable dame is played by FAYE DUNAWAY in the sort of part Mary Astor essayed in ""The Maltese Falcon"". Instead of Sydney Greenstreet, we get JOHN HUSTON in the role of her megalomaniac, corrupt father. And keeping all of this fascinating material well in hand is Roman Polanski, himself a player in the film as the hood who slashes Nicholson's nose.It's gritty, authentic looking (except for the above-mentioned flaw) and captures the mood of the story with its Los Angeles backgrounds and detailed attention to '30s styles. Visually, it's a masterpiece--and while the story gets a little slow once in awhile in uncovering a convoluted plot involving land rights and water control, it leads to a highly suspenseful ending.A stylish thriller, well worth watching, especially if you love film noir. But somehow, Bogie's image hovers over most of the dialog and it falls far short of being called a ""masterpiece"" as many have done here. A more concise, compact telling of the tale would have made that description more apt instead of this long, rambling story with its engineering background and slow revelations.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A film-noir masterpiece,"Chinatown is the only film-noir movie I've seen that uses sunlight ironically. If film-noir by definition deals with dark subject matter, what's all the brilliant sunlight for? Robert Towne's script is a perfect assemblage of complexity and coherence; the plot twists are never misleading and add to the story, not detract from it. Director Polanski was also lucky enough to catch Jack Nicholson in his prime; he is perfectly cast as slimy and yet vulnerable Jack Gittes. Faye Dunaway is also superb. She was in her prime too, with Bonnie and Clyde behind and Network yet to come. There is genius in not showing Chinatown (the place) until the end of the movie; it represents the idea that all dirty secrets reveal their tragic consequences only after a miserable and dogged search for truth.

If the Devil exists and I wind up in Hell when I die, I would definitely expect him to be in the guise of Noah Cross.  He is the most vile screen villain I can recall; even Tommy Udo from Kiss of Death would have difficulty matching up to him in the meanness category.

Colorful Film Noir:  just add water,"Roman Polanski has a way in all of his films of luring you into a calm, inviting stream, and then forcing you to sink or swim while the stream becomes an aggressive river meandering until it reaches a climatic waterfall.We meet Jack Gittes (Nicholson) when he is in total control of his world as a private investigator. Gittes, however, has a way of letting his snooping get him into trouble, or from what he better knows it as, Chinatown. When a mysterious woman hires him to investigate a case seeming to revolve around adultery, Gittes falls in over his head in a corrupt scheme surrounded by greedy politicians, eager detectives, and truths that become utter confusion.Nicholson, supported by a strong supporting cast (Faye Dunaway, John Huston), brings his character such dimension and realism, that we all scratch our noises (watch the movie and you'll know what I mean) when we join him in his investigation.Robert Towne has penned a story as deep as the pacific, but all the while leaving your assumptions as dry as the Northeastern Valley. You are confused from the first twenty minutes, just as Polanski and Towne want, and any assumption you have will be wrong. As Towne said, ""Chinatown is a state of mind,"" we spend the entire film in Chinatown without physically going there. Not to worry, however, as the climax easily takes every thread of the story and ties it together, answering any questions the audience might have had, in a way that will make film noir buffs stay seated on their couch, hours after the credits, in awe of this masterpiece.Chinatown has been and always will be a classic of twentieth century cinema.

"""Hold it, Kitty Kat! Hold it!""","Chinatown is one of those famous movie marvels that comes to you trailing so much prestige that it is almost inevitable you'll be disappointed. Often times, after a couple more viewings the greatness of the great movie fully reveals itself. But in the case of Chinatown, I dunno, maybe it's just because the story is so distasteful, becoming more so as the ill doings are revealed, I can't help having some sympathy with critic Vincent Canby's assessment. He said it made him wish he was watching the very movies that inspired this one, i.e. Classic film noir, black and white, with all the deep shadows. Maybe Chinatown is just too challenging for the both of us?I guess the main thing is the fact that he recreates the 1930s but in colour. Jack Nicholson was establishing himself as a leading actor among A-listers at this time, the kind that wins multiple Oscars. Thing is, his character, Gittes, he ain't cool, not like the kind of gumshoes and street-wise guys played by the likes of Bogart and Mitchum, Cagney or Ladd. The P. I. who decides to stick his nose in, and very nearly loses it (a famous sequence) after a woman asks him to tail a cheating husband, whereupon the surveillance snaps find their way into the tabloids. A much bigger conspiracy is being worked, monstrously lucrative, cruelly damaging to its victims. At the same time, a horrible family rupture, worthy of Greek tragedy, is also being dragged up to the surface, out of the murky depths. All of this to the mournful soliloquies of a sour trumpet on the soundtrack.I love John Huston's supporting role, and Polanski's smaller but fearfully menacing one. I'm just not that taken with Nicholson's Gittes or his employer, Evelyn Cross-Mulwray (Faye Dunaway, sans eyebrows).

Great Film for a number of reasons,"Briefly, on first viewing this film, I was not sure about the relevance of the location known as Chinatown.

As Leone (Ugly) (66), Hathaway (Grit) (69), Bogdanovich (Last) (71), Fraker (Monte) (70) & Wincer (Dove) (89) all did for the western, then Coppola (Godfather) (72), Coen brothers (Millers) & Scorsese (Goodfellas) (90) for the gangster flick, Polanski (d), Towne (s/p) & Evans (p) would do in their resurrection of noir with Chinatown, a genre that seemed to have, like the others, run out its string, yet, all these films unique, stand alone productions in subjects we never thought we'd enjoy again (See also; ATPM) (76).Stars Jack Nicholson as private eye, JJ Gittes.

Marvel more at 2/3rds in when the action swings by the Mar Vista (Inn) Rest Home. Suffice to say, the music, milieu & message (""as little as possible"") all amount to a feeling that can only be called euphoric and foretelling (as Jake & Mrs speed away, note the bullet holes and where Evelyn's free hand is drawn). Sympathize with Evie when, after the coupling, she hurries to the house where Kahn attends to Katharine, Jake arriving to force a partial revelation (""sister"") but leaving in disbelief and a lonely Mrs Mulwray to her grief, fears & tears. And praise director Polanski's decision to film in color (lipstick oranges), even as black & white had come in vogue, and then as much in daylight as night, rejecting the crime drama tradition that can rely too heavily on visuals (shadows), instead showing faith in his script and actors ability to create mood.The great movie scores will walk hand in hand with their stories, each knowing the other's pace and favorite places to stop and smooch. In turning atmosphere into notes (hear the Swing Time leitmotif at Water & Power and Brown Derby), Jerry Goldsmith did the unthinkable, surpassing any artful audio of earlier noirs, it is that good, helping make this dark drama into what may well be the best of its kind ever made.

Despite that flaw, I found a few aspects of the film (cinematography, acting, musical score, etc.) to be fascinating and impressive.  Faye Dunaway is okay as the wealthy widow who Gittes falls for. Film legend John Huston is clever here as Noah Cross, a shady and wise millionaire who asks Gittes to find his daughter's only child.

Nothing Is As It Seems In Chinatown,"I was quite excited about 'Chinatown' because of the so many great things I had heard about. When the movie started on a slow pace, I was having my doubts whether I would like it. However, this is a layered movie and as the story unfolds, it gets darker and dangerous, and when you look back, you understand that nothing was as it seemed. There are plenty of twist and turns and yet they manage to develop the story without seeming out of place. This is easily one of Polanski's best films. Much of it is a homage to the noire genre but I also see some Kubrick references. The cinematography deserves special mention. I don not consider myself a Jack Nicholson fan but he's very good as detective Gittes determined to seek the truth. John Huston is terrific as Noah. His Noah is the villain of the scariest kind. He appears to be a charming, friendly and basically nice guy but there's a sleazy and greedy monster behind that facade. Yet, for me the star of 'Chinatown' is Faye Dunaway. At first, she seems like your typical film-noire femme fatale type but there is much more to her character and I repeat again that nothing is as it seems, watch a little further",,Anonymous,Mystery
An atmospheric neo-noir,"One of the finest movies of the 70s, and despite Polanski's reputation, Chinatown highly engrossed me from start to finish, and is deserving of every praise it has received. While too layered to summarize, the tale of conspiracy, fraud, and deception is rich with its masterful screenplay writing and acting, especially from Jack Nicholson who I personally believe gives his best performance. Every scene feels necessary, as the film also never felt all too predictable, and has an ending that is par for the course of this excellent film , but in the end, defeating. The devastation felt at the end is truly awful, and is one of the best endings of a movie ever (personal opinion). Whatever else is mentioned about the film has already been said enough, but generally, every aspect and facet the movie touches is done with true excellence. Touching on dishonesty, apathy in the face of evil, and helplessness, ""Chinatown"" does everything and more to develop its themes and messages that delivers, as stated, one of the greatest movies of the 70s, and in fact, ever. Highly recommended movie in general, or for any fan of the noir, mystery, or in fact detective genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sessions: ""Are you alone?"" Gittes: ""Isn't everybody?""","I loved the story, for once the mystery was actually unpredictable! That's something you unfortunately don't see too often with murder mysteries. And the ending, boy oh boy, it was so so sad and actually very bold of Roman Polanski to end it like that, and I applaud his execution of this movie as a whole. Jack Nicholson (as J. J. Gittes) and Faye Dunaway (as Evelyn Mulwray) were amazing of course, and definitely deserved their Oscar noms. I also want to praise John Huston who was marvellous at portraying his character's deceitfulness and two-facedness.But why am I not giving this a 10/10? Well, it might just be a me problem but I found this film very confusing for the first 30 minutes. I had to spend ages rewinding and rewatching certain parts just to get a grasp on things. Like I say, there's a fair chance that this is just a me problem, especially since I wasn't 100% focused during that period, but from then on, because I was that befuddled, my brain hurt for the rest of the picture, as even when I did eventually get a full understanding of what was going on, I was still convinced that I was missing a bit of information somewhere, so I basically gave up at that point. I do believe they should've explained things a bit more clearly. I will for sure give this a rewatch someday though, and hopefully then I appreciate this in all its awe and give this a 10/10 rating.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Keeps getting better,"I first saw this movie when I was 17 and a theatre usher working its premier.  Between the great soundtrack, the beautiful time-period-perfect sets, the complicated but tight plot, this was, I was certain, the best movie I'd ever seen.  Twenty-seven  years later that still holds true.  I have seen this movie not less than 300 times.  It's well beyond perfect. It mesmerizes everytime. Its lessons ring truer as life itself brings more parallel experiences to one's attention as the decades roll by. Superior!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Big Screen Movies are meant for the big screen,"I must admit to leaving movies like this on the shelf in the 'I must watch this again someday' rack, but the recent upgrade from half decent TV to projector and decent sound system has brought new life to movies that were often in my above category. A big TV is better than small, but there is a magical glow that comes from the dimly lit room and the projected image that draws you in, in a way that no glass trap can. (In my honest opinion)To be honest there isn't much I can add to what has already been written here, only to add, that directors like Polanski create their vision to be seen on the big screen and (IMO) it is on the big screen that they breathe life. Subtle lighting directions, cute camera angles (like Gittes watching Mulwray through the wing mirror of his car) often drift into obscurity on the TVWhen I first saw Chinatown it was on the TV, I liked it, but then i have always liked a touch of Noir, and have watched it a number of times since. But seeing it 'large' put it back where it was meant to be. Up at the top. The film has class, the actors play it to the full, (with Nicholson at his best) and the direction is just.... well, Polanski. I am just sorry that I never managed to catch so many greats like this on the big screen when they came around. (Something I intend to rectify)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Film Noir - Now in Colour!,"Jack Nicholson is my favourite actor. He's got a beautiful relatable quality to him which gives him that everyman essence both men and women enjoy watching. In Chinatown, Jack is perfectly cast as a slightly seedy, but professional and ethical small-business man who becomes embroiled in a nasty, complex case. Chinatown is perfect Film Noir, in colour. And in colour, it's sumptuous. I wonder whether the film would have been as successful at the box office if it had been filmed in black and white. One of these days, I'm going to rent the DVD again and switch off the colour on the TV and enjoy.Faye Dunaway is classically beautiful, aristocratic and mysterious; a perfect Film Noir heroin. Roman Polanski directs expertly and he gives the characters space to reveal so much of themselves. The plot may be complex, but detective mystery/thrillers are meant to have complex plots (if you're enjoy reading detective novels, you'll have no trouble sewing things together).I can't add anything further to this masterpiece other than to say Chinatown should be on every serious film buff's list of must sees. 9/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
After Thoughts,"I like the whole setting for this film and just the overall vibe of it! It had the grimey feel I wanted from a Detective film and I loved every minute of it! I also thought the mystery aspect was great and I kept switching who I thought did it all the time. Also Jack Nicholson did an amazing acting job in the role! 👏👏👏👏 Bravo! Jack Nicholson is usually a very hit or miss actor for me, not that he ever does a bad job or anything, I just sometimes feel like he is playing the same character all the time. But not in this role, he was outstanding and was a genuine diamond in the rough and I totally bought it! And I just truly have a new respect for him. The only thing that hangs me up, that I had no idea or even heard about going into this was the ending. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad thing, it's just something I will have to think on to see if my rating for thus film will change. I love the artistic point, it just came as a blast from left field, and will have me thinking for a while.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Chinatown,"It's 1937 and private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired by the wife of Hollis Mulwray, LA's head of water and power to investigate her husband's infidelity. Gittes follows Mulwray for days finding him with a young girl but also behaving mysteriously relating to his refusal to build a new dam for the city. The real Mrs Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) turns up, threatening to sue Gittes, but then her husband is found dead at a local reservoir.Exceptionally fine piece of period detective fiction from Polanski featuring a terrific mystery, dry humour, the occasional shock, a perfect sense of time and place and even a great score. On top of all this is a completely stonking performance by Jack Nicholson who fits the role like a glove - he is just so terrific in this and actually appears in every single scene. Fine support all around, this is a very classy piece of work indeed. Nigh on perfect cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
For misguided viewers,"I would like to suggest to anyone confused or not impressed with the masterpiece witch is ""Chinatown"" A movie such as ""Chinatown"" is a film that screams for viewers to observe its contents more than once. No person, movie buff of not, is going to take in whole the essence of this film based upon one viewing. There is so much complication in this film that the first viewing will result only in the knowledge of the plot and mystery behind it. After you have a grasp on what the heck is going on behind the lies and schemes of the characters is when you can take in mind the essence and pure brilliance of this classic. I urge people who have not taken advantage of really trying to understand this film to do so immediately, especially if you liked it but are confused on many issues of the film. If not, forget about it, it's only Chinatown.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A thrilling homage to the classic Hollywood detective noir films.,"(NOTE: Originally posted on 3rd September, 2018)(P): Positives(N): Negatives(?): Other points/neither positive or negative(P) Story is tightly plotted with great twists and turns(P) Acting is superb (Jack Nicholson is a delight as always, playing the cocksure but kind & well-meaning P.I.)(P) Cinematography across the board is good(P) Lighting is also good or great in most scenes (with a few exceptions)(?) Occasionally has cliche 'detective movie moments' (Although, that could be viewed as part of the homage to detective fiction - hence the '(?)' and not the '(N)')(N) (Minor) Pacing can feel a bit iffy at times(N) (Minor) While lighting can be excellent in some scenes and good in most, a few scenes have lighting issues e.g. a shot leading into an underexposed office room, a nighttime car tailing scene etc.Overall: Whilst Chinatown occasionally has its issues, it's still an exceptionally well-crafted homage to the detective noir films of old - as well as, in many areas, introducing fresh (and oftentimes, disturbing and dark) ideas of its own.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A 1970s film noir,"In my books this film is a successful, later film noir in colour. All the elements of the old 1940's film noir are there. Private Detective Jake Gittes thinks he has a run of the mill adultery investigation on his hands when Mrs Mulray the wife of a Water Company executive hires him. The case quickly turns to set ups, conspiracy and murder.Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunnaway play this movie perfectly. A private detective needs to be played as street smart and cool. The street wise must ooze from him without being overplayed and ruining his cool. Jack Nicholson is almost a natural and Faye Dunnaway compliments him beautifully wealthy woman with a dark secret.This film is a true classic and perhaps it is Roman Polanski's own dark experiences that have him pulling off a film noir in the seventies.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Jack Nicholson's finest efforts,"The scene: 1930's Los Angeles.  Someone is fiddling with the scant water resourses in the time of drought. When the water commissioner ""drowns"", private eye J.J.""Jake"" Gittes becomes entangled in the mystery while investigating a routine domestic case that is anything but routine. Nicolson's cool, yet passionate character is the standard by which all of his subsequent roles can be measured. Faye Dunaway is also excellent as the wealthy yet seriously messed up Evelyn Mulray. Ditto John Houston as the menacing Noah Cross. Add to this a haunting score and you have a detective picture in the best film noir tradition.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  On a scale of 1-5(5 being the best) this gets a 10.",,Anonymous,Mystery
