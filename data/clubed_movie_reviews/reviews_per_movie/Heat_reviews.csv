Exceptionally well done though it's not the sort of film for everyone...but what movie is?,"I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like ""Heat"". However, on a lark and because it's apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.The biggest reason I liked the movie and thought it was made so well was its rich and complex plot. At nearly three hours, there is lots and lots of time for the plot to slowly unfold. It also allowed for several concurrent plots to interweave themselves through the film--the story about the master criminals, the cops, another criminal as well as a rogue nut-job that just likes to kill. It's almost like a mini-series in this respect. I also loved how this was not a set-bound film but was made throughout LA--though I wonder how this was possible, as it must have tied up huge portions of Los Angeles! I also loved some of the characters--particularly Robert De Niro's oddly professional and scary criminal boss. It was one of his very best performances.There's very little to complain about in the film, though I thought Al Pacino's character was a tad over-acted at times. Unlike De Niro, I had a harder time believing Pacino was real. Perhaps it's just me....Overall, if you don't mind the violence and the occasionally frenetic pace, then this is a film well wroth seeing. Extremely well-directed and never dull.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Captivating,"Micheal Manns'(director of 'The Insider', and 'Manhunter') smooth, straightforward direction is studded with brilliant and very memorable cinematic gems in 'Heat',  A bullet riddled drama with, yes , Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in their first on screen meeting.What do you want to hear about 'Heat'.  Is it DeNiro's best performance? No. Is it Pacino's best performance? I'd be lying if I said it was.   Do the performances improve the story? Absolutely.   Mann has written (he wrote it as well) a complex and exciting two-sided story that develops the hunter Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and the hunted Neil McCauley (De Niro)  separately throughout much of the film.  Underneath a hail of bullets Mann is able to paint both lead characters with the same brush by delving into the similarly tragic and chaotic personal lives of Hanna and McCauley, allowing for the final epic scene, which would have been too pretentious if it were not for the excellent performances of Pacino and De Niro.Bottom Line:  Not having seen this movie is akin to idiocy for anyone claiming to be a fan of movies.   9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Unmatched Tension and Masterful Storytelling""","Michael Mann's Heat is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the genre. This film explores the intertwined lives of professional criminals and dedicated law enforcement, all wrapped in a narrative that is as engaging as it is intense.At the heart of the film are two iconic performances: Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley, a meticulous career thief, and Al Pacino as Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, a relentless LAPD detective. The film portrays their cat-and-mouse game with striking depth, showcasing the moral ambiguities of both characters. As McCauley plans one final heist, Hanna's tireless quest to bring him down adds layers of complexity to their dynamic.Mann's direction is nothing short of masterful. He creates a palpable tension that permeates every scene, particularly during the film's infamous bank heist sequence. The meticulous attention to detail-right from the practical effects to the realistic portrayal of criminal techniques-brings this meticulously crafted world to life. Viewers are not just spectators; they are drawn into the narrative, feeling the weight of each decision and the stakes of each confrontation.The cinematography by Dante Spinotti is also notable. The sweeping shots of Los Angeles, with its gritty underbelly juxtaposed against sleek nightscapes, serve as a backdrop that enhances the film's tension and themes. The visual style complements the narrative's emotional depth and urgency, making ""Heat"" a feast for the eyes as much as it is for the mind.In addition to its visual and narrative strengths, ""Heat"" features a powerful, atmospheric score by Elliot Goldenthal that elevates the film's emotional stakes, further immersing the audience in its world.Despite its lengthy runtime of nearly three hours, ""Heat"" manages to maintain a gripping pace, with each subplot and character arc meticulously woven into the broader narrative. The supporting cast, including Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and Diane Venora, also deliver strong performances that enrich the story.""Heat"" stands as a benchmark in the crime genre, exemplifying how deep character exploration and stunning visuals can coexist within a high-stakes narrative. It is a film that provokes thought, examines the duality of human nature, and ultimately leaves the viewer pondering the fine line between right and wrong. Whether you're a fan of action films, character studies, or tales of obsession and rivalry, ""Heat"" offers something for everyone-making it a timeless classic well worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film.,"Heat (1995) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows an underground high end burglary team looking for one big last mission and a parallel story about a successful police officer who is struggling at home. As the buildup to the big heist unfolds the two worlds come closer and closer together until the ultimate collision happens.This movie is directed by Michael Mann (Ali) and stars Robert De Niro (Goodfellas), Al Pacino (Scarface), Val Kilmer (Willow), Jon Voight (Anaconda), Mykelti Williamson (Forest Gump), Ashley Judd (Kiss the Girls), Tom Sizemore (Black Hawk Down), Wes Studi (Deep Rising), Natalie Portman (Leon: The Professional), Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs) and Dennis Haysbert (Far from Heaven).This cast is absolutely amazing top to bottom. The writing is also excellent and delivers the backstories to each character to perfection and the dialogue is out of this world. The chemistry of the cast throughout the film worked perfectly and the action scenes are intense and very well done. You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film. The conclusion to such a huge movie is excellent and fits the film perfectly.This is an all time classic that is an absolute must see and an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Brilliant,"This is a brilliant film. While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn't a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too. The cinematography, locations and scenery are superb, and the film's atmosphere and pace are also terrific. The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary. So all in all, brilliant and absolutely worth it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best character film of all time.,"Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Heat is truly epic, absolutely breathtaking","One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Mann's crime drama delivers,"'Heat,' a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some.  With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann's sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, 'Heat' is arguably one of the best crime dramas.Perhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley.  Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters.  While following Hanna's personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal.  Hanna's marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the ""remnants of dead people.""  A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small).  His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him.  The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.  When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic.  To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.In addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters.  And the cast is one of the best, at that.  DeNiro. Little more needs to be said.  Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover.  And, despite his life of crime, McCauley's human side shows through.  He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist.  His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady.  Pacino.  Equally without need of praise.  As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships.  He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley.  Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be.  Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity.  Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere.  Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives.  Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film.  Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions).  Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine's daughter Lauren.  As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro.  In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.And Michael Mann's direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama.  He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly.  He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost.  Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous.  Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment.  He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic.  The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever.  Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable.  And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.Because of these and other well done aspects, 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good But Overlong,"The thing to strike me about HEAT is that it`s overlong . I don`t know if I`ve been watching too much MTV but a major problem I`ve had with a great number of movies coming out of Hollywood studios since the early 1990s is that they`re too long for their own good and I wish to add HEAT to this list since its running time is taken up with too many unnecessary scenes . If these scenes had been ditched at script stage not only would we have had a shorter film we`d have had a far better one . Take the scene in the coffee bar where the gang have just carried out the initial heist and Neil teaches Waingro a lesson  by banging his head off the table . Seeing as they`re shown throghout the story to be well organised , professional villains why would Neil draw attention to themselves by assaulting Waingro in this way ? It`s a scene that lacks any credibility and should not have been included . There`s another problem with too many domestic scenes , the film tries to show the audience the marital marital/romantic life of every major character , cop and robber . I know Michael Mann`s later movie THE INSIDER is also full of scenes involving home life but that`s necessary to the plot and characterisation . Here it is notHEAT isn`t by any means a bad film , on the contaray it`s a good one . DeNiro and Pacino in the same movie , boy what a casting coup . Not only that we get to see Val Kilmer when he was famous plus up and coming names like Portman , Sizemore and Fichtner , and once the story gets going it is very compelling with a breath taking shootout . Unfortunately because someone ( I`m guessing Michael Mann deserves all the blame for this ) thought they`d stretch out a two hour movie into a three hour one HEAT remains good instead of great",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Michael Mann's finest work,"A brilliant character driven action thriller with drama and emotion all the way. Despite the long runtime, the pacing never drags. The Magic of this action movie is that you believe the people you see in the screen. You care for them and everything they go through. All of the scenes are influential, the script and the score are iconic. Two thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An okay movie.  Would have been better 60 minutes shorter with half the characters,"Having seen almost every classic and influential crime drama of the past 30 years, I finally got around to seeing Heat. Having heard about how influential it has been in other movies and video games, I couldn't believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. Boy, was I disappointed. This movie is far from the masterpiece that I was led to believe. Other than a couple of great crime scenes (and a little bit of great action), I can't think of much that this film had that would make me want to see it again.While I wouldn't characterize the acting as bad, I can't think of anyone in this movie who gave a performance that is among their better ones. Al Pacino is practically a caricature of himself the entire time. He overacts in every scene and he yells about half of his lines. Robert Deniro has the same scowl on his face and speaks in pretty much the same voice for the whole movie. Pacino and Deniro fans looking for some ""tough guy"" porn will find plenty of it here.Ultimately, Heat is a movie that could have been made better by cutting about half the content. It is loaded with characters that are poorly developed, but are dramatically presented as if you are supposed to give a crap about any of them. One of them gets killed after about four minutes of screen time, and after that, we see his grieving wife. Rather than cry with her, I just kind of rolled my eyes. Another gang members death is presented with the drama akin to a squad mate getting killed in a war movie. I could have cared less. Val Kilmer's subplot centers around the tenuous relationship that he has with his wife. Al Pacino has a lousy third marriage and Robert Deniro somehow manages to have a romance side plot that is neither relevant nor believable.There is even a suicide attempt scene that has nothing whatsoever to do with the story – a diversion that will have you scratching your head, wondering why so much celluloid was wasted on it. Without exception, every single scene with a female in it could have been left on the cutting room floor, and not one shred of value would have been lost. None of the characters are sympathetic or well developed enough for you to want to see their romances work or to be able to share their pain. It would have worked well maybe in a television series where you would have more time to develop the characters, but here, all of the side plot material is really boring.One of the draws of this movie seems to be that it is a ""realistic"" and non ideal take on human behavior. Okay, I get that, but if you are going to go with the ""realistic"" approach, then don't ruin it with the occasional unbelievable scene or plot hole. The biggest offender is the famous bank robbery scene in the middle of the movie. It would have been spectacular in an action movie that didn't take itself seriously. But in Heat, I couldn't stop thinking about how absurd it was that a few guys with automatic weapons were able to cut through the entire LAPD like a hot knife through butter, escaping clean in the process. I still greatly enjoyed that scene, largely because it's just a great action scene that is well choreographed and shot. However, it's sort of out of place in this film.I'll give Heat some credit for not being a by-the-numbers cops and robbers movie. Maybe it is this uniqueness and the time of its release that made it so popular. Upon reflection though, there have been many crime and caper movies over the past few decades that are more entertaining than this one. Scarface, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, to name but a few. While I didn't hate this movie, I certainly don't think that it deserves a place in the Top 10 greatest crime dramas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I obviously don't get it ...,"Let me start by saying that Heat isn't a terrible movie. In fact, it's not a bad movie at all. I just think that it's incredibly overrated.
I'm not a huge fan of Michael Mann's work in general. I find his films to be no more than very long music videos. His movies seem to epitomise style over substance to me, and Heat is no different.
DeNiro and Pacino chew through the scenes like they normally do. That's a given. The rest of the cast are as competent and watchable, but the film doesn't feel deep enough for me. Though judging by the way everyone else is rating it, I must be missing something, even after watching it three times.
I'm sorry that I don't like this film. It's got all the right ingredients to be special, but, as far as I'm concerned, it's undercooked.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I finally sat down and watched.,"I have been hearing about this movie for years and kept telling myself to see it ffs, and today I did. Seeing who was cast during the opening credits, I knew I was in for a treat. I was lucky that I had never had the plot spoiled for me and I knew absolutely nothing about what was coming.Regarding the cast, let me mention an actress I have been a fan of since her turn on FX, and she is also the mother-in-law of a friend, Diane Venora. She played her part with such a wide spectrum of emotions that I was completely drawn into her empathy, anger, aloofness, and deep sorrow. It tore me up, actually. She was the perfect match for Pacino's manic character.Speaking of Pacino, his performance was one for the books. He was a dude on the razor's edge of completely losing it and uses his job as a form of a security blanket. It's his happy place which unfortunately makes any semblance of a normal life impossible.Now lets talk about De Niro's performance. In a word: Perfect. It's sad in today's world, people judge an actor on their political beliefs rather than how they perform their craft. De Niro's beliefs are polar opposite from mine, but I could not care less. He was fantastic as the professional thief who is likeable, deadly, and when all is said and done, a scourge of society. Rooting for him is wrong, but you can't help to just a little.The movie was filled with great performances particularly from Val Kilmer, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, and damn, Kevin Gage's evilly maniacal portrayal was downright demented. The entire cast was top notch. Kudos to the casting director.Watch this movie for the intense ride of hovering between good and evil. It does not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masterful on all counts,"For some reason I cannot stop thinking about this film lately.You know that feeling of having seen it about 3 or 4 times in the last 12 months is not enough? That's what I feel at the moment.I rate it as Mann's best. It's his most kinetic,vibrant(for a film mostly shot in steely blue),agonising,stirring,brash,violent and brilliance in such a simple story.What games did you play as a young kid? Cops and robbers.Good guy.Bad guy.We all know De Niro and Pacino could have been either main part,but can you imagine it any other way round. Pacino doing ice cool calm? De Niro the manic outbursts,arms flailing? It wouldn't work. We know these men now.We know neither will stop at what they do.And yet there is no way either would stop the other.Unless they had too. Which leads us too the characters. All of them.This is an extended family where you feel you know all of them without knowing anything at all. The cops are similar to the robbers and vice-versa. Perhaps Mann is telling us were all the same.Except in what we do.Every speaking part holds substance in this movie, and the support cast is astonishing when you actually read the caliber of who appeared in this film.Tom Sizmore, Val Kilmer,Ashley Judd,Ted Levine,Wes Studi,Hank Azaria,William Fitchner,Henry Rollins,Dennis Haysbert,Tom Noonan.

One Of The Best Crime Films Ever,"I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn't make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!This movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film. Those two didn't disappoint, either. They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film, to me, was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee. That conversation has always fascinated me, no matter how many times I've heard it. It was such a ""landmark"" scene that It's even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD.As with the conversation scene, the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it. The other action scenes are intense and memorable, too, and the cast in here is deep. This isn't just Pacino and De Niro. It's Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Diana Venora, Natlie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenamann, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson, on and on.Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann, one of the best directors in business, add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film. At three hours long, it never bores one and at same time, doesn't overdo the action, either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters, but you can't have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport, but that's nitpicking considering the film as a whole.This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

In this one, it's hard-faced Diane Venora whining about how cop Al Pacino isn't THERE for her and her daughter (Natalie Portman), how she gets only part of his life, etc. Haven't we suffered through this boring situation in a hundred cop pictures? Then there are the uninteresting marital problems criminal Val Kilmer is having with Ashley Judd; who cares? Finally, there's the loony, preposterous, extraneous, wholly unbelievable relationship Robert De Niro has with Amy Brenneman, who plays a lovestruck artist/shopgirl who takes one look at De Niro, begins flirting with him, and is soon taking him to bed. Yeah, right: Here's a beautiful, glamorous-looking young woman who throws herself at a middle-aged, mean-and-careworn-and-greasy-looking guy who initially pretends to be a salesman and carries on a halting conversation worthy of a dullard. The relationship has no bearing on the plot that I could see; it's just an impediment and an annoyance. Thank God for the fast-forward on my remote.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
good cop movie but a little long,"This movie was good.  I loved the gun fight scene in Downtown LA and Neil's last confrontation with Waingro.

Also, I thought the dialogue could've been better.  Am I alone on this?  Everyone seems to praise this movie as one of the best they've seen.  Am I the only one who thinks the sub-plots, especially those involving the characters' personal lives could've been shortened or eliminated altogether?  And that the dialogue was weak, even during that coffee shop scene?The pacing was slow and, except for a few scenes, the movie was boring.  The movie was basically a few great scenes strung together by a lot of weak ones.  Despite the movie's flaws, I enjoyed some of the action sequences and the performances of Al Pacino and Robert Dinero.

Won't describe the story as its not particularly original and not the best thing about this film. You've got Pacino and Deniro on screen in a film for the first and possibly last time which should be recommendation enough. You've also got director Michael Mann at the top of his game. An awesome supporting cast firing on all cylinders. Arguably the best ""shoot-out"" in any film - ever. What more do you want???It's a long film but there is not one wasted scene in it. Even the incidental story lines - for example, the recently paroled ex-cell mate of Deniro whose first job is in a ""grill"" working for a nasty, exploitative boss and then ends-up as a stand-in getaway driver for Deniros crew. It just adds weight to the whole film. All the domestic dramas of the good-guys and the bad-guys that you wouldn't get in the typical cops and robbers film are shown in loving detail and nothing is rushed. Just makes it a more satisfying and involving film.Mann who started his career on Miami Vice almost seems to be taking a trip back to the eighties with the soundtrack and styling of the film - almost but not quite.If you still don't want to see the film after this then what the hell's wrong with you?! Sit back and enjoy. Also - no. 247 in the top 250?? Whats up with that???",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Everything is so excellent here,"""Heat"" is a classic. Not just a classic, but a good one. Not just a good one, but very very good one, a brilliant classic. The story is well-written, the actors were great in their roles (especially Al Pacino and Robert De Niro), Michael Mann directed the film very well, the cinematography and music are also amazing. And the scene where Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are sitting in the cafe is simply incredibly tense and reaches the pinnacle of acting. At the same time, others were also really great (ones like Natalie Portman and Val Kilmer), it's hard to name someone who played their role poorly. Overall, Heat is an amazing movie and probably one of the best ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What else can be said about this perfectly conceived and executed crime drama?,"I would like to think there is something to add to the accolades this ultra-violent, deeply character-driven crime drama has received over the 15+ years since its release, but it should be enough to say this is a movie that has to be seen, to be watched, to be studied and examined as an example of truly artful direction and powerfully delivered film-making. All the actors and the director are at the peak of the creative power and authority here, never missing a beat, never chewing on a scene too long, never overstaying their welcome.Mann engages us intimately with the characters. We grow most sympathetic with DeNiro's Neil Cauley, an anti-heroic bad guy we can't help but hope will get away and get out of the game (even though we know they never do) but we are given an almost equal treatment of Cauley's nemesis, an over-achieving major crimes homicide detective, Pacino's Vincent Hanna, a cop who never sleeps, never stops thinking, never gives up. He's a gum-chewing New Yorker ADD case transplanted to the L.A. underworld he must deal with.The violence and the heists is crucial - this is the criminal underworld we're looking at here after all, one full of treacherous, twisted, and thoroughly untrustworthy people - but Mann goes a step further and makes them knowable, sympathetic, three-dimensional people with real problems (not the least of which is the lifestyle they've chosen for themselves).Much as I found ""Reservoir Dogs"" initially breathtaking in its depiction of hardcore violence, violence that was bloody and terrible and full of complications - not the Cowboys-and-Indians gunplay of the '50s and '60s where a gunshot to the gut didn't seem to really do much - I found the violence of ""Heat"" equally breathtaking. I'm not sure if it was the choice of guns or simply the way they were recorded, but the semi-/full-auto Colt rifles used in much of the movie are astonishingly loud. Even the sound of the guns makes them a part of the cast and gives a realistic scope to the violence, a nearness and a real impact that makes ""Heat"" unique among its counterparts.""Heat"" and its fully-rounded characters are an amazing achievement that is rarely seen in film: We care about the good AND the bad guys, we want to learn more about them and the director and cast delivers, again and again and again. The film MAKES us want to know more about them. I suppose there are some visual and film and plot clichés common to many crime dramas, but it doesn't feel clichéd, doesn't feel time- or tread-worn.If for some crazy reason you haven't seen this movie - and I can't imagine you haven't - be sure you do. And, if you haven't seen it in a while, please watch it again. Really watch it and observe what a fine film ""Heat"" is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Unnecessary Subplots Sink This Crime Thriller,"This movie is about a cat-and-mouse game between an intelligent heist boss and an LAPD officer who is devoted to his job. This has the potential plot for a great heist movie with great actions and twists and turns. Did they deliver it right? Well, I am not impressed.The movie starts with a heist that doesn't go as the gang expected and it leaves huge heat in their back. It is a good start for the movie. As police investigate the scenes, it looks good too. As the gang leads the police to trap and make their progress to zero again is interesting. The action scene where police encounter the gang as they escape from a heist in the streets is great. But the movie has many unwanted scenes and characters to dull it to enjoy fully.First the family of the robbers. There are criminals. What is the point of showing their family side? I understand that you are creating to give them character depth. But it looks like you trying to sympathize with them despite their actions. Who cares about how their personal life goes when they kill people and steal money? It's a bad idea. You can try showing how selfish each is even though being a team, conflicts, and contradictions between the robbers, and betraying each other.Second, the LAPD officer's marriage. I understand, and everyone knows that the married life of police is more complicated. What the LAPD officer's failing married life contributes to the story of this cat-and-mouse game. It's not necessary in the movie other than being a filler to stretch the length of the movie. Instead, they could have shown how the LAPD superiors and the public panic on the series of terror of the gang pressures the LAPD Officers to put the gang to an end. That would contribute more to this cat-and-mouse game being more intriguing and interesting than it is.Third, the LAPD officer's stepdaughter. The movie shows that this daughter has issues with her actual dad but does not delve into it. She has a couple of scenes. She tries to end her life. Like, what's going on? It is another filler on parenting which does not contribute to the story.Finally, if you want to show how the police's family life or the robber's, make it a separate movie with more details and emotion as you want. But filling them in a cat-and-mouse game between the police and criminals makes the movie dull to watch and avoiding those scenes could have shortened the movie's length into two hours of a good heist movie.The actors did a good job, especially Robert de Niro and Al Pacino in their roles. The cinematography and the color were good. The music at the climax feels like it was made for a feel-good movie's end which this movie isn't.In conclusion, this movie had the potential to be made as a good movie if they avoided the things I have issues with. I am saying it is decent because of some elements I liked in the movie or else it's crap.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Summit,"One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts.The roles they have are not as good as Jake LaMotta, Jimmy Conway, or Max Cady for DeNiro or Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, or Bobby Deefield for Pacino. But Neil McCauley master criminal for DeNiro and Jake Hanna dogged detective for Pacino does show these guys at their best.You can best describe Heat as a long running version of Law and Order Criminal Intent with a big budget. Like that show the action shifts back from the cops to the criminals and smoothly for director/writer Michael Mann. We see both of these guys as rather similar to each other. DeNiro prides himself on the fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work. And Pacino is on his third marriage and his mistress is the job. He's been a failure twice as a husband and about to go thrice in the romance department.Mann gave Pacino and DeNiro a really outstanding cast for support in Heat. People like Val Kilmer are in DeNiro's gang, Jon Voight is the Sam Jaffe like mastermind of the operation. Pacino on his team has Mykel T. Williamson from Forrest Gump and Ted Levine best known as Captain Stottlemyre on Monk.This action film also does not stint on woman's roles. Diane Venora is fine as Pacino's estranged wife. Amy Breneman is also good as DeNiro's woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go to his destruction. Best in the film on the distaff side is Ashley Judd as Val Kilmer's loyal wife who has one great choice given her by Williamson, betray her husband or lose their kid. See how she handles it.Although the scene was shoehorned into the plot and would never happen in real life, Pacino and DeNiro do meet and have a brief scene together over a cup of coffee in a diner. They compare notes so to speak and take the measure of the other guy. Since these two guys are the most acclaimed actors of their generation, the scene artificial though it is takes on a whole different dimension. It's like when writers give Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots a climatic meeting scene even though in real life it never happened.But like in Heat, it should have happened.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I absolutely love Michael Mann and his signature is all over this film.,"I feel I need to preface my review with the following, I grew up watching Miami Vice in the 1980's and it was the coolest thing on tv. Everyone wanted to be (or date) Crockett and Tubbs, something that spurred a whole fashion movement that included pastel colored jackets and sockless loafer wearing! I can't tell you how disappointed I was in 1990 to discover that the portrayal on Miami Vice is not exactly what Miami looked like...although I did think Puerto Rico came close! I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, but Michael Mann made the Miami scene so visceral and real...one of the things I have come to think of as part of his signature. Heat also has that very visceral experience attached to it, along with two other Mann signatures...that intangible ""cool"" and using a great cast that includes appearances by popular musicians...in this case it was Tone Loc who I also grew up listening to.Heat has some big name stars that make this film a must see. It stars Al Pacino (Lt. Vincent Hanna) and Robert De Niro (Neal McCauley), who go head to head as cop vs professional thief and crew. There is genius in casting these two in their respective roles as I have to confess I kept having to re-ask, 'who is the 'bad guy'?', as the cop was brutal and distant even with his family and the thief and his crew were acting a little more gentlemanly. The rest of the cast was filled in by some amazing performances by Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Wes Studi, Ted Lavine, William Fitchtner, Hank Azaria, Martin Ferraro, and a very young and troubled Natalie Portman. The two actors I was most excited to see in the film, even though their roles were small, were Danny Trejo (one of the crew of thieves) and Jeremy Piven...who plays a dentist paid to deal with one of the crew's bullet wounds.If the star power alone isn't enough to get you to watch this film, let's talk about the story itself. The film starts with an armored car heist that was a pretty simple in and out...except their newest or borrowed crew member gets a little twitchy with his trigger finger leading to some fairly violent deaths (Mann never shies away from depicting violence and this film is no exception). He then gets kicked off the crew, which eventually leads to the ending. Neal has a couple crew members who really need a big score and after he finally meets a woman that he can see having a life with, the crew start to make some elaborate plans for their final job. Meanwhile, Lt. Hanna is doing everything he can to figure out first who this crew is and second to catch them with something they can be charged with. He is holding nothing back.The tension is really built as these two minds meet in a diner and pit their wits against one another in the ultimate cat and mouse. This was one of the rare cases where I wasn't sure who I wanted to win...another aspect of Heat that I consider to have Michael Mann's name written all over.This should be on every cinephiles list to see at least once and particularly on those who are fans of Pacino and De Niro. There is a lot of violence and the film includes several mature topics like suicide, murder, prostitution, and drugs, so I wouldn't recommend this for young kids...but for mature audiences this is a meaty cinematic meal that should be on your list.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Heat is stone cold bad.,"What passes for epic cinema these days can be found in Heat, a noisy, bombastic, self reverential cops and robbers bore that between gun battles drags for most of it's three hour (yes three) running time.Detective Vin Hanna (Al Pacino) is a standout cop with almost as many bad marriages as commendations. Neil MacCauley (Robert DiNero) is a career criminal always bent on the big score. Both men are very methodical and take great pride in their professionalism. After botching a brinks job Hanna pursues the gang which is beginning to fray at the edges. Mac Cauley realizes it's tough to get good help these days and decides on one last score before calling it quits.Showcasing the biggest meeting since Truman met Stalin at Potsdam director Michael Mann treats the first meeting of Pacino and DiNero together (both were in Godfather 2 but appeared in no scenes together) with the same solemnity as the two actors wheeze through their moment. With nothing new or revelatory to say, they show manly respect and understanding for each other. The problem is the scene is more about these closely identified highly regarded actors than the characters they play. Their star wattage (as well as their skills) may have dimmed by 95 but their legendary status carried a lot of weight. It's about as interesting as two old codgers reminiscing on an old folks home porch and rings hollow like the rest of this lumbering elephant of a film.The convoluted plot is filled with forgettable characters but it does allow Mann to wander around LA spreading gratuitous violence. The women in the film are relegated to looking tired and concerned over their boy friends, acting as sounding boards for the guys to spew their Mannly philosophy about honor and being true to your skills.The action scenes are big, loud, bloody, poorly edited and ridiculous as LA empties out to let the boys shoot it out in grand fashion on the streets. The badly paced montage of Al and Bobby dashing up and down the avenues with some very big weapons (size is everything to Mann)playing cops and robbers runs out of steam before they run out of bullets.By the time they made Heat Pacino and DiNero had peaked before doing self parody (though Pacino would go on to give a stellar performance worthy of his early years as Roy Cohn in Angels in America) and it shows in their lackluster tired performances magnified even further by the film stealing effort turned in by Val Kilmer as gang member Chris. Kilmer's energy and the self confident way he moves and acts delivers the passion the two stars lack.As in some of his other films Mann explores the theme of moral relativism with usual heavy handed pretension attempting to bestow nobility on the good as well as the bad, solemnizing the whole ponderous affair with Elliot Goldenthal's vapid score that is more appropriate for a coronation than a shoot'em up.In Heat MacCauley states ""Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out of in thirty seconds flat"". One should keep this in mind before watching this big helium balloon of hot air.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Still holds up almost 30 years later,"#265moviereviewSeriously, this movie is so good I think I am committing a crime along with the crew.I had the pleasure of being in Los Angeles in a building overlooking the bank heist shootout courtesy of a friend and nothing prepares you for it. Even in Los Angeles blanks were used but you could hear the gunfire. It was absolutely chilling.The dialogue is crisp, the action is first rate and as to the performances, everyone gives it their all: Diane Canova, Natalie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Wes Studi, Kevin Gage, Ted Levine, Miletti Williamson, Jon Voight (before his mind went bye bye) Tom Noonan, William Fichtner, Amy Brenneman and especially Dennis Haysbert and Val Kilmer. Talk about a powerhouse cast.And of course there's two guys - Pacino and DeNiro who never shared the screen before and a big deal was made out of it - and for good reason. Two guys, cut from the same cloth but on opposite sides of the law both with their own credos, they sell the movie. DeNiro's low key criminal suits him to a tee and while I usually find Pacino's yelling to be grating it works perfectly in this film.Michael Mann knows the nighttime. It's where he thrives and it's where he does his best work. And this movie is his pinnacle of PM mayhem. His script and direction are flawless and should have been nominated for an Oscar. It's a pulse pounding thrill ride with characters that are a different shade of the same color.As Vincent says ""What are you, a monk?I don't know how to do anything else"", Neil responds ""Neither do I.""The point is that they both don't want to do anything else.And neither does Michael Mann.And we are better for it5/5P.

"One of the more necessary American crime films from recent years, as character as well as genre are given harsh redressings.","The sorts of characters, and it is mostly low-lives, that inhabit Michael Mann's 1995 crime film opus are serial killers; thieves; ex-cons and gamblers, even those who aren't immediately applicable to those particular tags carry their own traits and flaws, one that'll see them get into hot water at some point in the piece. But to tell someone the film is possessed by these sorts of characters, however true it might be, would still be somewhat misleading as this is not the freak show of circus side-acts and dumbed down criminal caricatures one might initially think. Mann's film deals with some raw content from both sides of the law, content born out of various individuals' relationships with wives, partners and children; content born out of why it is what they do and how it can have as much-an affect on their private lives as it does their own lives.I read that it took Mann years to get the film made, doing what was perceived as a 'dumbed down' version via 1989's L.A. Takedown in the mean time. This was before Scorsese's Goodfellas arrived in 1990, a film that took the villain of the American crime film genre and fleshed him out to the point of skeletal in his being stripped bare, in doing so spawning a number of American crime films which enjoyed, within reason, deconstructing what were otherwise hard-bodied, villainous archetypes within a genre and getting under their skin in what they do, how they speak and how they operate. Nowadays people come away from such films remembering, indeed either relating to or liking more, the crime-infused villain more than anyone else, particularly if there is a 'just' co-lead. De Niro's character here joins a long list that sees mostly everyone from Liotta's Goodfellas character; to Jackon's in either Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown; to one of the two kidnappers in 1996's Fargo; right the way through to 2008 and Ledger's recent turn in The Dark Knight.But that isn't to say crime or a criminal lifestyle is glamorised in anyway, particularly in Heat. There is a beautifully observed sub-plot, nothing more than a mere diversion which has about five total minutes of screen time, utilising a character who has just got out of prison and is beginning a crummy job at a burger joint cleaning toilets and mopping floors. Later, they are given a proposition which will lure them back into the world of crime and violence. The point here, in this brief span of sub-narrative, being that everyday work is long and arduous, while you have an initial choice in which career you take - but a life of crime, no matter how appealing or alluring, will take its toll on your life. Although the use of an African-American to enforce this point in the film may have garnered some criticism in the past.The film centres around a 'crew' of thieves, in which the leader is seemingly Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley, as enforced when they stand around following the realisation that the police are onto them and each of them seem to look to McCauley for guidance: a blurry eyed Michael Cheritto (Sizemore) somewhat weakly exclaiming ""Whatever. I'm with you."" to McCauley when faced with a predicament that will either change his life or end it. The others are a gambling junkie named Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer) and a Mexican named Trejo, played by Danny Trejo. On the flip-side of the coin, Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna, a serial crew foiler, attempts to rid Los Angeles of McCauley's crew in taking them down. This is perhaps where the inspiration for the title of the 1989 version of the film derives; harking back to my earlier point, the title of this film: ""Heat"" derives more from the criminally minded of the two sides, in particular McCauley's ideology of walking out on anything and everything if you smell the police (heat) closing in.This shifting of the title of the film from 'Takedown' (Police standpoint/goal) to 'Heat' (Criminal standpoint/ideology) only emphasises the post-Goodfellas idea of bringing everything round so that there's more of a weight on the fact the 'bad guys' are, at the end of the day, human as well. The film is polished, its mostly night-set cinematography decked out in navy blue, but its idea of a life in crime is quite ugly. The stark, harsh font used in the opening credits is metallic and uneasy on the eye; thus juxtaposing the 'look' of the film. It is a film that'll see the thief interact with a women in a loving manner, whilst at a book shop of all places, in a sequence that is soft and melancholy in its construction, before sleeping with her; but then cut to the police badgering and bullying a scrapyard employee. In another piece of work, the scenes would've stuck but the roles might've been reversed to enforce the inhumane and hard-bodied nature of the gangster and the good-hearted, kind, loving and melancholy nature of the chief cop.Heat essentially sees two individuals at the peak of their game go against one another, with whatever they have in the form of backup tailing them around. The fates of those on either side range from potential injury during full blown, breath-taking shoot outs with automatic weaponry in the streets of the city to more smaller things, such as a member of a SWAT team accidentally bumping into the side of a truck trailer, thus alerting the thieves to their presence. It's a film about crime, violence and procedure; but it is additionally concerned with genre archetypes as human beings, those whom feel; dream; realise flaws and balance marital issues. As far as attention to the intricacies of both character and plot go, as well as a number of other film-making conventions, Heat is a really creditable effort.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Is everyone on dope?,"Take the big moment of this movie. What the trailers touted. What was supposed to be the meeting of giants. The coffee scene with Deniro and Pacino. Both legendary film actors with credentials that are undeniable. What possessed them to allow this scene to get to the screen is beyond me. If your 10 years old you could have written the dialog. If your not and have kids, they have. In fact I have written this dialog as have many people that have put pen to paper and were ever drawn to cop/robber dramatic films. ""your going down brother"" Need I say more.Then I read the reviews here and I am even more stunned. If you eliminate the horrific Pacino/Deniro scene you have a decent movie. Perhaps I would have given it a 5. Plot lines that were meaningless. A movie that tried very, very hard to be something more than it is, or was. Over direction. And the rest of the script wasn't Shakespeare either. It wasn't just the ""big"" scene. It was all of them. Kilmer's part was comical. I don't think that was the intent.Anyway, I suppose, based on the unbelievable reviews for this movie here, I am in the vast minority. So if you haven't seen it yet all I would say is this.

While in this movie, i was not able to choose between the Protagonist and the antagonist characters in final breathtaking scene.I would undoubtedly recommend this movie to who is searching for an unpredictable and enjoyable film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"One of the best movies of its kind, period.","Absolutely masterful flick. Worth every minute spent, never a dull moment. Incredible cast. Beautifully told.There are very few movies with this level of film making executed so perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
More than De Niro and Pacino,"What can you say about this movie, that hasn't been said before? Not much, but I state my opinion nonetheless :o).It is undeniably an action classic, although some people will find it (too) slow moving. So if you're more the fast paced action movie viewer, there's a chance that you won't quite enjoy this movie that much.Apart from the well staged action scenes (and the much talked about on-screen meeting of Pacino and De Niro), the supporting cast has to be mentioned. Not only Val Kilmer (who hadn't been that good in a movie since Doc H. in ""Tombstone"" and since then might only have achieved a likewise performance in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", though comedic and overshadowed by Robert Downey Jr), but every single one. Be it Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight to name a few ...The great film about the movie then (for me) is not the action parts (can't say I don't enjoy them! ;o) ), but the acting in the movie. Nobody is overplaying his/her part.So great acting+good story+well ""executed""(directed)=Classic (imo)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very special,"I watched this nearly 20 years ago and it was immediatly one of my favorite movies. I remember in school we were discussing if this was better than The Godfather or not, some saying this just was the best movie all time. I agree it's up there. Rewatching it right now it's so different for me now, I understand and appreciate more of the details in the story then I did back then. It's really a class of it's own. I had no idea how many amazing cast there was in there and the exceptional work they delivered. I'm really grateful they made this and did it so well. For the perfect experience, enjoy it after the last day of work all setup to watch this in peace with no rush or interruptions. Because watching this is (and should be) a special event. It's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best movie ever made. Hands down.,"I've watched Heat dozens of times, at least twice a year for the last several, and it still blows me away every time. That cast is obviously unbelievable, you can look at it here so I don't have to tell you. But the movie doesn't lean on star power, it is a force of nature. The characters are complex and enigmatic. The plot is a roller coaster, the dialogue captivating, and more than that the scenes without any dialogue may be the most enthralling part. The shootout, the drive through the tunnel, Val Kilmer seeing his wife after the heist. Pacino is in his truest, most unhinged form. DeNiro is cold, smooth, powerful. This movie crushes me every time I see it and I don't believe it will ever be matched, let alone surpassed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Intelligent, tense, and thrilling, Mann's ""Heat"" is more than an just an ordinary crime film","""Heat"", much more than a typical crime drama, is a character-driven masterpiece of writing and a film so riveting and fascinating that one cannot take his or her eyes off the film for one second without possibly missing a masterful shot or a fine bit of character development. If the film's intelligent, appropriately 'epic', character-driven screenplay wasn't enough to make this a great film, then surely Mann's brilliant direction, Dante Spinotti's photography, and Elliot Goldenthal's memorable score make this a great film.Of course, the big selling point for ""Heat"" to this day is the union of screen legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. I am not certain whether the film's excellent screenplay was written by Mann with these two actors in mind, but it doesn't feel like it because it does not feel for a second like a cheap marketing gimmick, and the two actors actually share very little screen time together (for the first time, as despite both of them appearing in ""The Godfather: Part II"", they were not in any scenes together). When they do, it is tasteful and interesting. The scene in the diner where they first really meet, not counting a quick encounter on the street just before, is perhaps the true centerpiece of the film, even more so than the famed shootout. In that short, beautiful scene the two main characters discover just how similar to and yet different from each other they are.The film is brilliantly. It is around three hours in length, but passes faster than most 90 minute films. The film masterfully builds tension while developing characters in its early stages in what some might call subplots, which is entirely missing the point of this film being driven by the characters rather than strictly by the plot. The film has a loose 'main' plot, but is a true epic, one which concentrates on many different characters and stories in almost equal measure. It builds up to a climax which lasts for an entire hour, a riveting, spectacular, epic, brilliant hour of film that begins with the shootout. Oh, the great, famous ""Heat"" shootout in the middle of the street in broad daylight. My opinion may be blasphemy to some, but I think this is one of the best and most exciting scenes in film history. It's as well-shot and edited as any of cinema's most well-known action scenes.The immediate thing that stands out about the visual look of the film is how carefully and beautifully composed some of the shots are, the prime example being the film's stunning final shot (which follows an equally astonishing final sequence), which is certainly up there with the great final shots in cinema. The film's look cannot be credited entirely to Mann, as frequent Mann collaborator (The Last of the Mohicans, The Insider) Dante Spinotti's work as cinematographer is certainly impressive as well. This cast is certainly much bigger than Pacino and De Niro, and I can't think of one performance, not even Jon Voight's that can be called anything less than excellent. From Val Kilmer to Tom Sizemore to Ted Levine to Ashley Judd, the supporting cast is terrific. Even Natalie Portman's good.""Heat"" is a masterclass. The writing, direction, cinematography, acting, everything about the film is great from start to finish. Truly a brilliant film, and one that will not be forgotten anytime soon. It doesn't work because it is a good crime thriller, it works because it's a terrific character drama, one which I find more and more involving with every viewing.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Superior thriller with some depth,"How can a film starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro be bad? It really can't because they would never approve the script or director. By that I mean, they would pass. The fact that neither of them passed says something.At the very least, this is a pretty good film.And it is. In fact I think this will be one of the defining films of the nineties. I suspect it will be viewed in distant eras and scrutinized for clues about the American psyche, circa 1995. Some will see a fantasy glorifying professional criminals and the men who fight them. This will be true. Others will see a morality tale about good and evil played out with women in the background, but actually in the forefront of our consciousness.I wish this part had been more fully developed.Eady, played by Amy Brennaman, chooses the man who excites her (De Niro) and ends up with nothing (but she had an exhilarating ride). Charlene, played by Ashley Judd, swaps her men around, searching for the best deal, the one who will best provide for her and the one she can best manipulate. Justine, played by Diane Venova, cannot help but choose the workaholic super cop (Pacino) because he is so superior to any other man she's ever met, particularly to her first husband, the uncaring father of her adolescent girl. But her life will never be secure because he is always leaving her alone so he can chase criminals because that is what he really loves.Some of this is a mafia-style film without the mafia. We have the same worshipful attitude toward those who thumb their noses at society and give orders that must be obeyed, super macho guys who bond together and follow the code, guys who can out shoot and out fight mere mortals. This is part of the fantasy. We see the expensive cars and the dinners with the beautiful women and the adorable children at fancy restaurants as part of the booty of being men who aren't afraid to take what they want regardless of risk. These men will always have the pick of the herd because if successful their mates know they will get a lot of the goodies of this world, and if unsuccessful, there's always the next risk taker who might succeed.This is a complex film and I would have to view it twice to make sure it all fits. Being a thriller, I know off hand that it won't. Thrillers unravel. But life is too short to view this twice, so I will say I wasn't offended by the unlikely events: the fact that the touted bank robbery scene was like a war scene filmed with surround sound effects and jittery camera immersions and bullets flying everywhere-semi-plausible even if nobody seemed to run out of ammunition. The robbery of the armored truck was nicely done except that the tire-puncturing chain strewn across the street for the pursuing cop cars seemed a bit stagy, and the whole thing required the most exquisite timing. In the uncompleted break-in there was a familiar ""Mission Impossible"" tension-filled race against the clock that seemed authentic, but probably wasn't. The Los Angeles environs, especially the final scene at LAX, provided atmospheric locales that made everything seem real and immediate.Where I think director Michael Mann went astray was his insistence on giving the audience the expected confrontation between the two big stars, a subplot that reached its low point with the phony bonding scene with De Niro the bad guy and Pacino the good guy having coffee together and exchanging dreams like blood brothers. This mutual admiration society was right out of some WWII film in which the American general admires the courage and cunning of his Nazi counter part and vice versa. De Niro's final line was a little corny, but Pacino's squeezing his hand reminded me of the way a big cat lovingly licks its prey after killing it. Bottom line though, Pacino and De Niro made us believe, or at least suspend judgment for awhile, and that is what Hollywood is all about.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"I think I'm the only one, but this is the best film I've ever seen,","There is so much more to Heat than whats on its surface. It is so well directed, acted,written, scored and photographed that it takes mulitple viewings to take it all in. This is the best crime movie ever made. And, since my first viewing over 5 years ago, I have seen it a countless number of times. After all of these viewings I can only say that this is my favorite film to watch and therefore the best film I have ever seen. I will not divulge into plot because the expanse and depth of the films story, I could not do justice with a shorthand overview of its plot. This film is not about its plot, it is about its characters and what they feel. Michael Mann is my favorite filmmaker, his list of credits, admittedly, doesn't strike many people as the resume of the greatest living director, but when you watch those films you can see the gift this man possesses at telling a story and making us feel for his characters. There are three scenes in this movie that had me so drawn in, I still think about them often. One is the films first scene, Elliot Goldenthal's mesmirizing electronic score captivates us in the first shots of the train carrying Neal McCauley (Robert DeNiro)and leave me, and the audience wanting more. The third comes toward the end as McCauley and his boss Nate (a wonderful Jon Voigt) exchange their last words as Neal is planning on leaving the country the words the choose and attitudes they strike almost had me in tears. These are two hard men and this is far as they will go with their heartfelt goodbyes. The films last scene I will not give a description to as not to ruin the plot for you. I contains the best (almost) wordless exchange I've ever seen in a film. The music swells and Mann allows us to linger on the last shot. It brought me to tears, and still does. This is the best film I've ever seen. I doubt you will see it that way, but trust me you will love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cash of the Titans?,"(There are Spoilers) Overlong and mindless crime drama that has to do with this master bank robber Neil McCauley, Robert De Niro, who becomes the object of L.A police Let. Vincent Hanna's, Al Pacino, obsession, The two get involved in a battle of wits and bullets that turns the city of Las Angeles into Baghdad Iraq by the time the movie ""Heat"" is finally over. Inolved in a number of high profile robberies Neil has become a bit soft in his life long career in crime. Neil is planing to pull off just one more multi-million dollar bank robbery and then call it quits and retire.Let.Hanna on McCauley's tail want's to prevent him from pulling off his grand slam bank holdup but is always stymied as McCauley is one step ahead of him. Even though after the first armor car robbery, that resulted in the three armor car guards getting shot to death by McCauley & Co., all McCauley and his gang did was do each other in. As well as being, or trying to be, double-crossed by big time mob money launderer Roger Van Zant,William Fichtner, who's over one million dollars in untraceable Bearer Bonds the McCauley gang took in the armor car robbery and attempted to sell back to him at .60 on the dollar. This after Van Zant got back all the money that he lost in stolen bonds back which were covered by his insurance company.Were then bombarded with both McCauleys and Hannas personal life that goes on for almost an hour like a day time TV soap opera and really has very little to to with the movie's basic theme about crime and punishment in the streets and airport of L.A. All that confuses and bores you to the point that your almost put to sleep watching it.Who cares about Hanna's relationship with his old lady Justine, Diane Venora, and who she sleeps with! Even Let. Hanna doesn't seem too concerned he's only angry that Justine's lover Ralph, Xander Berkeley, has the nerve to watch his TV set and couldn't care less if he slept with Justine or not. Det. Hanna's step-daughter Lauren, Natelie Portman, is so upset over his and her moms bickering that she attempts to kill herself. Lauren does this by slashing her wrists and then trying to drown herself in her step-fathers apartments bathtub.McCauley also gets involved with this young graphic designer Eady, Amy Brenneman, but it's so out of character for him that it leads to his ultimate demise at the end of the movie. McCauley juggling between Eady's going along with him, to heaven knows where, in his attempted escape from being captured by the police at the L.A Airport and then going out of his way to murder Wangro, Kevin Gage, at the airport hotel that's crawling with L.A policemen. Wangro who was involved in the opening scene armor car robbery was later kicked out of McCauly's gang, and almost killed by him. Yet how did Wangro somehow seems to have gotten a hold of McCauley's later plans to rob a midtown L.A bank? it's never explained what and how Wangro knew about the impending bank robbery since he was totally out of the loop when it was planned and later executed! And what exactly had Wangro's later involvement with the Van Zant mob have to do with him informing on McCauley's plans to the police?There's also Jon Voight as this big mob honcho Nat who looks like General Custer at the Little Big Horn. Voight pops up every now and then in the movie, giving McCauley advice that's always on target, but who's part in the film is never really explained by the script writers. As well as not clarifying the story behind the Shiherlis' Chris & Charlene, Val Kilmer & Ashley Judd. The wacky couples zany and bizarre relationship soon threatens to screw up all of McCauley's plans for his last big score.Chris gets badly shot up in the L.A bank robbery and looks like he's about to die from his wounds but then what seems like only hours later he shows up, with a new haircut, totally recovered! Chris also comes up with a new identity that was so convincing that even Let. Hanna and the LAPD had to let him go free! This after he was involved in the deaths of at least a dozen innocent people and L.A policemen that afternoon!We earlier saw Charlene give Chris some kind of hand signal as the L.A police were about to pinch him, in a sting they set up for him. But all Chris did was turn around in his car and drive out of sight and like magic he was immune from prosecution?The movies ridicules ending was about as exciting as a game of chess. Both Let. Hanna and his rival and adversary in the movie Neil McCauley are seen running for what seemed like the length of the Boston Marathon all around L.A Airport and it's surroundings. This was all done I suspect so those of us, still awake and waiting to see the big showdown between the two, could finally switch the channel and get back to watching something that makes more sense and is far more interesting; like the Saturday Morning Cartoons.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This film is special,"Heat is much more than an amazing cat-and-mouse crime tale, the viewer gets involved in the characters personal lives, their relationships and their family problems, it ends up being a story on loneliness and alienation too.Pacino plays Vincent Hanna, a workaholic detective obsessed with bringing down Niel McClauley, played by De Niro, a skillful and methodical thief who always seems to get what he wants. Vincent and Neil's dynamic, one in which villain and hero respect, and almost admire, each other skills as they they keep trying to one-up the other, it's one of my favourite ever. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are incredible, as usual. I love the type of ""classy villain"" De Niro plays in this, his personal story was incredibly engaging, he is my favourite. This films is packed with talented actors though, all the performances are awesome, but a big shout out to Val Kilmer as Chris whose storyline is also so compelling.The robbery/heist scenes are great.

Quite a bore and overrated,"I watched this movie twice now. First a couple of years after its release and again last night. I did not remember much of the plot or character from the my first viewing which is not a good sign. I am a fan of Al Pacino and De Niro, but what a waste of talent. Al Pacino first, well he is Al Pacino playing a cop. You don't see a cop you see Al Pacino, no creativity and no effort in making the character more subtle. De Niro is quite better playing it it cool and professional with a little bit of nostalgia in his eyes, but he cannot save the movie.I could not care about the other characters in the movie. Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd and Tom Sizemore are usually good, but their character development was quite weak. Although the movie is pretty long, it seems that each scene was missing the point and at the end we do not feel any sympathy for any of the crew members, except De Niro. What about Dennis Haybert character, what the point ? Why adding a side story for a few minutes of interaction ?I haven't seen the original, but it seems that it is the problem of adapting the story and trying to fit everything in it, but missing important links.I put a five because of the cinematography and for the action scene that show LA from a different angle.But again, Al Pacino and De Niro in a movie and that all what we get, sad....",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Masterclass in Tension and Character Depth,"*Heat* (1995), directed by Michael Mann, is a gripping crime thriller that stands out for its detailed character development and tense action sequences. The film revolves around a cat-and-mouse game between a meticulous bank robber (Robert De Niro) and an obsessive LAPD detective (Al Pacino). The narrative perfectly balances intense action scenes with moments of emotional depth, allowing the audience to see both the professional and personal sides of its characters.What makes *Heat* exceptional is its attention to atmosphere, with Mann's direction creating a moody, almost noir-like tone. The iconic diner scene between De Niro and Pacino, where they discuss their opposing life philosophies, is a cinematic gem. Though the film runs long at nearly three hours, it rarely feels sluggish due to its engrossing story and strong performances.**Rating: 9/10**

A great cop thriller with a rich tapestry of characters and subplots topped with two fantastic actors brought together for the first time,"Neil McCauley is a professional crook; he and his crew do very planned and detailed jobs and execute them without error.  Vincent Hanna is a cop who's life revolves around catching criminals with robbery homicide division. One botched job brings these two men into direct confrontation, sparking a cat and mouse game where McCauley's crew wants one last job, regardless of the heat that is being put on them by Hanna.The fact that this film brings with it one of the most anticipated onscreen pairings in recent memory is only the icing on a cake that stands out as one of the best cop thrillers of the 1990's.  Essentially a remake of the much lesser LA Takedown, Mann delivers a story that is a simple tale of two men on the opposite sides of the law who clash heads over one job - each using the skills they have in their field in an attempt to do what they have to do, but only one can succeed.  However this is layered with such great characters that it is difficult not to be impressed - many films would benefit from even half the characters and subplots that this has.If they hadn't worked, then these subplots and side characters would have felt unnecessary and really dragged the film down.  It is to the script's credit that this doesn't happen here and what they actually do is strength and enrich the central narrative and easily fills out the running time. The direction is great - visually the film is impressive and it really uses the streets of LA to good effect; I was really taken by how Mann was able to not only manage that side of things but to also to deliver on the characters as well.  It is not without problems though - and some of the subplots are running for some time before we find out what the point of the character is (most notably in Breedan's cook).  Also some of the threads seem unnecessary and distract - the fact that McCauley's betrayer is also a rapist is a side issue, while Lauren's problems are not dealt with that well.The plot is a solid crime thriller but it is the characters that make it so much better - in particular those of Hanna and McCauley, both of whom are well developed to the point that the audience never sides for one over the other.  The John Woo thread where the two men have admiration for one another is well done but not overdone.Of course a massive boost to the delivery of this dynamic is the pairing of two actors who, regardless of bad spells, are rightly revered as two of the finest of their generation.  Both are on great form here and it is as good a showcase for them as any other film.  It is impossible to say who is better because both are excellent - hell, even Pacino's OTT woo-ha'ing works here! Both bring so much to their performances, using minor facial expressions to convey so much - just look at De Niro as he drives through the tunnel at the end, we don't need to be told his inner thoughts because De Niro lets us see them.  The plot holds back their first meeting and it is worth waiting for - it doesn't overdo it and it proves that less is more.  They both underplay in a scene that lacks fireworks but is immensely satisfying.On top of this the support cast are roundly excellent with the material to work with in most cases.  Kilmer is not great normally but is excellent here, as is Sizemore and a nice role for John Voight.  It may be strange to see Haysbert now that he is famous for 24, but he is good here - even if the relevance of his subplot is less than clear until later.  Fitchtner, Williamson, Levine and Noonan are all good but, if the film has a weak link, then it is in the female characters.  The female cast are good on paper but they aren't given their fair share of the material.  Judd stands out because she is given a decent character but Portman, Venora and the beautiful Brenneman are only really required to fit in the best they can.  In fairness this is a minor compliant as such a rich tapestry was always going to have flaws - especially in such a masculine film.So, yes, this film has the odd weakness - the female roles aren't as strong as the male ones, and some of the subplots require a bit of faith that they will come through, but mostly the film hangs together as one that works superficially, on a basic plot level but also deeper with great characters who have their own lives and are not simply there to say their lines and fill in the background.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Iconic 90s movie!,"The plot isn't the most original thing and some of the secondary characters feel sort of tacked on (e.g the driver). However, unlike most other action films the protagonists are given enought time to develop. The audience is given a chance to get familiar with their personal lives and distinct details of their personalities.Perhaps the most special sequence of scenes is the shootout after the bank robbery. The sound of the bullets echoing throughout the city, the robbers looking dapper as hell in their suits, the police cars being converted into swiss cheese. Those few minutes are absolutely one of the most momorable in the action genre as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best crime films ever made,"I was fascinated by this movie when I first saw it almost thirty years ago, and all these years later it still holds up as one of the best crime films ever made.On the surface, it's a story that's been done a million times before - a story of cops and robbers, specifically bank robbers. What Heat does differently that I think separates it from so many other movies in the genre that came before and after it is that it transcends the crime genre and delivers a master class in character study. Unlike so many crime movies, none of the characters in Heat are one-dimensional. The story shows what makes every main (and many secondary) characters tick, and does so no better than with the two main characters, Pacino's Lt. Vincent Hanna and DeNiro's Neil McCauley.It also illustrates both subtly and overtly the similarities between the two men, even though they operate on opposite sides of the law. This is something that had not been done in many crime films prior to Heat (which more often than not painted the cops and robbers as polar opposites), but has been imitated many times since, although nowhere near as masterfully as Michael Mann did in this film.Heat also has a lot of other things going for it that can never be duplicated - a truly substantive script written by Michael Mann, a master writer/director of the crime genre, two films the finest dramatic actors In DeNiro and Pacino in their prime, a deep roster of supporting cast including Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, and Any Brenneman, all of who just perfectly deliver their parts without any overacting. Even smaller roles given to Hank Azaria, Piven, and Tone Loc are delivered just perfectly. The other part of this movie that I think Mann nailed was the use of Los Angeles as a dominant character in the film, and not the glamorous side of LA either. Many of the scenes are shot in industrial and abandoned parts of LA (think the opening armored car heist, Pacino's stakeout, and the famous coffee scene). There aren't any scenes in Beverly Hills and almost none of the ocean. Mann shows the gritty side of LA, which adds to the general theme of the film in a highly effective way. Of course, no mention of the nuances that make this film such a classic would be complete without mentioning the bank robbery scene which in my opinion is the heart of this film. Without giving away any spoilers, this scene (which occurs about 2/3's of the way through the film) is the best bank robbery/shootout scene ever put on film. This was true when the movie was released in 1995 and it still holds up today, despite attempts from newer films like Den of Thieves to duplicate this (which they all fall short of). The robbery scene creates a frantic and intense tone to the final act of the film that wraps the film up perfectly, no matter how you feel about the ending.This movie remains one of my top five favorite films of all-time, and by far my favorite crime film. I watch this movie once or twice a year and it still holds up almost every bit as well as it did in 1995. A true masterpiece by Michael Mann.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Bloated script takes away from star power,"""I gotta hold on to my angst. I preserve it because I need it. It keeps me sharp (snaps fingers), on the edge (snaps fingers), where I gotta be.""Al Pacino vs. Robert De Niro has many of the moments you'd expect, and there is an epic feel to the face-off of these two tough guys. Unfortunately, the film built around them is incredibly bloated, with scenes involving relationships and side characters going on too long, so much so that it started becoming laughable - and even with all the extra time, the female characters being ridiculously drawn. The film just tries to do too damn much, just one example of which was tossing an attempted suicide in towards the end, and there are countless others. The second half also betrays the first, with De Niro's character improbably going against his own mantra by not walking away from it all when he senses danger. The interesting cat and mouse game between detective and con-man takes a step backward when the script has them meet in a contrived way (hint: they both tell each other how they'll take the other down), and then devolves completely into testosterone-laden action scenes like the bank job that lose any semblance of subtlety. This needed to be about half as long, and with something more surprising up its sleeve in the story line.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Long and Boring,"Has its good points, but at nearly 3 hours this movie is crying out for editing. I would have left out the whole Waingro as serial killer bit, including the scene with the hooker and the subsequent finding of the body - its inconsequential, irrelevant, and left unresolved. I also would've left out the whole ""sell VanZandt his bonds back"" subplot and just had Waingro be a straight out snitch. It would cut out a lot of nonsense, and leave the movie a lot leaner and meaner. Basically only include the armored car job, the foiled metals heist, and the bank job and denouement. At an hour and fifty minutes, this would be an action packed thriller. At 3 hours, it's kind of a yawn-fest.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Writer director Michael Mann's masterpiece to the general public,"Heat is a classic and is elevated above the standard cops and robbers film by a few elements. Firstly it has possibly the two greatest actors of all time Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Secondly it is written and directed by the greatest filmmaker of all time Michael Mann.

Epic in every way,"This film is phenomenal, it grabs a simple premise and it manages to transform it into something engaging and thought provoking on an epic scale. This film has not 1 but 2 fantastic performances by Robert De Niro And Al Pacino, they both play suit their roles perfectly and they succeed in making every scene they are in entertaining.But their is more to itthis film isn't just about a bank heist, a cat and mouse game or crime. Its actually a brilliant study of risks and consequences. The themes aren't really the main focus of the movie, but they do play out in a natural way sense the narrative is driven by 2 very flawed characters that suffer from basically the same problem.I don't want to spoil much but this is all I can say about this (almost) masterpiece, its entertaining well done and very impactful on an emotional level, and it is without a doubt one of the best crime films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I Must Be Missing Something,"I am not sure what I am missing, or if this just isn't my type of movie but nothing about this movie screamed great to me. It's not a bad movie, it's just slightly above average. To me, it's just like any other cops and robbers movie, there is nothing that stands out as special with this one. Seeing Pacino and De Niro on the screen was nice, I liked Pacinos random outbursts and I would say the best scene was when De Niro found out initially they were being tracked and he was starting right at the infrared camera. Other than that, it was extremely drawn out with minimal surprises or intense dialogue. Half way through the movie it was easy to predict what was going to happen and I have to say unless I'm missing something, this is overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
When movies were great,"Well where do you start?. It doesn't glorify either side, infact the police side of it comes of worst. Brilliant acting by every single actor.

Brilliant and the shoot-out wow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
May Or May Not Be Too Much...Depending,"Not the Director's best film, it is a complex coupling of two mega-stars in an action/character study that ends with mixed results. The stylish shootouts and the sprawling landscape are really the attraction here with the threading of streetwise cops and hoodlums holding it together in a rather long expose of a cat and mouse game of life and death.The much talked about talk in the diner between the two stars comes off as rather ho-hum and the ending is not fully satisfying and seems elevated to an unnecessary mythical status.The best parts are better than most films of this type but the inclusion of the home lives never elevates the story, in fact it seems an addition rather than an insightful inclusion. Not a bad try at adding some humanity to the genre but some of it doesn't click and the film is lesser for it.Overall, forget the hype about the actors and settle in for a long story that may or may not be too much depending on your expectations and anticipations of the expansive underpinnings of humanity that is not usually served with this type of offering.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You MUST be joking.... OVERRATED,"What an awful, awful movie. It is twice as long as it needs to be, for what the actual tired story really is. There are soooo many tangling plot lines that are never tied together, and some are frankly quite interesting. Al Pacino's character has an interesting ""relationship"" with his 3rd wife, and Natalie Portman's character is having severe problems, but she's only in a few scenes and we don't learn what ultimately happens to her.To invest 3 hours in at least a dozen characters and to come away with nothing.....unreal! Even at such a length there are leaps in the action. And I was quite bored. If I hadn't rented it, I would not have sat through the entire thing. If it were on TV, I would have shut it off after a half-hour.There's no doubt the cast is first-class, but they are wasted in one of the most overrated, predictable and boring films I've ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Let's have a cup of coffee,"Maybe the crime genre is not my favourite, but without any doubt ""Heat"" is one of the most well known and respected movies in this genre. On top of that not often do Robert de Niro (master criminal Neil McCauley) and Al Pacino (experienced cop Vincent Hanna) share the leading roles.Somewhere halfway the film the two of them meet to drink a cup of coffee. The scene is very famous and rightly so because it contains one of the essences of the film. Hannah and McCauley view themselves as opponents or even antagonists (in the sense that they can't both reach there goals at the same time), but they don't see each other as enemies. For that there is too much mutual respect.The coffee scene is not only the most famous scene in the movie, for me it was also a dividing line between a good first part and a second part that didn't manage to maintain the same (high) level.In the first half Michael Mann portrays the criminal scene. McCauley as leader of the gang has to posses significant HR qualities to keep the team together. He has to get rid of a deranged cowboy (Waingro) and mediate in the marital problems of another (Chris Shiherlis). In this way he is a bit like Max (Jean Gabin) in ""Touchez pas au grisbi"" (1954, Jacques Becker), who also went at great length to keep the relations well within his criminal organisation, although with Max it was more about male friendships than about saving marriages.A great sequence in the first half is also the montage in which we first see an evening out of the gang of McCauley (and their wifes) and after that an evening out of Hanna and his colleagues (and their wifes). The message being (in my opinion) that their lives are not so different as we think. Yes they are on different sides of a moral divide (bad guys versus good guys) but the addiction to adrenaline and action is the same, not to speak if the difficulties of having a normal marriage. The similarities between underworld and overworld (although on slighty different aspects) were also shown in ""M"" (1931, Fritz Lang).The second half was for me a little bit too action oriented and too much focused on the de Niro - Pacino confrontation. Espacially the ending scene is teetering on the edge of melodrama.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
a masterpiece crime drama/action hybrid with memorable performances,"I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for the drawn out ""climax"" and the whole tangent between De Niro and his woman. I understand the necessity of that element, but his character is so indifferent throughout that it lost me completely. That said, about his character, I get it; he isn't supposed to be flamboyant, he's rigid and unforgiving, he lives by a strict creed, and De Niro nails it flawlessly. He just isn't nearly my favorite character. And there's so many to pick from! Heat offers you a slew of people to latch onto, emotionally and empathetically, or even apathetically. Every character showcases his own qualities and flaws, making even the bad guys likable in some cases, but when it comes right down to it they are, clear as day, the bad guys. And all the actors and actresses put on stellar performances. Al Pacino especially; Val Kilmer was a favorite for me, and even Waingro, as despicable a man as he was in the movie, depicted so memorably by Kevin Gage. Even Danny Trejo, who is such a small role, has. Subtle yet powerful performance in the third act. And then there's the action. While the movie is undeniably long, it isn't boring, with the exception of my aforementioned gripe with De Niro's romantic tangent. Aside from that, even when guns aren't blazing (every gunfight is raw and gritty and intensely filmed), there is action to be had. The script is ingenious and cinematography immersive. Have seen multiple times and will watch again in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Heat,"An excellent movie that did not disappoint expectations at all. The story of the movie was amazing, but the romantic side in the movie was not good, unlike the crime side. The acting in the movie was excellent, especially from Al Pacino, who was an amazing performance in the movie. Robert De Niro's acting was not at the level of his other films, but he is still Excellent, I didn't like exaggerating some action scenes, but it's still an excellent movie and I recommend watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Watched it nearly 30 years ago, just watched again","I watched this movie when it first came out and I guess it didn't leave a lasting impression on me because I have never really felt the need to go back and watch it again. You know those classics that you just have to revisit every few years? For me it's The Godfather, The Deer Hunter, The Revenant etc. You have to go back and watch your favourites because they are just so darned good!So why no revisit for Heat? It has some big hitters, Pacino, De Niro, Kilmer and others that set their stalls out with this movie. On paper the story is text book must-see stuff. But, for some unknown reason, it just didn't ring my bell back in the mid nineties.And then, it keeps coming up. Friends remind me about it. Apps, based on the relentless pursuit of data modelling and their unnerving way of knowing what 'I need' keep telling me that it's my kind of movie. Tom Hiddleston does a very entertaining impression of Pacino and De Niro in a key moment of the movie on the Graham Norton show (if you haven't seen it, check YouTube, it's great!).I am left with no choice. Happily, I don't have to pay to rent or buy the movie as it is on Netflix. And....? Well it's awful, the pyro effects are worse than movies twice the age, some of the acting by support characters is just gosh darn cheesy, and some of the character relationships are just totally implausible. But, yes I am going with a Jeremy Clarkson moment, it is also utterly brilliant. After 5 or 10 minutes of seat shuffling, wondering if I should just watch something else, wondering if my natural born ability as a movie critic is in fact spot on, I then fell under the spell of this movie. Once you are engaged, and prepared to forgive some of its shortcomings, the movie becomes spellbinding.If for no other reason, (there are many other reasons), watch for the famous coffee shop meeting between the Al and Bob. It's cheesy, it's over acted and it is absolutely ridiculously brilliant!!That's all folks;)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Michael Mann's the best 90's action crime saga masterpiece flick - my personal favorite movie of all time,"To me one of the best action crime saga masterpiece movie of the 90's by Michael Mann. I love this movie to death! It is my personal favorite action movie of all time. To me this is one of the best movies of all time!!!! You have great cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Dennis Haysbert, Danny Trejo, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Kevin Gage, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Tom Noonan, Jon Voight and Jerry Trimble. You have two great actors square off at each other Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Heat (1995) is a great film, it is a kick-ass action crime drama movie. It is a great crime EPIC drama has action and thriller elements.The movie is 3 hrs long, but is not boring goes fast around. Heat is a remake by Mann of an unproduced television series he had worked on, the pilot of which was released as the TV movie L.A. Takedown in 1989. I saw L.A. Takedown on VHS played by actor Scott Plank in the role as Vincent Hanna. Sadly Scott Plank past away in 2002 and he is no longer with us anymore. He was in Melrose Place Season 5 and 6. The actor is really missed. In my opinion Heat is much better movie than L.A. Takedown with a better cast. Great story, great plot.A brilliant L.A. cop (Al Pacino) following the trail a deadly armed roberry to a crew headed by an equally briliant master thief (Robert De Niro). Al Pacino has this crew: Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Ted Levine and Jerry Trimble. Robert De Niro has his crew: Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Kevin Gage, Danny Trejo, Jon Voight and Tom Noonan. Great cast of actors that i know.Michael Mann is one of the greatest directors ever. I did not like Miami Vice movie, I loved the series. In this movie it is a cop looking for a criminal. I love Collateral (2004) I have not seen that film in a long time, but I love it. Manhunter I enjoy I would say it is better than Red Dragon. I love Heat to death I love that Michael Mann produced Miami Vice (1984 -1989) one of my favorite TV shows. My favorite Michael Mann movies are Heat and Collateral they are my favorite movies of all time. Collateral I watched during my sophmore year on DVD with my friends. I have both of the movies on Blu-ray discs. This is a heist movie it belongs there with Point Break (1991) one of the best heist movies of all time I love and enjoy both of the version movies. Heat to me is much better than Point Break, much better executed.I love Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective he was a great character cop. Al Pacino's best performance for me. I love the character, he saved daughter of his girlfriend when she slit her wrist. I love his line because She Has a Great Ass!!! Or Don't waste my time! I love his vision, he was a tough marine. He take down McCauley's crew. He killed and shot two members of the crew. I prefer Al Pacino's character more than Robert De Niro's character. I always rooted for the good guys I have rooted for Vincent Hanna beacuse he is a good guy I am always be the good guy the boy scout. I love how Hanna was huging this mom when her daugther was killed by Weingro (Gage). It is great acting performance from Al Pacino.I love Robert De Niro's performance a professional thief Neil McCauley. He was smart, intelligent, high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies, he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. I love De Niro's acting performance I don't root for him but I love De Niro in this movie and this film to death!!!I love Kevin Gage as Weingro I love his character I love actor Kevin Gage. I read on trivia that he went in prison in 2003 and most of his inmates called him Weingro he was respected in prison. I love Val Kilmer his best performance. Ashley Judd was great. Jon Voight is in here as De Niro's acomplice. Jerry Trimble was also cast in this movie as one of the detectives in Hanna's team. Tom Noonan has a little scene in here, with a beared he was helping McCauley. Reminds on my dad with that beard ha ha. Tom Sizemore's best performance as Micheal Cherito I love his character.I love the shootut bank robbery heist. Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) pulls out an FN FNC-80 assault rifle during the shootout on Flower Street, and uses it to kill Cheritto when Cheritto - who is firing at Drucker and several other cops - grabs a little girl as a human shield. I love when McCauley's crew a firing on cops you see Hanna and McCauley firing at each other. Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) fires at cops, Val Kilmer's reload was so fast and smooth that this clip was used in U.S. Marine Corps training videos, to show new recruits how it should be done in combat. I love the shootout it is my favorite action scene. I love the finale Vincent Hanna chases down McCauley with a shootgun on the tarmac at LAX. They shoot eachother with their guns but Hanna sees McCauley's shadow and shoots him. I love the finale.I love the music score by Elliot Goldenthal great score well done.I really love the bank heist to me it was realistic it was no fantasy. The acting the story it was realistic. It is how is normal life and I just really miss 90's movies like how they are done. Heat (1995) deserves to be called a mesterpiece on the best action crime drama movie sof all time. I like the love story between McCauley and Amy Brenneman as Eady I think the actress did great.Heat (1995) to me is one of the best kick-ass action movie sof all time, it is my personale favorite action film of all time with Point Break (1991). It is a great film, it is entertaning. This movie deserves an oscar they both deserves an oscar. To me it is better than all Three Godfathter movies. God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters by Moby is a great music song, great look, solid performances it is a cop and criminal movie that is wonderful done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The best crime-movie ever,"As a long time fan of Heat I keep getting amazed every time I see it. No other crime movie has ever taken the time to build up every character so thoroughly. Even the ultimate bad guy Waingro is not just a shallow character communicating with corny one-liners. Actually so much of the depth of the characters come out through subtle facial expressions, e.g. Diane Venora when Pacino leaves her at the hospital (the camera lingers long enough for her posture to speak a thousand words) Ashley Judd in the couch after signaling to her husband...I hold my breath with her and almost faint every time I see that scene. For gun buffs you gotta love the sound effects of gun fire. For once guns are really loud and not like most movies where people talk calmly to each other while firing guns.The fact that no judgment is passed on the criminal crew or the cops is simply superb. There are no ""good guys"" and ""badguys"" here only complete characters.This is a remake of Mann's earlier L.A. Takedown. A much improved version that is, and I can see why Mann wanted to do this story right. Another thing I love is that Mann pays homage to ""that other great crime movie"" Bullitt. This is apparent in the very end of the movie during the airport chase, a scene that also concludes Bullitt.If Stanley kubric is the master of natural light, then Michael Mann must be the master of artificial and post-processed light. The visual side of Heat is absolutely STUNNING and the soundtrack work in perfect harmony with the images. Ladies and gentlemen, this is art!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Two S tier actors, what could go wrong?","Two of the 20 centurys biggest movie starts as the Antagonist and protagonist - what could go wrong?Not growing up with the works of Al Pacino or De Niro I don't think I will ever get into the same bubble as every else, thinking each of their movies they are in instantly becomes a masterpiece. With that out of the way, let's break down what works and what doesn't. Writing the script and having the movie played out whit almost equaly as much screen time between the Protaganist and the Antagonist was it hard to get over the fact that one of them where to go out in the end, the buildup to the chase is nicely done but when it comes to the standoff does it in a way feel like you already know what and who is about to go down.The characteristics and personality of Pachinko's character are wonderful to watch and the exploding temper with the calmness is a perfect fit for a cop. Nicely done and perfectly acted.What the movie builds around and probably what it does best is the relationship between the Antagonist and Protagonist, and this could not have been better portrayed than the ""Up for a coffee"" scene. The constantly cat and rat scene is what keeps the movie in momentum and with the relationship between them feeling very close is the soul of this movie.The thing that in some way feel a bit untouched and that in the end probably could have been better handled for a deeper connection to the Protagonist is the relationship between him and hes wife's daughter witch is briefly touched on but seems to be a major part of the letting go statement in the end.A good movie that brings a slight touch to the usual rat and cat game but does not in my opinion make it something unusual or a movie I out of the blue would recommend to a friend watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece that gets better each year,"Heat is a film that has aged spectacularly well, I think because I've become aware that films at this scale and quality are simply not made much anymore, and that there are no real inheritors to DeNiro and Pacino's genius. This is simply an iconic film, and has surpassed many others over the years to become one of my all time favorites.Much has been said about how Michael Mann sculpted Los Angeles into a character, but I would go further and say it is the films primary antagonist: a city made of concrete, freeways and glass, encasing its characters into a kind of shellacked doom. Cops and crooks thrive by night, and if they do appear in the day, they are blinded by the reflections and hampered by it. The cinematography captures something sleek and beautiful about LA, but it's also distant and seemingly out-of-reach, a dream quality. The haze, the night time lights, and the nostalgic synthesizers, all evoke something of pristine, far-away beauty. During action scenes, cutaways to out-of-focus pedestrians, that on first glance we hardly notice, now seem to exist very deliberately, to fully immerse us into the enhanced reality of this world.The writing. Rich and intensely confident. It puts the knockoffs to shame, and exposes many other screenwriters as lazy. Mann knows his stuff, lived this world - somehow, somewhere - through people, research, experience. I don't know. The wording between both worlds, the criminal and cop jargon, recall the precision of the best hard boiled novelists. This isn't writing that just comes easy. It came from over a decade of gestation, development and even a predecessor pilot (LA Takedown, still found online) before coming to fruition so perfectly as this film.They other key are the performances. It is an ensemble of masterclass players. Mann plucked some of the best actors around for this, and even the bit parts fill out the margins with talent. Of course Pacino and DeNiro basically sing their way through this - we can't take our eyes off them - but every character is so distinct, so well drawn. And notably, the female roles are so much better developed than those found in standard adrenalized 'masculine' films - and as integral to the overall story and feeling as any of the male characters. Heat has a feminine touch, underneath it all.Why this film earned exactly zero Academy Award nominations is a mystery, but I suspect it's because it all feels so effortless. I have watched Heat countless times. I'm always drawn in, always moved. Always seeing something I hadn't before. The layers keep unpeeling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Stunning.,"After watching this film for what seems the 100th time - I have come to the conclusion that it is truly a masterpiece crime drama.Mann has done so many good films, in different genres, like Last of the Mohicans, Manhunter, Collateral, The Insider, Thief - and yet this film stands head and shoulders above the others. Truly epic is scale, the tale of Cop and Thief is explored to its max, and is executed with extreme flair.De Niro and Pacino are top of their game - this being De Niro's last great role (along with the fantastic Casino). Both play their roles with precision - and when they finally meet (in the diner scene) both excel, neither putting an end to the ""who is better"" stakes. Pacino and his mouthy, yet troubled cop and De Niro's syntax-troubled thief make for one of the greatest duels in crime cinema history.Yet it is the fantastic team of supporting actors who help the main stars keep their balance. Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Diane Venora - only to mention a few - are fantastic.Heat is a modern noir, the urban Gothic, with stark sky's, hauntingly human snyth and a bruised L.A landscape. Mann has created such a deep film, that I can't express how much it means to me. Drama is great, acting is great and the action is superb (the heist scene to end all heist scenes) - so this film is the jewel in Mann's crown - and a benchmark for other films in the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Ageless classic !,"This is my first review I have ever written on IMDb. I felt the urge to do so quite a lot of times, but I thought there were so many already for the movies I wanted to do it for that there was no need. I just finished watching this movie for maybe the 20th time in my life of 26 years. There is simply one word this movie can be described with, and that is Masterpiece. Why do I say masterpiece? Because of this: 1. Acting - Stellar cast, most of them at the height of their careers. 2. Plot - Great story, plot holes are just for the nitpickers or the haters; 3. Cinematography - Probably some of the best heist scenes and a city at night ever shot on film. 4. Characters - Not all of them, but the main characters are well developed and you understand their motivation, their actions, their thoughts. This movie will not let you down. Perfect to watch in any situation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of my favorites,"With the extensive commentary by other reviewers, there's not much I can add here, other than this is one of my favorite crime dramas. There's so little crime and violence in my life that Heat seems to be a foreign film--and what a great one at that!Michael Mann has told a story of people I don't want to know but care about anyway. I was shocked and angered and frightened by the lives of DeNiro and Pacino and Sizemore and Kilmer.Heat is simply one of the most effective stories about criminals I've ever seen. It's not meant to be a message film or a documentary, just really good storytelling of a harsh, angry story.I don't want this level of misery and violence in my life, but watching good and evil battle it out in Heat on the streets and between the warehouses of LA was and one of the better 2 and 1/2 hour blocks I've spent in front of a screen.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Had a lot to live up to...fell flat,"I had this on my watchlist for years because it is so highly rated, user ratings especially. I am really surprised at how disappointing it was. The idea and setup was great but the direction left me emotionless. I was never connected to any of the characters, all the ""romance"" was soulless, and the action was even a little lackluster. A lot of squandered potential with an interesting story. Al Pacino's character was weird too. The way he interacted with informants, witnesses, coworkers, his family, all weird. I enjoyed DeNiro, Kilmer was fine, but overall it was just flat from start to finish. For a movie centered on suspense and thrill it was pretty dry and stale.

terrific Michael Mann style,"Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) leads a group of robbers including Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and Trejo (Danny Trejo) to rob an armored truck.

Police Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) leads the investigation.Michael Mann shows himself to be the master of the tense crime drama. The criminals are slick without being greasy. They are more the tough and quiet type. Following the criminals elevates the tension and the style points. De Niro is terrific and his encounter with Pacino is the stuff of legend. It's the first on-screen meeting between these two giants. The final bank shootout is something else entirely. It is pure tense gun action for the true fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Geeky Randy's summary,"Pretentious bank heist ""epic"" about a team of detectives led by over-the-top loud-mouthed Pacino on the trail of tight-knit group of robbers led by a-little-too-reserved De Niro. The film dates poorly; specifically, with Pacino screaming out supposedly clever lines that were probably witty for 1995, but nowadays is just seen as a cheap cry for attention. But even for 1995 standards, the film is incredibly overrated, what with your typical over-sappy and unnecessary Michael Mann unsexy love scene, or the ridiculous time spent (or wasted) developing overly-complex characters only to give them a rushed send-off. The tech aspect and the amazing band heist sequence (one of cinema's best) are both worth a look, but other than that, you're wasting your time.** (out of four)",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Doesn't Live Up To The Billing,"As a fan of Al Pacino's ""later years"" works, this seemed to be a gaping hole in my viewing of his films. When the film concluded after nearly three hours, however, I was left feeling severely disappointed by a whole slew of things in ""Heat"".For a basic plot summary, ""Heat"" sees Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) square off against notorious big-time criminal Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). As a sort of cat-and-mouse game emerges between those two leads, a secondary plot line focuses on one of De Niro's henchman (played by Val Kilmer).The #1 problem with this movie is simply that the story isn't anything to write home about. In fact, it is actually a sub-par plot that contains very little emotion or meaningful character development. It is a slow-moving, hard-boiled cop drama...but without any of the usual themes that make those types of movies watchable.Also, what really puts the nail in the coffin is that the acting (what should be the flick's strong suit) is also poor. I never thought Pacino could possible over-act a role, but he does here, while De Niro is pretty much just stoic throughout. I know those two can do much better, but this was just not a great vehicle for them to shine.I even considered giving ""Heat"" the dreaded one-star rating, but it isn't quite bad enough for that. There is one captivating scene involving Pacino/De Niro, and the plot is more recycled/dull than outright horrible.Basically, ""Heat"" is nowhere near the ""epic cop drama"" it is billed as. I would say go out a get ""Righteous Kill"" if you want to see a better Pacino/De Niro pairing. While that movie is only average in its own right, it still surpasses this bloated marathon.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Gets better with each viewing,"The first time I saw this I was about 12. All I knew then was the shootout scene that was in the trailer. So I spent nearly two hours watching and waiting for it. The scene did not disappoint but needless to say I was not a huge fan of the movie.Flash forward five years and I watched it again and loved it. Flash forward another five years and it became one of my top movies. Flash forward another five years and now it is basically my favorite movie. Why do I say all of this? Well, it is because this film has a lot going on in it and needs more than one viewing to truly appreciate it. I read how someone else called it an ""epic film"" and it really is. The actors are all top notch, well known (some became more famous after the film) and are perfect in each role. Yes, the big draw is De Niro and Pacino, but the director, Michael Mann, did a outstanding job not just making it about them. I felt this is especially true when it comes to Val Kilmer's character who has a decent side story of his own. These non-main characters play crucial roles throughout the movie. And while I will give you they may lack back story, that is not important here because of what this film is.The film is crime drama, a cat and mouse movie, not a introspective, melodramatic film. If you want character back story, watch Silver Lining Playbook or something like that. This movie is not about people talking extensively about themselves nor discovering who they are. All the characters know who they are, what their roles are, and are each working towards a goal. This is a story about people on opposite sides each working to get what they want.So back to the movie. It starts with an intricate plan to take down an armored trick which hits a snag and ultimately brings in the homicide division and Al Pacino's character. From here, Mann guides the viewer through the steps Pacino's character takes to track down De Niro's gang, all the while De Niro is dealing with another criminal and planning his next score. Eventually all three of these storyline convalesce during the epic bank robbery. And it is epic. It is so well planned, shot, edited, and choreographed, you feel like you are there. This is the shootout scene of all shootout scenes. Just remember this, it was so well detailed, it actually inspired a real life copycat. Now the real life event is awful and sad. So I am not trying to glorify that. I am merely making reference to it to show how this movie scene actually has a place in real life history.And while the shootout scene is by far the most memorable, its end does not spell the end of the film. While many films taper off after their big, climatic scene, this one keeps going with the same intensity as the beginning. Only, now Pacino's character has the upper hand and De Niro's character is scrambling. The chase culminates at a hotel near the airport. And while there is no big shootout like the bank scene, what does transpire is probably more powerful in terms of the suspense and emotions.Some people may not like the ending. I get that. In fact I did not like it the first couple times. But as time has gone by, it has grown on me. This is not a statement about good vs evil. If you follow the movie, you will see neither main character is good nor bad, they are just human, prone to being both good and bad, able to be selfless and selfish, with their own strengths and weaknesses. And this is why I think the end is so good. So there it is. A movie from start to finish that is just amazing.And for those who say there are plot holes or other stereotypical Debbie Downer critic jargon, I say write something better. You may think there are plot holes (ie Vincent continuing with the score even though he knows Hanna is on to him - but Vincent clearly believes by knowing this he can get ahead of and outsmart Hanna - or Vincent hiring a trigger happy crew-member - actually Vincent doesn't know he is trigger happy, or at least this is never mentioned, and Vincent needs bodies, so obviously he has to take what he can get, not like he can place a help wanted ad for a smart, calm, and loyal criminal). But what you think is a plot hole may really just be part of the character weaknesses I referenced above. People err, and this movie presents people, not super heroes or rare geniuses, or super computers, no just people. They may not be ordinary in terms of what they do and their skillset but they aren't extraordinary enough to make themselves immune to error.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Pacino and DeNiro, together at last","More than simply a cops-and-robbers story, ""Heat"" allows us to understand the characters more than the average crime story. In the first place, Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and thief Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) are good friends before they realize that they have to be enemies. And even when it becomes clear to them that they're on opposite sides of the law, the viewer still can sympathize with both men: we understand that McCauley doesn't want to be a criminal but has no choice, and we understand that Hanna finds law enforcement unpleasant but is trapped in his position. Never going overboard on violence or degenerating into silliness, ""Heat"" is a modern classic and a triumph for all involved.

3 hours full of thrilling action sequences and unforgettable characters,"I got myself a bit late to watch this flick, after hearing so many good things about it and already seeing pretty much all of Michael Mann films that he directed. I still got yet to see his masterpiece.At the beginning I was afraid that perhaps it was going to be overhyped like some films from the 90's. However, this film is an absolute home run in all sorts, it brings the drama of 2 characters with complete different visions and goals colliding to each other in a battle of wits that pays off so well. Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley will be remembered as 2 of the most compelling main characters in action film history, portrayed flawlessly by Pacino and De Niro. On top of that, has some of the best shootout scenes I have ever seen in my life, they felt so real and gritty that almost thought I was watching it happened on the street where I live, also props to the sound design INCREDIBLE.To sum up, ""Heat"" is a an action thriller that can be named as pioneer of many of the films from this same genre coming out nowadays, many try to deliver the same results, some come near but not many succeed. As this is is in my opinion, the best action thriller I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Missing Link Between Melville and Nolan...,"What makes ""Heat"" such a unique crime film is that it is both a gangster and a cop picture, which means that it spans an equal amount of time in both sides of the law and still manages to be original and compelling when they go toe-to-toe.This is a film that is obviously addressed to viewers who are familiar enough with heists, shootouts and police procedural to believe they've seen them all, but Michael Mann made a 180-minute script, as methodic, intelligent and articulate as its characters. And speaking of characters, they're not defined by some narrative status, sure, the criminals are the bad guys and the cop the heroes, but the film mainly shows them as men, with lives, wives, girlfriends, motives and weaknesses, and it takes all the time needed to do it in the most absorbing way. After all, you don't just make a character-driven picture about five or six people in ninety minutes. Now, let's get deeper in the film.Generally, in cop movies like the 'Dirty Harry' films, you have the central protagonist and the 'charismatic' villain. Gangster movies are centered on a specific operation and the gangsters' personalities generally undermine the outcome. ""Heat"" works on these two levels but with one pivotal difference: the cop and the bandit are not portrayed in a way that would influence our empathy. The cop, Vincent Hanna, is a tormented guy who can't handle his third wife and depressed stepdaughter, and Neil McCauley is a solitary criminal who lives by a code. His golden rule is not to depend on something he can't get rid of in less than 30 seconds. Did I mention that Al Pacino and De Niro play these guys?Of course, everyone knows but does it matter? These two actors are my all-time favorite, but the story is so engaging and well-written that I'm sure any other actors would have made it work. ""Heat"" is so good that even the Pacino-De Niro pairing (the first since ""The Godfather Part II"") almost feels like a publicity stunt, as if the film needed that little kick. Well, I'm glad they picked these two actors, and their confrontation in the coffee scene, halfway through the film is a highlight and the best illustration of the film's central theme: men who live for their job and don't know whether they enjoy the action or they're entrapped in the impossibility to live a 'normal' life because of their jobs. They have more in common than they think, and they're both atypical even within their crew.Still, from the way the conversation ends, we know their worlds tightly interact but don't mix. There will be a confrontation sooner or later. The film doesn't sugarcoat the criminal doings, nor does it ridicule the cops and that's important. The character of De Niro outshines the others because of his no-nonsense professionalism, beautifully echoed by the more volatile and dangerous personality of the villain within the villains, played by a convincing Kevin Gage. Now, that Waingro is a creepy criminal who adds his little spice to the film, and whenever he's is on the screen, you know there's trouble coming. He's a disturbing human being but crucial to the film, we know McCauley is on the wrong side of the law, still, he's closer to Hana than to Waingro.""Heat"" is a patient and serious epic-scale crime drama that borrows many elements from a director I admire: Jean-Pierre Melville. There's a Samurai-like quality in McCauley and maybe a little something from Lino Ventura, physically. Here is a tough guy dedicated to his job, and nothing else, which means no girls but if he finds the right one, he might change his mind, for better or worse. ""Heat"" is about many men who end up acting according to their nature, even if it implies a price. And while the main focus is on Pacino and De Niro, it would be unfair to ignore Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight and Natalie Portman who seemed to have gained in maturity ever since ""Leon"". If Melville inspires Mann, he distances himself by giving a more substantial role to the women, the film features many domestic scenes and marital arguments and overall, the women are not just used like props to their men's macho appeal.But I make the film sound like some existential journey while it also a school-case of thrilling action sequences and a bank robbery providing the most spectacular shootout you'll ever see, it is long but you never feel anything happening there gratuitous, from the first moment where they enter the bank, the way they handle the robbery and leave the car, you almost feel sorry for the cops' arrival, not because you root for the criminals, but because the real chaos and loss of lives result from the shootout. And some deaths come as unexpected and shocking but they're here to show how random and cruel life is, after all, the whole chain of events started with a miscast criminal, who was lucky enough to escape from his execution. Karma is also an important character in the film.So we have one of the greatest shootouts of cinema's history, one of the most elaborate criminal operations and equally gripping police investigation, an intelligent drama about men ruling their lives according to what they do the best and we don't necessarily enjoy what we do the best. And we have a director who seems to have embraced the professionalism of his characters to make his personal masterpiece, perhaps the ultimate cop/gangster picture and it's only fitting that the film confronts the actors who played more gangsters and cops than any others.And if ""Heat"" is a inspired by classic Melville film-noir crime flicks, Christopher Nolan admitted to have borrowed elements from ""Heat"" to make ""The Dark Knight"". See, the torch was passed and ""Heat"" is now a milestone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece.,"Five years ago to this date, I was pretty tired from working all day at my job at the cinema.  However, I did manage to stay awake for a almost three hour epic that blew my mind away and saw a different way to look at the cinema.  Before this film, the director Michael Mann, has shown the life of crime in THIEF, terror in THE KEEP, suspense in MANHUNTER, and a historical epic with LAST OF THE MOHICIANS.  But Mann's film were going on a upswing, and with HEAT, Mann reached peak level. This is a film that will go down in history.  Granted, it's not as much as a classic as SCHINDLER'S LIST and GOODFELLAS.  But HEAT will give future generations a example of what the world and life style was like in the 1990's.  Where NASHVILLE is for the 70's, and film by John Hughes is for the 80's, HEAT is for the 90's.While living in central Los Angeles for over three months, the images and scenes from HEAT couldn't leave my mind.  Mann did a fabulous job by shooting the film on the actual streets of L.A.  The film shows the dark and gritty world where we are use to the palm trees and beaches.  Mann's L.A. has some fancy art deco buildings mixed in with decaying buildings.  The streets of Koreatown where all the signs are in Korean, the run down coffee shop that is hidden among giant skyscrapers. If anyone wants to know what L.A. really looks like, this is the perfect film that shows the viewer the real world of L.A. There's the brilliant plot.  Some would say that it's a remake of Mann's eariler work, L.A. TAKEDOWN. But Mann took a simple story and turned it into a epic, and that is exactly what HEAT is, a epic.  Multiple characters, multiple stories, different conflicts and situations and adding a blend of fantastic action into it.  I love the way the characters and story works.  Al Pacino playing Vincent Hannah, the lead detective who is tracking down a group of professional thiefs led by Neil McCauley played by Robert DeNiro.  Unlike any other crime-action film that I have seen, HEAT has both the police officers and criminals being highly intelligent!  No bad doughnut jokes, no bumbling crooks, no ""I'm getting too old for this"" lines, etc.  The thieves use clever plans to stage and work out a robbery, while the officers use clever actions to identify and gather evidence of the criminals. The look by Dante Spinotti is beautiful.  The L.A. skyline with his famous tint shade of blue makes L.A. look like a million stars in the sky. His shots of the empty apartment that McCauley owes with the Pacific Ocean in the background.  The music by Elliot Goldenthal is also fantastic, it has a techno beat that adds to the suspense and excitement that the film is showing.  But it's the score by famous artist Moby that rises above the rest of the film's music.  With Hannah speeding down Interstate 5 while ""New Dawn Fades"" is blasting on the soundtrack, and the magical and beautiful ""God Moving Over the Face of Waters"" being played at the ending credits.  Moby was quoted recently that ""God Moving"" is his favourite song that he has composed, he says that it brings tears to his eyes whenever he hears it. While I listen to it, the song gives me goosebumps and I can not think of the blue Pacific Ocean with the lights from the L.A. coast. And should I mention the acting, which is the best casting in the history of film.  Not only do you have two of the best actors working right now, DeNiro and Pacino, but here is a small list of who else is in this classic:  Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Dennis Haysbert, Hank Azaria, William Fichtner, Henry Rollins, and Natalie Portman.  If you're going to have two fantastic actors in the lead roles, then you need to have a strong supportive cast with them, and that is what Mann does.  But it's Pacino's and DeNiro's performances are the strong stand-outs.  The scene where Hannah and McCauley are sitting down at a table in a coffee shop is of equal rank as Moses parting the Red Sea in TEN COMMANDMENTS.  Or Indiana Jones running away from the giant boulder in RAIDERS. Yes, these are bold statements to say, but if you have ever been to Los Angeles, you would understand.  And I don't mean the tourist city of Anaheim, I mean the real streets of L.A.  COLORS and BOYZ N' THE HOOD do show a pretty realistic L.A., but it's HEAT that shows the real Los Angeles. This is a film that when you first see it, it's good, but the more you watch it, the more you love it.  That is why I an not going to say to just see this film, but you should buy this film!  Believe me, for the last four years, I've been buying this movie on video or DVD for friends of mine. It's become my own personal chain letter, and every time I give them the movie, they come back telling me they loved it.  Please do yourself a favour, and see this film that is the ultimate image of the last decade of the 20th century. ***** (one of the top 10 films of all time!!!!)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Mann's masterwork,"Ever since his breakthrough in television with Miami Vice, which he executive produced, Michael Mann has had an eye for cops, and more specifically their relationship with the criminals they track down. Manhunter, his superb Hannibal Lecter film, showed this in a most admirable fashion, but it is Heat that will be remembered as his crowning achievement, one of the few must-see thrillers of the '90s (or of all time, for that matter).The title, as far as I can tell, comes from a quote in the movie: ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner"". That's the motto Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) observes every day, since every single second matters in his job: robbing banks. He has a great team working with him (Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight), but if it became necessary he would leave all of them behind. Even his affair with a woman named Eady (Amy Brenneman, fresh out of NYPD Blue) is ultimately meaningless, just another expendable element of his life.Paradoxically, that same mantra could sum up the life of Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), an LAPD officer who finds it hard to juggle his ever demanding job and his fragile (third) marriage, which comes complete with a troubled stepdaughter (Natalie Portman). If he could, he would dump everything and commit wholeheartedly to his work. And the opportunity presents itself quite quickly when Neil's latest bank job doesn't end as well as usual and Vincent begins to close in on the previously elusive criminal, beginning a battle of wits like few have ever seen.Being a Mann film, Heat is technically perfect: from the cinematography to the spot-on editing (especially in the central heist sequence) to the locations (L.A. is to the director like New York to Scorsese), the film shows its big budget credentials without hesitation, making for one hell of a visual experience. Light and dark converge into a new shape, emphasizing Mann's point: the ""good"" and the ""bad"" guy aren't that distinguishable anymore.That leads to the other asset Heat can boast, namely Mann's key theme of hunted and hunter being substantially equal: Manhunter suggested this in a quite eerie way, and it returns here in one of the most talked-about scenes in movie history - the coffee shop encounter between Hanna and McCauley. ""I don't know how to do anything else"" remarks the tired cop. ""Neither do I"" comments the crook. ""And I don't much want to either"". ""Neither do I"" McCauley repeats. There's a very thin line between the two sides of the coin, and Mann hasn't just blurred it, he's erased it for good.The coffee shop sequence also highlights Heat's main trump card: Pacino and De Niro. Justly described as the best actors of their generation, Mann's opus gives them the chance to actually meet on screen (which didn't occur, for obvious reasons, in their previous shared credit, The Godfather: Part II) and contrast their trademark personas - De Niro's controlled calm against Pacino's rage-fueled outbursts. They are accompanied by a terrific supporting cast (Kilmer, Voight, Portman, plus briefer roles for Ashley Judd and Simpsons voice actor Hank Azaria), but it's their combined presence that makes Heat the gem it is: the best philosophical crime movie ever, and, alongside The Usual Suspects, the best thriller of the '90s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazing and a complete package,"I rewatch this movie every few years and I still pick up little things every now and then. Well written, and is copied by the current movies Den of Thieves and other back heist movies.

Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.,"'Heat' is probably the most stylish realistic action movies of all times. It has been rare throughout cinematic history to get action film that emphasizes the substance as much as pure style. The film's story is so perfectly balanced that it makes the viewers question their morality. Thanks to the superb performances by two of the greatest actors in film, and their charisma along with their on-screen chemistry, it is easy to sympathize with both of them. You just want to Robert DeNiro's Neil get away as much as you want Al Pacino's Vincent to catch him. And what a fantastic group of actors both leads got on their side. It is simply pleasuring to watch such a rich supporting cast. Everything in 'Heat' is in epic proportions, and so is the length of the movie, but it is so masterfully paced that you almost don't notice how three hours are passing. Magnificent and exciting action sequences alternate with moody and emotional quiet scenes. I have to say that when people talk about 'Heat' they usually forget one of the main stars. And this, of course, is the city of Los Angeles.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Doesn't aged well. The cake is a lie!,"I liked the movie when I was younger. Now I rewatched it with 40 years and I have to admit, this movie isn't that good. To long. Unnecessary family opera nonsense. A lot of the character make no sense at all, for example Natalie Portman or the girlfriend of DeNiro's character. All this opera stuff is such a downer and stretches the movie in a unnecessary long play time. This movie gets to much hype and I have to write that down, to remember my self in ten to twenty years, that I do not watch it again. I am afraid that I will fall into the same trap, like I did now. In my memory I really thought this movie was great, but the cake is a lie!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best Heist Movie in my opinion,"This review includes some soft spoilers about the relationships between the characters and some detailed explanation of the synopsis. It is more focused on my sentimental impressions and I do not think it spoils any fun you will possibly have by watching this film.It's been 4 years since I watched it so i may not remember the vivid details but i clearly remember De Niro's stoic appearence; Sizemore,why can't we see him anymore?; Val Kilmer's 15 minute period of handsomeness in some time 90s and that neo-Nazi Waingro.
It was one of the movies that showed a well-thought action which was fairly new in Hollywood. Actually, action widely meant trade of blows between the protagonist and any henchmen until script demands to continue in that era until there were some attempts to be more detailed like Top Gun with the flight sequences and unfortunately i cannot think of any other example right now. The heist scenes were detailed, organized, and easy to follow to entertain and enjoy them. I like to watch complex and planned things portrayed realistically and any film that manages to do that will be loved and maybe be fanboyed by me.
Wasn't exactly a fan of Al Pacino's overacting but loved the dynamic between him and De Niro. That was the only thing i may criticise but not enough to drop a point.
As i told before loved De Niro's stoic appearance and loved his relationship with the woman. It was beautiful and moving in a film with cold-hearted nature.
Many told it was one of the influences of Dark Knight in its portrayal of heists and in its no-nonsense, never even grinning manner(except Joker). It is a great film to be taken example.
In conclusion, do not be afraid of its running time and watch some skills of this wonderful cast and Michael Mann.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A watchable crime with De Niro and Pacino,"'Heat' is one of these films that tried hard at being an epic. It's pretentiously long running just under THREE HOURS, and is really nothing, and I do mean nothing more than another fine action-crime drama type film that depicts the innerworkings of gangsters with their plans for heists, vs the good guy coppers. It tries hard to produce a stage for De Niro vs Pacino, the evilly motivated but likable scum vs the very flawed but ultimately good guy, and of course they meet before the climactic ending and share and manifest a mutual respect for each other, how of course they are not so different in the end, that old chorus... but although, again, this film makes for a somewhat entertaining viewing, even despite the very lengthy runtime, it's too much a caricature of what it sets out to do with very little intelligence in subtlety, originality or reinvention at all. The women/family of the protagonists are just filler to add more matter to the plot and runtime, and although they highlight aspects of the main lead characters' personalities they are just as ordinary as them, and the entire film. Nothing particularly special here. Good action scenes, a fine crime movie, but nothing more, really.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Classic and beautiful,"Still, after all these years, one of my favorite films. Not just because of the great cast, but the overall vibe and style is superb. When this movie was just released I was blown away by the shootout scene at the bank, but in the years after I found myself enjoying every single scene. One of the few films where the violence serves the storytelling instead of replacing it. Also the dialogues are sometimes poetry without losing credibility. The soundtrack is timeless and sets the right tone, straight from the beginning. An almost dreamy world that portrays a harsh one.

The film of the bests,"Heat is one of the best movies of all time and Michael Mann's best movie to me. Also one of the best crime thrillers with the best bank robbery sequence. This is a film that Al Pacino is in the cast. He is not a supporter actor. His character is also suits him a lot. And there is Robert De Niro too. He is not a supporter actor like Pacino. And this movie is three hours. However, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are not father-in-laws and Heat is not a comedy. Pacino plays a cop and De Niro plays a thief. Pacino says I will catch you and De Niro says, do it if you can. While reading the cast for the first time, I said this is enough, OK. but it continued. One more very good (and to me very liked) actor or actress and one more and one more. This is a crime, action movie, but a deep one, not a shallow work at all. Heat shows almost every character's personal lives, working lives and problems, but even one scene is not uninteresting. Some scenes are so still, but I like it. Stylish. To me Heat is the most stylish Michael Mann movie with The Insider. I like the movies which show us the city or show us the places that Scorsese never does. There are almost two action scenes, one of them is very short, but very exciting. The other is one of the longest and realistic clashes of all times, probably the most loudest action scene, too. You have a headache, this is inevitable and the gun sounds ring inside your brain, your ears ring. However, I don't care about it so much. I love watching Al Pacino while he runs, Mann turns the music down. It must deserve to be put in the action cinema anthology. Almost all the people saw the film talk about the scene which Pacino and De Niro talk face to face, as you know, Heat is the first film that De Niro and Pacino were in the same scene. Honestly, I am not interested in it so much, I mean I don't love Heat so that there is this scene, it is a historical moment in cinema may be, but cut this scene, the film is still excellent. A very powerful and stylish crime epic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Vincent Hanna cocaine user,"When this movie was originally shot there were scenes where Det. Hanna (Pacino) was doing cocaine. When he was outside the club about to go in to meet Tone Loc (Albert's brother) the bouncer outside gives him a vial, on the house, and he takes a snort of if as he goes in. There are several times throughout the movie were it seems like Pacino is over acting. This is because he was supposed to be wired. However, Mann decided the movie was intense enough without this story line and cut all of the scenes out. I spoke with someone who went to a program where Michael Mann spoke about movie making and mentioned this. Also, if you get a hold of some of the early drafts of the screenplay you can read these scenes in them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterful crime drama with outstanding performances,"In Heat we witness the actions and the daily lives of both career criminals and career cops played out over almost three hours of screen time. This is no mere ""good guys Vs. bad guys"" story, but is instead a deep and dramatic epic that dissolves that aforementioned theme and offers to us a rich, complex tale of desperation, dedication, and at times, despair.What lifts Heat above the norm is it's focus on the human story. You are given a set of characters whom one might expect to be two-dimensional in such a setting, but who are, for want of a better term, very much alive and living in the world the film portrays. People who only share six minutes of film time are given a backstory with a brushstroke of brilliance, thanks to a wonderful script and clean, concise directing and editing.That's enough from me.

Along side the superb audio track and the audio effects, which are unparalleled. The acting is good, and the cast fits the characters.

Brilliant crime action movie,"An amazing film. Has stunning battle sequences, culminating in the airport scene which was perhaps not as spectacular as other action sequences but still manages to be brilliant. The bank robbing scene is fantastic and feels very real and you can almost believe it is happening as you watch it.You almost want De Niro to get away with it all and ride off into the sunset at the end, even though he and his criminal buddies have done some terrible things throughout their time including bank robbing and killing whoever got in the way. The 'humanising' relationship that he has really does endear you to the criminal though, despite knowing what he has done and is doing throughout the film.An all time favorite, this movie is one of those movies you can watch again at any time and still be entertained. I only hope that something can get made continuing in the 'universe' that has some of the actors who didn't die in the film.

Pacino acts as bad as his wig looks,"There are some terrific moments in ""Heat"". There is no denying that. But those great moments come at a heavy cost. The first one being the nearly three hour running time. ""Heat"" is way too long. I don't mind long movies but ""Heat"" is a long movie that feels long. That's a big problem. This movie is at least an hour too long. The other problem with ""Heat"", and this is the biggie, is Al Pacino. Pacino crews the scenery like it's nobody's business. It's a ridiculously over-the-top, super hammy performance. Pacino does have a couple of good moments but they are few and far between. For the most part, he just runs around screaming and is totally unconvincing as a streetwise cop. And that wig? Oh brother, I couldn't stop looking at it.

"""One Of The Best Films of the 90's""","This is probably Michael Mann's best film. He wants us to care about these two characters, we feel sorry for these characters. Mann directs us into the minds of these killers. Like ""The Insider"", the film is about not really ordinary people, but when you look at the world they live in, they seem more ordinary than us.""Ali"", ""Colateral"", ""Heat"", ""Manhunter"", the characters that have to go threw these trials and tribulations, their lives are threaten, their families are even threaten. ""Ali"" was not his best film, but you get the same feeling about what he has to go threw to achieve his mission, that's the same feeling you get in ""The Insider"" and ""Heat."" The characters are pushed to their limits, to the point of insanity.THE ACTORSAl Pacino does his best over acting ever. He yells, he screams, he cries, he even throws things, but there are times when he is silent and that is him at his best, when he is silent. Robert De niro really doesn't do anything, but here's the tricky part, he's really the whole film, his character is quiet, has hidden rage, he love his work, he is also in love, but like he said, ""I don't really want to do anything else.""

"Self-indulgent, overlong and overrated. Simply a vehicle for two fine performances","I find ""Heat"" to be a very overrated film and my main point of contention with it is its self-indulgent runtime. It does not need to be three hours long. I've no problem sitting through a three or four film, but not when it is something like Michael Mann's 1995 heist-caper. There are many dragged out scenes incorporated into the film, along with a storyline that tries to be a lot more than it is, inevitably leading one to check their watch and how much is left in the movie. It goes all over the place, and is heavy on the dialogue, but Pacino and De Niro manage to make it work.All that being said, it is a good film, but I just find it to be a long way away from the classic and masterpiece status that it receives. Nor do I find much in it that would make it worth rewatching. Pacino, De Niro and Sizemore and Kilmer provide solid performances, but something tells me that if the two leads were not filled by Pacino and De Niro then ""Heat"" would not be the film that it is remembered and respected for today. After sitting through this I watched Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing"" shortly after it. Now that is a heist movie worth remembering (and is about half the runtime).",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

So much of what we see the crooks do just doesn't happen in real life, and this is a movie that seems to be pushing ""gritty realism,"" as opposed to, say, an Arnold Schwarzenegger flick.

Truly a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of all time,"HEAT is nothing short of spectacular.This was the first movie i purchased on DVD way back in '96' and I'll explain why, not only are the action sequences shot in cinematic brilliance, the plot really makes you care about each character and lets not forget standout performances from Robert De Niro, Al Pacino (the first movie in which both actors are in the same scene) Val Kilmer (possibly his best role since Top Gun) Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman the list goes on, the acting is nothing short of brilliant I cant stress this enough – the casting crew knew what they were doing here.The basis of the story is an oldie but a goodie – Cops and robbers. Vincent Hanna (played by Pacino) leads a squad of robbery/homicide detectives on the trail of a new ""crew"" of criminals lead by Neil McCauley (De Niro). This begins a game of Cat and Mouse which sees the tables turned on each of them throughout the movie, add to this the personal issues they have makes these two characters relatable and this just ads to them becoming more interesting. To say anymore would give the film away.The action, unlike most films isn't over done, even though they are awesome to watch, this gives the film a better sense of realism and inturn makes the plot more believable. A special mention here is the shoot out scene – you'll know it when you see it. Add to this the best sounding film I've heard everything just makes it real, the echo of the shootouts, the way glass cracks and wood splinters all are fantastic. The only other film that would compare is 'Saving Private Ryan'.At just over 3hrs long this epic crime drama has to glued, I must stress if you are going to watch this film make sure you have a decent surround sound system and a good widescreen and do it the justice it deserves.Novak",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A little warmth and a whole lotta cold,"Heat is not above criticism. I've put off reviewing this film for a long time as I know any negative comments will provoke an angry response from people who are blind to any faults. It's a good film, but it is far from perfect.Pacino and DeNiro are cop and crook who go head-to-head over a major heist. They have many similarities, and could otherwise have been friends, only they are on opposite sides of the same coin - both cerebral, cunning, and crafty. Attempts at juxtaposing their lives come across as a little indulgent, but it's a crime epic, with lots of characters and cameos, so the running time has to be filled-up with something.I just wish the dialogue wasn't so clipped and the editing so inconsistent. The movie has a naturalistic feel, meaning a lot words sound mumbled, and characters seems to come and go with no orientation given to the viewer. I am not saying that Michael Mann should pander to all audiences and dumb down the material, but a middle ground could have been found.Mann shoots LA with wide-open empty spaces and stays high above the city for the most part, giving it a cold, alienating feel. Dante Spinotti's photography is raw and filter-free, and all locations are real with not a single soundstage used (although there are a couple of obvious green screen shots). It gives you a view of LA not typically seen in movies.For a 170-minute it doesn't pay-off much considering the talent. There is a great 125-minute movie desperate to get out of Heat.

The drama is good, so is the acting, but some relationships should have had more depth to them to make them more impactful, such as the one between the step-father and step-daughter for example.

One of the best films ever!,"Soft music and gentle lighting give this film a vivid yet placid setting. Great cast, great plot and great writing make this one of the best films ever, in my opinion. Then you have the action scenes which are all awesome. The writing and the acting are both simple and realistic which help viewers get settled and connected to the characters. And then there is the occasional outburst from Al Pacino the grabs your attention and adds a bit of humor. I want to see a sequel with the remaining actors going at it again, and I worded it that way so I don't spoil the plot. Bravo!The only reason I didn't give this film a 10 are the love scenes between De Niro and Amy Brenneman, they are laughably terrible.

"The fastest and possibly one of, if not the, best three hours of your movie-going life.","Acted to perfection, rich in character traits, taut direction,... these words simply never can do this film justice.What began as a simple tale of cops and robbers suddenly develops into insightful and poignant characterization, the boundaries between good and evil, and facing up to one's demons. Yes, not only did this film deliver by the thrills, it gave us, the audience, an in depth look at the lives of two equal men who work on opposite sides of the law, and how their routines affect them, in the city of Los Angeles.First off, I would like to say that the acting in this movie is extremely well. You really emphasize with the characters and, for some, fell a sort of sympathy towards them. Kudos to Pacino and De Niro for playing the dedicated detective and disciplined thief, respectively. Both these men are exceptionally excellent actors and in this film, their acting is done to perfection. Without them, the film is nothing. Notable performances in the film: Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, and of course the lovely Ashley Judd.For the cinematography, I must say that Dante Spinotti has done a tremendous job with the scenery. The city of LA has never looked this wide or gritty until this film. The nighttime scenes and the helicopter flybys of the film are stunning to watch, as it majestically captures a sparkling portrait of Los Angeles set against an urban world.To accompany the cinematography, the music by Elliot Goldenthal is unforgettable. Especially the arrangements with the Kronos Quartet. It really adds to the entire atmosphere and theme of the movie.Kudos to director/writer Michael Mann. The direction is taut (as mentioned earlier) and whip-smart, the story fantastically evolving and original, and the screenplay is well-written. The action scenes were extremely well-handled, and is kinetic and heart pounding, and best - and most important of all, realistic. This is what makes it stand out from the rest of the other crime films - they tend to put in moments of Deux Ex Machina, such as the police knowing every trick up the crooks' sleeve - but not this film. It's good, because Mann is dedicated to show both sides of the cop vs. criminal story, and he succeeds with masterful results. From this film and Collateral, I can tell he is a skilled and dedicated filmmaker when it comes to crime thrillers. By the time the film ends you won't even know three hours have passed.In short, this film is nothing short of a masterpiece. It will stand the test of time for many, many years to come. If you manage to see it in a store, or while channel-surfing, do yourselves a favor and watch it. If you consider a fan of Pacino and/or De Niro, watch it. If you are crime movie fan, action fan or even a movie buff, you MUST watch it. I assure you readers, you will never get disappointed by this film.9.994/10Delton.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"One of the best, if not the best, 'Cops and Robbers' Sagas ever made.","Heat is far more than just a standard 'cops and robbers' drama. For a movie like that, see Michael Bay's movies. Lifeless, full of one-liners, standard. From the mold. And that's everything Michael Mann doesn't do.Unbelievably shot in L.A (using not one sound stage), Heat shows exactly what life in L.A looks like. The tinted blue, the dark, but beautiful nights of L.A. Michael Mann created one of the most perfect visual masterpieces I've ever seen.However, it isn't only the incredible look to the film, but the story and the all-star cast. There are no slackers here, not when you unite two of the best actors in cinematic history. Al Pacino is over-the-top, incredible, and in one of his finest roles to date. Robert de Niro is at his finest, playing the cool, quiet and lonely Neil. Both create some incredible scenes, both eerie and powerful. Even Val Kilmer doesn't look out of place here, and holds his own with the two screen giants.The script was perfect, layered with thousands of intricate details. At almost three hours, the movie is lengthy, however I would have wanted more. The amount of character development in this film is unprecedented, with Mann carefully showing the viewer exactly how the person would be in real life.Heat is by far leagues ahead of any other cops vs. robbers movie made to date. Why? Because it doesn't get stuck in that mind frame. Instead, Mann sculpts the stories of many different people's lives, all unified by their drive to get what they want. Mann did a stand-out job, and this film definitely deserves a solid 11/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Classic. The Best 'Cops & Robbers' Film of the 1990's. Very Good, But Not Great.","I'll admit - I had to crunch the numbers several times to see why this movie only rated a 6 on my scale. IMDB composite rating is currently at 8.3. Everyone remembers 'Heat' as a 'great' film. The truth is, when watching it 28 years later, it's only a 'good' film.In 1995, film making was still being influenced by epics like 'Scarface' (1983). Today, 'Scarface' seems a little long, and we could all do without so many 1980's music interlude scenes. So, for '1990's Film', this is a great crime drama. The cinematography was top-notch. The casting was amazing on all levels. But, this was not among the best performances of Pacino, or DeNiro, or Kilmer. It was a long movie with a great cast and a great shoot-out scene. Every cliche ever written into a crime drama is in this film, and all of them are over-dramatised.So, if you have 3 hours, take the good with the bad and watch 'Heat' next time you need a crime drama for ' '90's Movie Night'.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"Ironically, it's excesses are its greatest strength","You could trim a substantial amount of fat off of ""Heat"" and make it a much tighter and more focused film. But would that make it better? I don't think that it would.When we delve off into the life of a third-tier side character on several occasions, it's easy to ask why. And several sidetracks into the domestic affairs of other characters could have been trimmed or eliminated all together to reduce bloat and increase the pacing.But had Michael Mann done this, what we would have gotten would have been a well acted, skillfully made, but ultimately by the book and generic crime drama. But the focus on character, even at the expense of kineticism, is what makes ""Heat"" stand above the genre and stand the test of time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Pretentious, boring, never ending commonplace of a movie with bad acting from the protagonists","I saw this film about 10 years ago, when it first open in the UK. I was not impressed. Few days ago I decided to see it again - it took me 4 days to finish it! It is so dull and unnecessary long. I was shocked to read how many people here consider it to be ""the best ever film""! Are they nuts?! I think they have no idea what a really great film is about. Someone even thinks it to be ""De Niro's best performance"". I think it's one of both De Niro's and Pacino's worst performances. Pacino especially is over the top, whereas De Niro is doing his routine, nothing more. The film is full of clichés, constant close-ups like in some TV soap opera, the music is the cliché Hollywood-epic-computer-generated-nonstop noise. All in all - I wasted 6 hours of my life.

A Los Angeles Crime Saga - Of epic proportions,"Heat is an example of what can be done with a very worn genre, namely ""cops and robbers"", when at the hands of a master director, in this case Michael Mann.Mann has taken what is ultimately a simple premise, a bank robbery, and made it into a saga.Heat is the story of a tight crew of well trained crooks who execute highly organized scores, led by Neil McCauley (DeNiro). When one of these robberies does not go entirely to plan the LAPD Robbery-Homicide squad begins to investigate, headed by Vincent Hanna (Pacino). Neil's crew initially unaware of the LAPD surveillance plans two more scores, one of which is an incredibly daring daylight bank robbery.The action scenes are comparatively few when compared to other movies of this genre however when there is action it is executed as realistically as possible. Definitely no ""John Woo"" style action here. The gun fight in the street is one of the most realistic depictions of a gun battle ever portrayed on the big screen.The character development is fairly in-depth for the number of characters in the film. By far one of my favorite scenes is the coffee shop when our two main characters meet face to face for the first time and compare their lives, which are not all that dissimilar. I did not fully understand the ""Waingro serial killer"" sub plot, perhaps it was to give a little background as to the type of person Waingro was. We also get to see that the characters in the film are ""real"" by showing us their life ""behind the scenes"" so to speak - not just when they are working.Mann must have done a great deal of research into this movie. Many aspects of the film are very realistic. The characters of both police and the criminals, the police procedures, the use of informants, the execution of the action scenes, the weapons used - all very accurate (or as accurate as it gets in Hollywood).The soundtrack for Heat by itself is brilliant. The soundtrack is collaboration of several artists all of which contribute towards a very powerful score. When combined with the movie it enhances the mood incredibly. Tracks of note would be the opening titles ""Heat performed by the Kronos Quartet, Moby's closing titles ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" and his rendition of ""New Dawn Fades.""The cinematography is also outstanding. Mann did not use any soundstages - the whole film was filmed on location in and around LA. This is apparent with some of the moody lighting created in the dawn and dusk scenes with the smooth, deep blue lighting.All in all Heat is a very powerful film that delivers on all levels. Action, love, betrayal, romance, tragedy, suspense - Heat has it all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

pretty tight for a 3 hour crime epic,"Heat comes on TV, and you have see what scene is on. More than likely you'll get something really worth watching, sometimes for five minutes, other times for the whole running time. I was too young to see Heat in the theater, but soon after TV made it available. It's a film that takes to the professionals on both sides, and we have a great deal of empathy for both of them, for the tired but spot-on detective (Al Pacino) and, yes, even the ruthless criminal (Robert De Niro). Michael Mann's script is key, but it's a sense of the story, of the mood that all of those locations in Los Angeles brings, the streets, the little crevices, the diners, the architecture, the concrete and steel.There's also philosophy to Heat. It may not be a deep essay like Godard, but who'd want, or perhaps expect, it to a big Hollywood production? It's simple: Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner. This is the stance the super tough and least vulnerable criminal mastermind in 90s American cinema Neil makes, and its potent enough to match up against the hard-line stance that a detective has with his prey. The plot moves at a good pace and the wheels keep going along and Mann has these powerhouse sequences here and there (most notably the big bank robbery that turns into a battle with machine guns on the street outside), and of course the cast is large and amazing throughout (a who's who from Val Kilmer to Natalie Portman to Danny Trejo to Wes Studi).But what makes Heat endurable for such a long length aren't the actors but its substance. Mann's film is about something, about the conventions of cops and robbers, and that's what makes it work as well as it does. Sure, seeing a match-up of titans in that diner scene is enough to recommend it, but a combination of factors, of cast and direction and script, of danger and action and quiet moments, make it a kind of modern classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Nothing special,"I thought the film to be reasonably entertaining but I'm afraid I dont understand why the two leading protagonists are drenched with acting accolades all the time. De-Niro is well cast in this one but I thought Pacino was embarrassingly bad, acting way over the top, look at me here I'm tough .I've commented before on this, a good actor to me is one who is natural and not trying to show off in a role where it is not needed .Compare Gene Hackman in The french connection to Al pacino in Heat.I really believed Hackman was a tough hard boiled cop on the edge but the latter as some kind of over the top batman character from the 60's series.For a good heist movie watch  Walter Matthau in Charley Varrick a truly great actor in a film that was unusual for him and pulled it off with aplomb.jim",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Would've given it 7.5 if I could,"Quite a good crime film following roberry crew leader De Niro and leader detective Pacino in their dance around a few heists.Initially I was concerned that the film might be a little slow and complex as the first half is set over many days and introduced many seemingly inane tangents of the plot, however the second half of the film is set over a period of several hours, remind me somewhat of Die Hard, with great action scenes and events that tie all those plotlines together into a cohesive, emotional and quite suspenseful action packed ending.Worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best at several things,"This is undoubtedly Mann's finest, and I'm not sure even he, himself, can really top it. If you ever wanted to know about crime in L.A., this is what to watch. The plot is excellent, and consistently told well, so that the audience never loses track, and in spite of great complexity, it manages to not be difficult to follow. Every single performance in this is spot-on and effective, from the two acting veteran leads through the young and always talented Portman, and to the smallest, briefest role. The characters are all fleshed out, credible and interesting. This doesn't take sides. It gives insight into the private lives of people on both sides of the law, those who uphold it as well as those who break it. Not everyone is in a positive light, but no one is unfairly treated by the presentation of that type of person, and the word ""one-note"" is simply not part of Michael's vocabulary when he penned the marvelous script. The emotion is genuine, and this is immensely involving and engaging from first to last frame. This is long, however, which hopefully will not deter any possible viewers. It's around three hours long, give or take twenty minutes, depending on the version. There is a little humor, at least worth chuckles, and it isn't trying to leave you in stitches. The dialog is sharp and impeccably delivered, often saying a lot with few lines. This has concise social commentary. It also has magnificent suspense and tension. Production values leave nothing to be desired. The action is among the most unforgettable committed to celluloid since its invention. Realism is sky-high, with next to no Hollywood(in fact, in all aspects of this), and I kid you not, when those guns go off, you can *feel* it. Nothing fancy, no stylization. Instead, every shot comes off as having an impact, as being dangerous. People actually reload, accuracy is an issue and the firearms can't magically handle whatever situation they're used in. Pretty much any moment of this that has bullets flying is epic. The ending is amazing, if I do argue with the very last bit. Hey, MM and finales... anyway, it doesn't bother me enough to lower my rating any. There is a lot of strong language, and some bloody violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of drama who can stomach it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Director Michael Mann stages each scene with meticulous and razor sharp edge, and the second act shoot out is among one of the greatest action scenes in film history.

A great surprise,"I watched both Insider and Collateral, and I didn't like any of them very much. Mann's directing style was too hard to get for me. So I was not expecting too much in the way of directing in this movie, but was I blown away! The direction is great, none of the shaky hand cam stuff from Insider and not too much L.A. shots like Collateral.Then it's not Tom Cruise neither. It's Pacino and De Niro, and they do what they do best. The hardened criminal and the worn-out obsessive cop. They even get some screen time together, although little. But this is good, since having them together all the time would... I don't know, ruin the effect.The supporting cast is great. Pacino's wife and De Niro's girlfriend do a great job showing how normal women would react to their dysfunctional men. The smaller roles are great too. Fichtner is a bad guy, Tom Sizemore and Val Kilmer criminals, and Ted Levine does a really horrible ogre-like psycho.The score is good, sometimes almost hypnotic and trance-like.* Spoiler Warning * The movie also contains the best and most realistic shootout in movie history.*/Spoiler* A must see for, well, everyone.

"Heat, the perfect example of a crime movie","This movie is not a standard thieves versus cops movie, it really lets you get to know the characters of both sides and see their emotional lives. You can pick your side, so you can concider the end of the movie as a good or a bad ending. On which side are you on? The film is directed by Michael Mann, known for his work on the hit series 'Miami Vice'. 'Heat' has a great cast with some of Hollywood finest actors. The two main characters are played by the best gangster actors you can get; Robert De Niro ('Goodfellas') and Al Pacino ('Scarface'). The story line concerns both sides. You have the story of the life of Vincent Hanna, played by Al Pacino, who has a relationship crisis with his wife because he is always busy chasing criminals. And also his step daughter is a mess, because her real father never shows up. Then you have the story of master criminal Neil McCauley, played by Robert De Niro, who never had a wife because he wants to be independent so he can escape wherever he wants without having to worry about someone. The two admire each one other. The plot begins when Neil and his crew rob a transport wagon and steal the obligations of rich guy Roger van Zant. The robbery goes wrong when a gang member called Waingro shoots one of the drivers, so they have to kill anyone around to leave no witnesses. Waingro then gets kicked out of the crew. Still part of the crew are Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore). Officer Vincent Hanna an his team of LAPD agents are put on the case. They find out that they are dealing with real professionals. They track them down to find out what their next score is going to be. But McCauley's crew are on to them and play games with the LAPD. The next big score will be a bank robbery in central Los Angeles. Everything seems to be going smooth, until the LAPD gets the tip by Van Zant who got it from Waingro who is working for van Zant as a snitch. The police arrives just in time and the whole area gets turned into a shooting gallery. A lot of people die in the proses, but McCauley and Chris manage to escape. Now Neil has to escape before Vincent Hanna finds him. Which is difficult for him because he finally found a woman he loves. Neil has an escape plan but Vincent is right after him. The final scene is a battle between Neil and Vincent, eventually one of the two dies If you like gangster movies, then I would recommend Heat. Not only does it have the best gangster actors of all time, It also has a thrilling plot with great action.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Heat earns its way onto top 25 lists for heist films and 90s action, but its faults keep it low in the rankings.","Heat gets so many things right. The stellar cast continues to surprise me with all the different names and faces I recognize when I watch it. The action is exceptional, especially considering this film is over 25 years old. The shoot-out in the middle of the movie is riveting, raw, and powerfully hard-hitting. The story made it impossible to guess exactly how it would turn out - was the cop going to get his man, or was the mastermind thief going to get away? Heat belongs on best heist and action movie lists but not nearly as high as many lists rank it. Heat carries some annoying faults. The ending of the film is abrupt and unsatisfying. The runtime is at least 45 minutes too long. The biggest frustration was Al Pacino's performance. He was so over the top that his character felt like he was in the wrong movie. Every other action delivered genuine and serious performances while Pacino was screaming about women's butts. What?

Near-close to perfect,"Heat is a intriguing adrenaline rush crime drama with a history making shoot out between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. It's a classic cops and robbers story at its core but the everyday lives of all the characters is the real heart of the story. As cops & robbers movies go this is pretty close to perfect. I didn't think so at first as the first 30-45 minutes moved at such a frantic pace between a large number of scenes of a bunch of guys muttering plans and threats and moved so quickly that by the time I had caught up to the current conversation it was on to the next one. But after that first act, I managed to put together what was going on and what everyone was doing and after that, it was smooth sailing. The rest of the movie turned into a pulse-pounding thriller that not only had an excellent cat-and-mouse dynamic but also explored interesting concepts like the similar effect being a dedicated criminal and cop have on their personal lives and the heavy sacrifices they must take in order to do what they do best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"249th, what the f*!k.","I can not believe this film is ranked higher in the imdb top 250 films. This film should at least be in the top 5.  How can films like ""fight club"", ""singing in the rain"", ""some like it hot"" be ranked higher than Heat, not to mention a host of others.  It's a total travisty, and it also shows that people wouldn't know a classic film if jumped up a pointed a M-16 in thier face.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A chance lost.,"With this movie, I think that the viewer would be expecting something of an epic, but ""Heat"" never really got going in my mind. There was a chance to make a blockbuster movie, but somehow it ended up as a chance lost. The storyline is good, but the way it is acting out just seems to be dull, dragging itself through thick treacle. Many times throughout this film, it was hard to hear what was being said, kind of mumbling, whispering, muttering, and even with the sound turned right up, it did not improve that much. There is too much of this low light, mumbling routine all through the film. Of course, there is the big gun battle scene after one of the robberies, and probably this is what makes the viewers remember ""Heat"" for, but even that could have been done better. It ended up so very ""Hollywood"" with its never ending magazines, bullets that can only pierce the outer metal of a car door, not go right through the vehicle, civilians wandering around nonchalantly whilst bullets fly everywhere. However, this was the most ""Action"" part of the movie, and being nearly 3 hours long, the rest of the film just limped along. Could have been so much better, a chance lost.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
outstanding,This movie has the best shootout scene ever made. Let's argue. They were the criminals that you wanted to win. i freaking love this movie. I became a serious Val Kilmer fan after seeing this one.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Overrated,A word I rarely use because some people use it too loosely.In this case the reviews and lore fell short in my opinion.40 minutes could have been easily removed to create good pacing.Pacino? What were you thinking? Some of the random out burst scenes were ridiculous and didn't make any sense. If his character is suppose to give up easily and say random things in a odd fashion. That's a bit much.Robert did a fantastic job with what he had.I guess this isn't the type you can rewatch and enjoy at 2 hours and 50 minutes.The new 4k release the director added some weird Instagram filter on the whole film washing out all the colors.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Waste of time,"I made the mistake of rewatching ""Heat"" again today for the first time in decades as I saw it available to stream; however, I once again did not enjoy this film. I thought maybe my younger self did not give it enough of a chance, but no, most of my opinions remain unchanged across time -- I did not like this film. It is too long, too slow, too stilted, too dull. I have virtually nothing positive to say about it, which is surprising considering the good cast and crew. I will give it a 4/10 and I don't recommend it. Although it's not terrible, I do feel like I just wasted my time, and I don't want to ever watch it again.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Unquestionably Brilliant, But Shortchanges Female Characters","It's a long time since I last saw this, but there's no doubt its classic status is well assured long since. I loved it at the time, with a caveat - that there was something about the way the female characters were presented that unsettled me. With learning accrued in the intervening years, I can flesh that out a little - the females all speak truth to or about me, or reveal it to them. The truth is almost always about the men themselves. All of this means that the women end up paying the cost and bearing the brunt of the men's actions, men whose response to the truth is to ignore, to double-down, kick back at it. That may be realistic - this is a very (toxic) male trait, and it leaves us with the question of if Mann does this consciously or if it's his own fault, too. Viewed in the context of his other work, it's hard to feel it's not a fault - most female characters in Mann's films have little or no agency for themselves, existing only for or in relation to men. For a filmmaker of such insight and brilliance, it's a striking fault. Otherwise, Heat is brilliant - just think, though, how shining that brilliance could be if the women were allowed agency.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
GIVE ME ALL YOU GOT!,"8.2/10 is criminally low for a criminally perfect criminal film. Mann's 1995 creation ticks all the boxes to claim 'masterpiece' status.

A Powerhouse Crime Saga,"""Heat"" is one of the best crime films to come out of this decade. Michael Mann has crafted the perfect companion-piece to his haunting 1981 drama, ""Thief"". Mann's technical trademarks are present: the haunting, ambient score, and the industrial set design and exteriors add to the film's moody resonance and give Los Angeles a whole other dimension. The acting, writing, and direction is the key, however, and Mann has crafted insightful dialogue, and gotten stellar performances from all involved. It helps that the hunter and his prey and played by two heavy-hitting forces of nature -- Pacino and De Niro. They have a classic moment in a coffeehouse (the first on-screen pairing of the two method men), during which the viewer is left mesmerized as the two men unload the weight of the would in breathless, crisp dialogue. The shoot-out is one of the most cataclysmic, fantastically-choreographed scenes of action in one film; it's the kind of ballistic ballet that only John Woo seems capable of. All the negative reviews of the film gripe (understandably) about the length (or overlength). I didn't care much about the length; this an intensely dramatic crime saga with a depth that is hardly seen in American films of this genre. In short, this is one not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Mann's Magnum Opus - a landmark in the Cops & Robbers genre.,"💰""I do what I do best: take scores. You do what you do best: try to stop guys like me"".The Roman Empire; Heat; the biggest animal you could probably take in a flight. These topics take-up an unhealthy amount of bandwidth in any man's brain. And it's clear to see why.1995's Heat is the unrivalled king of the cops and robbers movie. Two of Hollywood's heavyweights, Pacino and DeNiro, faceoff against one another; one a veteran detective, the other a ruthless career criminal.Both men are hardened, calculating and professional adversaries; the perfect pair of antagonists. DeNiro's character has a code: ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" But his philosophy is soon challenged.Heavy on style but still brimming with substance, Michael Mann's long lenses and use of widescreen makes this movie feels like a gritty documentary. But it is the gunfire and authenticity of the heists which make this film so unique. No CGI in sight. No stunt doubles. No Hollywood nonsense. Just blank rounds, real training, and fierce intensity. You will hesitate to call them actors, they feel like operators.One shootout scene reigns supreme over the abundance of mediocre gun fights in cinema. Mann had a member of the British SAS teach the actors live fire drills and CQB. When you see it, it is a true test of your home speaker system: no sparking bullets, stock sound effects or exploding vehicles, just deafening gunfire and raw kinetic energy. Val Kilmer's weapon drills in one scene are so slick that military drill instructors mention it in training: ""If a f***ing actor can reload that fast, I expect you to do the same!""Mann made something special here. This is timeless crime noir, which feels as powerful now as when it was first released 25+ years ago. I still find myself holding my breath during the stakeout scenes. Without this movie, we would never have had the Dark Knight's bank heist or the epic shootouts of Den of Thieves, The Town and Sicario. GTA V also has everything to thank for this movie -- want to see who Michael was based on?This film kicks so much ass. It sets the bar of what to expect from cinematic gunfights. Beware of cheap imitations; accept no substitutes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pacino and DeNiro heating it up on screen,"This movie has got it going on, plain and simple.  Not only does the cast rock, but the direction, action scenes, and story are all equally worth of praise.'Heat' is a crime movie where guys on either side of the law are willing to take things as far as they can go.  Robert DeNiro plays Neil McCauley, the leader of a tight unit of friends that plan and execute risky robberies that pay off well.  Al Pacino is the detective Vincent Hanna who's on the case and hot on McCauley's trail.  Michael Mann who directs brings the viewer into each of these lead characters' lives and we develop an understanding of what they are--which turns out to be what they're after.The first time I saw any of this film was when my father was watching it and called me into the room just when that explosive gun battle poured into the streets of L.A..  I have seen tons of shoot-em up scenes in movies before, but nothing ever has compared to the 10 minute or so downtown shoot-out between DeNiro's crew and the police.  The rounds fired in this scene is incredible--the sound is deafening and bullets are ripping through cars and shattering glass everywhere.  Mann does a great job here by taking the camera and running with it along side some of the characters as the run through the urban terrain shooting and taking cover.  And the buildup to all of this is worth mentioning too.  DeNiro and company smoothly get in and out of a bank with bundles of money stuffed in duffel bags draped over their shoulders.  Everything looks good as they leave and approach the getaway car until the last one in, Val Kilmer, gets spooked when he sees a cop across the street and starts spraying rounds from his automatic rifle.  And as I described, things continue to get hot.The supporting cast in this movie is awesome.  Val Kilmer is DeNiro's main guy and by the end of the film you feel his pain and sympathize with the fact that he gets away but is forced to turn his back on his wife.  Tom Seizmore plays another bad guy and he is just a cool cat throughout the movie.  Even Henry Rollins is in here, and he definitely gets away with his role...good job.  I'll mention one other, and that's Jon Voight.  He is Nate, the guy behind the scenes who makes it all happen for McCauley's crew, the one who things go through before they get to McCauley.  Also, when you're watching, you should know that the scene where Pacino and DeNiro are sitting across the table from each other in the diner is the only time the two shared the camera together.I really love this movie.  Every time I see it though I wish DeNiro would never turn that car around and just proceed to the airport with his girl. But that really can't happen now, can it?  But the end moment between Pacino and DeNiro is still one of my favorites, and the soundtrack just amplifies the emotion I get from watching it.  I can keep going on with this sort of stuff, but I'm not.  This is just a must-see for anyone who enjoys watching these actors at work, or anyone into unbelievable gun battles that tear apart a city block!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Clash of the Titans,"Heat certainly sports an amazing cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Dennis Haylsbert, Amy Brenneman, Ted Levine, and Tom Sizemore. Top drawer all the way, and directed by Michael Mann, who knows something about action movies.Despite this, Heat managed, for this viewer, to be about forty minutes too long (the version I saw was nearly three hours) and slow.The story concerns two dedicated men: Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and Neil McCauley (De Niro). One is on the side of the law, and the other is a master criminal who has pulled off some amazing heists.Neil and his team target banks, vaults, and armored cars. When there's a problem on one of the jobs, the police finally have a clue and the robbers begin to feel the heat. Vincent has to begrudgingly admire McCauley for his cleverness.The two men are similar: both are dedicated to their work at the expense of their private lives. Vincent is married to Justine (Venora), who has a troubled daughter (Portman). The marriage is on the rocks; Neil doesn't want to share his work with Justine, and is away on the job all the time and noncommunicative at home.Neil has a philosophy, which is, 'Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner.'Neil disapproves of one of his associates, Shiherlis (Kilmer) because he is married with a child. His wife (Judd) is unhappy because Shiherlis is a compulsive gambler and doesn't act like an adult.But when Neil meets Eady (Brennemen), he falls in love. The men plan one last big score, though the heat is becoming more intense.I'm sure I will be criticized, but I didn't care for this film. At a length rivaling Gone with the Wind, the story could have been told in two hours. As it is, it's slow going.There are several gun fights, with bullets the size of rocks going through windshields, car bodies, and people on the streets of Los Angeles. After a while it became mind-numbing.In New York City and I assume most big cities, the police can draw their guns, identify themselves as officers, and pursue the suspects; I guess in Los Angeles it doesn't matter how many pedestrians and cars are around.The acting is excellent -- it's hard to miss with a cast like this -- and it is exciting to see Pacino and DeNiro together. I just wish it had been in something else.There are many positive reviews on this site. I'm curious as to how many of the positive reviews came from men. This is a man's movie all the way, from the behavior of the various women to the automatic weapons and explosions.If the film had been shorter and tighter, I might have liked it better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

While Pacino screams, Kilmer and Voight, both sporting long blonde locks, mumble their lines in such low tones that they are barely comprehensible, causing the viewer to constantly adjust the volume.

"This is total snorefest, overrated and overhyped movie","I watched this movie because of it's ""cult"" status. Never managed to went through it due to it's length when aired on TV with commercials.

I was trying to figure out anything for 1.5 hour but still I wasn't able to do so despite some obvious points in the plot. Filming is also very very bad - you can easily see bluebox pasting of characters. Colours are washed and scenes are set in very uniteresting way. There is nothing exiting in the movie, boring to the ground.Acting is another story... Al Pacino - usual ""show stealer"" do here what is worst with his acting.

Excellent,"One of the best crime saga movies ever made in film history. I mean even the director himself stated that it took him and his crew some time to plan the movie out and study the concept of criminals to start filming the picture. Michael Mann himself wrote this picture, he also hand picked the two main stars Pacino and Deniro. Two well known actors for their ability to study their characters and bring them to life on a screen. There are also lots of crime films as in scarface, the godfather trilogy, goodfellas, carlito's way, casino, blow, dead presidents, etc..... I can go forever. My point is that Heat is like the king to these movies....now wait...I know scarface and goodfellas and godfather is more classic but heat compares it's crimes to real life situations that happen now in days back then mobs and mafias are already old. What movie have you seen block a whole main street and start a bank robbery in public with full automatic weapons M-16s.

Heat: A Masterpiece of Crime Cinema with the Greatest Movie Gunfight Ever,"Michael Mann's ""Heat"" is a cinematic masterpiece that stands the test of time as a riveting and complex exploration of crime, obsession, and the blurred lines between law and lawlessness. Anchored by powerhouse performances from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, this epic crime thriller is a tour de force of storytelling, character development, and suspense that leaves a lasting impact on viewers.At the heart of ""Heat"" is the electrifying cat-and-mouse game between master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro) and seasoned LAPD detective Vincent Hanna (Pacino), two men on opposite sides of the law whose lives become inexorably intertwined in a deadly dance of pursuit and evasion. Their intense and nuanced performances bring depth and humanity to their characters, elevating the film to a level of emotional complexity rarely seen in the crime genre.One of the standout elements of ""Heat"" is its meticulous attention to detail and authenticity in depicting the world of crime and law enforcement. Michael Mann's direction immerses viewers in the gritty underworld of Los Angeles, capturing the pulsating energy of the city and the high-stakes tension of the criminal underworld with unparalleled realism.However, what truly sets ""Heat"" apart is its legendary centerpiece: the bank heist and subsequent gunfight on the streets of downtown Los Angeles. Widely regarded as one of the greatest movie gunfights ever filmed, this intense and visceral sequence is a masterclass in tension, choreography, and sound design. The precision and realism of the gun battle, coupled with the emotional stakes for the characters involved, make it a standout moment in cinematic history that continues to leave audiences breathless.Beyond the adrenaline-pumping action, ""Heat"" delves deep into the psyches of its characters, exploring themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the relentless pursuit of one's desires. The film's rich tapestry of supporting characters, including Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and Ashley Judd, further enriches the narrative and adds layers of complexity to the story.In conclusion, ""Heat"" is a 10/10 triumph of crime cinema that excels on every level: from its powerhouse performances and expert direction to its gripping narrative and unforgettable set pieces. Michael Mann's magnum opus is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences with its depth, intensity, and emotional resonance. With the greatest movie gunfight ever filmed as its crowning achievement, ""Heat"" cements its status as a must-see masterpiece that will leave a lasting impression on all who experience its cinematic brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Heart Stopper,"I'm not kidding. I'm 23 and every time the bank scene comes i still feel my pulse riding. I wouldn't recommend it to people with heart problems. First of all, who ever doesn't think this is a masterpiece knows very little about films. I'm sorry but it's true, I read some of these Hate-It reviews and man i gotta to say, to put this movie down is a crime to art in general. wait wait. A genius story, complex characters, great score, all star cast, a bank robbery scene to put an end to all bank robbery scenes, and Michael Mann directing it all. I probably missed a lot more but the point is if you're into the crime genre and haven't seen this film you're not into the crime genre. If you are not into the genre then you will be only never to be this satisfied again.

A clash of two great characters...,When you take two great actors such as De Niro and Pacino your bound to get a great movie like Heat. This movie keeps your heart beat up till the very end. The acting is superb. Pacino the cop looking to score big against the money criminals. But De Niro is a lot smarter then he thinks being on the other side of this crime chase. He plays his character perfect with the full emotion needed to have a great story-line and a great character in this well made crime drama. Two great actors clash in a crazy story of good vs. evil. It is a perfect picture of the 90s. This movie is De Niro at his best along with Pacino actually playing a good guy. I give this movie a 10 out of 10,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pros and Cons,"It seems that wherever this movie opens, it is accused of starting a crime wave.  That aside, it is an interesting film.  The performances by De Niro and Pacino are excellent, especially in how they relate to each other.  The scene where they are talking over a cup of coffee in particular brings a level of excitement without resorting to action.  But the movie was too long and had to many subplots to constantly maintain interest throughout the film.  Nonetheless the story was generally entertaining.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Captivating,"I remember watching this movie on VHS on my tv in Tokyo. The robbery shootout was what stuck in my mind.

Great performances, character development and, oh my, the set pieces. One of the greats.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
LA Takedown a better movie?,"Heat is an excellent film but I was always disappointed with the end; I thought the DeNiro character wouldn't just blindly run from Pacino - he would have waited for him and shot him down, surely? I must have counted a dozen occassions where DeNiro could have safely ambushed Pacino. The earlier film LA Takedown, which is almost scene-for-scene and line-for-line the same as Heat, has a better ending I think, more true to the De Niro character anyway. Why Mann changed it for the implausible ending of Heat I can't conceive.Having just watched the two films within a day of each other, it is amazing how close they are; even down to the cut-aways, close-ups and zooms. The scene in the diner and then outside when Waingrow is about to get shot but disappears is identical in every way, as is the scene when Patrick/Neil meets the girl when reading a book (except in Takedown she designs album covers and in Heat it's CD covers!).The bank heist shoot-out in Heat is one of the best scenes in cinema history. Wonderfully put together and filmed, the violence is shocking rather than merely exciting. It makes you feel that you've been a witness to a real life shoot-out; a very different and disturbing feeling to what most cinema violence gives you these days.I would have given it 10 out of 10 but for that ending. Somehow the last 10 minutes make you feel that you've wasted the previous 2 hours and 40 minutes. Gotta go down to 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cop and Robber,"""Heat"" reunited Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for the first time since their starring roles in ""The Godfather Part II"", a film in which they never actually appeared on screen together. (They were later to act together again in ""Righteous Kill"" from 2008). Like both those films, this one is a crime drama; here the two stars play adversaries on opposite sides of the law. De Niro is Neil McCauley, a professional criminal who organises a security van heist in the course of which three guards are killed. Pacino plays Lt. Vincent Hanna, the L.A.P.D. detective charged with investigating the crime. The plot gets very tangled, so I will not attempt to summarise it any further.The name ""Neil McCauley"" was taken from a real criminal on whom De Niro's character is partly based, although he was from Chicago rather than Los Angeles. The character of Hanna was based upon Chuck Adamson, the detective who tracked McCauley down. I wonder if the name ""Vincent Hanna"" was borrowed from the well-known British television journalist, who would still have been alive when this film was made in 1995. (He died in 1997).Of the two big stars, Pacino is certainly the better. Hanna is quite a complex character; the film deals not only with his attempts to solve the crime but also with his problems in his private life. He already has two failed marriages under his belt and his third marriage is also troubled because the long hours he has to work, and his obsessive dedication to his job, are placing his relationship with his wife under strain. Pacino copes well with the difficulties of conveying the two sides of Hanna's personality, the dedicated, almost workaholic professional and the struggling family man.I was not, however, so impressed by De Niro. After starring in films like ""Mean Streets"" and ""Godfather II"" in the seventies, he became almost synonymous with crime thrillers, and I am not convinced that this has always been to the benefit of his career. At his best he is, of course, one of the greatest actors working in the American cinema, but at times he can fall well below that best. It is notable than many of his best performances have come when he has tried something different in films like ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""King of Comedy"", ""The Mission"" and ""The Fan"". Now most, perhaps all, of those films can be characterised as ""crime films"" in that they involve criminal acts committed either by De Niro's character or by someone else, but none of them fall into the standard ""gangster epic"" or ""cops and robbers"" formulae. When De Niro does appear in standard crime dramas it sometimes seems as if he is simply retreating back into his comfort zone where he does not need to try very hard.That is precisely what happens in ""Heat"". His performance is not particularly bad, but it is mediocre, lacking the spark of brilliance which he can bring to those films which really stretch him and challenge him to do more than falling back on the tried and trusted. Also, his delivery is at times below par and I found it difficult to catch some of his lines. I never had that problem with Pacino. The one time De Niro really comes to life is in the scene where McCauley and Hanna meet in the coffee bar. While watching the film I felt this scene was a bit unrealistic, but in fact the real McCauley and Adamson did indeed once have such a meeting.Heat was a commercial success, and was generally well received by the critics, but I can't say that it is a film that I cared for very much. My main complaint would be that at nearly three hours it was too long. Some will doubtless reply that the film needs to be this long to deal adequately with all the complexities of its plot, but it is these very complexities which are part of the problem. The film would have worked a lot better with a more straightforward storyline, fewer characters and greater concentration on the main McCauley/Hanna confrontation. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It has identical elements to many other cops and robbers movies - a crime, a shootout, a love interest for the good guy and the bad guy, a cop on the edge, etc.But saying Heat is ""just another genre film"" is like saying a Ferrari is ""just another car"" or Jessica Alba is ""just another woman"". The bottom line is ""this is as good as it gets, folks"". I thought it was perfect back in 1995. I watched it on DVD some twelve years later and that assessment hasn't changed.So it's a cops and robbers film. You already know the plot. A crime happens. A cop pursues a criminal. There is a big confrontation at the end. You've seen it a thousand times.But HEAT isn't about the ""what"". It's about the ""how"". How is was made, and how it was delivered. And to put it simply, the film is completely flawless. The acting is beyond breath-taking. Every scene is perfect. Every moment of it's nearly three hours is to be savoured like the finest wine.Bottom line - A masterpiece that is richly deserving of its place on the ""IMDB Top 250""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Three pillars: De Niro, Pacino, Mann","This movie is one of the great crime movies and what it held up by are the three pillars.Where these pillars are best represented are two scenes the coffe shop scene and pank heist/shootout scene.Coffee shop scene is two acting masters at work. You get the sense that if these characters were in different situation they would be friends. They go through emotions and understanding of each of their characters and yet under the surface there is coldness of death towards each other.The shootout sequence is one of the greatest action sequences ever made. What makes it great is the direction, preparation and sound design/mixing.Everything is clearly filmed you know exactly who is shooting who and what the geography of the place is. Actors went through a rigourus training with weapons and you can see it, the way they hold the guns they way they shoot, it feels real.I havent heard a shootout sound like this in any other movie you feel every shot in your chest the echo of the shots bouncing around in the streets, it is just great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
God it's good!,"There isn't much new to be said about ""Heat"". It's a solid, well paced film that satisfies the strong need for logic in a story that is human and poignant as well. Often I find myself unable to enjoy a film because some small plot hole unravels the point of the story. TDK has several plot holes that upon repeated viewings get more glaring, as well as pacing problems (I tend to feel exhausted by the joker is captured halfway through and just wish it were over). Heat does not have these problems. It is poetic and grounded. The only reason I haven't watched it a hundred times is that I enjoy it so much I like to live with my impressions of it between viewings.""Collateral"" suffered from an all too convenient third act twist, that while being setup early on still felt too convenient. TDK definitely had some ""how the hell can you plan for this kind of thing"" moments when the Joker was pulling his social experiments. In this film, the rules apply throughout. No one is super-smart, or possessing of plot device powers. They're just good at what they do. Consequences are followed through in a very satisfying way that raises the question, why don't more script writers adhere to their own created world's inevitabilities when Mann can do it and make it supremely enjoyable? But then, not very many directors/writers have Mann's subtle and meticulous vision.Sober is a good word for how Mann constructed this film. From start to finish, deviations from the plan only lead to failure. Every time the police get closer to catching the criminals, it's because someone deviated from the plan or stepped outside of the rules.I would recommend this to anyone that finds the common fair of bloated plot-hole riddled blockbusters dissatisfying.

Too many unnecessary characters,"Part of the reason that this film felt boring was the unneeded development of minor characters.

"Stunning, gritty, intense - one of the best films in decades","Wow. While the basic plot is nothing complicated, it is one of the most well executed movies of all time. The acting of everybody involved is superb. Every single key character is meaningful and presented in such a way that you become emotionally invested in all of them, good or bad.

The ""good"" guy is obsessive, emotionally dysfunctional, and incapable of seeing the train wreck which is his stepdaughter's life until it hits him in the face.The visuals are fantastic, the music excellent. The scenes where Pacino and DeNiro interact really show these two actors at their best.

Apart from a fabulous street shoot out between the goodies and the baddies, which is so realistic you will think you are actually there, there is absolutely nothing to this film. It is slow, verrrry boring and apart from THAT scene has no action in it what so ever. The script is lost in the hype as the clock ticks on very slowly indeed and as for the scene where nemesis's De Niro and Pacino discuss their intentions 'over coffee' I just have to say eh????, what's that all about???.

Heat: a Michael Mann masterclass of the heist movie genre,"Director Michael delivers one of the best thrillers of the last few decades with Heat.

I have yet to witness a heist movie that even comes close to the greatness of this slick thriller of a movie. Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley and Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna are riveting to watch. Val Kilmer's extremely cool Chris shiherlis steals the show in some of the movies greatest action scenes. The city of L.A is also captured beautifully; whether it is a heart-racing gun fight on the streets of L.A or a conversation between two guys in restaurant, the city of angels feels like a character of its own.

There is a real restaurant in Los Angeles where one day of the week police detectives sit down and eat together, and on a separate night, known ex-criminals have dinner in the same room. Michael Mann placed his actors(police with detectives, and bank heist crew with mobsters) in the same room to listen to their stories, to get a feel for their role, for their character. It is this type of preparation that makes Heat one of my most cherished films.

One of the greatest movies of all time.,"Heat 1995
A scene in the middle of Michael Mann's ""Heat"" illuminates the movie's true subject. The film revolves around detective Hana (Alpacino) following a professional thief named McCauley (Robert De Niro) for several days. McCauley is a clever and wary thief who seems impossible to track; So, one night, McCauley is surprised by a car that asks him to stop on the side of the road, which turns out to be Detective Hana.McCauley waits in his car, ready to fire his weapon if necessary, and Hannah approaches him and says, ""How about I invite you for a cup of coffee?"" McCauley replies that this idea sounds good.The two men are sitting across from each other at a plastic table; Middle-aged, bored, with immense experience in their respective fields, they know each other what they represent, but they drink coffee in this short respite.McCauley is a professional, skilled and talented thief. When Hannah suggests otherwise, McCauley responds, ""Do you see me robbing a liquor store with a 'Born to Lose' tattoo on my chest?"" The policeman believes in his words, he does not think so. Towards the end of the conversation, the policeman says, ""I'm not good at doing anything else,"" and the thief replies, ""So am I."" The spectacle intensifies the ""heat"" that cops and thieves need each other, their jobs cut them off from society, and they are defined only by what they are good at.They are enemies, but somehow more intimate, they have more in common, than they are supposed to be their friends - their women, for example.Another movie theme is ""Women"". Two of the main characters in ""Heat"" have wives, and during the events of the film McCauley falls in love, which goes against his policy. Detective Hana is working on his third marriage with a woman named Justice (Diana Vinora), but it is a bitter marriage because he is obsessed with his job. ""You live among the remains of the dead,"" says Justice. The other married is one of McCauley's gang partners; Sherlis (Val Kilmer) and his wife, Charlene (Ashley Judd).McCauley's policy is not to get involved in anything he can't get away from in 30 seconds, but he gets into a conversation with Eddie (Amy Brenneman) while sitting in a restaurant. She answers him, ""I'm alone,"" and he replies, ""I'm not alone."" The truth is that he is the most lonely man in the world, and soon discovers that he needs her.This is the theme of the old conflict in American action films, between the man and his work on the one hand, and the dominant woman on the other, the woman who wants to tame him and force him to stay at home. The film dealt with this theme with depth and insight rarely seen in these genres, through the screenplay by Michael Mann. The men in his movie are obsessed with their lives. There's a scene where the thieves get all the money they need, they can retire, and McCauley even has his retirement home in New Zealand, but another mission comes up and they can't resist. This ensures the continuity of the action and excitement scenes, of course. The film opens these scenes with a fascinating sequence of an armored car robbery and a shootout, and continues with a court bank robbery.McCauley is the mastermind, while Hana is the one tasked with guessing his next move.The police put McCauley and his gang under 24-hour surveillance, and one day follow them to an isolated warehouse area, where the thieves stand in the middle of a large area, and McCauley explains a scheme to them. Then, the cops stand in the same place, trying to guess the plan the thieves were discussing, they can't figure out anything, but Hana suddenly finds out, ""You know what they were looking at? They were looking at us, us, the LAPD."" And he was right. Meanwhile, McCauley was standing on a rooftop, looking at them through a magnifying glass.Deniro and Alpacino. The two starred in many great crime movies, and spent more time playing police and thieves than real cops and thieves. There is constant talk of actors studying real-life characters to bolster their performances. If Pacino and De Niro had decided to study a policeman and a thief at this point in their careers, they might have chosen to study their old films. In this film, we see absolute ingenuity, and an innate feeling radiate from their roles.What is interesting is how Mann analyzes these roles with women. Somehow, wives and mistresses are always standing at the kitchen door in this movie, telling the boys to come in and stop playing. Bacchino's wife, played by bitterly intelligent Vinora, was the cruelest of them all. She is married to a man who takes the dead bodies to bed to haunt him in his dreams. Her daughter is drunk and rebellious, and she does not get any kind of parenting from him. Their marriage is a joke, and when he catches her with another man, she says he forced her to degrade herself.The other two women (Judd and Breneman) lacked foresight. They still have some illusions, though, as Breneman, who played a graphic designer, objects as any modern woman would when this secretive stranger expects her to quit her job and her life and follow him into the unknown in New Zealand.This is not just an action movie. The dialogue, above all, is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they think, and their dialogue is eloquent, insightful, surprising, and poetic when required. They are not bound by the usual cliches. One of the worst constraints in our world is being powerless, being unable to tell someone what you really feel. These characters have that ability. It's a great ability, but it won't save them, of course.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

When the two adversaries finally meet over a cup of coffee in a cafe it is a spellbinding moment. Pacino coolly warns De Niro that he intends to take him & his gang down. De Niro responds by telling Pacino that if he gets in his way he will have no hesitation in killing him.

Extravaganza,"Wow...I have to give a ""summary""...?! Well, extravaganza it is. Seeing this film for the first time was like opening a box of treats. And not having long enough to savour each one. So, on repeat viewings, the box exposes itself and my appetite for Michael Mann's take on the human condition is sated, more so.Heat begins like many movies of its' genre; the opening scene-setters are very brilliantly shot and choreographed (the opening smooch between Vincent and his wife; Val Kilmer's character purchasing the weaponry from an unsuspecting Martin Ferrero etc). This movie starts well, and as it means to go on. Information is the key. The more you know about why these characters are who they are, they more you may understand why they do what they do.Complications set in quickly; Al Pacino's Lt Vincent Hanna is plagued by guilt over his lack of commitment to his marriage, which affects his relationship with step-daughter Lauren; Chris Shiherlis is a rogue, but endlessly loved none-the-less; Robert De Niro's Neil Macauley has a pact with himself: ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" This is complicated city! These people have feelings! They are loved, and they do too.As a heist movie, Heat is great. The L.A. take-down scenes are breathtaking. You pine for the guys who get shot, more so for the robbers who we've come to understand and, hell, like. The ultimate in cinematic connivance comes, however, when Robert de Niro and Al Pacino appear on screen for the first time ever. Yeah, they did Godfather 2 but, hell, a whole generation separated their characters. This is big stuff...however, the scene is so brilliantly underplayed that it takes on its own life, and becomes almost the point of reference for the whole movie. Al Pacino's cop chases Robert de Niro's robber and, Christ, they meet in a café. What do ya know...?! Suffice it to say, the climax of this movie is one of the most memorable and emotional in recent movie history. If you really feel these guys, and buy into what they do and what they say, you'll be hard pushed not to be blown away by the finale. I was. I saw this movie and realised that some people in Hollywood still know how to press the right buttons for people who are waiting impatiently for something good to come along and...well...blow them away.Hats off to all concerned. This is one hell of a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pure intensity.,"In what is arguably one of the finest heist movies in history, ""Heat"" pits two acting heavy-weights in Robert De Niro and Al Pacino against one another. One is a professional thief, so well seasoned that he has avoided the law for as long as he can probably remember. The other is a troubled homicide detective whose third marriage is fizzling out due to his over-riding commitment to his job. Each character ultimately finds he has more in common with his adversary than with his peers. Both are flawed, tired and run-down middle-aged men who, in the immortal words of Roger Murtaugh (see: ""Lethal Weapon"") are ""getting too old for this .""""Heat"" is hardly your average cops and robbers tale. It's long, it's sweeping and is steeped in character moments and conversations. While much of the hype about the film has always revolved around its finale – the bank robbery – it's the small moments that make the film. Take for instance a scene in the middle of the film where Pacino, too tired and beat down to do anything else, tracks down his suspect (De Niro) and invites him for a cup of coffee where the two talk shop and in spite of mutual respect for one another, both vow not to back down. This moment serves to build the tension that is the big pay-off in the film. You get to know and feel for these very real and very flawed characters, so that when the heat is on, so to speak, you don't know who to cheer for anymore.Undeniably, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are the stars of the film and are a large part of its greatness, but it is also Michael Mann's (""Collateral,"" ""Manhunter"") unique eye and story-telling sense that defines the film as well. Despite his insuppressible style, the film still retains a gritty, realistic air that is best evidenced in a shootout that takes place in the Los Angeles streets. Without a doubt, this is the director's masterpiece and definitely one of the best of its kind. It's a true epic that is filed to the brim with intense acting (nobody's forgotten about you either, Val) and complicated characters as intricate as the job they are trying to do. For all intents and purposes, ""Heat"" lives up to its name.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pretentious and overrated,"In Los Angeles, a gang of armed thieves is hitting serious targets - major banks, vaults, and armored cars. These thieves are led by arch-criminal Neal MacAuley. One of their operations, an armored-car robbery, goes bad and the armored-car guards are murdered by the gunmen - putting LAPD homicide detective Vince Hanna on the trail of the thieves. Hanna knows it will take a lot to bring these dangerous, armed thieves down, and it will end in a horrifying gun battle when the thieves try to rob a major federal bank... Heat is a pretentious and overrated crime thriller. I don't know about 1995 but as of today, the film fails to impress. The fact that Heat is hold as one of the best thrillers of all time is a joke. Michael Mann, himself, has done much better thrillers that don't have half the fame of Heat, like Collateral and Miami Vice for instance. First of all, the film seems to put all its chips in the reunion of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino instead of being an exciting thriller with a proper story and good writing. Good actors don't make a good film, it's as simple as that. The plot is convoluted, shallow and empty, and the side stories thrown in, like Pacino's suicidal stepdaughter and a gang member that turns out to be a serial rapist/murderer on the side are uninteresting and contrived. Plus, the action sequences are completely unrealistic with the thieves killing several cops and escaping despite being surrounded and completely outnumbered. Roberto De Niro was actually enjoyable as the gang leader Neal MacAuley, but he didn't have much room to expand or develop the character thanks to a mediocre script. On the other hand, Al Pacino, who I enjoyed in other films, was a huge disappointment. He was constantly trying too hard and had no sense of subtlety, he just screamed and yelled his lines without any real purpose. Val Kilmer, John Voigh, the great William Fichtner and a very young Natalie Portman, all had too little screen time to even comment on their performances. Another big problem, was the run time. The film drags and drags clocking at an amazing 170 minutes, almost 3 hours, when the story could have been easily told in 90 minutes or so. Overall, Heat is a mediocre thriller with a poorly written script that has gained much fame, only because, it stars two of the most well-known actors in Hollywood.5/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Pinnacle of the Cops and Robbers genre,"Pacino. DeNiro. Ask anyone who the greatest actors of all time are, and those two will be at the top of anyone's list. But here in ""Heat,"" there is an opportunity that will cause any movie-lover to begin salivating profusely: Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro star in a movie together! The story is simple, because ""Heat"" is about its characters. Robert DeNiro is Neil McCauley, a professional thief. Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna, the Los Angeles detective who is trying to prevent him from taking down his next big score.Despite being on opposite sides of the law, McCauley and Hanna are very much alike, yet their lives are governed by opposite circumstances. Hanna's marriage to Justine (the wonderful Diane Venora) is failing, while McCauley, a previously satisfied loner, finds romance with graphic designer Eady (Amy Brenneman). However, both of them have a similar mindset when it comes to their lot in life. Both of them simply do what they do best: McCauley takes scores while Hanna tries to stop him.The acting is what you'd expect it to be: outstanding. Pacino and DeNiro are in top form, and so is everyone else. Standouts from the main cast (apart from Pacino and DeNiro, of course) are the female love interests, Venora and Brenneman. Venora brings a torn sense of weariness to her character. She loves Hanna, but she also knows that he can't be the man she needs. Brenneman is great as the rather shy librarian, who decides to take a chance on Neil, but realizes that she doesn't know what she's getting into. Special mention has to go to Kevin Gage, who is seriously creepy as Waingro. Gage is absolutely chilling; he's the stuff of nightmares.When it comes to directors, Michael Mann will always have a special place in my heart. His tough-as-nails style is instantly recognizable, and ""Heat"" is pure Mann (no pun intended). The film is highly stylized, often times resembling magazine ads (though not in the same way as, say, Tarsem. Think high-end apartment ads, not fashion magazines). ""Heat"" is a long movie, clocking in at a little less than three hours, but Mann keeps things moving. The actors are so good that the time flies by.However, all that is fluff compared to the highlight of the movie: the robbery. Simply put, this is one of the greatest action sequences of all time. Not because it's full of explosions and extravagant stunts, but because it's so real. I had no problem believing that a bank robbery could have been carried out just like this. It's superbly choreographed and expertly shot. The sound of the gunfire is completely realistic, and the tactics are all in evident. It's exhilarating.There's not a person alive who wouldn't find something to like in this movie. It has great drama and spectacular action. ""Heat"" definitely is one of the masterworks of the cops and robbers genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Grand Theft Auto The Movie?,"I'll just come right out and say it because I'm sure the movie fans are thinking ""shoot yourself"" after reading that headline.With that being said obviously this film has nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto (GTA) but as a major RockStar fan and a fan of the GTA franchise I cannot help but see the obvious inspiration that RockStar must have had. I mean, RockStar plainly draws inspiration from the films opening scene alone as that heist is pretty much copied for a mission in the game.Regardless, I'm not here to talk about GTA...Heat is a good crime drama/cop drama, but because of its run time and story, this film, I must admit, didn't grip me.The story is interesting enough, but it never hooked me. Then, the film subplots I found even less interesting. Dennis Haysbert is a fantastic actor, but his character and his subplot I found useless it did nothing and led to nothing. Then the romantic interest for Robert De Niro's character I found was another useless subplot used only as a plot device and a tool of foreshadowing which I must admit had a nice payoff between De Niro and Pacino at the end but it did little to nothing else. Also, Hank Azaria's character, who was in the film for like two or three scenes, did next to nothing but was used as another plot device.De Niro, Pacino, Haysbert, and Kilmer all give great performances, as does the rest of the cast, and despite the great ending, everything else in the film left me wanting.I did enjoy the film and it was exciting to see the heists that I undoubtedly believe inspired RockStar in GTA V all that was missing was De Niro threatening a bank employee as he said ""you forget a thousand things everyday Pal you make this is one of them."" Great, now I want to play GTA again.Nonetheless I found this film is at it's best during the heists and investigation scenes and there is a fantastic cops and robbers movie in here but it gets bogged down with a less than stellar story and uninteresting subplots.PS. This film does have a fantastic structure that I believe would work in a live action Grand Theft Auto movie.IMDb: 7/10

One of the worst movies ever made,"I was recommended to watch this movie. Now I wonder whether this even is a movie. Is it an insane fantasy? Is it a collection of clichés; the thoughtful gangster and the cool police chef - not to forget all the beautiful women who share the role of the loving wife and girlfriend? Who are the characters that are introduced and suddenly disappear again? Why are we presented with the entire background of the cook/driver who dies within one minute? What is up with the daughter, that tries to kill herself, for no reason whatsoever? Michael Mann has no idea how to create sympathy for his characters, nor does he know how to convey emotions or give insight to the human psyche. The plot is yet endurable, compared to the filmic devices. The cuts are dreadful, unnecessary scenes are emphasized,important scene miss completely, the setting lacks design (Mr.Mann simply wanted to film L.A at night), the dialogue is grotesque and superficial - and does the role of Pacino have a dangerously high blood pressure or why is he permanently swearing and shouting like a prolet? The characters lack depth, especially their relationships are cliché-like and absolutely hollow. Cinematically, the film has no structure, it is a slap in the face.I recommend you to not watch this film, unless you want to have a good laugh with your friends.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Work of Pure Craftsmanship,""" A guy told me one time, 'Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.'"" Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) from HeatI've always been of the opinion that it is incredibly difficult to make a great crime picture. The genre has been explored so many times from so many angles. I can say with a degree of certainty that 99% of crime films being made today fall in to the ""Forgettably Entertaining"" category. Michael Mann's Heat is a film that falls in the final 1%.Heat (apropriatley subtitled ""A Los Angeles Crime Saga"") is at its core a character study of archetypal cops and robbers. The two sides of a coin: homicide detective Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and ace thief Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro). Their stories are fairly typical: Pacino is always on the job, must to the chagrin of his third wife, Justine (Diane Venora). This is a Pacino performance of the first rank. He's manic and riveting. Though he represents the ""right"" side of the law, Hanna is not Elliot Ness reborn. He loves the role of the hunter and craves it, Pacino, always an incredibly intelligent actor, knows this and bases his performance in this characteristic.DeNiro is Neil McCauley, a career thief who is the best in his profession. He's never had anything to weigh him down, so he's always been at the top. DeNiro bring a realistic cynicism to the role. In the hands of a lesser actor the role could have seemed to maudlin, but DeNiro pulls it off due to the attention and fascination her garners on screen.Yet, when it comes down to it, this is truly a Michael Mann film. It is an epic of surprising scope, and thankfully Mann is a director of considerable range. Mann stages what is arguably the most impressive shootout of the past twenty odd years. He doesn't just throw it on the screen, it is carefully edited, and maintains a naturalistic flow. However, by praising his direction I do not mean to discount his taut scripting. The film is filled with endless fascination, down to the characters and their daily routines, details are abundant in this film.All these elements are a certain greatness on their own , but when combined into a saga like 'Heat',they take on a special brilliance. When the credits roll it dawned on me, the film is so masterfully made, it is not only a masterpiece of the genre, but of the medium.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A True Gem of Movie-making,"I have just had the good fortune of seeing this movie 15 years after its making. Of all the the ubiquitous Pacino-De Niro -paired films, this one is easily the most outstanding. The direction is as tight as a Led Zeppelin concert, the cinematography is simply breathtaking, the major players are larger-than-life yet believable, the action sequences are exquisitely choreographed and finished to near-perfection. The moral questions the movie raises are an interesting side-issue as well. Not to mention the way the plot examines the flawed, but redeemable, relationships of post-modernity. In the end, one has become so involved as to try to stop the subtle plot from fulfillment. The suspense at the end builds to an almost unbearable climax, and the denouement is as brilliant, and human, and deeply moving, as they come...

"Michael Mann, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro at their brilliant best...","Simply incredible. This movie wasn't a massive box office hit like other similar movies but it is easily one of the best movies of all time because put simply, it has it all. To start with, it is visually stunning. Michael Mann couldn't have made LA look any better. Then we have the fantastic cast led by Pacino and De Niro and supported brilliantly by the likes of Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore. The casting is astonishing considering this wasn't a big budget, box office smash type movie. Then we have possibly the best written storyline in recent history. The story revolves around the dedicated but highly strung cop Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and his team of detectives trying to bust articulated thief Neil MaCauley (De Niro) and his team of bank robbers. The complexity of the characters becomes shades of grey rather than black and white as Neil wants out but struggles to give up doing what he does best and Vincent struggles to hold his marriage together as his pursuit of Neil takes over his life. All the characters in the movie are complex and interesting, adding different dimensions to the already fantastic storyline. It really has the lot. It is nearly 3 hours long but every minute is gripping and develops the story further, and the acting is fantastic. I recommend it any casual fan as much as fans of the genre.

Must See Movie!,"Interestingly this is a remake of a TV movie by the same director made only 6 or 7 years previous. Although ""LA Takedown"" itself was a good movie this has the advantage of a bigger budget, stellar cast and being the film which first presents De Niro and Pacino on screen at the same time.Although the De Niro/Pacino factor is something this movie is known for it is not all the movie is. In my opinion it is also one of the best films ever brought to the screen.The amazing cast includes as already mentioned Al Pacino and Robert De Niro plus Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Wes Studi and Dennis Haysbert. Not only is the cast almost dream like on paper but also all put in great performances (in many cases personal bests).Al Pacino plays Lt Vincent Hanna, an LA detective who is passionate about his work to the point he is unable to keep a satisfactory personal life running as well. His performance is very powerful and at times almost bordering on over the top but this fits the character well. De Niro arguably out does Pacino with his brilliantly understated performance as Hanna's nemesis - thief Neil McCauley. This is easily De Niro's best performance in years - the realism of his character is amazing. Kilmer plays Chris Shiherlis a member of McCauley's gang and gives a solid performance supporting the two key stars. As I say all the cast put in a great performance but it is worth mentioning Natalie Portman's early role as Hanna's troubled step daughter Lauren Gustafson, it shows why she has become such a big star since.Director/writer Michael Mann shows this must truly have been a labour of love. Every detail from character development to photography and music is spot on.

""I don't know how to do anything else.""

""I don't much want to either.""
""Neither do I.""Heat is the dream of LA, of the endless night and nearing dawn, of people who are stuck but must move forward, who must change because eventually, everything will change.Change.McCauley wants to change; he even convinces himself that he'll leave his life behind, that he'll settle with Eady. But he can't change. He's stuck, alone, forever following the mantra, thirty seconds flat.Hanna knows he should change, but he'd rather have a chaotic life and broken relationships and do what he does than have a normal-type life. And all he is, is what he's going after.Watching Heat has become something of a cathartic experience for me. It's probably one of the few movies I really feel a lot of emotion towards, and that I feel comfortable crying during.I love it.Heat has you sit with your thoughts as the characters do. Mann does such an incredible thing here: he lets you take a break. For such an intense action thriller, there's a lot of calm, reflective moments that allow you to get sucked into the world, relate to the characters, and reflect on yourself. The music and cinematography do an incredible job of doing this as well, making the film seem almost timeless in a way.Heat will forever have a sense of memory and nostalgia for me. I will change, life will go on. How else can we change if we do not reflect, if we do not look back on ourselves? Perhaps that is what some search for in this film... a moment of static, of facing the reality that we can't have it all.

Best movie ever!,"20 reasons why ""Heat"" is the best movie ever1- Best cast for a movie ever. How's this for a cast: Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brennemann, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Henry Rollins, Tone Loc, Jeremy Piven, Mykelti (I have the coolest voice ever) Williamson, WIlliam Fichtner2- Love movies where the main character can beat up people twice their size, in this case Neil McCauley beating up Wayne Gro a few times and Henry Rollins. Close runner up would be Ed Norton beating up DeNiro's bodyguard in ""The Score""3- Pacino explaining the first crime scene. It's so good you can overlook the amount of things he says that would be obvious to cops but not to us, the naive viewer (the exits, how they knew the average police response time etc). Not done as well in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" when scientists explain basic weather information that many movie goers wouldn't know. It would be like in ""Rocky"" if the trainer said ""Hey Rock, you gotta knock him out before the 12th because that's when the fight ends"".4. Al Pacino never saying ""goodbye"" or ""ok"" to end phone calls. Looks so cool just hanging up at the time you feel like it. I tried it a few times on friends but they no longer talk to me so my technique obviously needs some work.5. Neil McCauley's routine to pick up Eady at the bar. If you've never gotten a date, try this.6. Al Pacino's couple of screaming rants. Bill Simmons said about Pacino is his piece on DeNiro v Pacino that all of his characters in the last 10 years have basically been like the one he plays in ""Scent of a Woman"". Lots of silly yelling and screaming. The best one in this movie is probably ""Gimme all you got!"" in his ridiculous conversation with Albert.7. The cameos in this movie. The best ones being Henry Rollins , Jeremy Piven and Tone Loc.8. The quote: ""Have no attachments, allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat coming around the corner""9. How creepy the diner manager is. He'd be awesome in ""My Restaurant Rules""10. When has the ""cop pursuing likable criminal"" not worked? My second favorite movie of all-time is ""The Fugitive"", so. Even ""US Marshalls"" is watchable purely on this premise. Oh hang on, theory ruined, I forgot about the Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones one, ""Double Jeopardy"".11. Another McCauley quote ""I'm talking to an empty phone...There's a dead man on the end of this line."" Try it on a telemarketer sometime for a laugh.12. Vincent Hanna talking to Kate about why he doesn't talk talk about his work. Great Pacino work. She holds her own too, except that haircut ruined her character for me.13. The fact the movie seems to be around bank robbers but really is all about relationships. Watch from about the 56min mark for 10 minutes and see how it goes right into them. The movie has them all. The dead relationship between Kate and Vince, the blossoming relationship between Neil and Eady, the roller coaster ride of Chris and Charley and lots more.14. One of the few action movies with cops ever where no-one over rides the man in charge's orders. It's pretty much a staple of cop movies these days. See ""The Negotiator"" and ""Con Air"" for the worst offenders.15. Pacino quote: ""Who..Who...What are you a %$^&*( owl?""16. Neil's suit.17. ""The Scene"" with Vincent and Neil having a chat over coffee. Both guys are almost having an ""act-off"" (like the ""walk off"" in Zoolander). Forget Shakespeare, aspiring actors should watch and rehearse a role from this scene and they'll be set for a huge career.18. Pacino Quote: ""I'm very angry, Ralph""19. The directing of Michael Mann.

A well-executed crime drama,"One could hardly ask for more than to see Al Pacino and Robert De Niro perform together in an engrossing action drama, and Heat definitely provides the thrill that is expected from a film with such a star-studded cast. Along with the two very strong leading performances, this crime drama also puts on display the terrific filmmaking abilities of Michael Mann, who manages to bring a great deal of passion and the feeling of sensation to the genre. The story is rather typical, but the unexpected emphasis on character development lifts the film, as interpersonal relationships are explored in a very compelling way. Although the film is perhaps a bit too long, and as a result feels slightly flat at times, it is carried by tremendous acting and ultimately does offer the audience a very solid ending. Heat succeeds in presenting the duality between the police and the criminals, while also providing the necessary action alongside it, which ultimately does differentiate the film from others in its genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"An average thriller, overrated by the presence of De Nero and Pacino","A lot of people have made a lot of fuss over Heat. After seeing it for myself I really can't understand why. Aside from the presence of the two leads Heat is essentially a cops n' robbers saga given a little extra dimension and a lot of extra gloss. I can't fault Michael Mann's style. His stark vision of Los Angeles is excellent. The opening shot with the elevated train coasting past the camera with the haunting synth score is truly memorable. However, when the first shot of a film is the best part, you're in trouble. Mann as writer fairs much worse. His script (actually based on his 1989 TV movie LA Takedown) is a mess; padded his unnecessary subplots and characters; it substitutes intrigue for confused plotting. The near 3-hour running time is sheer self-indulgence, when the concept behind this film is complete mouse of idea: that cops and robbers are very much alike. In reality this so-called character development that Mann has put at the front of his film is just a story of male bonding between two highly unlikeable and unsympathetic characters. Pacino as the cop and De Nero as the robber are both well-worn clichés that are slightly deeper than normal. Pacino as an angst ridden cop, on his third marriage and De Nero as the calculating psycho criminal who plans his life so that he can drop everything and leave at 30 seconds notice when the heat is on. Both these characters are as unlikeable as the other is and this blunts much of the tension. A brilliantly staged gun battle on the streets of LA is wasted because we don't care which character comes off the better. The two leads don't do anything for their roles either. Neither gives performances that equal their best and the film's main purpose is simply to bring them on screen together. They appear twice together. Once in a coffee shop to discuss their morals and at the film's ending, which more than resembles that of Bullit. Clearly Mann has attempted to say that police and criminal are indivisible, and this is probably why we don't sympathise with either of them. This is such an unoriginal concept that has been explored as far back as the 70s with The French Connection and Serpico it also is the reason why, the film is overrated.

"You don't live with me, you live among the remains of dead people.","Heat is written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brennerman and Danny Trejo. Music is scored by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Dante Spinoti.Big time thief Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is after one last major score before he retires, but hot on his tail is Vincent Hannah (Pacino), a cop equally and methodically as driven as he is himself.In the build up to Heat's release, much was made of it being the first on screen pairing of DeNiro and Pacino. A mouthwatering prospect for sure, it proved to be worth the wait and unfolds as a lesson in restrained acting with two modern greats affording each other the respect that was due. What we didn't realise in the build up to the film's release, was that it would prove to be one of the greatest cops and robbers movies of all time, brought to us by an auteur director whose kink for realism and commitment to research stands him out from much of the modern directing pack.Rarely does a film come together as one, where all the cogs of the engine are in tune, but Heat is one such picture. From cast performances to visual aesthetics, to screenplay and actual substance of story, Heat is as meticulous as it is thrilling. There are a myriad of characters brilliantly stitched together in one de-glamorised City of Angels, as plot develops, and each character and their crumbling relationships come under inspection, we are witnessing a coarse viewpoint of human nature, where people's lives are ended or defined by their choices. Everywhere you look, here, there are folk cracking under the strain of being exposed to high end crime, dreams, hopes and happiness are unlikely to be achieved, and this is on both sides of the law.For Heat, Mann fuses the tonal and visual ticks of Manhunter with that of the adrenalin rushes from Last of the Mohicans, with the former gorgeously born out by Spinoti's pin sharp photography, the latter thrillingly realised by Mann's skill at action set pieces. Once again word of mouth about the key heist and shoot out in the film led to high expectation, and again there is no disappointment. L.A. becomes a battle ground, rapid gunfire punctures the air, cars swerve and crash, bodies fall, visually and aurally it drags you to the edge of your seat, an extended action sequence fit to sit with the best of them. The kicker as well is that because Mann has been so detailed in his characterisations, we care about what happens to all parties, we understand motives and means. Which in a film with such a huge support cast is quite an achievement.There is enough in Heat to fill out a dozen other cops and robbers films, fans of neo-noir and crime films in general are spoilt supreme here. It's not rocket science really, put a group of great actors together, give them an intelligent script to work from and let them be guided by a director who will not sit still, and you get a great film. Heat, the ultimate predator and prey movie, where from beginning to end it refuses to be lazy or cop out, and energy and thought seeps from every frame. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliantly done... legendary,"This is one of the most inspired, brilliantly crafted and gut-wrenching crime dramas ever made and it shows. We may never see a better cast in a drama/action film because as far as I'm concerned no one could top a dual lead like De Niro and Pacino alongside support from actors like Kilmer and Sizemore. Acting aside, the storyline is filled with profoundly brutal realism and transcends pedestrian good guy/bad guy dynamics with a bullet, not to mention the gorgeous cinematography, masterful editing and outstanding musical score. The color choices alone seal the mood (like that blue filter so sweet) and it couldn't have been cut together better to add dramatic intensity and edge of your seat action sequences. The music in this one is definitely what pushes it to the next level, as many people seem to agree, and I would love to shake the hands of each and every person who helped to create this masterpiece, especially whoever had the idea to use that Moby song at the end brilliant, absolutely brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of my Top Five,"This movie settles the score of who the better actor is, DeNiro or Pacino? Although both great actors only one can come out on top and be recognized for their outstanding performance in this one. The infamous scene where the two are face to face (rumored to be a split screen because the two can not work together) at the diner is where I feel the judgment can be made. I will let the viewers come upon their own conclusion, or maybe one can not be made, but I will say if you pay real close attention you will notice one of the two actors trips up on their words. Besides this scene, both performances are almost flawless ('nobody is perfect'). Each character in their own rights is content on winning and absolutely NOTHING will stop them; not love, friendship, or themselves. When I say 'themselves' I mean there personal/emotional problems, and they both have many, will not affect their goals.The mentality of the two main characters, one of almost no regret no regard, trickles down to the whole supporting cast. The supporting cast could have not been put together better, I developed much respect for Tom Sizemore and Val Kilmer after this movie. I would like to name the rest of the cast, because it is good, but these two stand out the most. While watching this movie imagine Kilmer as DeNiro's good son and Tom Sizemore as his wild child trying to learn DeNiro's flawless and seemingly simple routine criminal tactics. One gets himself in trouble.The movie as a whole is one of the best. I wish it were a top 10 because it deserves to be, but due to violence and the lack of a love story so many crave, it isn't.Sit down and enjoy, don't plan to relax as this one is a quite a ride. The ever so popular typical bank robbery movie that isn't so typical.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Boring,"I think there might be a good movie buried under all the excess celluloid.

Quite the crime action...,"I actually believe that I have only seen the 1995 crime action movie ""Heat"" once before, and thus now in 2023 making it my second time. I have to admit that I had entirely forgotten about the storyline in the movie, though of course I was well aware of the movie itself. And thus, I opted to sit down and watch ""Heat"" once again.The storyline in ""Heat"", as written by writer and director Michael Mann, is rather good. Sure, there are elements and aspects of the storyline and narrative that are cliché and generic for crime action movies of the same type, but it actually plays out nice enough in the movie. It is a good storyline that takes the audience along on an exciting and entertaining ride. Sure, the narrative is somewhat predictable, but given the performances and such, then ""Heat"" is certainly well-worth watching.The acting performances in ""Heat"" are great, and talk about an amazing cast ensemble. There are so many talented actors and actresses on the cast list in ""Heat"", that it is mind-boggling. I am really impressed with the sheer number of familiar faces on the screen, in both leading and support roles. And, of course, with the likes of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in the leading roles, you are in very, very capable hands.Running at 170 minutes, the movie has the possibility of being a bit long for some viewers. And yeah, it could possibly have benefitted somewhat from a more round-handed trim in the editing room. But I have to say that the nearly three hours actually passed by pretty quickly. I enjoyed the narrative of the movie, and thus had no problem with the runtime of the movie.Writer and director Michael Mann definitely came up with a rather enjoyable and entertaining movie here back in 1995, and it most certainly is a movie that still is very enjoyable and watchable today.My rating of ""Heat"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the most complete movies ever made,"Let's start with this: This is probably my favorite movie of all time, all categories. And I've seen a LOT of movies (too many).It has some of the finest actors of our time together, although not in many scene shoots together maybe. It is, by far, one of the most ""correct"" movies ever made considering the characters and how they act according to their backgrounds, and certainly in their trade-craft - how REALLY professional criminals/robbers do their job. This is mainly due to Mann's attention to detail in interviewing and involving former cops, criminals, and special forces guys in the making, in everything from stances, weapon handling, clothing and equipment down to the last details, and how they walk and talk. They gave Andy McNab (former SAS) the task of producing the most efficient way to do an armored-car heist, bank-heist, and how to move a small outnumbered armed group out from an area surrounded by police (it's all SAS tactics by the book), and the result is astounding.This movie is so known and over-reviewed I'm not going to say anything more, just see it if you haven't! A clear 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pinnacle Of Mann's career,"Plot In A Paragraph: In L.A, a group of professional bank robbers led by a loner called Neil (Robert De Niro) start to feel the heat from the police headed by homicide detective Vince Hanna (Al Pacino) following their latest heist.The pinnacle of Michael Mann's career so far, Heat is simply superb. It's interesting to note he hits a lot of the same beats from Thief and Manhunter, plenty of shots of the ocean, men sneaking out of bed leaving their woman sleeping, scenes in cafe's at night and again one hell of a score. Boy does this guy know how the chose his composers. So reminiscent of Thief's score, I looked to see if it was Tangerine Dream. But it was Elliot Goldenthall. Brilliant at helping create tension and setting the tone.People always wax lyrical about Pacino and De Niro in this, and they are worthy of the plaudits, but so is the supporting cast Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Kevin Cage are all brilliant, as are William Fictcher and Hank Azria in smaller roles too.Of the women in the movie is Amy Brenneman and Ashley Judd (for years I thought it was Charlize Theron) are more than just scenery, as can often be the case in this type of movies. For her brief time on screen (3 scenes) Natalie Portman is superb and her subplot is heartbreakingly sad. Ignored by her Dad, no fatherly figure support from her step Dad (Pacino) and her mam pretty much ignores her.I love this movie!! One of the best of the year, if not the decade!!Heat did not do as well at the box office as I thought, grossing $67 million at the domestic box office to end the year the 25th highest grossing movie of 1995.To put that in context, Father Of The Bride 2, the Hugh Grant comedy Nine Months and Mortal Kombat all out performed it.WTF?? Don't get me wrong 1995 was a good year for movies, but I expected to see this higher when I looked.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
'95 - Year Of The Mann,"Here's another gem I've only just got around to watch, and its pretty much as near to a masterpiece as a film can get.For those of you who don't know what Heat is about, it follows Lt Vinncent Hanna (Pacino) trying to track down and convict a group of cons, who are terrorising LA, headed by Neil McCauley (Deniro). Its supported by an all-star cast (Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Natalie Portman ...) and is directed by Michael Mann.Due to Mann's style, the LA surroundings and photography are fully utilised, creating a visual backdrop second to none, and not just serving as pleasant on the eye but also plot devices throughout.Sure it's a cop flick, but more than being about the cat and mouse antics of the cat and mouse style story, it is an explicit snapshot of human nature and choice, it is a compact summary of what Mann clearly views as the mechanics of everyday occurrences placed under extreme stress. The subplots to each character is complex and twisted with each is a powerful subtext, which is not fully revealed till the last shot has been fired in the closing scene.Simply stated, this film is genius. Managing to manor around the simplicity plot holes of the 'cop' genre, Mann has created a stunning canvas of human life and emotion second to known, which is kind to the eye yet persistently juxtaposing the viewer's perspective.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock.......................,"Oh mama! What a drag this film is. I could only stomach around an hour before I had to switch this off. You just don't get drawn in and it's like being at work watching the clock waiting for 5pm. Sorry but I think Robert DeNiro is the most overrated actor in history. He was great once in a film called Taxi Driver and been living off of that ever since. Not to say he hasn't been in some good films but they were good in spite of not because of him. He is the dullest, flattest, clichéd, wooden, self conscious, one dimensional actor ever. For some reason he's been MADE 'great' and now everyone just repeats what they've been told. Pacino is a great actor but in this (probably his worst outing) he over acts and you constantly feel you're watching Al Pacino. I'm not a film maker and so it's hard to say why this doesn't work but it doesn't. Something to do with an inability to empathise with any of it. It's drama by numbers.

It is one of those movies which you watch once and then forget about it.And the last chase scene is also way too long for no reason. I guess director wanted to really gives us the full experience but it came out as forced upon. Cops and robber genre is not for everyone; what you can do with this genre is very limited in my opinion and most of the time it comes out as cliche.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Superior entertainment.,"Master filmmaker Michael Mann wrote & directed this theatrical reworking of his 1989 T. V. movie 'L. A. Takedown', in which two men on opposite sides of the law are destined to have their fates intertwine. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is a smart, efficient L. A. P. D. detective who picks up the trail of Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), an equally smart and efficient, high-precision robber. But the fact is, the two men are not so different. They're both very much married to their careers; Hanna is on his third (shaky) marriage, and McCauley prefers solitude. Still, McCauley is in danger of violating one of his own codes of conduct when he enters into a relationship with a bookstore employee (Amy Brenneman).About the only criticism that this viewer could make of this riveting film is that it simply goes on for an awfully long time. But it's still appreciable that ""Heat"" is just as much a character study as it is a cracking, contemporary cops-and-robbers melodrama. It benefits a lot from the dynamic between the two talented leads, who finally acted in a scene together in a revealing conversation scene a little past the halfway point. And we can see that they do understand each other. ""You do what you gotta do, I'm gonna do what I gotta do."" is basically McCauley's attitude. Both men admit that they don't really know how to do anything else (or *want* to do anything else, for that matter).Pacino does give in to some of his latter-day hamminess in a couple of memorable scenes, but when he tones it down, he's excellent, and De Niro is superb as his counterpoint. They're literally surrounded by lots of familiar, reliable actors; ""Heat"" deserves credit for creating one of the great acting ensembles of the last few decades. Among Hannas' crew are Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, and Ted Levine, and McCauley's team includes Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, and Danny Trejo. Kevin Gage plays Waingro, a new addition to the McCauley team who unfortunately has a compulsion to kill. This viewer will refrain from simply listing all of the talent; suffice it to say, they make this well worth seeing. Bud Cort appears unbilled as a jerk boss at a diner.All of the intelligent, interesting character details are supplemented by some truly fine action sequences. The botched bank robbery, in particular, leads to one of the most intense and prolonged shootout scenes in action movie history. Yes, ""Heat"" can be quite violent, but it does provide a real catharsis for the viewer.Wonderful music by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Dante Spinotti are also assets in this top-notch picture with many dramatic highlights and some definite insights into its characters.A must-see, even if one is ordinarily not a big fan of crime dramas or any feature with violence in it.Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Real stuff...,"""Heat"" is really an extraordinary movie. The crime story is not only one of the best written but also extremely strong directed by Michael Mann (""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""Manhunter"").It twists around the bank robber Neil McCauley, played by Robert De Niro (Academy award winner - ""Raging Bull"" (1980)), and his magnificent chaser Lt. Vincent Hanna, played by Al Pacino (also Academy award winner for ""Scent of a Woman"" (1992)). They both produce two of the most remarkable and stylish characters of all times, which is due not only to their great actor skills and abilities but also to the chemistry between them. They also have a strong structure to step, created by the supporting cast which includes noted names like Val Kilmer and John Voight.For the connoisseur of cinema this movie is absolutely flawless. According to the mass spectator, however, it has one main disadvantage  ""Heat"" is really heavy stuff, and because of this it is not very dynamic but trying to create strong and complex characters and plot and going deeper into human mind and different point of views. From one moment you won't be able to distinguish who is the bad guy and who is the good one. It is so emotional for it is made extremely close to reality as if making you a reluctant witness of a real event. And then the final will leave you speechless.""Heat"" is like a gem among the crimes and it is obligatory for anyone being a movie fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Michael Mann's Magnum Opus,"Bringing two icons of yesteryears face to face in a deftly scripted & expertly directed crime drama, Michael Mann's Heat is a defining work of its genre that's envisioned, executed & presented with finesse, is led by compelling performances from both Al Pacino & Robert De Niro and, despite its daunting 3 hours runtime, it manages to be a thoroughly engrossing cinema that's as smart as it is satisfying.The story of Heat follows a career criminal whose latest heist mission goes wrong when his team's hired help impulsively kills an unarmed guard, thus turning their planned robbery into a homicide, and brings veteran LAPD Lieutenant & his crew into the picture who then take over the case and hunt for the perpetrators. What unfolds next is a series of close encounters where each team tries to outdo each other.Written, produced & directed by Michael Mann, the film opens with a thrilling segment that sets up the premise and puts the story into motion. Mann's direction is absolutely top-notch, for he offers ample screen time to all the characters that inhabit this tale, and his script is just as accomplished as every character is embedded with a well-defined arc and the consistent flow between its events keeps the interest alive & kicking.From the technical standpoint, Heat is a masterwork of first-rate craftsmanship as almost all the element work in tandem with the rest to significantly uplift the whole look & feel of the story. The decision to shoot everything on location gives it a realistic vibe, Camera-work is controlled and its handling is smooth & flexible in both close-up & wide panning. Editing moves the plot forward at a steady pace while Sound is skilfully utilised.Coming to the performances, Heat features a fabulous ensemble in Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ted Levine, Tom Noonan, Natalie Portman etc, and although the supporting cast plays their part well, all of them are overshadowed by the stellar inputs of Pacino & De Niro, and the moments between the two are the highlights of this feature. Pacino definitely has the upper hand here but De Niro isn't far behind.However, despite plethora of positives, Heat isn't without its shortcomings. Its 170 minutes runtime carries a lot of fat and could've been trimmed into a lean narrative by editing out nearly everything that doesn't play a key role in the final outcome. The numerous subplots dealing with the turmoil of our relevant characters' personal lives do help in adding more depth to their arcs but most of them are unnecessary and should've ended up on the editing room floor.On an overall scale, Heat scores high marks in both storytelling & technical departments, and has played an influential role in the world of filmmaking over the years. The magnetic screen presence of Al Pacino & Robert De Niro as well as their strong chemistry alone makes it worth a watch but it is Michael Mann who cements his own legacy with this crime drama, for Heat is one of his finest directional efforts, if not the finest, and presents the notable filmmaker in complete control of his craft. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great Thriller,"Heat is the story of a brilliant Los Angeles detective named Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino, Scarface) and his confrontation with an expert thief named Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro, Raging Bull), as well as his crew (including Val Kilmer as Chris, Tom Sizemore as Michael, and Jon Voight as Nate). The film is more about character development than gangster action. That is part of what makes director Michael Mann's Heat the best of Al Pacino and Robert Niro's careers.The performances in Heat are superb. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino play their characters in such a way that you don't know who to root for and you can't tell who is the better actor. The supporting cast is strong also. The film is long, which gives it more time to bridge into several different subplots (examples: Hanna's troubled home, McCauley falling in love with a civilian, and Chris's gambling addiction).Okay, now here's for the new generation. The action in this movie is great but spread out throughout the story. There is a very famous bank heist scene which follows with a lengthy shootout between the cops and criminals. Although my favorite scene is when the two rivals (Hanna and McCauley) meet face to face and drink coffee at a diner.This is a great movie, and fans of the crime genre will not be disappointed.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Mann+Pacino+De Niro= Heat,"First off I would like to say that Heat is one of the best drama films in a long time personally in that decade. Mann is a very talented man but all his films he made before heat were OK like Manhunter, The last of the Mohicans, Thief and his writing also in Miami Vice. I am not knocking him down and saying all the film before that were bad or not that good they where good and his writing has improved so much over his carrier its amazing. and his directing well thats been good to, But Heat is what I personally think is gonna to be one film a lot of people are gonna to remember him for I mean his screenplay was like a novel with a pulse the dialog was well written and the Chaterter Developmeant was beautiful I mean every person in that movie had everything in a chain circle and the way he made you have a felling towards Lt. Vincent Hanna (AL Pacino) and Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro)it wasn't like I was meant to favor one better then the other instead I learned what it was like to live both life's and what the Pro's and con's are.Now for Al Pacino this is one of his best movies after this His acting wasn't really that terrific granted he did a awesome job in Donnie Basco, and the Insider but man when he talked you knew he meant it when he was with his Wife, his co-workers, even with DE Niro stand in.I mean this man was on the ball and he knew how to deliver expression with the lines. Robert De Niro is an other actor who i think this was his last terrific film after this was what Analzie this and that give mean break When I saw De Niro come off that train in the intro I knew he meant business and he didn't have no born to lose tattoo to his chest. I mean his performance was right on the ball including when he talked to his pal's people and even Pacino's stand in. They were both solid actor's with a solid Script / Director. Let me tell you some what that one scene with De Niro and Pacino was like noting to describe it was perfect each person told about them self s and said to each other plain and simple this is what I do and this is how I plain to do it and nothing is going to come in my way no matter what. All and all this Movie is amazing and to see two actors come together in a film with plenty of other well know actors like Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo, Ashley Judd, Natile Portman and Tom Seizmore they where all awesome I mean what a great job they helped carry this film it wasn't just two actors it was the cast and crew and Mann who made everything alive. But believe me this is one movie you will never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""All I am is what I'm going after.""","This is quite simply one of the finest movies of the last 20 years. The acting, direction, production and cinematography are all of the very best quality. This movie is well known for 2 things in particular. Firstly, for a while it was the only film in which Pacino and De Niro shared the screen *at the same time*. That has since been done again in Righteous Kill, but that was a vastly inferior movie to this. Secondly, as has been pointed out elsewhere, it contains the best heist shootout scene ever filmed. This scene is one of the most intense use of firearms you'll ever likely to see on screen, with the phenomenal sound of high powered rifles echoing off the buildings of downtown LA - if you have a home cinema system, turn it up for this scene, the background music is faded as the shooting begins and it is an audio assault on your ears. Fantastic atmosphere.What's fascinating is how Michael Mann balances the two sets of production values, moving skilfully between in-depth character exploration and major action sequences. This is done by offering the viewer a juxtaposition between the 'normal' aspects of the criminal's lives and their 'work', conveying the point that, for these criminals, it's a lifestyle, a habit, and a pattern of living that in some ways has its own appeal and is difficult to escape from. Even for De Niro's more experienced and level-headed character, 'one last job' is just too tempting a prospect. The grim consequences of this failing are told here with weary inevitability: a fatal confrontation between law and criminality is on the cards. What this film reminds us is that these two communities are equal sides of the same coin. The glimpse this film gives us into their lives is a pastiche, but in a way it is no more unreal than the weirdness and tragedy that pass for reality.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Has potential, but is far too long","About ten years ago, I sat and watched Heat with my family. Despite the three hour runtime, I was the only one who managed to sit through the entire thing without falling asleep. At the end of it, I really did not like it at all. I thought it was overly boring, and ran for way too long. My vast film knowledge was not even a fraction of what it is today at that point, but for years to come, if anyone ever asked if I had seen it, I said the same thing to them. So in the last two years, I've caught various parts of it, and was totally immersed within the film, despite my previous ideals about it. I never managed to watch it beginning to end at any point (usually just the same parts over and over), so I finally decided to crack down and watch it.Heat runs along the lines of a parallel story between two characters: Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro). Hanna is a Liutenant with the LAPD, and basically spends his life tracking down and arresting criminals. His social life is totally absent, and it shows with the frustration his third wife Justine (Diane Venora), has with him. McCauley is a skilled thief, who is hired on various jobs with his crew, and lives by a very straight, and by-the-books lifestyle. He consistently delivers lines about being able to walk away from anything if any situation was to come up. For that reason, his social life is a mess too.Both are basically the same conflicted character, just on two sides of the law.With the film running for three hours though, you can tell that this is just a very basic idea of what the film is about. It is littered with dozens of subplots involving secondary characters, and even deeper subplots with the main characters. It seemingly goes on and on, until it finally meets the ending, which never seems to come soon enough.While DeNiro is his usual great acting self here, there was something about Pacino that was just, not right. Watching the film, I could never figure out just what it was, but it was so easily noticeable that it was not on the same level as his performances in Scent of a Woman, The Godfather or Scarface. He's a great, versatile actor, and he's undoubtedly one of the greatest of the last thirty to forty years. But something just does not click here the same as it does with DeNiro. Of course, DeNiro's performance does not rank up there with the likes of Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, but it is still much better overall than Pacino's.The supporting cast which features Venora, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight and Tom Sizemore among others, are all just good. None of them really stand out performance wise, and none of them stand out as even close to matching anything that DeNiro puts forth (or Pacino for that matter). They are secondary to the two big actors, and they know it. They follow Michael Mann's writing to the tee, and make little to no progression in making their characters any greater than they can be.As said, Mann's script and direction really hurts this film. It is too long. Easily, a whole thirty minutes could have been excised right from the film, and it still could have had potential for greatness. Collateral was a straight two hours, and felt brisk, yet got so much accomplished. Why could this ""saga"" not have been so much more tightly packed in? The layers of subplots really damage the film and its impact, and really damages any sort of astonishing acting to be done. The audience is bored, and so are the actors. Is that not obvious Mann?But I will admit, the film has some fabulously choreographed sequences. The LA street shootout between the thieves and the cops is just astonishing. That one scene I mentioned above that I kept continually seeing? This was it. And watching it within the film really made me feel how sad it was to see such a great scene come so long after the lengthy scenes before it. It looks and sounds amazing. The cinematography within the scene is top notch, and is so well paced, that you have to ask yourself why the rest of the film was not done nearly as well. Yes, the film has a variety of other top-notch shots and visuals, but some are just overkill. And others are just unneeded. It was almost like Mann really wanted to make this film continue on forever, and try and throw some of his excellent style in to try and make up for it.Sorry to say, but it just does not help the film in the end.While some films have gotten better since I first watched them years ago, others have not changed. This film, sadly, is one of them. It has great potential, and some great sequences, but it just does not know well enough as to when it should stop. It's too long, and it has way too much going on in it for it's own good. It's not a bad film for this reason, but it's not an amazing one either.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"If there's a passionate genius on both sides of the law, the world turns out to be too small.","Every now and then there's a movie that never fails you. Heat is one of them. There's the opposition between two extremes, always returning in another shape, another metaphor. Cop vs bad guy, coolness vs heat, distance vs connection... This tension never ceases to get you out of your chair, into the story. Michael Mann always puts his main characters always at the opposite end of a long distance, and yet you feel there is close interaction. In Heat, Pacino and DeNiro meet twice, but the are talking to each other from the beginning till the end. One can't help getting between them while watching the movie.The other half of the story is the action. No mind blowing huge explosions or endless high speed chases, but real action. This movie gives you an impression about how simple and complicated real ""jobs"" can be. It just happens and you feel like your walking in that very same street, watching the whole thing while it happens in front of your eyes.That is the greatness of this movie. It feels real, both the action and the complex characters. It is not the regular good-guy-nails-bad-guy-flick. Both sides are figuring out the antagonist's next move and the spectator is caught in the atmosphere of mixed feelings: respect for the other side, both cop and gangster admire each other, but there both hardliners. No time for emotion, and yet there's a continuously glowing heat in their interaction, something that's reflected in their personal lives, the way they handle their private life.This movie is black and white in real life color.Well, it may be a matter of personal taste, but this is one of the best crime saga's ever shown on the big screen...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A slick a action movie with better than average acting,"I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but it ain't that good.  Yes, there's a lot of action and snappy dialogue, and not many dull moments.  I was entertained.  But this is not one of the great cop films of all time. Call me old fashioned, but I appreciate the gritty, grind it out cops like Popeye Doyle,Frank Bullitt, and even Harry Callahan to Vincent Hanna.  Somehow, I have difficulty envisioning Hanna staking out the front of a restaurant in NYC on a very cold and damp evening.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that try as hard as Mann did, I was never convinced that Vincent Hanna was a blue collar cop.Michael Mann churns out very stylish films, and this one is no different. He's got two great actors and a fine ensemble cast. I particularly admire Tom Sizemore's performance.  This could have been a far better film had Mann made his cop and robber a little less ""Hollywood"" and a little more believable.  These guys are just a little bigger than life.Comparing this movie to French Connection is like comparing Miami Vice to Kojak.  I can do with a little less emphasis on the sound track and a little more emphasis on reality.Nevertheless, if you are looking for a very entertaining two hours, you can do a lot worse than Heat.  6/10!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Contrived and cliched,"I guess I'm one of the half dozen people in the world who didn't see ""Heat"" when it came out. I read all the gushing critical reviews, but I just never got around to it.Watching it 24 years after its release, it struck me as contrived and cliched, with dialogue that sounds like something out of a bad 1940's gangster movie (""The cops are all over me like a cheap suit."" One guy actually says this! And there many other cringe-worthy lines).The cops and crooks are all alpha males; the women are all brainless bimbos--especially DeNiro's girlfriend who, in spite of being a normal ""civilian,"" decides to stick with him even after she discovers that's he's a thief and a murderer. This is after about two dates. Good choice, lady.To make matters worse, the movie is interminable: two hours and 49 minutes.There's plenty of automatic weapons fire, scores of wrecked vehicles, and many gallons of blood, if you like that kind of thing.Everyone at the time of the film's release was all hyped to see DeNiro and Pacino together as a bad guy and a cop, but to me, there is no chemistry. The one scene in which they meet in a restaurant and talk is promising, but it falls flat. They recite their lines and try to make it convincing, but that particular moment in the film made me realize how little investment they had in these roles. Just two big time actors collecting their paychecks.Just another Hollywood blockbuster with pretensions of greatness. Meh.

Brilliant,"Brilliant action-drama-thriller. Directed by Michael Mann, and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Historic in that this is the only movie that these two mega-legends of the screen have appeared in together.Excellent plot and direction. Mann gives the characters depth and builds the tension and drama. This is the movie where Michael Mann demonstrated the cinematographic style that would be his trademark: the use of colour and light on dark, the beautiful high-resolution night scenes. Visually amazing.Great acting by De Niro and, to a lesser extent, Pacino, but you would expect that. Pacino maybe overdoes the theatrics, though. As an indication of the magnitude of the main stars, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight and Amy Brenneman, major stars in their own right, get fairly secondary roles and Tom Sizemore and Ashley Judd have fairly minor roles. All perform superbly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Classic 90's Crime Epic,"There were many 'stylish' crime dramas and action movies to come out in the 1990's, but Heat puts them all to shame. Rarely missing a beat, this film takes the time to let the audience know how both sides, cops and professional criminals, go about their business. The time given to show the relationships they have outside their jobs with wives and girlfriends separates this film from most others. Michael Mann is a master of this, never underestimating the curiosity and intelligence of the audience. Every actor seems perfect for their role. Ted Levine and Mykelti Williamson can do more with a facial expression than most actors can with 100 lines of dialogue. Great Movie! To Note: there are many subtle plot points that can lost in the fray if you're not paying attention, even if you miss some things, it will be enjoyable.

Excellent film,"Just finished watching this movie for the first time. I registered on IMDb JUST for the purpose of commenting on this film. This is hands down the best crime thriller you'll ever see. Val Kilmer is awesome, DeNiro is awesome, and Al as always is top notch. The shoot outs, the plot, the characters are all insanely well done. I'm actually not a particular fan of this genre of films, but this film transcends genre and just about everything else. If you ARE a fan of the genre and haven't seen this film already then GET IT, now right NOW don't even finish reading this just go get the film. If you're not a fan of the genre then I highly suggest you put aside any misgivings you have about seeing this film and watch it, it is WELL worth it.

An epic crime film.,"At the center of Michael Mann's ""Heat"" is a simple cop-and-robber story, but the film's understanding of its two leads, and their deep affinity and respect for each other, is what essentially propels the film into greatness.It stars the two biggest names in Hollywood, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. For over thirty years, their performances have created critical milestones in acting. Although they both starred in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Godfather"" series, chronology prevented them from appearing on-screen together.Over the years, their performances stirred the entire world. Pacino electrified with ""Serpico,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Scent of a Woman,"" ""Donnie Brasco,"" ""The Insider""; De Niro impressed audiences and critics alike with ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" ""The Untouchables,"" ""Cape Fear,"" ""GoodFellas,"" ""A Bronx Tale,"" and ""Casino."" Both actors have won Best Actor Academy Awards, and have attracted fervent die-hard cinema fans. ""Heat"" marks their first -- and, to date, only -- film where they actually appear together in the same frame.Their first meeting takes place in a small diner off a freeway. Their calmness and mutual respect is what separates it from a similar story that might have them involved in foot-and-gun chases for the entire running time. This diner confrontation is ultimately one of the major reasons the film impresses.Pacino has been playing the same characters since ""Scent of a Woman,"" frequently yelling, ""Hoo-hah!"" and randomly shouting. His recent role in ""Angels in America"" was the perfect example of this tiresome persona -- a great actor who is starting to become lost (De Niro still has it, as far as I'm concerned, but Pacino needs to be careful). But if it's any consolation, this sort of frantic performance works well in ""Heat,"" resulting in the appearance of a tired cop who's been working on similar cases for far too long. Neil (De Niro), a criminal genius, is his perfect nemesis. Once he brings him down, his agenda will be fulfilled.The film is described on the posters as a ""Los Angeles crime saga,"" about a cop on the trail of a smart villain. The cop is Vincent (Pacino), a newly-married LAPD officer who takes great pride in his job. ""It keeps me sharp,"" he tells his wife after she complains that he doesn't spend enough time with the family. To Vincent, there is no other life apart from his job.Neil is planning to rip off a bank for millions of dollars. His last heist. He plans to settle down and raise a family, like his partner in crime (Val Kilmer) has already done with his wife (Ashley Judd). But you can't escape your past. Neil can only get so far before everything catches up with him. And, like a trapped animal, his only chance at survival is to attack the pursuer, which in this case happens to be Vincent.It is rather unfortunate that Pacino and De Niro are compared to each other so often, since each actor brings something unique to their films. Pacino, with his increasingly raspy voice and occasionally over-the-top performances, is wilder than De Niro. His portrayal of Tony Montana in Brian DePalma's ""Scarface"" was intense, and that same raw intensity he displayed there is brought to every role he has played over the years.In ""Heat,"" he plays another intensely breezy, confident character. De Niro is once again the quieter, reserved character, saying little, observing, and controlling everyone around him with those penetrating eyes. He has a face that says, ""I own you,"" and his intimidation is greater than anything he could ever express in words.The ending of ""Heat"" is absolutely brilliant, touching and moving. Suffice to say, I will resist spoiling it -- but it's far more tender than you might ever imagine. The film is based on an earlier work of Mann's, called ""L.A. Takedown,"" which is rumored to be included on the similarly-rumored Special Edition DVD.""Heat"" is masterful in the way it manages to balance the two most colossal stars of our time in a film that goes beyond the boundaries of crime thriller and into the realm of cult masterpiece. I do not know if Pacino and De Niro will ever team up again, but if they do, I'd be satisfied if the result is only half as good as ""Heat.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An epic masterpiece of modern American cinema,"Heat is among the finest 10 movies ever made. It's a classic. You can watch it nearly 20 years after it was made and it still astonishes you, every time you see it. Heat is a movie I never get tired of seeing.In Heat we follow a very professional tight crew of criminals led by DeNiro's McCauley that specialize in complex high-yield crimes. In the intro crime, they are forced to hire a new guy- Waingro, which will end up being the cause of their undoing. That intro crime is also among the more thrilling crimes ever filmed. It's elaborate, brilliant, fascinating.Tasked with solving the crime will be Pacino's Hanna. And he sure is up to the task, a man just as dedicated to his job as his nemesis. While McCauley is a loner and introvert, Hanna is the loud, at times funny, extrovert- and is he ever an extrovert.Hanna quickly catches up with this crew and keeps track of them in secret. But, McCauley is no dummy and he catches on to the cops, in a scene that is flat out genius.Hanna has unorthodox methods to say the least and one night he decides to invite McCauley for a coffee- leading to the famous face-to-face scene between DeNiro and Pacino. McCauley's character is the coolest criminal ever, and you most definitely don't want to this movie to reach its unavoidable conclusion. But for getting there you are rewarded with the most exhilarating shoot out scene put on film- following the crew's bank robbery in the middle of downtown L.A.Heat succeeds on every level: action scenes- the now legendary shoot out scene; on a personal level- Hanna's marriage falling apart and McCauley finding a girl; it has plenty of memorable funny moments- Hanna visiting Alan Marciano or Albert Torena; the fantastic music- many directors pay attention to their music (Tarantino being a bad example of it) but the score of Heat is perfect; not to mention the casting from the main to minor characters, it now reads as a who's who of Hollywood.What is most remarkable about Heat is the attention to emotional detail. The scene where loner McCauley looks in tenderness and disbelief the next morning at the girl in his bed is outstanding. In general, relationship are handled so well in this movie, in a mature, smart way that's not melodramatic. And the most significant relationship is the indirect one between Hanna and McCauley. They are truly meant for each other. There is a deep reciprocity in their lives. Without brilliant criminals like MacCauley there wouldn't be brilliant cops like Hanna. Hanna is married but the marriage is falling apart; MacCauley is a single and deep down lonely and finds a relationship. But both men aren't meant to live a regular life.Worth mentioning is also the cinematography. This movie looks gorgeous, every scene, every setting, the fashion, the cars. There is an aesthetic sensibility here that is years ahead of the aesthetic focus in movies these days. The tone of this movie, the looks, the music, it's all so understated yet so unashamedly brilliant.What makes this movie unforgettable though are the characters and the script. And there is no shortage of amazing characters. This isn't a movie that depends on one character or where one performance makes the movie. McCauley, the coolest criminal; Hanna the outrageous cop; Waingro, the vicious criminal; one could go on and on. One in particular is interesting because mysterious- Jon Voight's Nate- the man behind McCauley, pulling strings for him. What is his deal? We'll never know. A TV series based on him would have been a great idea. It's a shame that Mann's Robbery Homicide Division TV series never developed into what it could have been, a TV version of Heat.There are good movies, there are great movies, and there are movies like Heat.

The best film that I have ever seen - mind blowing !,"I first time I saw this film was in a cinema in Dublin. It was the biggest screen in Ireland and when the gun-fight scene came on, my ear-drums nearly jumped out of my head. This is certainly ten times the film Mann's first attempt was - 'LA Takedown'. Watching his pre-'Heat' films is almost embarrassing when you compare it to this mastery of cinematic genius. The characters gel together better than any cast I have ever seen. The opening armoured-car strike is filled with military precision, ex-SAS trooper Andy MacNabb was one of the military technical advisors on this film and special forces tactics permeate it from beginning to end. The gunfight scene is the best I have ever seen, the use of 'fire and movement' is truly breath-taking in it's beauty, even Val Kilmer puts in a good performance despite De Niro's overwhelming presence. MacAuley's turn at being a bank manager should put all other criminal elements to shame, here we see a mixture of undying professionalism and natural compassion intertwined in the consumate crim.

The style, while not overwrought, really brings Los Angeles to life.

An LA Crime Epic,"Michael Mann's Heat is quite possibly one of the BEST crime dramas in cinematic history. Mann puts in a lot of work to make this film feel authentic and real, while also telling a compelling story. Showing the unique contrast AND similarities of the lives of cops and criminals. The writing also does a fantastic job of fleshing out the main characters, almost to the point where you want to see BOTH sides succeed. Heat's gritty, realistic feel comes mostly from fantastic use of location in the city of Los Angeles and immaculate sound design that still blows me away today. It's a truly tansportive movie that tosses you right in the middle of the action, and it's absolutely riveting.

There   Is  A  Flip Side  To   That,"Throughout ones cinematic life, a fan comes to understand the essential ingredients of every movie. When it comes to crime dramas, it becomes standard for the good guys to win over the bad guys. However, after a lifetime of watching the same scenarios, and knowing full well the good guys don't always win in real life, sophisticate audiences then expect reality to be part of the movie. Few authority figures want to change the 'good always triumphs' myth, but modern audiences demand more 'authentic' crime dramas and thus a few courageous directors will give the audience what it demands. The best among them is Michael Mann. The movie ""HEAT"" has earned him more acclaim than any movie to date for realistic films. Anyone who views Heat, will see real life drama in action. Watching the film one realizes more than Mann's superior direction went into the creation of this unique story. The sheer star power added to the magical combination. Here we have Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) a veteran no nonsense detective who goes after only the best crime 'Crews' and will not stop until they are put down. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a master career criminal who rarely makes mistakes in his craft. Val Kilmer plays Chris Shiherlis a professional who is willing to put everything on the line for his woman and the Big Score. Jon Voight is superb as De Niro's mysterious fence and skilled consultant. The Big heist is upon them and De Niro's hand picked crew is going for 70 million. Al Pacino's special elite police squad will be there to try and stop them and to bring their crime spree to a end. Expect Micahel Mann to allow the experienced criminals to take on the well armed police with military weapons and precision teamwork in one of the bloodiest, explosive most exciting running gun battles ever created.

Overdone but good,"Police detective Al Pacino is after mastermind thief Robert De Niro. Also De Niro's partner Val Kilmer is having trouble with his wife (Ashley Judd); De Niro falls for nice Amy Brennerman and Pacino is having issues with HIS wife (Diane Venora). Also Tom Sizemore, Wes Studi and Dennis Haysbert appear in supporting roles.Big, sprawling cops and robbers drama. There are multiple story lines and all the characters are fully realized individuals. The acting is great across the board (except for Kilmer). There was a lot made of this film because of the 8 minute sequence in which De Niro and Pacino face off verbally against each other. They're both great and the sequence is crucial to their characters--but it isn't particularly well-written. Still this might be the only time we'll ever see the two together on screen (They both starred in ""The Godfather Part II"" but shared no scenes).The movie is well-directed with constant close-ups (for some reason) and shot in washed out color with some truly incredible gun fights (the last one is just jaw dropping). An ALMOST great movie.There are problems. There are too many story lines and the film becomes quite convoluted towards the end. For example--a subplot between Pacino and his stepdaughter comes up, disappears and pops in out of NOWHERE at the end. Also the film is much too long at 3 hours. This worked great in a theatre in wide screen and ear-shattering stereo (the gun shots went right through you). It doesn't work as well on TV.

She doesn't want to give up Chris no matter how much salestalk about Dominick's future the African American officer tried to persuade her with.Wonderful to see Hanna and his wife reconciled in their last scene together in the movie, its not a lose end left untied, but its something that's given closure up until the moment Vincent takes off to hunt down Neil.A lot of rough action scenes to make your viewing of this 2.5 hour movie worthwhile and exciting.Now, I'm gonna try to find a copy of MANHUNTER and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS.

heat doesnt sizzle,"Directed by Michael Mann, Heat is a action chase character drama that tries to be everything and ends up being bits of each..An absolutely outstanding cast though with Al Pacino as the cop on the chase of the big heist, Robert DeNiro as the leader of the bad guys (this is the only movie where both Pacino and DeNiro, arguably the two greatest actors of the past 50 years, appear on screen together) also with Val Kilmer Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, and Natalie Portman. This movie is a good movie with excellent characters who come to life. There are some memorable scenes..DeNiro and Pacino drinking coffee in a diner, Ashley Judd as Pacino's wife and Natalie Portman who does a great job as the step daughter whose life is falling apart.Overall a good movie but it seems to fall short of the lofty expectations.. on a scale of one to ten..a 6",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Practically flawless crime drama,"So to begin with i'm a very big fan of Robert De Niro and I honestly think this is one of his best. Everything about this movie works for me; the cinematography is stunning, the cast is brilliant, the score is pretty good as well. Heat (excluding some of the ones in John Woos movies) also has one of the greatest shootouts ever. To me heat is the ultimate blend of realism and style. This is easily one of the best movies released in the 90s also there's some brilliantly inventive film making from Michael Mann that, despite the 2 hours 50 runtime, keeps you gripped and thrilled at all times. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Didn't Feel As Great As It's Reputation,Good film though I am not sure it holds up as well as people say due to its writing. Not horrible by any means and possibly it is the idea of retrospection that is talking here but I found the film's action to be quite gripping with a story that could be a lot shorter and simpler while hitting every beat that it established. The rivalry aspect is played fantastically by both actors who deserve their recognition as superstars. Outside of that the dramatic writing seems too typical to justify the running time. Not lazy by any means still great effort by everyone involved. A revolutionary work just not one that can keep its status in my mind upon scrutiny.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Bloody hard work,"I'm sorry to go against the norm here, but I didn't enjoy this one bit. Even more surprising given there's about half a dozen actors in it I really like. But It actually took me 3 attempts to hack it through to the end & sent me to sleep once at 11am after a full nights kip before.I'm going off police films or shows anyway as too many tend to resemble extended episodes of TJ Hooker or Dempsey & Makepiece & this weren't a great deal different. It started off with some promise but degenerated into an overlong soap opera. At no point did I ever give a monkeys about Pacino's marital problems nor whether DeNiro or Kilmer sorted it out with their women.That don't mean I like the bang-bang you're dead type police films, I like some character insight but the amount of dialogue in this was ridiculous. The script must have looked like War & Peace. The scene with Pacino & DeNiro in the restaurant summed that up. I knew as I watched it everyone would rave over it, but I still can't watch that scene, even on it's own, without my concentration waining half way through. It seemed as if the director wanted to get as many 'cool' quotes in as he could & sacrificed the tension level because of it. Thus, when the plot did get complex from time to time, with the extra characters, it really required 110% concentration at all times.John Voight mumbled too much, Pacino shouted too much, almost Ric Flair-esque at some points, each character much have had tracking devices on each other the amount of times they bumped into each other, some of the least adept Police were on duty, there seemed far too many anonymous or convenient tip-offs and lots more was left unresolved after the end.Over half an hour & some of the subplots could have been chopped from this film. I know it was an insight into the contrasting lives, of the 'policeman & the criminal' but it was too much insight. I rate DeNiro & Pacino as much as anyone, but lets be honest you could have an hour of the pair of them on the bog, having a dump & reading the paper out loud & there'd be a hard-core group of fans who'd still worship it.3or4/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Simply Fantastic,"Michael Mann understands character(s). This is why 'Heat' stands out as an original piece of work that can demonstrate to young writers and filmmakers on how important character is to a film. There is so much depth given to the two central characters that it may propel some to question its use in several scenes. Yet it is precisely why this film is effective in juxtaposing the parallels of good guy versus bad guy, highlighting how De Niro and Pacino's characters are identical though on opposite sides of the spectrum. Subtle dialogue and actions are incorporated early on in the film so we are able to determine that when the two finally do meet, well into the second act of the film, we have already established that they mirror each other. Thus when the dialogue flows, we are well aware of this observation and allow the scene to naturally flow without the need to reiterate this fact.

the best action thriller crime movie of all time!,"This 1995 Michael Mann film is, certainly, one of the best action movies ever and for no doubt my favorite alongside Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.Even if for nowadays almost three hours of intense action may sound long, nothing is waisted here.The clash between De Niro and Pacino couldn't take place in a hour and a half average movie.What's extraordinary in this film is that one of my favorite actors, Val Kilmer, acts brilliant and what could seem impossible, to shine near De Niro and Pacino, he realizes.But the best thing about Heat(I know -a lot of superlatives...but it deserves)is how well the personal lives and each character life dramas are shown.In the average crime movies we can see a lot of shooting and that's all.Here, above the shooting, every character drama it's put in front.A definite 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A crime masterpiece,"This film will never cease to keeping me, or anyone else who loves well written, character-driven, and all around effective films - so involved and astonished. Michael Mann creates (actually, it's really all there already) a whole world through his attentive eye to details, distinctive characters, and just astonishing cinematography. He knows the meaning of balance, and knows just when to show certain characters in order to move everything to a certain point. Never throughout the film I felt something lagged. Each scene is brought in, and is dealt with in a way that always moves the story forward. That's perfect film-making. A definite masterpiece of the crime genre, and it's no wonder why Nolan is tipping his hat to this grandiose piece of work in The Dark Knight.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It is a film almost everyone loves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Absolutely Outstanding!!,"Overall this was an incredible movie.Yeah, it was a bit long, but I think it was worth it. Yeah, there are a few hokey scenes, but the good ones out-do them by a long stretch. Personally, my favorite is the coffee house scene. Not only do you get a true understanding of both Pacino and Dinero, but what really sets it up is the background. As they're both talking, listen and watch the background. You'll notice, at the start, that you hear regular conversations and and the clatter of dinner/silver ware. As the two talk on, you'll notice that the conversations slowly taper off, but the clatter remains the same. There's a point where, over Dinero's shoulder, you can clearly see an Asian woman whispering, and I'm sure that's what Mann had all the other patrons doing. As soon as Dinero says ""Or maybe we'll never see each other again"",everything returns to normal. Between their conversation and the background setup, it makes for the best scene of the movie. The bank heist/shootout would be my number two, although I think Kilmer could have taken his facial expression a bit further. I live close to downtown L.A., and have been on the same streets where they filmed that scene,but haven't been able to find the exact building they used for the bank. The armored car score at the beginning would be number three. The precision and preciseness was great. The ""drive-in on Centinela"" would be number four, although Kilmer should of had his H&K dialed in on the driver from the get go. The ending scene where Pacino shoots Dinero could of been setup a little better, but it worked out overall. If it isn't that obvious, I've damn near wore out my VHS copy watching it so many times. I give it five stars of five. That's my side of it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

All movies made in the same time, the 90s were the greatest decades of Hollywood, actors that gave a damn because life meant something, it wasn't about artificial things and popularity, it was about the acting, the times those actors lived, the feelings they had inside, the vision they saw of life.

The greatest crime drama ever!,"They do not get more perfect than this film. All of the pieces for a masterpiece are in place. You have the two biggest actors of the last twenty years, Pacino and DeNiro. You have some great talent in the supporting cast, Sizemore, Voight, Noonan. Kilmer, etc. You have one of the best bad guys ever in Waingro (Kevin Gage). Coordinating these brillinat actors together is one of the greatest directors of our time, Michael Mann. Brilliant dialog, direction, choreography, cinematography, etc.The movie centers around the relationship between ""cops"" and ""robbers."" Mann shows us just how close these two groups are to one another. After all, if you devote your whole life to staking these robbers out, thinking like them and investigating them, you are in reality, living their life. Pacino's character is consumed with busting guys that ""take down scores."" His marriages collapse, his personal life is non-existant. Moreover, the robbers live an almost identical existance. They plot and plan and steal. Living for the score. This movie shows you that criminals do live by a code and cops get off on the action just as much as the cons.The real strength of this film is the great story and dialog provided by Mann. He used hours and hours of prison interviews to get ""con literate."" The result is dialog that is real and a story that is all too plausible. In fact, several bank heists were directly inspired by the events portrayed in this film. Now this is not a good thing, but does show just how on the ball Mann was in his script. **** out of ****.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
True cinematic artwork,"I can honestly say that in terms of style, this is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The way Michael Mann weaves two sides of the law together and puts in the perfect amount of action, superb performances by Pacino, DeNiro, Kilmer, Sizemore, and every one else, it is just an amazing piece of work. It is simply one of the most entertaining and satisfying movies ever put on screen.Think I'm exaggerating? Name one other movie that has been able to so stylishly film an action sequence (the bank robbery shootout) that not only is captivating and intense, but is so real in the sounds of the gunshots, the buildings of downtown LA, the routines of the policemen, the reactions of the people, and again the performances of the actors.Can this even be considered an action film? The action is so stylishly done it is Kurosawa with guns, and is so thrilling at the same time. The only other film in recent memory that has modern gunfights in such a stylish way is Ronin, but this movie has such a deep and rich plot that it far surpasses any other action movie of the last 20 years.I can say no more without repeating myself, only to say that to claim to be a movie enthusiast, actor, or the like and not see this movie (and the amazing cinematic experience that has made me a huge Michael Mann fan) is like being a sculptor and not witnessing Michelangelo's Pieta.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of Micheal Mann's best,"Micheal Mann is one of the best crime story director's who has ever lived and this is one of his best if not his best film.Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Seizmore, Wes Studi, Natalie Portman, Dian Venora, Jon Voight, etc. This movie boasts one of the best casts ever assembled and it is the first time that Pacino and De Niro, two icons of the film industry had met in a film since Godfather Two and Heat has the first scene that ever featured the two actors together. I'm not going to go into detail because I don't want to spoil it but Pacino and De Niro's scene is so incredible and yet so subtle it has quickly become one of my favorite scene's in any movie.This film not only tells the exciting cat and mouse crime story, but it also becomes a character study that bores into the lives of the Cop (Pacino) and the career criminal (De Niro) in an incredible depiction of the lives that these men chose and vow to see through to the last regardless of the burden that they must pay.It has several well done action sequences that are enough to keep anyone at the edge of their seat but again this movie is about the people, their family's, and others that they love and hurt in order to fulfill their duty.If you ever have three hours of free time make sure you see this film it will not disappoint you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
LA's finest go head to head...,"The master thief versus the master thief catcher. A classic tale of cat and mouse- continually swapping roles as the story develops. Who is hunting who? Robert De Niro is excellent as Neil McCauley- a professional criminal whose outlook on life is to ""Not become attached to something where you can't escape in 30 seconds when the heat comes 'round the corner."" But he disobeys his own law- and falls in love with a young woman in called Edie, thus, putting his priorities in jeopardy.His arch rival, Vincent Hanna, played by Al Pacino- is almost a mirror image of his counterpart. A pill-popping partner, complete with estranged husband, and dysfunctional daughter to boot. His work is his life, and often serves as an unassailable barrier between both parts of Hanna's life- restricting him from continuing a fruitful relationship.The poignant scene in this film is when both men come face to face, and vow to stop one another dead. Literally. What ensues is a deadly game of cop v robber, a high-stakes decision for both men, as to where their loyalties really lie In my humble opinion one of the most enthralling films of the mid-nineties, and a masterpiece on Michael Mann's account. Both leading men are at their best, with both acting in roles which they seem to revel in every time. A must-see by all definition! 9 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A captivating crime saga,"After developing the proof of concept with the TV movie LA Takedown, Mann takes the idea to new heights in a nearly 3 hour crime epic. Within the confines of a mainstream, big budget Hollywood movie Mann's story is told from the perspectives of a group of bank robbers, the key policeman leading the hunt, and the wives/girlfriends of some of these characters, and the impact that the men's lifestyles has on the women in their lives.Al Pacino, while playing his role a touch theatrically at times, is compelling as the flawed hero dealing with the impending disintegration of his third marriage to a highly troubled and depressed wife(Diane Venora), while at the same time taking on an emerging antagonist in the form of hardened but analytical bank robber McCauley, played brilliantly by Robert De Niro in a realistic and grounded way. However, an interesting extra twist is that while Hanna's marriage is in trouble, McCauley hardened exterior hides a fact that inwardly he is falling for a female artist Eady (empathically played by Amy Brenneman) who is nevertheless not initially aware of McCauley's 'job'. The interplays are further layered by interesting dynamics playing in the film which include the other bank robbers, notably gambling addict Chris (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd), as well as the rest of the robber 'crew', and how events in the story impact on the crew and their relationship with other criminals who the viewer comes across in the story. I was particularly taken by a small but emotionally involving subplot that involves an ex-con (Dennis Haysbert.)This layering could have severely crowded the narrative of this film, but amazingly Mann pulls it off, producing a film that carries the viewer through the many effective subplots without losing sight of the main thrust of the story, which is a showdown between DeNiro's and Pacino's characters. This is beautifully set up through the much commented upon diner scene, which works brilliantly and prepares the audience for a terrific final two acts, which includes a truly remarkable shoot out in Los Angeles, that leaves the view horrified and captivated all at once.While Mann's direction is outstanding, he is ably supported by several technical contributions, notably photographer Dante Spinotti, and the fabulous editing by Dov Hoenig, Pasquale Buba, Tom Rolf and William Goldenberg. Elliot Goldenthal's music, together with other musical collaborators, creates a fantastic mood and atmosphere for the film, rather than accentuating particular dramatic moments in the film, and is an evolution of the work both Jan Hammer and Tangerine Dream did in Thief and the Miami Vice TV series. Neil Spisak's production design, together with Mann's own attention to detail in prepping the cast, leads to great verisimilitude despite the very slickly shot action sequences, albeit the character development is still allowed to shine through, leading to the films emotionally satisfying if tragic finale.An outstanding and landmark achievement, and together with The Insider, is one of the two best films from Michael Mann.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Enthralling...and extremely overrated,"OK...I like this movie. I like Michael Mann in general. But the idea that ""Heat"" is some kind of definitive crime movie is pretty silly.It does get lots of points for being a very long movie that never really drags at all. But it would still have been much better with a half-hour (or more) cut out of it. The film school touches intended to produce an ""epic"" nearly all misfire; the VERY strong supporting cast somehow keeps several of them from turning into major LOL moments.The performances of the leads are wildly overrated by IMDb members. Pacino mugs his way through this, as he does most of his films since ""Scarface."" DeNiro is much better but nowhere near the top of his game. People always praise Val Kilmer for ""keeping up"" with these icon guys, but the reality is they aren't running all that hard to begin with. That said, Kilmer is good here, as is the entire supporting cast.Crime movies don't have to be realistic to be great (see ""Sin City"") but it's incredible how many people think Michael Mann makes ""realistic"" action films. Yeah, he's obsessed with technical details and gets them right more often than most directors. But there's just about nothing realistic about ""Heat"" or ""Collateral""; they both exist in a make-believe LA populated by make-believe good guys and bad guys. Frankly, if you think Mann's crime films are true-to-life, then everything you know comes from movies and TV and headline news.Don't get me wrong here; I highly recommend you see ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"" - they are both extremely well-made and pretty damn riveting.

Classic! Why no Oscar nominations for Al and Bob?,"One of the finest crime thrillers of the last ten years. Heat boasts an all star cast, some exceptional cinematography, sound and acting. The film has gone for realism in the action department and what you get is some brilliant action sequences, there's no diving through the air in slow motion with doves appearing from nowhere, its more involving on a realism level like Saving Private Ryan was to war movies. The post bank heist shootout is outstanding.The plot is based around Pacino's character Vincent, a cop and Neil played by Bob De Niro, who is a criminal genius. Both are similar in that their careers are their life. They feel isolated because of the dedication required to being the best of the breed in their chosen profession. Neil and his team want to pull off one last big heist and Pacino's character wants to stop him. Simple. The scripts excellence is that this is an exceptional character movie. The film has so many interestingly written and well played supporting characters, combining with the lead characters.The film has flawless acting from everyone. Pacino and De Niro are both on Oscar worthy form with neither quite managing to steal the others thunder. Val Kilmer has rarely been as watchable and Tom Sizemore is also in great form as was Kevin Gage as Waingro. Diane Venora is very good as Pacino's long suffering third wife. Also Amy Brenneman as De Niro's love interest is very good. There are some great scenes in this movie. De Niro and Pacino sharing the screen for the first time in the cafe scene was legendary, it is one of my favourite scenes in a movie ever, and the end was touching. The last scene between Val Kilmer and his wife was good as was the parting of Neil and Eedy. Also Natalie Portman followed her brilliant performance in Leon with another great showing here.Overall this is a movie that has classic written all over it. The most interesting supporting cast ever and also excellence in direction, acting and the music. This film should have had more Oscar recognition. Pacino and De Niro are both worthy of Oscar nominations but there wasn't really enough room for both of them and you couldn't nominate one and not the other. This is one of my favourite movies ever, at nearly 3 hours it never bores and holds your attention from minute one to the thrilling climax. It is a tale of obsession, solitude and mutual respect.

Haunting portrait of sacrifices made on the altar of success,"A fascinating portrait of two obsessed careerists and their neglected loved ones in a world of high-stakes crime.  Robert De Niro plays a brilliant thief and Al Pacino plays an equally clever detective out to track him down. Both men are highly principled and protective of their crew, but each is addicted to their chosen professions to the point that nothing is allowed to get in the way.  Michael Mann delineates the alienation felt by the detective's family and the thief's girlfriend in scintillating dialogue and rich performances.   The overall effect is haunting and stayed with me many hours after the film was over.  Quite separate from the cops and robbers story, it reflects our modern age of success-at-all-costs and tallies the damage left behind in broken lives.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

(I know they did the second ""Godfather"" film, but they were in two parallel, contrasting stories.)Before becoming geriatrics, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were juggernauts; the top actors in the world who could be as picky and choosy as they wanted. Now that they are much older, parts are more limited. But in the 1990s when they were middle-aged, no one could stop them. So placing them as enemies on opposite sides of the law was something bound to happen. Despite Al Pacino playing the honest cop and and Robert De Niro playing the career thief, their performances under Michael Mann's direction made the feud as divided as, say, Hulk Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior.At the surface, ""Heat"" has a very simple concept: cops & robbers. Pacino is the cop and De Niro is the robber. Pacino's team consists of such guys as Wes Studi and Mykelti Williamson, while De Niro has such men as Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore. When De Niro recruits a man named Waingro who has fun killing, things get turned upside down and he tries to sell out De Niro and his crew.When Pacino and his crew draw closer to De Niro, there is an unforgettable scene where he pulls him over on the freeway and they have a cup of coffee and discuss their lives. The first time they have appeared onscreen together, the scene in great. Not only is it a cop and robber talking like regular guys, it could also be looked at like two arch rivals in acting.Some time after this scene, there is a robbery that leads to a street war between these two factions. The robbery itself is short and sweet, but the massive gunplay is nothing short of astonishing. There are some gunfights sporadic in the film, but this is where it explodes into an all-out war. Michael Mann used more of echo sounds in the shootings to make it more real. He succeeds in that and it leads to a major jolt in the viewer. Without the innovative sound, the scene still would have been great, but not a mind-blow. You can't talk about ""Heat"" without talking about this action scene.""Heat"" features lots of characters and several subplots. Each are developed to the max, making them relatable and sympathetic including the bad guys. Mann tries to make it Shakespearean by giving the fullest backstories possible to almost everyone that run in similar fashion. That is where the movie gains a flaw that may turn some people off: it is too long. The Los Angeles jungle is an excellent setting and the characters are all captivating, but they just drag on a little too long. At almost three hours, thirty minutes could easily be shipped and the movie would have been better.But that is just a minor flaw in an otherwise great film. The movie being too long is not bad enough where I don't give it a perfect score. Some of the best films ever made have noticeable flaws. This is one of them.4/4.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Disappoints in the end,"This movie conditions the viewer to think of extreme craftsmanship and meticulousness in its scenario and dialogue. This comes from the perfection De Niro's character portrays, and the success of the heists. You start to think the movie is perfect, it's genius, maybe too smart for you to comprehend.THEN, it disappoints you with the last 10 mins, throwing away everything you appreciated right in the garbage. The chase in the end is absolutely ridiculous. How could Al Pacino catch up? Why did he go by himself? What's the deal with the shotgun switch then pulling out a gun again? After this scene, the movie appears to be mediocre. Maybe it's not so genius, but only appeared to be... Maybe there's a ton of inconsistencies I couldn't spot...

Fooling some of the people all of the time......,"I lasted about 90 minutes before turning off this nonsense.What had the makings of a decent cops and robbers film is totally ruined by too much talking, multiple sub plots, and a storyline I was unable to follow.It really ought to be perfectly possible with a decent cast to give us a semi believable and exciting story about robbers being pursued by cops, right? Wrong: What we get is being exposed to the exceedingly soap opera-ish private life of some of the main characters in this film. Boring, boring boring. This movie bears little resemblance to real life and is unrealistic. The picture goes on far too long. I would think it runs into thousands the times we get films about policemen who have families who resent the irregular hours the cop works and the difficulties their jobs cause to their home life etc etc and blah, blah, blah. Who cares.....as most people watch movies to be entertained and not to have to be tortured in viewing the tedious domestic lives of others. Incidentally: A good way to know if a movie is worth watching is to see what the critic Roger Ebert says about it. As a general rule if he raves over a film, then usually it ain't worth seeing. If he says its' not his taste, then take a look!1/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
bravo Mann - this was a good 'un,"frankly, I believe that some of you have it out for one of the most entertaining movies of all time. Mann is a cinematic legend to engender our sympathy for McCauley and passion for Hanna. ""we ran with the bulls"".Outstanding imaginative content and cinematic deliverance from ""method acting"" driving a cognitive approach to acting and character portrayal. remember that street shootout? has there ever been 15 minutes - or so - as entertaining in movie history? the first time I watched the movie - about 10 years ago - i was with a friend and we were both interested in the storage cupboard that was left unlocked inside the cinema and every few minutes during the start of the movie we would pay a visit to the store but once we started getting into the movie all the sweets and chocolates in the world could not distract us from fixing our gaze - hypnotically - upon the unfolding action.the shootout was amazing. no music needed and none used. no other manipulative medium needed other than the the visual stimulation and sound of the sheer violence unfolding (no, I'm no fan of violence - per se - either but did grow up hearing gunfire regularly) few films could claim cinematography as entertaining - in my opinion. I was at the edge of my seat and had sweaty palms until I left the cinema - if i remember correctly.all those who submitted ones and twos must have voted tens for movies like titanic huh?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Masterpiece,"Michael Mamn has been a expert cinematographer for years and has produced his share of great movies, but this is his Masterpiece.Where to start with this great movie?The opening sequence on its own is a great example of this mastery: cutting from scene to scene as Neal exits the subway and walks down the platform to an escalator and then through the hospital and to the ambulance, the angles are just so unique and unparalleled in its inventiveness. Mann finds ways to see the world in ways that went against convention by showing the same scene from a totally different perspective.DeNiro and Pacino put in tour de force performances which was noteworthy because at the time it was the first time they had been on the same screen since The Godfather, and because at the time critics felt they had not been in a movie of this magnitude for some time. This answered those calls resoundingly.The dialog is minimal but impactful and even at just under 3 hours the movie does not drag on. The gunfight scene after the bank is in my opinion the best that has ever been done.Heat is my favorite movie of all time and has remained as such since it was released. And to top it off, the music is great.I won't spoil it, but scene before end credits? EPIC",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Michael Manns Masterpiece,"If I can only recommend one movie to watch, Heat would be it.This movie has it all.Top notch acting from stars and future stars to be.

stylish action meets intelligent script and textured characters,"Heat is not just a film about good vs evil. It is so much more than that, anything else would be an insult to the viewer. The lines are blurred here, yet the course laid out in front of the viewer is crystal clear. We know a showdown is imminent, but it's the journey through the various sub plots of this film that make it worth the almost 3 hour length. Some have criticized the ending as being anti-climatic, or a sell out. I couldn't disagree more. I believe that was the point of the ending, to tie together the main theme of the plot. The characters live up to there billing throughout the film, including it's ending. 10/10 for one of the best movies of it's genre ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Wholly original and fascinating post-modernism,"Michael Mann's Heat is truly a perfect movie. The acting, screenplay, cinematography, editing, and musical score tie the movie in together creating a movie experience unlike any other. The complex interdependence of the character's lives gives the movie realism and meaning to the post-modern audience. The script is taut and acute creating tension paralleled in a beautifully tragic and violent epic tale. Each time I re-watch the movie I feel I gain a deeper glimpse into the character's lives. The catch to this movie is understanding that in the post-modern universe no one is essentially in control. Here is the tragic irony because each character goes to great and costly lengths to maintain control however fails to keep it. Loneliness is a very deep and reoccurring theme that menacingly unnerves the characters and the audience alike. L.A. is a perfect setting because of the complexity of her society: economic, social, and political. Two top actors at the top of their careers giving a top performance. Essentially, there is no way further up except down and there is the beauty of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Timeless Masterpiece,"A brilliant epic crime drama about a criminal played by Robert Deniro who is pursued by a cop played by Al Pacino. This is a multi layered film which can be appreciated on many levels and has so many deep themes. One of the common themes found that most people point out is the similarity between the lives of the criminal and cop. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. The main message that I got from this film is how life is full of choices and how every choice sacrifices something else. You might get a different message. This film sparks a lot of real emotion and the ending will surely bring tears to your eyes. In my opinion it's just as great as Godfather and it's a strong mystery at how it was overlooked at Oscars and is probably a perfect example that Oscars mean nothing. Lastly this is not just a masterpiece of storytelling but also a technical masterpiece and the sound effects and action scenes are spectacular especially highlighted by a famous street shootout scene. Lately many movies like Departed, American Gangster, Dark Knight were clearly influenced by this film but they are much inferior. Heat is a true classic. 10/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good but not fantastic,"This ""De Niro Vs Pacino"" showdown could never possibly live up to the the hype surrounding such a movie. And this is basically the problem. For huge De Niro and Pacino fans (such as me) the two of them on screen together could never meet my expectations.This cops'n robbers movie feels like less than the some of it's parts. There is a slow, almost romantic, feel to the movie. Pacino's performance feels tired. De Niro looks uncomfortable with the two of them on screen together and even a little intimidated by the prospect. I think Michael Mann must have had a hard time deciding who would play the cop and who would play the robber. Watch the film and find out.The rest of the cast includes Jon Voight, who's character is supposed to be some sort of sleazy criminal master mind. Voight however looks extremely old and you get the feeling the director just wanted another big name to place on the poster. Val Kilmer's performance is surprisingly good, considering the titans he's sharing the screen with. You immediately feel sympathy for him.It is however a little-known actor (in comparison) by the name of Dennis Haysbert who steals the scene with the few minutes he has on screen. He plays an ex-con who's decided to go straight and is heavily supported by his wife. There is a scene between them that brought a tear to my eye when she tells him she's proud of him and doesn't understand why.What Michael Mann does get right is the depth of the characters. Each character's life is explored in every area. The effects of their chosen profession on their personal lives is a central theme. As a result you feel sorry for both criminals and cops alike. All characters are shown with flaws, even the good guys.The problem with pitching Pacino against De Niro is that one of them has to win. Throughout the movie I hoped that both would. You'll have to see the film to find out.All in all, I really hope that Pacino and De Niro team up again on screen, although it's probably unlikely. If this is to be the only movie where they share on-screen time then it's a disappointment.Conclusion: If it wasn't for the cast, this film would have gone straight to video. It is a fine piece of work but not fitting for kings of Hollywood.I recommend watching it if you're die hard fans of Pacino and De Niro. If not, then it's just another Cops'n robbers movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Excellent Masterpiece,"""Heat"" is one of the best example of a cinema cult in action genre. Probably the movie has the most impressive cast ever in any film. Al pacino, Robert de Niro, Val Kilmer, even nobody pay attention Natalie Portman. Although its duration, nearly three hours, audience cannot notice how the time is flowing while watching the movie. Robert de Niro, as Neil McCauley, seems a different kind of criminal that can be relatable with ""Carlito Brigante"". Both want to get rid of this life similarly for a woman. Even there is another similarity, both are so close the point they would like to reach but something occurs regarding their past.The name of movie exactly represents its story flow. There are always increase in heat and in the final scene we can easily feel that tension. Final scene is a masterpiece that must be spoken especially. I want to thank two great actor, Al Pacino and De Niro, for this movie. I wish I were the one who has seen the movie for the first time at the age I have right now. If you are one of those who have concern about watching the movie, I strongly suggest watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Long, long, long","""Heat"" was recommended to me for its supposedly original and fascinating storyline. However, just having spent 3 hours of my life watching the DVD, I'm somewhat surprised to report that story & characters are by far the weakest link in the movie. Like other reviewers have reported, the film is overly long, mainly because Michael Mann tries to cram way too much subplots in, none of which work since the characters are all tragically generic, the women especially. Also - and I always hate it when scripts do this - much is made of the supposed cleverness and intelligence of the Pacino and De Niro characters. So why do they make one stupid decision after the other? Aaah, that's probably what their mutual attraction is all about, punctuated by a terribly boring coffee scene and culminating in a hysterical manly handshake before the credits roll.Anyway, see this movie for the great sound, hardcore action and, probably, if you like Pacino and De Niro.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
More than a crime drama,"There are rare occurrences that elevate a director, into a great director. This can be seen in ""Taxi Driver"" by Martin Scorsese, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" by Steven Spielberg and ""Magnolia"" by Paul Thomas Anderson. These are movies in which people begin to realize the true talent that these directors have in making their films.Watching ""Heat"" for the first time years ago it was obvious that this film had more then what you would expect from a crime drama, but it's only after a couple viewing that you can begin to really appreciate what this movie has to offer. Which is the experience of watching the world that cops and robbers live in.When this was first released it was promoted strongly on the fact that it was going to be the first movie where Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro were going to share screen time (I'm aware they were in Godfather Part II together but they didn't have any scenes together in that). After all the promotion of this some people were disappointed to have to wait for more then have the movie for them to have a scene together, but honestly I preferred it the way it is. There are far to many movies that have cops and robbers sharing numerous scenes together and after so many it's just hard to believe that it's real. In this they share a couple scenes and only one real conversation which is perhaps the best scene of the movie.The plot of the movie is something that you've heard before, where the movie flourishes and excels beyond the commonality of these sorts of movies is in the dialogue and emotional input that is put into each scene. There is really no scene that seems ""scripted"" or ""fake"". There are certain points in the movie where DeNiro pauses for a moment as if he's trying to think of what to say in that situation instead of just regurgitating what the screenplay tells him to say. This is one of those extremely rare films where you can literally see no one else in any of the roles that are cast, it's easy to tell that they went into real casting calls and picked the best person for each and every role.Even with all the beautiful dialogue and conversations that go on throughout the film, I have always been and will always be a fan of the silent parts where we all know what's going on and the director has enough faith in the audience not to insult our intelligence by dumbing down any of these parts at all. There is one particular scene between Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene Shiherlis (Ashley Judd) that is perhaps of the best examples of this. Instead of words there is music in the back round of this scene that gives away the emotional feelings that are occurring during this scene. There is another scene involving Lt. Vincent Hanna's (Al Pacino) stepdaughter (Natalie Portman) that is along the same lines and is another one of those unforgettable scenes that lesser movies would not even bother to incorporate.There is everything right about this movie, there have been movies which after a couple viewings they begin to lose their enjoyment. This is not one of those, this is one of the rare movies that will end up being a classic crime drama along the same lines as ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Key Largo"".It's hard these days to find anything with the same kind of impact as the older crime dramas but that just might have to do with the less and less attention that writers are giving to the characters in these sorts of movies since their target audience it seems doesn't want to be intrigued by complex plot points, they just want to see stuff blow up and cars chasing each other around the block for half an hour. However when a movie like this comes along it's hard not to appreciate it's courage in taking a kind of movie like this and elevating it to greatness.""Heat"" is Michael Mann's masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Inevitable Joy,"I hated this picture when I first saw it in a theater, hated it again on video when I was trying to like it, then saw it on cable one night when there was nothing good on (!) and fell in love - all the family background that I once hated finally clicked for me. That, and the length it adds, may be what turns some people off, including several of my friends. (That and feeling that Pacino is over the top here, which I have also learned to love - he's the last romantic left in acting.) In the end, there is no denying that Heat is a 10 out of 10 in these times in film, maybe better than The Departed, if not as culturally relevant as Goodfellas. Miami Vice fails because Mann did common themes of that film and Heat already in Collateral, and with more detachment than in Heat - so by the time he washed out in Miami Vice, passion (or ""heat"") had drained, and Farrell and Foxx had nothing to replace it with. I hope Mann makes one as good as Heat again, and collects an Oscar like Marty. Where he'll get the talent, I don't know.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Crime Thriller with Heart and Brains,"Agree with all the other comments about its greatness, this might be my favorite film ever. But aside from that I'd just like to offer a comment that I didn't immediately come across in my perusal of the others, but one that seems pretty obvious to me upon viewing this movie recently for the 5th time: above all this is a movie about meaningful human connection.****SPOILERS**** Is there any scene in the movie that doesn't pertain to this theme? You have the domestic scenes with Pacino, his wife and their daughter which are the most obvious. The woman just wants some attention from Pacino and because she doesn't get it, gets too stoned on prozac to realize her daughter is desperate for the same love. None of them can even have real meaningful conversations. The same goes with Kilmer and Judd. DeNiro is missing a connection of this sort and only now beginning to realize it, evident in the dinner-celebration scene in which he calls Edie. Edie herself is a naive and sincere midwesterner getting eaten alive by the disconnect running rampant in L.A. She's starved for some sort of meaningful interaction which makes her primed for even a dysfunctional relationship, one that she finds with McCauley.Even the smallest scenes run rampant with this theme. You have Tom Sizemore with his apparent bimbo, a ""relationship"" that he's willing to sacrifice in the end probably because there's nothing real about it. He receives his due. There are the 2 or 3 scenes with the new-guy driver and his girl, which seem superfluous until the part where DeNiro approaches him in the diner and the viewer can witness exactly the torture that this character is going through as he sacrifices the one good thing in his life.The end only makes sense when viewed through the lens of human connection. Otherwise the lingering shots on Edie as her heart is broken mean nothing, nor the pained indecision on Deniro's face as he has to drop everything in 30 seconds. The hand clasp at the end, is both characters' fulfillment of this need for a true companion. They are, after all, the two most similar characters in the entire movie, the only true compatriots, two men who sacrificed everything that matters to satisfy the needs of their careers. Goddamn this is a good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Well-acted, but slow and stupid","Michael Mann makes great movies (THIEF, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS) and not-so-great movies (MANHUNTER).  HEAT falls into the latter.  Boasting one extraordinary performance (Robert DeNiro), three terrific ones (Al Pacino, Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman) and one very good one (Ashley Judd), HEAT is, unfortunately, Mann's most poorly paced film.  Much of the problem lay with the stupid script.  The writers would have us believe the ""best"" armed robbery team in America would meet in a public restraunt after a multimillion dollar robbery at which guards were murdered, and the leader would exact his frustrations on a team member whom ""screwed up"".  We are to believe that DeNiro would ""cap"" a ""screw up"" on a public street, when he could have ""done"" him in an isolated location. We would believe that an experienced fence would order the ""hit"" on DeNiro without researching his team, when DeNiro knows where the fence ""lives?""  We would believe that DeNiro would keep the team together after the ""screw up"" escapes, rather than having them disban, track the guy down and ""tie up loose ends?""

To have Pacino and De Niro in a film was to be the event of the decade, but for me it turned out to be a little dissappointing. I blame the script, mainly. Perhaps the producers and director were more concerned with the action scenes instead of building the drama and give these actors enough range to work with.
Val Kilmer participation was a waste of talent. They could have given the part to somebody else and it wouldn't have made any difference. Perhaps Kilmer pushed for the role in order to share a movie with these two legends, but i don't know. It still puzzles me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I have had reason to think about it many times since I first saw this movie. (Though fortunately I have had no reason to act on it, yet.)For sure, there are other good things about the movie. There are the action scenes, some of which have a connection to the ""30 seconds flat"" message. Wrapped around that, there is the drama; depending on taste, 3 hours of it might be too long, but it felt just right for me.On the negative side, it is hard to sympathize with any of the characters -- but is that really a negative? maybe it is better to watch the movie with detachment.What makes this movie great is that it all comes together: the plot; the action scenes; and the message that, just possibly, you might have to give up on anything you hold dear: not just for your own good, but also for the good of the very people you hold dear.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It is a truly epic film, not just in terms of its length but also its brilliantly constructed plot and complex characters. 'Heat' has you hooked from the start and the action-sequences, visuals, and all-round absorbing plot holds your attention throughout.DeNiro and Al Pacino are two actors at the top of their game in this film and both deliver outstanding performances and real personality to their characters.

Humanity conveyed to film.,"The significance of Heat is not that it boasts, perhaps, the greatest shoot-out scene of all time, or that it was a big budget film with top quality effects, or that it had big name actors.  The significance of this film is in the original script written by Micheal Mann.  The characters are REAL people, not some exaggerated freaks or stereotypical one dimensional types.  The characters have good qualities, bad qualities, they do good things, bad things, and have flaws that we, as people in the REAL world, can relate to.  They do not suddenly change, but at the same time are dynamic in subtle ways.  They have distinctive characteristics which define who they are.  The nature of each is responsible for the best in each of them and is the source of their flaws.  These are flaws, which at the end of the day, cause them misery and are responsible for their self-destruction.If you are tired of artsy, critic acclaimed movies in which you could absolutely never relate to the characters, then its time for HEAT. HEAT will give you characters that are REAL people, in a REAL environment and setting, with REAL problems, that result in REAL outcomes and circumstances.  Michael Mann finally shows us a depiction of humanity that we can relate to and that is the UNREAL power of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A fitting rendez-vous for two titans of cinema,"This film is exceptional. Almost all crime films are biased in their portrayal of cops vs robbers. If the cop is the main character, the criminals are snatching babies or just generally being evil and *incompetent*. If the bad guys are the main characters, it's a horror movie. Finally, this is a movie where both sides are experts and they're both like-able. As such, I never knew which way the film was going to end.Both sides have just as much likelihood to win in the end and I could realistically get behind either side. This film kept me on the edge and seemed so much more realistic about the criminals. They weren't just bad guys for the sake of it.

I am a huge fan of Micheal Mann,"Okay, I have to preface this by telling you I am a huge fan of Micheal Mann, so if my praise for the man seems a bit over the top, you know why. Al Pacino has figured prominently in many of my reviews, so no surprise he delivers another stellar performance in this epic that reunites his with his Godfather II costar, Robert De Niro, who also delivers in his best ""tough guy"" style. The cast list above may seem a little long, but it could be longer, since there are a few other superb actors in the film, such as Martin Ferrero, Henry Rollins, Hank Azaria, and Jeremy Piven. The list above represents a powerhouse of a cast, though. Ferrero and Noonan have worked with Mann many times before, and I would imagine their inclusion represents a strong suggestion on Mann's part, but they both perform their roles well. This is one of those films where we see the entire canvas, not just one or two parts of the painting. We discover what drives these men, and their women. The settings are perfect, the photography Oscar worthy, and in spite of a run time of just over 2 hours, keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat. Lots of gun play and bad language, a few scenes of with implied sex, so no need to watch this when the kids are up and about. Definitely a collectible, one you will love to watch over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very good,"One of very best in my opinion. The plot, actors, the way that the movie goes is almost excellent for me.

I recommend to watch when you want a good thriller with actors and perfect plot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Where There Is Heat There Is Always Fire.,"I started writing movie reviews for this site nearly four years ago. During that time I have written information about over 1,200 movies. Constantly I get messages, good and bad, about my reviews. Sometimes individuals point out errors I have made in terms of something I mis-wrote and I go back and correct those mistakes. Others demand changes to be made in my criticisms and those requests always fall on deaf ears. I wrote a review for ""Heat"" back in the summer of 2000 and gave it 4 stars out of 5. I liked the movie, but looking back my review was not entirely correct. Surprisingly not one person has ever written to me about my review of this picture (no praise and no criticism). What I want to write today is something that has been bothering me for quite some time when it comes to this movie. I did not reward ""Heat"" with as much praise, respect and fondness that I should have. Honestly I think I was not the movie-reviewer I was in 2000 that I am now. I feel I have grown up to an extent and that I must correct the mistake I made in regard to this picture. ""Heat"" is one of the most brilliant, captivating, sophisticated, intelligent, honest, emotional and powerfully-moving experiences I have ever had when it comes to the cinema. In modern day Los Angeles a career criminal (Robert DeNiro) and his gang (which includes Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and Danny Trejo) go around the city and create destruction and chaos early on by robbing an armored car. Immediately police detective Al Pacino and fellow cops Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi and Ted Levine (among others) get involved in the case. Quickly it is very clear that the thieves are skilled, skilled beyond anything Pacino has ever seen before. Soon a bank heist of more than $10 million is hatched by DeNiro and his gang with help from others like Tom Noonan, William Fichtner and Jon Voight. DeNiro and company though are struggling outside of their work. Kilmer's gambling problem over-shadows his illegal work and wife Ashley Judd turns away from a marriage that is being ruined because of his terrible addiction. DeNiro meanwhile suffers from loneliness and isolation. He has been dealt a poor hand in life, but amazingly he finds love with librarian Amy Brenneman (""Judging Amy"" fame). On the good side of the law Pacino is on his third marriage. This time he is with pot-smoking wife Diane Venora. Pacino's obsession with his work has created an island between himself and his wife and his private life is a jumbled mess because of it. Adolescent step-daughter Natalie Portman suffers herself from an unstable home-life (her real father is nowhere to be found) and begins to question why nothing is going the way she would like. A very fine invisible line is drawn to show the similarities and contrasts in the lives of Pacino and DeNiro. Their personal lives are wrecks for the most part, but when they are doing what they were born to do (policing for Pacino and thieving for DeNiro) they are much like mythical gods. Many characters come and go throughout the course of the picture and a few side-stories take place, but in the end ""Heat"" is about one of the best relationships I have ever seen in a motion picture. It is a brotherhood-styled relationship between Pacino and DeNiro that is mysterious, complex, legendary and definitely thought-provoking. The picture runs right at 180 minutes and the two all-world performers share only about seven or eight minutes of screen-time, but their time together are some of the very best moments I have ever been lucky enough to experience in motion pictures. About half-way through the film the two meet for coffee in a busy cafe. To a stranger in the restaurant they could be friends or even brothers. What no one except the audience knows is that the two are mortal enemies because of their God-given skills. They do not yell, they do not fight, they do not ever raise their voices. Instead they chat and they get to know each other, they realize that the other is suffering outside of his work and they both learn to humanize one another. They share backgrounds (which they both basically know about each other anyway) and then they share dreams and fears. It is very clear that the duo hate their lives and make up for that empty feeling they both have by immersing themselves in their work. You hope they will actually come away friends from this conversation, but sometimes that just cannot be. Men like these two cannot change. They both act like they cannot stand the heat in their lives but in actuality they must have it in order to survive and function. Pacino and DeNiro admit that under different circumstances they likely could have been friends, but in their topsy-turvy existences that just cannot be. Maybe they won't ever see each other again, but then again maybe they will. Whether they see one another again is not really the point. The point is who you are and what you do ultimately dictates your life. These two are knights in a chess match of words, strategy, territory and ultimately emotional connections. Pacino is a great cop because he can think like a criminal and DeNiro is a great criminal because he has the intelligence to see things like a cop would see them. ""Heat"" is all about the roll of the dice in each person's life. Under many circumstances Pacino and DeNiro would be brothers, men who would stand beside one another and fight for the other until the bitter end. However the roll of dice here has come up snake eyes. Both have hardships and both have emotional scars that are literally tearing them up inside, but they do not let that get them down to the point where they cannot do their jobs. Instead they do what they were meant to do and do those jobs to the very best of their ability. The only question is how will these two experts do when they possibly meet again and which will make the potentially fatal mistake that will change the entire landscape of the film. ""Heat"" is a film that I really did not get as well as I should have when I first saw it, but as time passes I see the unquestioned brilliance this picture possesses. Really the whole movie becomes a microcosm when Dennis Haysbert (of ""24"" fame) comes into the picture for the first time. Many have wondered what the point of his character is. The point of Haysbert's character is that you are what you are and you cannot always change that. He has been recently released from prison, but assigned a terrible job as a cook at a small restaurant with a sadistic and cold boss (the uncredited Bud Cort). He wants to do right and make it in life honestly, but it is clear that just cannot be the way it is. An opportunity to work with DeNiro leads to a situation that may be predictable, but is also chillingly dramatic and highly nerve-racking. Writer/director Michael Mann had supposedly been working on ""Heat"" as a television movie back in the late-1980s. His work on the very impressive television show giant ""Miami Vice"" had endeared him to many in Hollywood. However ""Heat"" was stuck in limbo because honestly no one really knew what to make of Mann's vision. The big screen is the only place this would have worked well. In my earlier review I stated that ""Heat"" could have been the film of the decade. Looking back I am not sure that this was not the finest picture of the 1990s. Everything is perfect here. Dante Spinotti's cinematography gives Los Angeles a glossy and slick look throughout. The City of Angels has never looked better on celluloid. The very memorable musical score (primarily by Elliot Goldenthal) continues to be quite possibly the finest soundtrack I have ever encountered (Moby's instrumental ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" is one of those tunes that has just glued itself to my soul). I believe ""Heat"" is a movie that should be studied, embraced, cherished and remembered by all those who realize that movies can create thoughts and emotions within us that nothing else on Earth can. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
kinda over-rated,"Is there anyone else who thinks this movie is over-rated? Yes, the crime sequences are memorable and done with skill, but the domestic scenes are painfully bad, not to mention entirely unnecessary. Every time either Ashley Judd or Natalie Portman enters the picture, the story just grinds to a halt. And while Michael Mann may have a keen visual sense, he can't write dialogue to save his life (not unlike George Lucas). And the characters? What characters? The criminals, in particular, are devoid of personalities. If someone asked you to give a brief description of Deniro's character, or Kilmer's, or Trejo's, what would you say? At the end of the film I never felt that I got to know any of them in even the slightest way. Eliminate the domestic scenes, infuse the characters (the criminals especially) with some personality, and you've got a great film. As it stands, though, ""Heat"" is a mediocre film with some great scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Pretty good but way way too long,"Robert de Niro is smart tough guy who heads a team of highly skilled robbers and Pacino is the smart tough cop who tries to catch him.

All the leading players have wives/girlfriends who want them to settle down and be there for them all the time blah blah blah. Way too much senseless chatter in what should be a taut crime flik.I'm not a big de niro fan but here i liked him. He plays a truly tough guy who can kill with the best of them but only when necessary. The Pacino character didn't work for me cause of the way he bullied everyone around in this film.

One of Micheal Manns greatest stories PERIOD,"Heat, one of my personal favorites is a powerhouse of emotion and is a haunting and beautiful crime saga. when people first see the film, Mann fans expect them to talk about the heist and that what happens. besides the robbery being one of the greatest heist scenes in American cinema history, everything surrounding that is twice as great. First the story,a group of professional thieves are forced to pull a big one after the last job went stale. Apart from them, the cops who are tracking them are on the constant move when their thieves make a move. Second, the character build up is by far the deepest of any movie I've seen. Al Pacino plays a detective who is struggling to keep his work out of his personal life. Robert De Niro is a thief who plays the cool and composed professional but yet is isolated from everyone else. The movie's final comedown is simply beautiful and brings a tear to my eye as Al Pacino grips his dying enemy's hand as they realize that they are not so different after all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Timeless Film,"Enough just can't be said about this movie. Heat is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's a nearly three hour crime epic that simultaneously leaves you wanting more and makes you feel completely satisfied. There is really nothing about this film that isn't perfection. The story unfolds beautifully, never dragging. The characters all feel fleshed out, and the actions of every character effect the stories of every other character. On top of this the performances are all as great as you'd expect from a cast like this one. The dialogue is cool, fast, and entertaining without falling into the trap of needing constant one-liners or jokes to keep the audience engaged. It'd be a sin not to mention the score which features everything from rock, to electronic, to classical, to choir. All of it beautiful and minimalistic. As far as the technical aspects go, well, it's a Michael Mann crime thriller. Every scene is shot and lit to perfection. Mann's style is so distinct because of how his films manage to be incredibly stylized and realistic at the same time. No eccentric camera movements, no cool editing tricks, and no cute transitions. Just perfectly executed storytelling. Heat is an absolutely timeless film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A terrific must-see,"Gritty and realistic, with superb turn-outs by all involved.  I couldn't take my eyes off Ashley Judd (as Christine Sheherlis), and not just for her looks.

DeNiro and Pacino are their usual (if predictable) best, but the surprise is Val Kilmer, playing his role with fine subtlety.  If they ever devise retroactive Oscars for casting, then let Bonnie Timmermann be the first recipient.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

There are people who say that de niro and pacino did not do their best but actually, they did excellent performances: Especially de niro showed a magnificent example of understated acting: You just look into his eyes and you know whats going on.

"Mann Delivers Real ""Heat""","Two men, each a consummate professional in his respective field-- but on opposite sides of the law-- become adversaries in a high-stakes cat and mouse game from which only one can emerge victorious, in the action/drama `Heat,' directed by Michael Mann and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Neil McCauley (De Niro) is a professional criminal who makes his living by `Taking down scores;' it's all he knows, and what he does best.  Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a Detective with the L.A.P.D. whose main reason for `being' is to stop guys like McCauley from doing what they do best.  It's what `he' does best.  And when circumstances put them together on the same playing field, it becomes a battle of wits and tenacity, a matter of who will outwit whom and when; for each man is adamant in intent, and it becomes clear early on that neither will ever acquiesce, withdraw or concede the game to his opponent.  McCauley lives by a code that allows him to walk away if he knows the heat is around the corner, but only to another space on the same board; and Hanna owns the board.  What follows is an intense study in the dynamics of uncompromising conviction; and the tension begins with the opening sequence and continues to build throughout the film, right up to the very end. 	In McCauley, De Niro has created a character that is more than just a bit disconcerting; a hardened criminal, ready to kill-- indiscriminately-- at the drop of a hat, anyone who gets in his way, but with an outward appearance that belies his true nature.  This guy is anybody's next door neighbor; the software salesman or the manager of the local A&P who would blend in with the crowd anywhere because he is so nondescript.  A man whose life is a ruse, hiding his psychotic, sociopathic instincts behind a facade of normalcy.  And De Niro plays him with such integrity that it makes him one of the more terrifying characters he's ever brought to the screen, not because of what he seems to be, but because of what you know he is capable of.  His portrayal of Max Cady in `Cape Fear' was, by comparison, the outward expression of what McCauley is underneath, and which he conceals so well; With Cady at least you could discern the evil of the man just by looking at him-- a man the likes of which you would cross the street to avoid if you saw him coming.  McCauley is the one you would invite in, never suspecting the truth.  And that is what makes him such a powerful character. 		Pacino's Hanna, on the other hand, is the exact opposite.  He's boisterous, loud, and in all ways larger than life; he swaggers and intimidates.  And why?  Because it gets results. The manner he affects gives him the presence he needs to ferret out the criminal element and to keep them in line; if someone chooses to play in his court, they're going to know he's there, and he's not going to let them forget it.  It's his turf, his rules, end of story.  It's a purposefully over-the-top performance, because that's who Hanna is, or at least that's the face he puts on for the job. Underneath he's just a man looking for a little peace in his life, a part of his own personal puzzle that has so far eluded him, in no small part due to the dedication he brings to his work.  The necessity of dealing with reality at the level he must day in and day out is simply not conducive with the ability to leave the job at the door when the shift is over.  For a man like Hanna, the shift is never over.  And the fact that McCauley-- at the other end of the spectrum-- is made of the same cloth, is what gives this film such explosive intensity. 	The exemplary supporting cast includes Val Kilmer (Chris), Jon Voight (Nate), Tom Sizemore (Michael), Diane Venora (Justine Hanna), Amy Brenneman (Eady), Ashley Judd (Charlene), Natalie Portman (Lauren), Hank Azaria (Alan) and Kevin Gage (Waingro).  `Heat' is a hard-hitting, memorable film, impeccably directed and delivered by Mann; an entertaining and action-packed character study with an adrenaline rush that never lets you off the hook for a moment.  And how great to see De Niro and Pacino together; that alone is worth the price of admission.  If you're ready for some excitement, check this one out; it'll take you to the edge and keep you there, and by the time it's over you'll be ready for more of the same-- and that is what movies are all about.  That is the magic.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fight of two character men,"An interesting thriller, it has two good ingredients, acting of excellent Italo-American actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. It is delightful to see both ""Mafia- Godfather"" actors together. Here Pacino is a policeman while De Niro is a thief. The director, Michael Mann did very well when he left enough spaces for each of them in his own role to show his problems and feelings. Pacino is tough, but with good feelings, obviously always with the obsession to capture any guilty man, in this case De Niro, no matter how and when. De Niro is a criminal, but not a vulgar one, he has some literacy and is able to love a beautiful lady. The best scene of the film is the direct dialogue Pacino- De Niro had in a cafeteria and how both politely explain their intentions. The end of the film is a bit bias, nobody will try to make justice if he/she knows that police is behind you. These last scenes remind me a bit the Western films, with a duel where the good kills the bad one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Warning: This movie will be about an hour too long.,"While this isn't a horrible film; it doesn't belong in the top 250. First of all: it's long. Way to long. It felt like I was actually sitting there for three hours. Good movies will draw you in and let you forget about time during the running length. This movie wasn't good enough to do that. Did they really need all those scenes about Hanna's home life and poor marriage? No. Likewise, was all the screen time with McCauley and his girlfriend necessary? No. It felt like typical movie relationships. The entire movie spent way to much time developing each character and quite frankly it didn't need to.However, there are a lot of great scenes. Including the bank robbery, the shoot-out afterwards, the heist at the beginning of the movie, the diner scene between Hanna and McCauley, and the shoot-out at the drive-in. The acting is top notch. DeNiro and Pacino are great leads. They both portray their characters wonderfully. The rest of the cast was great too. Plus any movie with Danny Trejo is worth seeing.So if not for the overlong running length, I highly recommend seeing it. If you want to see a fast pace heist movie; I'd recommend Heist with Hackman and DeVito. Heist was able to cut the fat and make a great movie.

Michael Mann places Robert De Niro against Al Pacino in this masterpiece,"Heat is written, produced and directed by Michael Mann, a critical acclaimed director and honestly a great one. Heat is probably one of his best films and in my opinion one of the best crime films. That's why I re-watched it and it got better on my second viewing. The almost 3 hour length might scare some people away but I really think you should give the movie a chance, it puts the characters in focus and the slow pace makes for some amazing and memorable scenes and acting.Heat tells the story of Robert De Niro's character, Neil McCauley who are a seasoned professional robber and Al Pacino who plays Lt. Vincent Hanna, an LAPD robbery-homicide detective tracking down Neil's crew after a botched heist leaves three security guards dead. Behind those two incredible and possibly among the best actors in our time is Val Kilmer and a supporting cast full of big names who does great performances, but Robert De Niro and Al Pacino is truly terrific in this film, so is Val Kilmer.Dante Spinotti was the cinematographer for the film and his work shows in how well shot and beautiful it looks, he knows how to shoot a crime film. There's also a lot of visual storytelling and overall amazing storytelling. How this didn't get a Oscar nomination for Best screenplay or directing is something I ask myself, it's a well crafted and simply phenomenal film, truly cinematic.Much thanks to Janice Polley for picking out the sets, some really great sets and the director wanting to shoot on location at all times made it to be much more realistic and immersive than other crime films. The realism doesn't stop there, Michael Mann went in detail to get everything as realistic as possible and I appreciate that. Just tells how much love the film got and it shows in every minute.

As we all know, Pacino and De Niro are two of the best actors of all time, and both of them are specialists on crime films. Most notably, Pacino appears in crime movies like ""The Godfather"" franchise, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Scarface"", ""Carlito's Way"", ""Donnie Brasco"", and De Niro has played in ""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Godfather 2"", ""Once upon a time in America"", ""Goodfellas"", and various other crime thrillers.

"This Big-Name Crime Drama Concentrates on the Dance, Not the Kiss","De Niro and Pacino share the screen for, somehow, the first time ever in this mature, complex cops-and-robbers saga. Excluding an explosive, high-powered gunfight and a dramatic, suspenseful standoff of a finale, Heat is almost entirely interested in playing up tension and exploring character motivations. Its powerful cast is astoundingly well-rounded, with a complete lack of black-and-white personalities. Villains show their soft sides, heroes bare their dark underbellies, and in-betweeners continue to straddle the chasm between fates. Devoting the vast majority of its running time to the careful, calculated dance between law-saddled feds and their spooked targets, it applies the same flirty mentality to the inevitable rendezvous between the two big-name stars. It's a film that constantly teases its viewers with promises, only to yank them out of sight at the very last moment and resume playing hide-and-seek. That persistent devotion to delaying the shrapnel in favor of more character-building does result in a tremendous ensemble of players, and ultimately we care about the fate of every one of them. It also causes an already-long three hour duration to feel more like five or six.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Excellent-One of the best films of the 90's,"I first saw this in the cinema when I was 14 (Yes, I was underage!), and thought it was a decent enough film, if a little long.

Pacino and De Niro, quite rightly hyped as the 'two most electrifying actors in America', are both brilliant, as well as Voight and Kilmer. The shootout scene must be one of the most well directed and suspense filled in the history of cinema. It has been knocked for being too long, and I admit it can drag in places, but watching through these has its rewards. All in all a fantastic film, probably the second best film of the 90's after 'Shawshank Redemption'.

This is a perfect love story, mixed in with cops and robbers, with the backdrop of Los Angeles and directed by Miami Vice legend Michael Mann. The movie keeps you anticipating what will happen next.

There is an actual storyline that makes you care about some of the characters,"It's a gangster movie set in the early 1990s in Los Angeles, California. It follows a criminal gang led by 50-ish Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). He's unmarried, but he gets into a relationship with a 30-something bookstore clerk named Eady (Amy Brenneman) during the film. Neil's primary accomplices are Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), an expert at explosives, and Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore), a whiz at electronic security systems. Chris needs crime to pay for his gambling problem; Michael just likes the buzz. Chris is married to Charlene (Ashley Judd); they have a young child and a troubled marriage. Michael is also married with children. Other villains include Waingro (Kevin Gage), an erstwhile member of Neil's gang, Nate (Jon Voight), Neil's fence and fixer, and Roger Van Zant (William Fichtner), a criminal money launderer.Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), who is in his troubled third marriage, currently to Justine (Diane Venora), pursues the gang. Justine's daughter, Lauren (Natalie Portman), lives with them. Vincent, a member of LAPD's Homicide-Robbery Division, is driven by his work.""Heat"" follows three crimes committed by Neil's gang and Vincent's efforts to catch them. What makes the story more compelling than ""Scarface,"" for example, is the inclusion of everyone's family relationships and the impact on each.Some things are overdone--like the shootout after a bank robbery that never would have happened even in the 1990s with so many pedestrians in the vicinity. Also, De Niro's relationship with Amy Brenneman is not really believable. But there is an actual storyline that makes you care about some of the characters. The cinematography around Los Angeles is well done. There is a lot of violence and blood.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Fantastic Police/Criminal Dynamic,"Heat was terrific and just as good as I remembered watching it from years ago. First, the heists throughout the movie were very intense and well-shot. The pacing of each intense scene was perfect and didn't seem rushed which kept me glued to the screen. The acting in this was also amazing and filled with plenty of talent that were either already established stars or an early entry for future stars. Deniro and Pacino were fantastic contrasts to one another as the movie progressed. The story was also well-written. Both of the main characters and even the side characters had the same weaknesses that set them back in the movie whether it was Pacino's greed for that next arrest (which affected his marriage) or Deniro's desperation for his revenge (affecting his relationship). Sure they were on separate sides of the law but their similarities developed slowly throughout the movie and came together nicely at the end. 4.5/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the finest movies ever made,"Everything in the movie has had the fullest attention of the makers. It seems everything had to be perfect in the movie. The movie has a good story and although its a crime-story, it gets a little romantic at some points. It is like a box which contains something very bad, but has been wrapped with beautiful giftpaper. At some points in the story you almost sympathise with the bad guys.The movie has it all: Violence, humor, drama, suspense etc. But also the scenery, the music, the actors and the clothing have all been carefully chosen. The director Michael Mann was the producer of Miami Vice. People who have seen the TV serie Miami Vice will see some similarities.This the first movie so far were Al Pacino and Robert de Niro play together. Personally I think they are one of the best actors so far.Heat gives you real entertainment for about three hours long.

"A slick, polished thriller","Movie fans and film snobs already acclaim Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino as two of the best actors in the history of entertainment. From the past experience of putting them in the same movie, The Godfather Part II, magic is bound to spark. While Heat isn't quite what one would assume it to be, it succeeds at being a mature, emotional experience that defines itself at the top of the action genre for years to come. Robert DeNiro has a beef with politicians during elections: they tear their opponents down and sacrifice their dignity instead of trying to prove themselves to the American people. Heat is an action thriller with dignity. While other action movies are concerned with what neat stunts can they throw at the audience, Heat internally speaks to the viewer as well as bringing well choreographed action scenes.Director Michael Mann, makes Heat more personal than most action thrillers. In fact, Mann doesn't tell the story as if it were a action movie at all. He tells a story centering in on the lives of two men who are connected by a few pieces of action. Mann delivers the film with a tense feeling, and establishes a gloomy tone. The engrossing score is cautiously placed the in the correct places. Heat succeeds technically, as well; the sound quality that adds to the excitement of the action scenes. The suspense is successful because Mann creates the film's tension sensitively. All the action and suspense is met perfectly because of the tender touch of Michael Mann.DeNiro and Pacino lead the adept cast creating one heck of an acting ensemble. Al Pacino has moments of greatness, but those are contrasted with some cringe-inducing moments. His highs are pretty high though and make up for the brief moments of instability. DeNiro, playing the darker character, is solid and consistent from his first scene to the last, giving him DeNiro the slight edge over Pacino. Both are great actors doing great work. Like their first appearance together, The Godfather Part II, they each lead their own section of the film, but in Heat they come into one-on-one contact half-way through the movie. It's a rare scene when the cop and the bad guy sit down for conversation and coffee.""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you the heat around the corner,"" is a line said by Robert DeNiro's character that resonates a lot of what the film is about. Heat is a slick polished thriller that holds carefully plotted action scenes while packing a powerful punch in the topics of abandonment, life, and admiration. The last scene's poignancy solidifies Heat as a movie to remember.Rating: 8/10Grade: A-",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Love and Obsession Cops and Robbers,"Far from being a familiar cops and robbers movie, ""Heat"" is a story of two men's obsessions with being the best at what they do, and the price each one pays for it. Although there are scenes which tend to drag a little bit, there isn't a character, sub-plot or relationship in the film which is even remotely boring, which is much more than I can say about more traditional ""epic love stories.""

It doesn't get much better...,"Heat should have taken every OSCAR in the world. With Bobby DeNiro and Al Pacino going head to head, what could be better? Nothing much. If there was ever a movie that you could call an ""Epic"" this is the movie. I don't think there has ever been a more realistic, enjoyable and smart cops and robbers flick. Just because Robert is the gangster in the movie, doesn't mean he is the ""bad"" guy. He is just doing what he needs to do to survive.. Pacino respects him, and knows that they don't get much better. I love the way this movie paces itself. It's like you are planning the heist with DeNiro. And it also puts you in the shoes of a cop. You get to go under cover with Pacino. The end of the movie, is one of the most heart breaking and entertaining scenes to come around in a long long time. 10 for Heat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Heat,"I really like Michael Mann's ""return"" to his Miami Vice roots with this entertaining police-drama. While many dismiss it because of its length, I contest that it moves quicker than any three hour plus film I've seen in recent years. Pacino plays the hot shot ""Sonny Crocket-like"" cop on the hunt of a master thief and criminal, played by Robert DeNiro in a great plum of a role. Mann's film is interesting because like the classic 1980's drama, it shows both sides of the story. The cops and the robbers. It shows that outside of their work, there is more to life than busting people or killing people or money. DeNiro's Neil has nothing because he's never known anything but treachery and fear. Pacino's Vincent is the same thing. Failed marriages. Failed opportunities. All that both of these men have is their work and they're damn good at it.The film moves at a super pace. Every cast member has their moments to shine and there's plenty of guest stars to this drama: It's nice to see Jon Voight again. Ashley Judd and Val Kilmer are both fine. Michael Madsen is menacing as a member of Neil's gang. This film has all the elements of good drama, tough action and edge of your seat suspense, with a pleasing conclusion. It's also nice to see two giants like Pacino and DeNiro go head to head with one another. Their coffeeshop scene is perfect. Wes Studi, Mykelti Williamson and Tone Loc co-star.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dreck,"It is rare when you can identify the exact point where a movie goes horribly wrong.  Al Pacino pulls Robert Di Niro over in an unmarked police car and says: ""How about a cup of coffee?""  I can just see a commitee of studio execs (they roam in packs like hyenas) saying ""We need to have a meeting between the cop and master criminal, to give the movie, you know, more personal tension. Plus, it's Pacino and Di Niro, how can it miss?""  It missed by a mile.After the friendly coffee talk, everything slides quickly downhill.  Plot holes open up like fault lines, little sub plots rise up with no rhyme or reason, then get cut off.  (witness the ex-con turned short order cook subplot.)  ""Emotional"" scenes with peripheral characters get tacked on to the end, I guess to tug at our heart strings, since they add nothing to the plot or to our understanding of the characters.Everyone seemed to be going through the motions on this one.  What a shame, considering the cast.  This movie is not worth the talent put together to make it.Oh, and it drags on FOREVER.

Going in Depth,"Sure, ""Heat"" is a top-notch crime drama with bold action and gritty details but Michael Mann has created something special by exploring the characters more deeply.  Within its 2.75 hour running time is enough room to show the consequences of the choices both the cops and the robbers make to themselves and their loved ones.  That includes those characters that would get little or no lines in other films.And there's Al Pacino being Pacino.

Even if one scene was deleted, the movie would not have been as good as it was. Another criticism of the film is the ""weak"" ending.

Lukewarm,"Michael Mann's western ""The Last of the Mohicans"" frustratingly told a complex story (that of the settlement of America) with a black-and-white vision of good and bad.  In ""Heat"", he performs the reverse trick, and in a story of a brutal mass murderer and a policeman, tries to assert the moral that they're really both the same.  It doesn't convince in this convoluted, but essentially shallow film, in which even deNiro and Pacino fail to do much more than fill out familiar outlines; the fault in part lying in the degree of respect that Mann accords both stars. Neither wholly realistic nor truly slick; ""Heat"" holds the attention but little more, nothing really sparks except for a ludicrously over-the-top gun battle of which Peckinpah might have been proud.  For a really great movie in a similar genre, watch and compare to ""The French Connection"", 25 years older but lean, taut and merciless; ""Heat"" adds nothing new except for sentiment and flab.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Perfect Crime Film,"In twenty years, Michael Mann will be remembered as one of America's greatest directors. He consistently has churned out modern classics, from Thief(1981), Manhunter(1988), The Last of the Mohicans(1992) and The Insider(1999). But in my opinion, Heat is his best. It may be strange to say so about a movie with a cast that includes Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, and Jon Voight, but its the writing that gets me. Is the dialouge Mamet level? No. Maybe its not the most original plot in the world either. But the screenplay has something that almost no movies can truly claim these days- efficiency. It may seem odd to say that about a movie that is almost 3 hours long, but there is not one scene in this film that doesn't advance the story. And the subplots are clear and every single one of them is resolved before the credits. Much has been made of the first onscreen meeting of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. And when I say meeting, I mean it, as they literally share one dialouge scene together. And it is a fabulous scene. There is a reason this movie could not have been made in 1978 and had the same impact.Whats so special about the scene is that Pacino and De Niro have essentially lived their lives and aged before our eyes, and are now very much the seasoned professionals they portray in this movie. The other strength of this movie is its action, which isn't at all what the movie is about, thereby making its setpieces that much more intense and compelling. In these scenes Mann proves that he is a born filmmaker. Its also nice to see interesting female characters, which is so rare in this kind of film.

Already a classic,"Pacino, DeNiro, Sizemore, Voight, Judd - in one movie - I couldn't miss it. But what I saw was better than all I had expected. I know Mann is a great director (The Insider), but I never could have imagined him to direct such a pretentios picture. It was not easy to decide to which character you feel more sympathy - I decided DeNiro, as he's so cool and played his best role since Taxi Driver. Also to be mentioned is Ashley Judd, who proves that she can be a great actress - her calm suffering and sympathy to the happening regarding her husband (Kilmer - who also surpriesd me, as I don't like him very much)was amazing to watch. When seeing this movie you cannot even move - it is filled with suspense, with a great action (Bankrobbery scene is a classic) and not a second to long. Also make sure you watch that scene in which DeNiro and Pacino are together for drinking a coffee - a very quotable scene. Just watch it yourself. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great Movie with TWO of the Greatest Actors,I love the fact that this movie was teamed with two of my favorite actors of all time. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are the best. I love them both.

Quite Possibly the Best Movie of its Genre,"OK, so I may be a little biased as this is my favourite movie, but who isn't about theirs ? Anyway, I'll start with character portrayal and representation. Michael Mann exceeded the 'blue-print' (LA Takedown), by taking the time to make you understand the logic behind the characters' actions, ranging from the 'main' ones (De Niro, Pacino) to ones that didn't have much screen-time, like Kilmer's wife and the black guy who was the bank shoot-out driver.  Mann didn't need to go into so much depth with this, as the 'typical' film lasts around 2 hours, but he's not the sort of director who follows traditionalism, obviously.And then there's the screenplay, the score, lighting, sound-effects - I could go on, but I won't.  I'll let you watch it and make your own mind up.De Niro and Kilmer in the diner still has to be one of the most memorable scenes of any film, with both of them understanding the other's actions and course of life.Please watch it and form an opinion of your own though !",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece?,"The narrative of mental and physical duel between Pacino and De Niro is expanded to include needless subplot of other robbers' private lives. It becomes more and more boring except that memorable shootout in the street after bank robbery.Pacino spends the whole picture chewing gums and shouting at everyone in sight; Kilmer is as stiff as usual. Diane Venora, as Pacino's wife, always speaks in a low tone while Pacino's voice over the top. It's irritating to watch these two actors in conversation, because the viewer has to adjust the sound volume continuously.On his way to the airport, De Niro suddenly drives off the highway and gets to the hospital to eliminate a traitor who worked for him. After he finishes the job unconvincingly, Pacino finds him on the street and chases after him. It's absolutely ridiculous that they can run from the hospital to the airport without cars.

a true gem of quality film long gone,"Let me preface this by saying that this movie IS considered a crime-action-drama type movie.  But if you aren't necessarily interested in those specific genres of film, do not worry.  Heat is not just another action-drama.  It rather speaks to an innate issue in all of us.  What will we live and die for?In my opinion, being a huge Pacino fan and an even bigger DeNiro fan, given the years of experience and sheer amount of superb roles each of them has underneath their belts, I would argue that this film, in their latter years of film making (Pacino then at 55 and DeNiro at 52), is some of the best work that each of them has done on the screen.This is the true ultimate story of two men unwantingly on the opposite sides of the law.  DeNiro fills his smoother than smooth bad guy role to the T, bringing in the reality of the character and showing him to be dynamic and real.  Pacino takes on the part of a street wise, taking no crap from no one, hard nosed driven type of guy.In addition to these two godfathers of film who could just as well carry the movie, we are blessed with multiple superb secondary characters that provide so much color and support for Pacino and DeNiro.Specifically Val Kilmer as the loose cannon, yet cool under fire (literally) bad guy in DeNiro's gang and Tom Sizemore who in my opinion adds so much to every film that he is in.Jon Voight is great in his small role as DeNiro's inside man, Ashley Judd is beautiful and as talented as ever as Kilmer's wife, Amy Brenneman is great in one of her first big roles as DeNiro's love interest, and the ever-talented, young (and now not so young but still as talented) Natalie Portman as the troubled step-daughter of Pacino.Michael Mann breaths life into the script (that he wrote too) and into the movie.

Turns a piece of ore into a heart-piercing projectile,"The movie has been on my mind long before I've decided to play GTA V, but then my friends mentioned the connection between these two magnets for humans, so it was time to check the roots of heist for dummies. Imagine my amazement seeing a top bill cast in one mash up: this instantly boosts up the value, but what about the plot and actors' commitment?The temperature was unstable through the course of the film: started bright and sparkly, then for an hour or so got a chilling breeze of placidity, which could have been simply cut from 2h50 span. Nevertheless, the chemistry of characters was so poignant that I wasted the whole box of napkins wiping my face from all the testosterone splattering from the screen. The drive from a gorgeous shootout scene still pumps the blood on a single jog of memory: the vastness of skirmish blows all existing limits of imagination.Another great side of this crime drama, as mentioned before, is the cast. Robert De Niro with his goatee melts hearts and presents the ideal of masculinity. Val Kilmer shows off imposing hair and not less cool performance that enchains a viewer to his character. For the desert we have a cat in the bag - Al Pacino. Unpredictable behavior varying from drama-to-the-bone to take-me-to-asylum says for itself; you might like it or not, but this is Al as good as it gets.Cooling off the product I would say that the picture must be seen at least once in a lifetime but still clinging to the thought that almost 3 hours is too long - a little trim would have been a wise choice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Character driven crime drama.,"Brilliant film masterpiece by Michael Mann. Superb cast lead by Al Pacino, and Robert DeNiro; who share the screen for the first time. Neil (DeNiro) is a master thief about to take his last score, Vincent (Pacino) is a veteran detective obsessed with taking him down. Mann throws away stereotypes and guides a multidimensional story line around the very human and flawed characters of the film. Touching, and thrilling the film explores morality in an interesting way. You will find yourself torn between routing for the cops and the crooks. Brilliant, gritty story telling, by a true master: Michael Mann.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece...,"Michael Mann surely displays his talents the best in this movie. He has an eye for the naturalist feel and it really shows. Heat is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It's a combination of marvelous acting by Al Pacino and Robert Deniro, direction and story writing by Michael Mann, and the score by Elliot Goldenthal. There are a few lapses in story that I would have improved on but I will not argue with the finished product. A dynamic cast with stunning performances by all, including the most surprising Hank Azaria, best known for his voice on the Simpsons. This film is a must see for anyone who appreciates all of the elements that go into production of a movie. A definate thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A Great, if Slightly Underwhelming Crime Film","Undoubtedly a great film, but slightly underwhelming given my expectations. DeNiro and Pacino are fantastic - the ensemble cast is one of the best of all time. Mann's direction and visual stylings are fantastic - if this and Collateral prove anything, he knows how to make LA look fantastic. The action is also really well shot and enjoyable - the whole final hour is just brilliantly entertaining. The soundtrack is very enjoyable and the gritty cinematography works wonders throughout. The central storyline and conflict between DeNiro and Pacino is brilliant - their talk in the restaurant is probably the best scene in the film. However, as much as I appreciated a large amount of this film, it does feel quite overstuffed. None of the side characters or plots get enough time to be fully developed. I think the film should either have been 2 hours and had some of the side plots cut out, or be a 5-6 hour miniseries and fully develop all of the characters. As it is, there's just too much going on for me to give this a higher rating, despite the large amount of positives this film has. It's still great, but IMDB Top 250 great? Not for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A modern masterpiece, Michael Mann's finest hour","In terms of style and visual flair, Heat surpasses any movie made in the last 20 years. A true masterpiece, at turns brutal and subtle in content and delivery, this film shows the art of movie-making at it's finest. Pacino and De Niro deliver performances so nuanced and intelligent, one feels they were all to aware of the greatness the film would go on to achieve. Unlike other movies made by Michael Mann before or since (and in no small part due to the excellent casting), the characters are incredibly well defined and portrayed, the key being that even the support performances are excellent. This film hinges on the fact that even though people choose different sides of life (i.e Pacino 'cop', De Niro 'criminal'), there are similarities which are common in us all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Violent, but dreamy and mesmerizing","Heat is definitely in my top ten favorite movies.  While it is imperfect and murky in parts, I gave it nine stars because of what it might have been, and its ambition.

Heat reminds me in some ways of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner; while BR is darker, the two films share somewhat of the same mood.

Two greatest crime drama actors' hide and seek duel,"3-hour crime dramas are a thing that I don't watch very often because I get bored so easily. I'm the kind of person who likes movies to be 90 minutes long. But watching Heat I remembered again that length doesn't make a movie good or bad. It's how well it's directed and acted.I'm not very familiar with Michael Mann but he seems like a director who knows how to tell a story. Also we have a super cast of great actors. Al Pacino belongs to my favorites. He's sympathetic even when he plays gangsters, but this time he's a cop, so he's even more relatable as a good guy. Robert De Niro plays the main bad guy who is cool too. These two legends make great arch enemies who try to outsmart each other before the other does. One of my favorite scenes is when they meet for the first time and have a chat over coffee together - the two guys who are trying to kill each other!The movie is quite slow but there are a couple of more action packed scenes that will put the heat (excuse the pun) on.Because of the length and slow pace I'm not going to watch it again very soon but I got the feeling that I will probably at some point. It's a well made crime drama that you won't forget right away. Check it out!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Must See,"In the saturated genre of Action/Thrillers, Heat finds a way to stand tall above the masses, maintaining originality and an overwhelming sense of tension even despite moments of predictability. Michael Mann brilliantly utilizes both veteran actors (Pacino as Vincent Hanna, DeNiro as Neil McCauley), playing them with and against each other to the ultimate confrontation neither can avoid. There is an underlying depth to the film as the actions are incidental, its the characters that matter. While the defining line between good guy/bad guy is drawn it is equally blurred as your empathy lies with both men, understanding they're one and the same, each capable of being on the other side. Black and white hardly exists here, but rather those murky shades of gray that calls to question what matters most, what truly defines us: the motivation or the actions, the man himself or his job? Truly a magnificent cinematic feast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Heat,"I saw Heat in the theater with Mom & Dad at release, both fans of the leads. They didn't say much afterwards. The gist: an elite crime crew (De Niro) plans one last big score, in defiance of a special police unit that is keeping close tabs (Pacino) and a dangerous loose end still unattended (Gage).Gripping crime scenes, a pleasing cat and mouse entente (Al Bob) & proper casting (Kilmer Voight Sizemore Trejo Levine Fichtner Studi Haysbert Azaria Williamson Staunton) cannot overcome Heat's frigid feeling, a movie projected too slick (Mann) (direct write) on poorly developed female characters (Venora Brenneman Judd) (2.5/4). If you're gonna pass on charm (they did), you'd better include sentiment (they didn't). But don't leave empty handed, here are the payoff película: Frankenheimer's political chase, Ronin (98) (Bob) & Mandel's F/X (86) (Diane), thrills AND thoughts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I can't watch this,"I can't watch this. ""Heat"" is one of a few highly-regarded movies which I just cannot endure. I've tried to watch it several times but I can never get past the first hour. It's neither a feel-good action movie nor a decent drama. It seems to be aiming for a fresh take on the cops and robbers theme but misses entirely. The characters are deeply unlikeable, the performances are weak, the movie drags like anything and it exhibits no flair or style.

The soundtrack of this movie is amazing, it really helps bring you in and assists the conveyance of mood. The character development makes you feel for each side, and makes me feel that I've known McCauley and Hanna for some time.  I think most of us have feelings from both sides of this movie.  I think thats why I'm so drawn to this movie.  Its like I'm on the dividing line of good and evil, and this movie shows that people, real people reside on both sides.

You can also feel the strength of animosity between 'cop' and 'robber.'

As well done a crime saga as I have seen,"Heat proves that a great screenplay + great directing + legendary actors >an incredible movie.Heat is more real than most movies in this genre in that it shows the ""bad guys"" as real people. They have marriage problems, go to dinner at nice restaurants, play with their kids, and use their skills to earn a living.Michael Mann does an incredible job of comparing the police to the criminals. Both go to dinner with their ""coworkers"" both have family problems, both are very dedicated to their work.Mann also shows that as a person, Pacino is no better than De Niro. Pacino is a cop who is a terrible husband, and lets his job control his life. He tells his wife ""being a cop is the only thing I'm good at."" De Niro leads a life of solitude, and knows deep down that he would not be good for any one. He dedicates himself to his work and tries not to bring anyone down with him.The scene between De Niro and Pacino typifies the similarites between the cops and the robbers. After speaking, both men truely like each other. And in the tradition of the greek tragedy, both men secretly realize they cannot change their fate, and one day they won't come home from ""work"". Their jobs are a part of them that cannot be changed. De Niro says matter of factly to Pacino ""I take down scores, thats what I do.""Heat is a film with well-developed characters that is unusual in this genre. The similarities between the life of the cops and that of the robbers, are highlighted very well by Mann. By the end of the movie, you look at De Niro's crew not as mindless thugs, but as people, whose job happens to be on the wrong side of the law.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This timeless crime epic will probably always be my favorite film of all time.,"Michael Mann is THE MAN!  ""Heat (1995)"" affected me in a way that I cannot describe.  It is long, yet concise; a complex story told with sweeping epic about two men, one on each side of the law, and the fateful events that bring them together.  It is a collision of monumental proportions; one that sparks a chaotic downward spiral as each antagonist grapples for control of his respective world.Mann appears to do little to draw his audience in and make them care about his characters; he merely presents them for our viewing.  Yet for certain people, DeNiro's Neil McCauley and Pacino's Vincent Hanna will lift off the screen and live forever in our minds, never to be forgotten even in the off-chance that we should get amnesia.On the surface, ""Heat"" appears to be an action film, a showdown.  But it is much more: a love story, a friendship, fate, respect, suicide, and ultimately, a story of great sadness.  The infinite detail which Mann injects into this artistic palette makes for a film that can be watched again and again.  I will gladly return to this realm periodically for the rest of my life, and I doubt that I shall ever find a better film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The writing is also excellent and delivers the backstories to each character to perfection and the dialogue is out of this world. The chemistry of the cast throughout the film worked perfectly and the action scenes are intense and very well done. You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film.

A bit over-ambitious but I love what this movie accomplished,"At this point, I'm pretty sure that Al Pacino is a slightly toned-down version of Samuel L. Jackson, yet he still has the right tools to make every character he portrays badass.To be honest, I'm not too sure how to feel about this movie. Yes, it was definitely intense, as I expected something bad to happen at any moment, it was phenomenally well-acted, even excluding the big names of Al Pacino and Robert Deniro, the cast is really talented and gave their best here, and it was almost perfect on a technical level, as it was shot, constructed, and put together in beautifully. Yet, I'm feeling conflicted and I can't say that this movie is amazing or even really good. I'm not going as far as saying that this movie is bad, so I want to explore a bit deeper here and find out what kept me from liking this movie as much as most viewers did. This is a brand new concept that I'm trying out, so expect a lot of mind vomit, I just hope this turns out well without being a novel-length read at the same time.To begin, this was a crime epic, a procedural drama, and a film noir of incredible scale and ambition. Besides the classic ""cops and robbers"" scenario, this film has more layers to it - the most distinct one is the machismo of two men from completely different backgrounds. One is a professional thief, leading a criminal syndicate, and the other one is a hot-headed detective that is pursuing them. This relationship between the two lead roles quickly becomes a melodrama as the movie begins to explore their personal lives, all their troubles concerning their field of work and relationships, and the dilemmas that hang over their professional lives. On one hand, this unique view explores the duality between the men as we get to explore these characters in depth before the conclusion of the movie, but on the other hand, this extends the runtime to three hours. This way, the action sequences are more memorable as they're easier to distinguish from the sea of other character development scenes but at the same time, they kind of feel insignificant as they take make a rather percentage of the movie.Looking at the beginning of the movie, you already start to get a slight taste of action and what's coming later. In a gripping heist sequence, we get introduced to the term ""score"" and the first one is a treat. It ran as smoothly as it could have until Waigro lost his temper and killed one of the guards, forcing the killing of the other two as they were witnesses. This gave us a glimpse of what kind of sadist Waingro actually is even before he went into a prostitute killing spree. But the key point to the plot was what happened after that score, as Neil met Eady. Later in the movie, we learned about his professional code, which stated ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" but it was around here that his code was tested and he started to look into this relationship as something he might never need to walk out. I also think that's why the next heist seemed so desperate to him, as he planned it to be his last one.On the other side of the action, we have Lieutenant Vincent Hanna and the LAPD division, that is hunting Neil and his crew down. Hanna, already on his third marriage, is working relentlessly, while neglecting his wife and step-daughter, who is showing some signs of depression already. To be honest, I didn't really notice it at this point and only connected the dots during one scene at the ladder end of the movie. Hanna at this point is pretty much ruining his home life by giving every inch of his attention to his work. This is where we start to see the difference to our two lead roles, as Hanna, as just mentioned, looks to his work while Neil starts looking to his relationships.When two sides are put face to face, they don't look all that different. We have arrived at one of my favorite scenes at the movie - the coffee scene, as I like to call it. As Hanna's home life was crumbling to pieces and he was unable to catch Neil, who was just too slippery and clever to fall for his ruses, Hanna pulls out an interesting move (a pro-gamer move, if you like) and engages Neil face-to-face and invites him for a cup of coffee. As the two men engage in conversation, we notice that they relate to one another: Hanna is seen pitiful about how his devotion to his work has put his home life at the brink of collapsing; Neil expresses how his relationship with Eady might not last as his code states that he might have to ditch her at any moment he feels the heat (hey, that's the title of the movie!). We can see that these men have mutual respect for each other, even though their occupations are bound to put them against each other sooner or later. Besides being a great scene, I think this is the height of both of these actors right here. Pacino here is ferocious like Samuel L. Jackson with the audacity of Liam Neeson and De Niro here is level headed like Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and intimidating Kevin Spacey in ""Se7en"". In other words, this is like fire vs ice as both actors bring out their best, one portraying a hot-head relentless workaholic and the other is a patient, strategic and devious.The coffee scene is followed by a bank robbery. Usually, we have these kinds of action sequences at the end of the movie but here we have it around the middle. After this scene it got evident that the movie definitely isn't about the crimes, the heist, or the scores, it is about the people that get involved in them. As the heist is almost as a success, a violent standoff erupts, people on both sides lose some of their men. What follows is a bit of chaos, as to sum most of it quickly, Hanna finds his wife's lover in his home and takes away the TV because he can't stand him watching his TV, Eady learns about Neil's occupation as a professional thief and she's hesitant but still agrees to go start a new life in New Zealand with him, Hanna's step-daughter attempts to commit suicide (which sort of came out of nowhere as we haven't seen her much prior this scene), Neil tries to cut loose ends by killing Van Zant, who tipped off the police about the heist... okay, let's stop here. As Neil and Eady were finally home free, Neil suddenly learns about the whereabouts of Waingro and his instincts send him on a detour to eliminate him once and for all. The stealthy infiltration of the Hotel by Neil was a work of art, I'll admit that. After that, we have a pivotal scene as heading back to Eady, Neil notices Hanna and, being a man of his code, turns away from her while we are left to witness the fragile confusion of the heartbroken and abandoned Eady's face. The rest went by quickly as Hanna followed Neil into an airport and shot him in an anti-climactic scene. Their chat for a bit before Neil dies and that's how the movie ends.The duality of a cop and robber over here concerns drama and action. Our two lead roles aren't complete opposites, that are usually present in this genre - they are but mere men with shallow lives that are slowly collapsing because of their addiction to their field of work. Because they live in the same grey zone, they can relate to each other. Both of their stories are tragic but Neil takes the edge here. At the end of it, Hanna got his man while Neil's own discipline made anything outside his own rules impossible and eventually fatal. His love for Eady made him feel invincible and he created his own fate by going against his own principles when he decided to go after Waingro. His own rules have done this to him. Hanna's admiration for Neil leads to killing him without hesitation, perhaps knowing that he would rather prefer to die and not go back to prison. This admiration of his opponent to that degree makes the last shot of the movie overwhelming.I labeled this movie as a crime epic, a procedural drama, and a film noir before but that's barely the extent of the film's epic stature. It is much more than Al Pacino and Robert De Niro portraying a cop and a crook but defining a movie as complex as this is a challenge for me, yet complexity isn't shy of great cinema entries. Attention to the score, the soundtrack, camera lenses, locations, wardrobe, lighting, and the use of both realism and style with the thrill of robberies and the emotional significance of the story make this experience worthwhile.Almost finishing up now and only one question remains - why did I fail to really enjoy this? I gave a lot of praise so far but that's mostly out of respect for what this movie accomplished. My mind vomit manifested into a plot synopsis more than anything else and all I've got to say is that this movie feels real. Too real. The pacing is slow, rarely boring. During the bit that ended up being a plot synopsis, I skipped some bigger scenes or just downplayed them because there wasn't much to talk about. The sub-plots took too long here and some of the key scenes seemed to end really quickly just as you got excited about them. To sum it up, I think Heat was a bit over-ambitious with all the emotional scenes, and that ends up with some scenes feeling insignificant or even unnecessary but combining that with the action sequences that we did get and Al Pacino and Robert De Niro trying to out-macho each other makes this an enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not a hit (dvd),"For the moment, the simultaneous pairing of Al & Bob isn't unforgettable. As in ""Law and Order"", the movie is boring. If the duo copes well, the fault is on the story and the directing. About the story, this cop/gangster is stupid because the cops find the crew easily when they are planning while they fail when the crew attacks. Worse, all the characters manage easily their jobs while they got problems with their relationships! About the directing, the scenes are slow and there are a lot of useless moments. If Mann forgot to go in editing room, i haven't forgotten my fast forward button on my remote. There are a few good moments (Natalie's scenes, Bob's trap, the last chase) but it's not enough and not worthy of 160 minutes! To close the case, the hair style is particularly hideous from Kilmer, to Bob, to Voight (who stays definitely in the bottom of supporting actors!).",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Probably still the best cop-villain saga ever made.,"I saw this film when he got released in 1996. I must say, it was the period where a lot of important films where made; such as Se7en, Usual Suspects, Underground, 12 Monkeys, etc, etc. Those films set the tone for a lot of other movies. There are a million things that can be said about this movie and I believe that others have said those million things through the years, repeatedly. I have recently seen the film again on a big screen and I must say that the film didn't loose his charisma. That is maybe the best compliment a movie can get. Despite 'Ali' (2001), I think that Michael Mann is truly a great director, and I am sure he won't disappoint us with 'Collateral' (2004).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A brilliant crime saga,"Heat is a movie filled with clichés but as a whole is not clichéd. It has a confidence and skill to its craft that makes you believe that you are seeing this kind of story for the first time, or at least, in a whole new light. It's mainly the story of the obsessed-with-his-cases, badass cop and the professional, by-the-numbers criminal. Michael Mann fleshes out the characters (played by Pacino and DeNiro) extremely well and presents them as two men who are each consumed by their profession. Mostly because they are both very good at what they do, and they would not prefer to do anything else. Each story would make an interesting movie or TV show, but Heat collides these two similar characters together to make a great movie about two skilled men conflicted amidst pressures from their work and personal lives finally meeting their match.What I liked about the connection Pacino and DeNiro build is the fact that their characters truly respected each other. If the movie were bias to either side of the law, one character would be good and the other would be bad. It's not bias at all, and both characters are very likable. It's hard to root for one character over the other, which makes the film's conclusion all the more emotional. And believe me, it has a great ending.The supporting cast is top notch, ranging from Val Kilmer to Ashley Judd to William Fichner to a young Natalie Portman, but the main attraction obviously is Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro in the leads. They're actors who are amazing beyond words, and have acted in so many monumental movies throughout their careers, and I have to say that this was the last truly great, outstanding film that either has starred in to date. Oddly enough, it just so happens it was the same movie.With Heat, Michael Mann tells a sincere and richly detailed story within a subject matter that usually isn't treated with such care, and Pacino and DeNiro perform with their usual greatness, but still offer up new things we haven't seen before. It's one of the best films of the 1990's.My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
THE GREATEST COP DRAMA EVER MADE,"Michael Mann's ""HEAT"" is one of those rare films that effectively combines great action sequences and visual storytelling with fully developed characters all played beautifully by a great cast. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are two of the greatest actors of all time and both have dynamic chemistry that is played out beautifully in what will go down as one of the greatest scenes ever filmed. The other star of this film is Los Angeles itself. The use of colour and architecture by Mann is brilliant and lends the city an almost haunted, souless landscape, which is mirrored by the characters. Alided with the production design by Neil Spisak, the cinematography by Dante Spinotti, and the score by Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Mann has made a film that surpasses every other cop movie in this genre and turned ""Heat"" into one of the greatest films ever made.

I strongly suggest this movie to every movie fan worldwide,it is a screenplay with two interesting characters,who are being transformed to legends,just because of the performances.The two legendary actors give great performances and it's really sad to realize that this movie was totally ignored by the Academy.In my opinion both actors deserved at least a nomination,but it's not the first time when great films and outstanding performances are being ignored. Everybody should watch this film,an overwhelming experience watching two extraordinary actors performing face to face.One of the best sequences i have ever seen is the one where DeNiro and Pacino meet and discuss in the restaurant....absolutely fabulous.

Best Cops and Robbers Movie Ever,"This is an amazing piece of film from the creator of Ali, Miami Vice and my favorite, Thief.  Michael Mann was able to weave ten or twelve concurring plots into a whole coherent movie that never lets you relax.  The heist, the people involved, the families and the relationship between each of the groups, the cops and the robbers, are done seamlessly.  You are brought along the entire movie by the actions of the people to the situation rather than the situation dictating the moves of the people.The choice of actors doesn't hurt the movie either.  There is not one part that isn't played well by the likes of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Asley Judd, and on and on.  There are no landmark performances here but the whole is greater that the sum of its parts.  Each player was a small part going through responses of how the plot of the movie was affecting his or her lives and as a result the movie took form and the puzzle came together.  If all of this was not enough this film had two great scenes that were enough to make the picture on its own.  It had a head-to-head scene with Pacino and De Niro where the two acting styles also came head-to-head.  Pacino with all the expressions and eye movements that were creating a dialog of their own and De Niro's character with a quiet, in control, inwardly thoughtful way of telling you how it is.  More is said in the moments between his lines than the lines themselves.  You can see two great artists at the height of their craft interacting inside intelligent and confident characters.  These were equals in every since of the word having a very meaningful, insightful conversation and the audience was privileged to eavesdrop.The second scene that makes this movie one of the best was the most realistic shootout ever-devised on film.  I won't give away the plot as to how it came about but I will only say that when it is over you will think to yourself `How long was I holding my breath?'.The plot never lets you down, there are no slow points and this movie has some of the greatest scenes in 20th Century film; did I leave anything out. If I had to look for something wrong I would say that some of the sub-plots did not reach a conclusion but I only noticed this after the third of forth viewing.  I recommend this movie to anyone who wants non-stop cops and robbers action with intelligent characters and great individual acting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Epic Crime Saga,"An epic crime saga, indeed - as described on the back of the box.  This is my favorite film of all time.

This film's best quality is the fantastic acting meshed with Michael Mann's directing (See ""The Insider"", also directed by Mann and also starring Al Pacino and Diane Venora for comparison and like style).  The film also has a well composed score.  Regarding the use of music in Heat, the exclusion of background music from various scenes (like the bank robbery) forces the viewer to take in what's happening visually, and this is how power actors like Pacino and De Niro really make this film the masterpiece that it is. I voted this film a 10 because I think it excedes, and actually exemplifies, the criteria that viewers of good taste and quality want to experience when they see a movie. Fans of organized crime films such as Casino and Goodfellas will appreciate the up-to-date representations of crime in Heat.  Heat presents a modern tale of cops and robbers without focusing on the protagonist or pushing the viewer towards favoring one particular character.  This films blurs the lines between good guy and bad guy, and you'll be surprised who you'll root for in the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Missed the mark caused if length.,"The performances from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are undeniably strong, and the chemistry between them is captivating, especially in that famous diner scene. Michael Mann's direction is impressive too-he really nails the tension and the atmospheric vibe of the city. The action sequences, particularly the heist and shootout scenes, are intense and gripping.However, the movie does have some pacing issues. It's pretty long, and while that gives it room for deep character development, sometimes it drags a little. Some of the subplots feel a bit underdeveloped, and not all of the characters get enough screen time to make their arcs as compelling as the central story. It's definitely a film that requires patience, and if you're not into slow-burn crime dramas, it might feel a little tedious.Overall, it's a well-crafted film that explores themes of obsession, morality, and the blurred lines between good and bad, but it doesn't hit that perfect note for me to give it a full 10. Still, if you're a fan of crime thrillers, it's definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
UNDERRATED,"Heat (1995) is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I can't believe it's about to be knocked off the list. It is my 3rd favourite movie. It has great performances by Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Val Kilmer. I recommend this movie to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Wow ,what a movie!","This film made me feel extreme nostalgia for classic heist movies. But this isn't just some bog standard cat and mouse chase. We are basically a flie on the wall for pretty much every scene and i love it. We see the family dynamics completely alter on both sides (the detective and the crews), even those scenes are just as intense as the action moments. To be specific, there is never a dull moment in this film. Action was superb. I find with alot of modern heist movies I lose interest, either they're too overcomplicated and get lost in the plot or they're a total cheese fest. With HEAT ,I never felt lost in the dialogue and I felt entirely invested in the whole plot.In conclusion, something else I'd mention was it left me with a problem I haven't had with modern cop thrillers- I had no idea what side to take. I desperately wanted the crew to escape the police, yet I wanted the detectives to finally catch them and I believe that's what makes this movie brilliant. It's a total moral dilemma. Would absolutely recommend. I know it's 3 hours long ,but it really doesn't get any better than this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Praises,"Quite simply, the greatest film of all time.The De Niro-Pacino connection is emphatically brilliant - both give sensational performances, as two totally different characters.

An epic masterpiece of 90s film-making!,"It took over 20 years to get Al Pacino and Robert de Niro in another film together, and they get to share screen time!

It has it all: classic one-liners, explosive action, plot twists, romance, suspenseful situations, the lot!!One of the most underrated films of the 90s.

Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and John Voight all give amazing support, and the coffee shop sequence will hold your attention so deeply, you won't be able to rip your eyes from the screen.This film is a gem.

"A good film, with great actors at the highest level, a little different from other action films and that deserves to be revisited these days.","If there's one thing that can be a good pastime, it's an action movie, with ingenious and fearless thieves and police willing to do anything to arrest them. That's what this movie is, basically, and although we've seen many movies with this recipe, neither does it become tiresome, nor do the movies become boring or less interesting.Michael Mann is today a director with solid action credits, thanks in part to this film, but also to ""The Insider"" and ""Collateral"". Before this film, he had shown extraordinary competence in directing ""Last of the Mohicans"", a film that I consider an example for harmonizing creative freedom, absolute historical rigor and a great respect for the source material. In this film, Mann does not disappoint and once again gives us solid, consistent, committed and creative direction.For the cast, several great actors with given evidence were called. Of course, it's not possible for everyone to have the same degree of protagonism, but I think that each one of them had the time and material necessary to do a very well done job. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro clearly stand out from the crowd. In addition to having the central characters of the plot, they are both incredibly intense, charismatic, explosive. It's worth watching this duel of the titans. Pacino is the most unlikable and difficult to like because he is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. De Niro is kinder and more human, so it's not hard to root for him. In addition to them, we have the excellent work of Val Kilmer and Jon Voight, and a well accomplished performance of Tom Sizemore. The film also features appearances by Danny Trejo (almost playing himself) and a teenager named Natalie Portman, among many other well-known names.Despite everything, this film has little action, many will say. And really, the priority that was given here is the development of the characters and each of their stories, so that the action is more concentrated in some specific sequences like the anthological sequence of the robbery and shooting in the middle of the street. I liked that, and I liked that this movie tried to be different in a positive way. My only criticism is the slow and tiresome pace that the film assumes most of the time. With a slightly faster pace thanks to some surgical cuts, the film would become lighter.Filmed in Los Angeles, in the city itself (I can only imagine what a logistical nightmare it must have been!), the film couldn't have better sets and costumes, striving for total realism. The special effects work very well, the cinematography is wonderful, and the film is visually very elegant and mature.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
good vdo rental   7/10,"A collection of fine performances turned in by all.  Good plot, decent action sequences--if a tad Holly'd up and over the top.

I mean, really......who says ""baby"" with a straight face these days?  If you want a really bad case of stilted dialogue, rent Heist by David Mamet.....truly cringe-worthy.

Absolutely THE best movie EVER,"You've got two fantastic actors (De Niro & Pacino), a great director (Mann) and a fabulous scenario. So what do you get? The best movie ever. Some would think: ""Three hours? Too long..."" I'd say: ""Three hours? Damn, too short!!!"" Why? This film keeps your mind focused on the scenes, you don't let go, not for a second. No other film has managed to do so in my experiences (maybe The Godfather-trilogy...).I see two, three of the most intriguing scenes in the history of spoken film: an astonishing action scene (after De Niro and his crew robbed the bank) and the long expected confrontation between De Niro and Pacino.

Heat is a HOT movie...,"Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Val Kilmer's, Al Pacino's, and Robert Deniro's.

It was.""Heat"" is a truly epic film -- one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The charisma between Kilmer, Pacino, and Deniro is spectacular. The coffee shop scene between the two latter actors is quite possibly the greatest scene of acting I have ever witnessed. Although a long movie (running close to 3 hours), I was not bored for one minute. Mann keeps the action rolling and allows the actors to be themselves and not caged up. ""Heat"" is an amazing film and I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys great acting, drama, and realistic action. I would give it a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
great movie,"One of my favorite movies of all time. I don't know who's better in this movie. Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro. If you asked me to choose, I'd be hard pressed to pick. They can both play 'bad guy' or 'good guy' equally well. And doesn't Pacino get a chance to act? At times, he's over the top! I love it when he gets a chance to do that! The scene with Hank Azaria in Vegas. Wow! No one does it better. DeNiro is cool & calm throughout, even though he's a hard core killer. The supporting cast is right on the money. The entire film is a work of art. The bank robbery scene lasts 12 minutes & the music is right on the money! I watch it over & over & never get tired of it. Diana Venora is so smooth as Vincent's wife. Her line in the bar about 'sifting through the detritus' is so cool. Overall, one of the best. Thanks Michael Mann.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Not since Bladerunner, has a film touched me on life in such a profound manner within the narrative, yes it has action and drama, but it has a message about peoples lives in modern society, Destiny/fate, spiritual elements, e.g De Niro's Neil: ""I know whatever time we get is luck.""

Has a lot going for it,"I've had 'Heat' on my radar for a long time. Ever since I heard it was an inspiration for 'The Dark Knight' in fact. Were it not for it being almost 3 hours long I probably would've watched it years ago. I've even heard people say this is their favourite film of all time. Needless to say it had a big reputation to live up to. So does it manage it? It tries its best, let's say that.'Heat' is an example of a bunch of people getting together right at the right time, right at the peak of their powers. Writer/Director Michael Mann has never been able to top this movie, and the cast - a truly incredible cast - were at the peak of their powers when the film came out.I feel like this is a film that would get better with every watch.

More than meets the eye.,"Greetings from Lithuania.What can i say about this film, that hasn't been said before.I saw this film for about 7 times, i think. I love this film for a many reasons. Because it's so wonderfully acted and directed (the script is wonderful too). Because it's so epic. Because it's so beautifully sad.This isn't just a ""cops and robbers"" movie - NO. I don't know, maybe it's just my imagination, but in this movie i saw a fight not just between cops and robbers but a battle between good and evil. And it's a breathtaking experience, when in one, just one scene, two characters, who are representing good and evil (and two different worlds), just sit dawn and talk. And they are talking not about film's plot, but about they lives. You can feel how similar they really are. If one of them wouldn't be a cop, and the other a criminal, they would be the best friends (i heard and loved the ""theory"" that Vincent and Neil are brothers, when Neil says to Eady that ""i have a brother somewhere...""). But enough about ""good and evil"".This is a breathtaking action ""heist"" thriller. Yes, i think that scene that goes after bank robbery is the most realistic ""shoot-out"" in a movie history (there are other wonderfully filmed ""shoot-outs"", but this one i will remember for a lifetime). How this film wasn't nominated for a best cinematography, editing and sound effects is beyond my.For this films line A.Pacino will be remembered forever: ""because she had a great xxx !!!"" :). What a great performances, from everyone.By the way, (for a movie buffs), last time i watched ""Heat"", i noticed how big influence this film made for ""The Dark Knight"". The ""interogation"" scene in ""The Dark Knight"" is so similar to a ""conversation"" scene (not just a cinematography). Two main characters talks not about films plot but about them self's, what they do, and how they are fitting in this world. Bank robbery scene i a very familiar to ""The Dark Knight"". And this goes for a real fans: don't know how much of You noticed, but at movies (""Heat"") time 1:06:00 there is a shoot that goes for 6-8 seconds. This shot shows a car, with all the ""bad guys"" when they are going through the city. This is 99% identical shot that was used in ""The Dark Knight"", when Harvey Dent is being transported in a cop car through the city - view goes ""from the sky"", there is no music, no city sounds, just a night and this excellent tune.Watch this ""Los Angeles crime saga"" - this is a timeless art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliantly staged crime epic!!!,"'HEAT' has everything a crime thiller needs, and more. The pacing and style of this film, simply make it a cut above anything the genre's seen before. While watching 'HEAT' it's easy to see that the three main men involved (MICHAEL MANN- DIRECTOR, DE NIRO & PACINO) are all at the height of their powers! Mann's direction is pure genius. His use of the camera is subtle and classic, never resorting to flashy and unnecessary tricks. The plot structure and pace allows the the film to flow seamlessly from, nail biting tension to explosive action. The two lead roles (Pacino's obsessive cop and De Niro's clinical criminal) are so thoroughly characterized, that the audiences loyalties continually swing from one to the other. Michael Mann's masterpiece, in my opinion, is one of the top 10 films of the 90's!!! 10/10!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An excellent cast including Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenneman, Val Kilmer, Ted Levine, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Tom Noonan, and young Natalie Portman. Every actor plays a part in this thick and tense drama, and all do it exceptionally. Michael Mann has more than proven himself as a director with this film. The hauntingly beautiful score just adds to the tone of this great film. Set aside a good 3 hours to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Breathtaking - where are this film's Oscars?,"Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna of the LAPD robbery/homicide division. Now in a third failing marriage, Hanna is a man consumed by his occupation, which exposes him to all the sordid crime and violence for which LA is famous. Robert DeNiro is Neil McCauley, the leader of a successful bank robbing team that includes his protégé Chris Shiherlis, played by Val Kilmer. After a fouled-up heist puts Hanna on McCauley's trail, Heat becomes an elaborate cat and mouse chase between a driven police lieutenant and a seasoned criminal. Writer and director Michael Mann (Manhunter, Miami Vice, Last of the Mohicans), uses the chase as an opportunity to examine two interesting personalities who turn out to be more alike than different.As if Hanna and McCauley didn't already give enough material for three movies, Heat one-ups itself by leaving no supporting characters behind. Chris and his wife, Charlene (Ashley Judd), are given some of the movie's most intense drama, when after the climactic shootout, police use Charlene to lure Chris into captivity. Ashley Judd is given an emotionally restrained moment to reconcile her love for Chris with her desire for a more stable life. From her apartment balcony, she makes a simple hand gesture that signals Chris to turn around and never come back. Chris is forced to accept her decision for fear of being caught. Diane Venora, as Vincent's wife, serves up one of the movie's finest supporting performances. As Justine, she is a woman in an impossible love relationship. Venora balances the anguish with compassion and understanding, making her relationship with Hanna the movie's most engaging.In Heat, even characters with only ten minutes of screen time (or less) are given full character arcs. Dennis Haysbert plays Donald Breedan, whom we first meet outside the context of the major storyline. He applies for a job at a burger joint, where's the manager knows he's a released convict and treats him with great contempt. He takes all of Breedan's tips and pays him less than minimum wage. Haysbert, portraying Breedan as a character who has made a sincere effort to change his life, has very powerful, though brief, scenes with Kim Staunton, who plays his girlfriend, Lillian. When Breedan, disappointed with his job prospects, asks, ""Why are you with me?"", she responds, ""because I'm proud of you"". Haysbert almost cries. With only two short scenes, these characters have already inhabited Heat's world and drawn us into it that much more. When Breedan is propositioned by McCauley to join the big bank heist, we understand why Breedan makes the wrong decision.And when Lillian learns of Breedan's death on the evening news, it's a genuine emotional moment. In mere minutes, we knew these characters - because Heat takes the precious time to introduce them and let them exist as something other than plot points.And there are so many more to know, with well-established actors in all variety of supporting roles: Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, William Fichter, Hank Azaria, Henry Rollins, Tone Loc, and Xander Berkeley. No one is a throw-away. All of them are real in the moments the camera turns to them, giving spice to what is already a remarkable achievement worthy of its tagline - ""a Los Angeles crime saga"".Michael Mann gives Heat his signature visual flare. LA has never looked this good, nor have many films. Dante Spinotti's photography and Mann's framings are nothing short of mesmerizing, aided by a hypnotic soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal, Moby, and other artists. This powerful synthesis hits viewers broadside from the very first shot, one of a railway station at night. Through smoke and fields of blinking city lights, washes of blue and the occasional piercing red, we are drawn into this world in a powerful visual and aural way - matching, if not surpassing, the narrative efforts. Mann, famous for the iconic look of Miami Vice, goes the extra measure in Heat, as evident in scenes at McCauley's home on the ocean, in balcony scenes overlooking the vast city of lights, and in a great number of scenes shot at ""magic hour"", that ten minutes at dawn or dusk when the skies are at their most beautiful. One lush frame blends into another, and the parade never ends until the movie is over. Heat is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. - Scott Schirmer",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The cause, the goal, the ideology : some may be better than others, but each is inhuman in its way. How many bystanders died in the shootout ? And who chose that to happen ?

One of the greatest crime films of all-time; Powerful epic that defies cinematic conventions,"Heat (1995) is an excellent film. I definitely consider it one of the few modern masterpieces. Pacino and De Niro each bring strong performances, and I truly feel De Niro's is one of the top five of his career. Everything about this film makes it jump off the screen. The film chronicles the lives of two men on opposite sides of the law. One is the dedicated detective Lt. Vincent Hanna, portrayed explosively by Al Pacino. On the other side is Neil McCauley, the calm, precise leader of a crew whose sole intention is to take down the biggest score. As the two engage in a tense cat and mouse game, the viewer is put into the action. The epic saga unfolds with effortless grace and subdued charisma.It is a truly visceral cinematic experience. The colors, the music, and the power defy explanation when it comes to talking about Heat. Besides all that, the film has a tremendous supporting cast that makes it hard to pick a favorite character. Val Kilmer is worth noting as the brash, temperamental Chris Shiherlis. Heat is a construction of epic film proportions, directed with poise and passion by Michael Mann, a genius of his time. With all the emotion and tension that Heat exudes, it is worth noting that this film, despite its brutal nature, does have heart. There are subtle moments that let the viewer understand the characters' nuances and thoughts. The film makes you a part of the action, a part of the gritty L.A. backdrop, and a part of something special. The brilliant direction is no more evident than in the famed shootout sequence, in which the action feels strikingly real and in your face. I can't say enough about how I feel about this motion picture. It is a powerhouse that deserves credit for being one of the very best to come out of the '90s, a very good decade for films. If you are having doubts about seeing this film, then do it only for the coffee shop scene between De Niro and Pacino, one of my favorite scenes to watch in the film. Two screen legends taking time out of their film pantheons to sit down and have a little talk over coffee. What could be better than that?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Heat"" isn't a film; it's an event!","Few films are this length (almost 3 hours) and not boring.  And it doesn't take what could be one of the best film action sequences in film halfway through it to be so.  There's always the threat of something bad going to happen in every scene.  And most scenes have the threat realized.  At every turn the film could end but it keeps on going, building the tension for the shoot-out to end the film.  Of course, that is not even the best shoot-out in the film.  The 10-minute exchange between the robbers and the cops is simply *awesome*.  Only great films like Heat or Terminator 1 and 2, etc. can have great action, bang-up, shoot-out sequences but not rely on them to sell the movie.The dialogue's got the mix of snappy remarks, emotional releases, and expositions that make for great film.  It's equal only to the performances of the actors who deliver the lines.  And what actors there are!  Few films combine such a slate of name talent.  Besides the two headliners in the film, most of the actors who play minor characters are now leading actors and actresses in Hollywood (Judd, Portman, Voight, Brenneman, etc.).I wish they would put out a definitive edition for this film with the added scenes for the NBC broadcast.

Heat - an excellent and intelligent crime movie.,"Heat is one of the best films made. This is a thinking man's version of the cops-and robbers genre and it just doesn't have someone being killed every five minutes and something exploding which is ubiquitous in all of the action blockbusters today (which is kind of sad). The characters are three-dimensional and flawed and their relationships are fully explored in this movie. It was good to see two great actors appear in one movie.The two leads, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are dynamite. Pacino and De Niro have played plenty of cops and criminals in their respective careers and this would have to be a major highlight in their impressive filmographies. Al Pacino portrays Vincent Hanna as an intelligent, tough, no-nonsense, obsessive and relentless yet flawed character. Vincent might be a highly decorated cop, but he is so consumed with his work, that it takes its toll on his personal life. He has been divorced at least twice, his daughter is messed up, and his third wife is ready to divorce him. It shows that his job as a cop is his entire life. He's not the type of person to sit around all day.Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley is more restrained than his other characters in the past (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear). Neil McCauley though a career criminal, isn't portrayed as such a bad guy. He is portrayed as a human being with a life. He too, has a personal life which is parallel with Vincent's. He is intelligent, precise, violent and private, though he is lonely and does not have any attachments in his life. The only friends he has are the other criminals he works with and the love interest in his life which plays a big part in the movie later.Val Kilmer is actually pretty good in his otherwise hit-and-miss career. Other supporting actors including Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson and Ted Levine are solid and this keeps the strength of the movie together.The best scenes in the movie were the armoured car robbery (well executed), the pivotal scene where Pacino and De Niro finally meet face to face, the big shootout in downtown L.A. after the bank robbery (realistic and a major highlight in the movie), and the final scene where the two leads have the final showdown.Heat wasn't nominated for any awards, but it was a pretty well acclaimed movie (back in 1995). Michael Mann's direction was brilliant. Cinematography, sound, editing, and music is flawless.One flaw, it is a bit overlong (164 Minutes), but is still a top movie.Rating - 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This was a great movie.,"I saw this movie with my uncle and his friend. Three hours means nothing to me. What did mean a lot to me was the fact that this movie had a great cast of actors and actresses, the writing, directing, and cinematography was great, and well, yeah. Al Pacino and Robert DiNiro are obviously great actors. I knew this before I saw this movie, and I wanted to see these two guys pair up against each other. I loved the diologue. The way every character talks to each other is so great to hear. Diologue is one of my favorite things in movies. I thought that whole bank heist scene that lead to one of the best gun battles in movie history I just said it. I gave this movie a ten in the voting booth.

L.A shoot out,"Heat 1995 This is a re-make of a little known film, made for t.v. called L.A.Take Down / L.A.Crimwave / Made In L.A.(1989) down but with top name actors, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenneman (from judging Amy)and Ashley Judd.

Classic,"I have seen this movie probably 15 or 20 times, and each time I finish it I remain convinced that it deserves consideration as one of the best all-time crime dramas. Certainly it is one of the better assemblages of screen talent you'll see in any movie. Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, together onscreen for the first time since Godfather II, electrify the screen with their roles as cop and thief. The conflicts they face, both with each other and in other areas of their lives, relays to us the great human drama that lies at the heart of the movie. Both actors shine as they try to find balance and stability in their singleminded endeavors. If you don't care to analyze it that deeply, Pacino and DeNiro are simply phenominal actors.Let's not forget the rest of the crew, either. Val Kilmer, in my opinion, gives us the greatest role he has ever played. Tom Sizemore, a perennial supporting player, gives a fabulous performance, one which reminds us of how underrated an actor he is. Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, Jeremy Piven, Natalie Portman, and Henry Rollins (among others) all do their part to add to this masterwork. Michael Mann has solidified himself as a player in American Cinema with his stunning direction of this film. The film owes much of it's effect to Dante Spinotti's cinematography, which includes one of the most intense and impressive shootouts in all of movie history.I can't say enough good things about this film. It is a true classic, possibly the vehicle in which we see the last truly great performances from Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, two giants of the American cinema.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Two of the greats=The Greatest""","If you look at the cast of 'Heat' you must think to yourself that you can't go wrong.  And, yes, this is very true.  But to make a great movie you must, also, have a strong story.  This film has it. The film follows two sides to a very gripping story.  On one side, you have the on-edge detective, Vincent Hanna (played exceptionally by Al Pacino). You see the drama and heartache he must go through to be so dedicated to his work.  On the other side, you have Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley, who, in his own right, is a honest man.  The regrets he has and the pain he faces by being a criminal are both well played without exactly making you feel sorry for him.  Then, as the two slowly some together through their own destinies, you get to see the bond and similarities they share.  This film actually has three climactic points.  The first is the meeting in the coffee house.  It is there that they both show how much they actually respect each other.  The second is the robbery sequence.  This is probably one of the greatest action sequences ever to grace film.  The final climax is just that, the final sceen.  It is the final showdown between Pacino and De Niro.Now, as I have already said, the film's two main stars could at least make this worth watching.  But the directing by Michael Mann and the supporting cast are what really make this movie so attractive.  Val Kilmer as Chris Shiherlis gives a unique side story to the film.  It's the relationship with his wife, played by Ashley Judd, that we find ourselves being drawn into. Wes Studi and Mykelti Williamson play Vincent Hanna's right hand men.  And, Tom Sizemore plays the third out of three crucial parts to the gang.  You also can't forget the musical score.  Beautifully played, it really accents the happenings of the movie. This is the only movie in my life that I can literally watch over and over again.  The reason why, because I can never decide what outcome I want.  Do I want Hanna to catch McCauley, or do I want McCauley to keep driving for the airport before he veers off to the hotel.  The final, seemingly most important part of this movie, the clasping of hands.  When Hanna is holding McCauley's hand you really get a sense of what this movie is about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What a Cult Classic michael Mann movie!,"This is one of Michael Mann's best movies. I think it is also loosely based
on a British tv series which I also love called 'The Sweeney, in particular Series 1 episode 4 entitled 'Queen's Pawn'. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro again do a great acting job in their roles, well supported from the rest of the cast. There is wonderful cinematography which is purposefully matched with pulsating sound staging and a music score all the way through as is typical of Michael Mann's movies. It's fast paced, action packed with just enough tension all the way through to keep you tied to your sofa and even swear when the pizza man rings the doorbell ! Be in no doubt that this is a cult movie and I am proud to say I have watched this many times over. A massive thumbs up from me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best in the cops & robbers genre,"This is one of my all time favorite movies; an exciting and well worked-out tale of cops vs robbers. Everything in this movie is well done: script and screenplay are sharp, exciting, but realistic. Acting is strong throughout: DeNiro and Pacino have hardly been better, and the supporting cast is strong right down to every minor character.Without giving away details, here's a number of scenes that stand out and real fans will enjoy giving these a closer look to see what I mean about strong acting (as if the scenes don't speak for themselves): - DeNiro in the scene where McCauley confronts Chris' wife (Judd) - Scenes where McCauley and Nate (Voigt) interact, such as when they make their goodbyes. - Pacino in scenes where Hanna interacts with his informant (and the informant's brother) - The scene where Hanna comes home to his wife and Ralph. - The scenes between Breedan (Haysbert), the getaway driver, and his girlfriend. Also: The diner's manager's abuse of ex-cons like Breedan. - Of course: the DeNiro/Pacino coffeeshop scene.At the time, critics mostly seemed to object to the (over)length of the movie. In my opinion, this merely reflects the lack of other aspects (flaws) of this film that warrant any comment. I say: you can't get enough of a good thing. There's nothing wrong with a movie spending time on character development, so long as the characters are interesting and they contribute to the story. This certainly applies for Heat, which provides characters with a complete and complex personal background, which adds realism, creates involvement with characters and their motives, and adds to the excitement and atmosphere in action and suspense scenes.In todays era of fast-paced Hollywood action flicks, movies like Heat, that have the patience to tell a complete story, are a rarity and should be cherished. If you have enjoyed this movie as much as I have, you can be sure to enjoy other work by director Michael Mann (e.g. Collateral, Miami Vice) as well - but you knew that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

After watching again on video, I can't overlook some unrealistic aspects. The failure of the team (Deniro)to eliminate Waingro was laughable. This is a crack team of no-nonsense criminals. They would have blown him away immediately at the crime scene and removed any evidence of their M.O. or later outside the restaurant they would not have let him slip away that easily. Pacino's scene with Tone Loc is almost embarrassing. The situation with Pacino and his girlfriend and her daughter could have been more interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
How great is this film? Say it with me...,"This film is just SO good. No,scrap that, good isn't the word for it. Sublime, flawless, compelling, inspiring, exciting, intelligent and just damn satisfying are all words which must be used when describing this film. Possibly my favourite of all time, Heat takes the viewer on a never less than enthralling trip into the world of the cop and the robber, the hunter and the hunted. I'm not going to go into the storyline suffice to say that Michael Mann has taken a tired and seemingly unoriginal genre and slapped it around until it resembles something altogether different. (But not that different obviously.) By giving as much of the film's focus over to the criminals as the cops trying to catch them, the film achieves an unparalleled level of authenticity with each side reacting to the others best attempts of capture/evasion being one of the films great strengths.It says a lot when the only criticisms that can be levelled at a film are it's length (a criticism which holds no meaning given how wrapped up the viewer becomes in it all), it's lack of action scenes (of which there are plenty for the mood of the film including one of the 'greatest' shoot outs of all time) and part of the ending (which is, I admit, a little out of character of the meticulous McAuley). But these are of little importance when everything else is so good. The acting is uniformly excellent with even Val Kilmer turning in something resembling a dramatic performance. Then of course there is the meeting of two of the most accomplished screen actors around (YES YES YES, the coffee shop scene IS as great as everyone makes out.) A haunting soundtrack ,which nobody else seems to have mentioned, direction which takes in the 'real' settings of L.A. to their most stark and startling effect, realistic characterisation and a storyline that is as unsinkable as the Titanic was meant to be all add up to make Heat one of the greatest crime flicks ever put onto celluloid. See it. Be amazed. See it again. Be amazed again etc.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best crime movies,"Michael Mann's Heat is an extraordinary crime drama that stands as one of the greatest films of the 1990s, a masterwork of direction, writing, and performance. Released in 1995, Heat is a visceral and intellectual exploration of criminality, the law, and the human condition, delivered with an impeccable sense of pacing, tension, and emotional depth. The film offers an intricate narrative that unpacks the complex dynamics between its central characters, most notably the cat-and-mouse game between a master thief and a seasoned detective.At the heart of Heat is Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), a highly skilled professional thief who lives by a strict code: ""Don't get attached to anything you can't walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner."" McCauley is a man of few words but deep introspection, haunted by his own isolation. On the other side is Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), an intense and driven detective, equally consumed by his work and torn by his personal life. The film follows their paths, which inevitably converge as they become locked in a battle of wits and will.The dynamics between McCauley and Hanna are the core of Heat, and the actors bring depth to their characters that turns what could have been a straightforward crime thriller into a layered and rich exploration of obsession, morality, and the loneliness that often accompanies such high-stakes lives. De Niro's portrayal of McCauley is understated yet commanding, a man of discipline and pragmatism, with the internal void that comes with his lifestyle laid bare. Pacino, meanwhile, gives one of his most compelling performances as Hanna, a man driven to extremes by his commitment to the law but equally fractured by his inability to balance his work and personal life.What makes Heat so unique is its ability to blur the lines between protagonist and antagonist. While McCauley is a criminal, he is not a traditional villain; he follows a code, has principles, and feels the weight of his actions. Hanna, too, is not without flaws. His single-minded pursuit of justice and his fractured personal relationships make him a deeply human character. Their scenes together-especially the now-iconic diner conversation-are some of the most riveting in cinematic history, not just because of the tension but also because of the intellectual engagement. This isn't just a face-off between good and evil but rather a nuanced exploration of two men who, despite being on opposite sides of the law, share a similar emotional and existential emptiness.Mann's direction is masterful throughout, balancing the sprawling narrative with sharp attention to detail. The film's pacing, despite its 170-minute runtime, never lags, and the tension builds consistently. The film's action scenes are both meticulously choreographed and emotionally resonant. The legendary downtown Los Angeles shootout, in which McCauley and his crew are pursued by Hanna and his team, is one of the most gripping action sequences in film history. Shot with an unflinching realism, it captures the chaos and the desperation of the characters' situation while also conveying the high stakes of the confrontation.Visually, Heat is stunning. Mann's use of the Los Angeles skyline at night becomes a character in itself, reflecting the cold, impersonal world the characters inhabit. The cinematography by Dante Spinotti is rich and atmospheric, with shots of rain-soaked streets and neon-lit alleyways adding a moody, noir-ish quality to the film.The screenplay, written by Mann, is dense and layered with themes of trust, betrayal, identity, and the cost of a life devoted to crime or law enforcement. One of the film's most powerful themes is the duality of the characters: Hanna's obsession with the case and McCauley's commitment to his criminal career leave them both estranged from those they care about, whether it's Hanna's troubled marriage to his wife, Justine (Diane Venora), or McCauley's brief, doomed relationship with a woman named Eady (Amy Brenneman). The film portrays the cost of their lifestyles-not just in terms of personal loss but in the ways they are consumed by their respective obsessions.The supporting cast is also outstanding. Val Kilmer, as McCauley's partner Chris Shiherlis, brings a subtlety to his role, while Tom Sizemore, as the tough but vulnerable Michael Cheritto, rounds out McCauley's crew with equal depth. The performances of these actors, alongside those of De Niro and Pacino, elevate Heat into something transcendent, creating a cinematic experience that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally powerful.Ultimately, Heat is a film that explores the inevitability of conflict, both external and internal. It's a meditation on the cost of living a life at the edges of society and the toll it takes on those involved. As McCauley and Hanna's fates intertwine, Mann crafts a conclusion that feels both inevitable and tragic, leaving viewers with a profound sense of loss and contemplation.In conclusion, Heat is not merely a crime film; it is a profound reflection on the human experience, the consequences of our choices, and the loneliness that pervades both sides of the law. With a superbly written script, unforgettable performances, and a direction that elevates every scene, Heat remains a cinematic masterpiece, as compelling and relevant today as it was at its release.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Really Good,"*Heat*Over the years I've been told I had a weird taste in movies.  Unlike most girls my age I would rather watch a Robert De Niro movie over a Freddie Prinze Jr. one.

Anyway I enjoyed Heat very much.Al Pacino plays the cop, Robert De Niro plays the bad guy.  Just having those two leads it's obvious this will be no ordinary movie.  Their first meeting is in a coffee shop.  The scene is incredibly well done.  I kept thinking ""Micheal, your father loves you very much,"" but they were playing completely different characters from The Godfather II.Many people complain about the length of Heat but it didn't bother me.  It allowed you to get to know the character's lives outside of their jobs.  De Niro and Pacino give great performances and so do it's supporting cast.

The best movie,"Well, it's up there anyway.This is the rare flawless movie, a great movie by Michael Mann during a string of excellent movies, including The Last of the Mohicans, Heat, and The Insider. However, neither of those two films, while both fantastic, can raise a candle to Heat. The two-DVD set of the movie features lots of informative additional material including a commentary by Mann, featurettes about the journey from the screenplay to the screen, a documentary returning to sites visited during the movie, one about the famous scene featuring DeNiro and Pacino together on camera for the first time in their careers. The film itself is worthy of such attention as it addresses the lives of a group of accomplished, high-end bank robbers and the detectives charged with tracking them down in all their complexity, from the toll their careful planning and preparation takes on their relationships and personal lives, to the success of the operations themselves and the duties that the men undertake in their attempt to free $12 million from a bank. The title of the film refers to the proximity of stress, of challenges in a person's life, about the point at which stresses cause discomfort, at which one's comfort zone is disturbed, whether that be, as seems to be the case for the men (primarily) in this film who are work-obsessed, or whether it be through dysfunctional relationships, whether it be via unhealthy work relationships, via affairs uncompleted or something else. It speaks to the idea, finally that one aspect of a life is ultimately inseparable from another part.The film is a nearly perfect depiction of the intersection of the complexities of relationships and work lives and how this complexity affects us. How Mann manages to make such a grown-up, subtly sophisticated movie is almost impossible to know, but Heat is a perfect balance of how lives cannot be compartmentalized forever and how actions have reactions, regardless of how long ago they happened, regardless of the physical distance from the person or the circumstances now. The film is so wonderful, that in summarizing it, I am unnerved that perhaps I might de-value it or not do it justice. The ensemble cast is fantastic, particularly Diane Venora as Justine Hanna, an artist and Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino in a superbly calibrated performance)'s third wife who is tired of being the third wheel in a marriage between Hanna and his career. Pacino and DeNiro are unsurprisingly excellent. Pacino plays, with perfect nuance, an accomplished detective whose job significantly supersedes all other elements of his life his life. That said, he is a good man who is a more devoted father to his step-daughter (Natalie Portman in her second major role) and whose focus is true and untainted by blandishments that some cops might not be able to resist. Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is a world-class thief and equally focused man but is a sociopath in that the loss of innocent life does not detract from his intent to complete a theft successfully. Ultimately, he is self-centered while Hanna is a devoted public servant. In most other ways, however, they are two sides of the same coin. He emphasizes to Hanna during their meeting in a coffee shop that, if circumstances get too hot (another instance of the meaning of the title of the movie), that he will leave the scene. As he puts it, ""that's where the discipline comes in."" However, he has no reluctance about taking a cop or a civilian in the way out, if they interfere with his goal of completing the robbery successfully. Tom Sizemore, Mykelti Williamson, and Dennis Haysbert in particular, are excellent in supporting roles, Sizemore evincing a devotion to Neil McCauley that bespeaks a man who owes a great deal to someone and perhaps the devotion of someone who is in awe of someone while Mykelti Williamson seems the ideal police officer for his compassion but also for his discipline and commitment to upholding laws. He is a tribute to excellent police work. Dennis Haysbert's part in the film is poignant and bespeaks the larger forces, the larger palette against which all our actions take place. He must decide between going straight in a thankless dead-end job for a cold, demanding boss taking one last job on the chance that it will be a big payday. Ashley Judd as Charlene Shihirlis, the wife of one of Neil's crew (Val Kilmer also fantastic, as Chris Shiherlis) is concerned that her relationship is dysfunctional and that her husband is not adequately committed to assuring its success, and that, as a result, her son will not be adequately cared for. She is a woman who, from Mann's commentary on the DVD imagines her as the wife of a high-end thief who grew up rough and had some unpleasant experiences growing up, but just wants to settle down and attempt to live a fairly conventional life. The tension between husband and wife and drives her into the arms of a small-time Vegas crook (the fantastic Hank Azaria who conveys small-time sliminess and short-sighted misogyny better, perhaps than anyone ever has in movie history).Mann must be given ultimate credit for weaving all the strings together so adeptly and conveying the inter-relatedness of the different parts of our lives. His imagination and clear- eyed vision of what motivates and drives us all makes this film an epic, a film ostensibly about thieves and cops, but one which ultimately speaks to the higher purpose which all must find on this earth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Slower build paced consensus crime heist thriller,"What is considered one of the greatest heist films or to be the standard of heist films in Hollywood cinema history. Heat is a rather lengthy and slower paced build of a film. There he definitely a lot occurring and it is best dissecting each part to fully evaluate.Of course it is beloved by those of film buffs and critics due to mainly the leads of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, both delivering great showey performances.The action is great, the scenery is very solid moving. There is a bit much romance subplot involved but considering its runtime its expected. However at times the film feels like it drags on a little.Its ending is quite comical. How was Pacino able to spot DeNiro in a crowd full of hundreds of screaming people and able to track him down. Somewhat of a letdown ending. This is a film which definitely requires full attention to detail, otherwise you may miss something important along the way. Perhaps multiple viewings is best served.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This movie trashes all of the cliches about cops n' robbers,"Perfect. Every aspect of this film was perfect, from the acting, to the cinematography to the story line. It was excellent to see Pacino and De Niro, perhaps the two greatest actors in the history of crime-genre movies, finally appear as nemeses. The fact that they didn't appear on screen together for most of the movie was also a great buildup to the diner scene. Fabulous character study between the two--it trashes the usually superficial emotive tendency to cheer for the ""good guy"" and hate the ""bad guy."" Like De Niro's character asks, ""What is normal?"" Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy? Above all, I loved the viscerality--each of these guys is in it for the thrill, not for money or convictions. Not so for the lesser characters in the film, but this, too, feels appropriate, and throughout the movie, I felt a hair's breadth away from each character's id. The cinematography was also amazing. The gun battle in the street early on in the movie was the most gripping scene I've ever experienced, and the diner scene is also one for the ages--nothing on the screen except for two great egos matched up against each other for the thrill of the fight.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's okay,"""Heat"" (1995) is a crime thriller directed by Michael Mann, known for its intense action sequences, complex characters, and intricate plot.

Why all the 10's??,I mean it's not a bad film but there is way too much fluff for an action film. Way too many sub plots with relationships that are not needed. Especially the step daughter with Pacino. If the story had of been better those would not be needed in a cops and robbers film which is exactly what they portray this as. And my biggest complaint is the over acting. Usually Pacino balances it very well but this movie it's so noticeable for some reason. Personally I think this was a cash grab to get Pacino and De Niro on screen together. And lastly these movies do not age well. They scream late 90's mid 2000's.,5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best example of an improvement of an own work,Heat is the remake of Michael Mann´s TV Movie LA Takedown. As I saw Heat the very first time in the cinema in 1996 here in Germany I was very surprised that I watch a movie where I know what happened next. But Heat is the perfection of LA Takedown. It has replaced Scott Plank / Michael Rooker with Al Pacino / Robert De Niro and this with the combination of the very good cuts of this movie is the secret of the success of this masterpiece from Michael Mann.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Michael Mann is a GENIUS!,"This really is a sophisticated cops and robbers film. Before scripting this film, Michael Mann did months of interviews with convicts in the California penal system.

Of course it does not hurt to have two of the greatest actors of our time in it. DeNiro and Pacino rival each other in a great display of dramatic talent.

A Modern Crime Masterpiece,"This movie promised so much. A powerhouse cast including De Niro and Pacino together on-screen for the first time and director Michael Mann's abilities as a filmmaker very much in the ascendancy, how could it possibly deliver? Well it does, in spades.Pacino has the showier role of Vincent Hanna, an instinctive career detective and Pacino pitches it just right without being too flamboyant. De Niro is Neil Macauley, the cool and chillingly collected head of a gang of professional thieves. Much is made of the contrast between the problems with personal relationships that both are experiencing but De Niro is also grappling with a psychotic gang member, a slippery businessman whose bail bonds he has stolen along with the heat he fears is 'just around the corner'.Mann's taut and muscular direction makes the most of the LA locations and the grimly professional action scenes only bring even more depth to the multi-layered and detailed plot. Two scenes in particular remain in the memory: a casual encounter between cop and criminal in a coffee shop (the only scene between Pacino and De Niro) and a botched bank raid of such ferocity that will have the hairs standing up on the back of your neck.Incredibly well directed and acted and almost mythic in places, HEAT is a definitive work in the crime thriller genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quite brilliant,"My main reason for watching ""Heat"" when it was on TV tonight was to see if it was as good as I remember I thought it was when I saw it at the cinema in 1996. I was awed when I walked out of the theater that day, but I haven't seen it since so I was kind of curious. And hey, even if the film is only half as good as I thought it was back then, it's a film I want to watch again!So, yes I can say that ""Heat"" is almost as good as I thought it was the first time I saw it. It's a fantastic mix of thriller, action, and drama and the acting is top notch... Well; De Niro, Pacino... it's *better* than top notch. My main complaint, though, is that it is sadly too long. Had it been shorter I would have enjoyed it so much more, but it is still a quite brilliant film, very entertaining. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Complex, drawn out story with some action thrown in","Technically the film was superb: realistic make-up; excellent use of lighting and filters; smooth and realistic sound...an A+ for the technical guru's behind this film. If you can stand the 3 hours long film just to bask in the glorious visuals and audios, you will have no regrets.The action in this film can only be described as a don't-blink-hold-your-breath-till-its-done tour de force. Each action sequence begins with a bang (literally) and ends with a bang. They are violent, terrifying, and yet beautiful to observe at the same time. A+ for the choreographers, stunt-men, and actors for giving us high octane action scenes that, without any doubt, stole the show.So why only a 7 out of 10? Two words....story and pacing. The story, in premise, has potential for being a great classic film of cat-and-mouse between a hardcore cop against a cold and determined crook. And yet we, the audience, are subjected to 3 hours of long, drawn out scenes mostly involving the mediocre lives of the two main characters. There are scenes in this film which in the grand scheme of things have absolutely no point what-so-ever in being in this film. Plot points that would have been taken care of in probably 5 minutes are drawn out in complex detail to the point of monotony. Now, in some cases, this approach works; however, for the vast majority of the film they are unnecessary and ruin the overall pace of the film. Mann, a veteran film-maker, should have known better. C for effort, but even that is generous in my book.I also felt the ambiguous morality of the film to be questionable. When the film nears its climax, you are still divided over who to cheer for: the cop or the crook. In a film that clearly shows that the cop, although flawed, is good and the crook, with ""some"" redeeming qualities, is evil, the audience is left with an ambivalent attitude toward the fate of both. Once again, pacing is at fault. After 3 hours of feet dragging, you simply don't care about either of them anymore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I Didn't feel the Heat,I watched this movie because of the ratings and thought okay it would be really good with a rating of 8.2 because its a heist movie and oh how i love heist movies.There really wasn't any heat to be honest but i understand it was a 1995 movies as well so it was okay in his own right and in the year it was produced.The last robbery i was really expecting the bank robbery to be sophisticated and the way di nero bragged about the scores i thought he would be tricky in his next scores but nothing really came out.Felt more like a drama it was unecessarily long i know they don't do movies like that again.Its just an okay movie the real ratings should be at 7 not 8.2 its misleading.,5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

He was pretty good in ""Jackie Brown"" as well, but I consider this his best role. I usually like Al Pacino's work, though this role, IMO, was not a good match for his talent, or he just didn't have his heart in this one. His outbursts weren't convincing at all to me.

Easy 9,"It's probably the best robbery film ever made; plus, it has that scene with DeNiro and Pacino meeting in the diner.The real question is, why isn't this movie a 10?1. The scenes with the wives didn't need to be in it at all. Both being acted horribly didn't help. DeNiro's love interest is the only one that needed to be in it, and that's arguable. The domestic affairs added nothing, they only took away. The worst being Pacino's wife and stepdaughter. There is no way anyone on the planet would consider those scenes 'entertainment'.2.

Arguably Michael Mann's finest work of art!,"I could not believe how excelent this film was when I first saw it for the first time. It absolutely blew me away. Pacino and DeNiro are great together, and Mann assembled a fine cast of supporting actors such as Val Kilmer and Jon Voigt. The action scenes are unforgettable in their realism as Mann brought in Andy MacNab to be the technical advisor. You can really see the military influence in the combat scenes. But what really sells the movie is the story and script. If less intelligent than ""The Heist,"" it is much clearer and easier too understand and much better. Another great aspect is the fact that there really isn't a ""good guy"" or vilain. While DeNiro is supposed to be the bad guy, you find yourself wanting him to end with a good ending for him. While the very end of the movie may not be up to scratch and not really believable, it is very good and should not discourage people from seeing it.

In My Top 5!,"It would seem logical that a movie with two of the greatest actors ever (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro) would have to be an incredible movie.  After all, this is only the second movie in which both have appeared (Godfather II, the other) and the first where they are together on screen.  But, the general public never seemed to take to Heat.  It did not do very good business at the box office, was not even one of the top 10 grossing movies in the year of its release (1995).  In listing the best movies ever (or favorite movies) no one will mention it.  Maybe people did not like how long it was (171 minutes is pretty long for this type of film).  Maybe there were too many other good choices in 1995 (Braveheart, Se7en, The Usual Suspects, to name a few). But, the people who have seen it must love it, because (at the time this was written) it is in IMDb's top 250.Having said all that, I love this movie.  In fact, I place it on my top 6 list of favorite movies.  These may not be the best movies, but they are the ones I love to watch.  (The list, for those who are interested is, in order: The Godfather, Fight Club, Casablanca, L.A. Confidential, Heat, and Gladiator.)Movies are great when characters are complex.  The two main characters, a detective (Pacino) and a thief (De Niro), are very similar.  The movie follows the two men as the thief plans for his ""last big heist"" and the detective tries to nab him.  The two seem very similar in many ways.  You can hope the thief gets away with it without feeling guilty (he is a decent person), and maybe root against the detective a little without remorse (he is an egomaniac).  They are both the best at what they do and as the movie follows their paths, you cannot help but think these two could be twins separated at birth you chose different paths.The other part of this movie that I like so much is the end.  Without giving anything away, let me say this.  Most movies like to leave you with a good feeling when they are done, a great movie is unafraid to leave you a little disappointed at the end.  You will notice from my list of 6 that three of those movies do that to you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A glued-to-your-seat kind of experience,"I remember this movie getting panned by some critics when it came out, which is partly why I haven't made seeing it a top priority. Then, through the years, I kept hearing positive references to it, usually by acquaintances but occasionally by film makers who would speak on director Michael Mann's visual pallette and tonal choices. So tonight, as I recover from a cold, I decided to give Heat a chance, all 2 hours and 50 minutes of it.Outstanding. Like hella good. I don't know what the naysayers were smoking because this is masterpiece level work. I'm serious. I didn't think I would make it through the whole thing in one sitting but once it grabs you it doesn't let go until the credits roll; that is a the ideal state to be in as a movie watcher.I don't remember what the criticisms were of the film, nor do I care much now about them, but I think it might have been something about having two movie stars involved in a project of this scale and only have one (maybe one point five) scenes together in a three hour span. What a stupid critique. The story calls for these titans not to spend much time together, and in fact that is the literal point of the movie, even tying the title into the story.So yes, Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino are as good as you'd hope for, in the prime of their careers, but Mann assembles one of the best overall casts I've ever seen. I mean we got Oscar winning actors in small supporting roles. The production is as good as any, including action sequences, but the intimacy is where the director shines. He makes it so that the city itself is almost its own character, and with a masterclass on how to rarely (or never) use CGI.I can see why Christopher Nolan references Michael Mann more than a few times during his career. It looks a lot like what a Nolan film would look like if shot in the mid-90's. The movie somehow is able to take its time as it moves things along with pace, as oxymoronic as that sounds. It's rare for me to watch that long of a movie at home without pausing it at least once for some reason (a snack, bathroom break, whatever), but here it happened. So, I'll just store this in the ""critics-don't-know-squat"" file.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A classic in the crime genre,"The film showcases the electrifying dynamic between Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, who play an expert thief and a dedicated detective, respectively. The film's strength lies in its realistic portrayal of both sides of the law, delving into the complex lives of the characters. De Niro brings depth and complexity to his character, while Pacino delivers his trademark intensity. Their on-screen chemistry is electric, making their confrontations all the more riveting.While the performances are stellar, and the action is pulse-pounding, ""Heat"" does suffer from a lengthy runtime, occasionally slowing down the pacing. Additionally, some may find the film's sprawling narrative a bit overwhelming.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of my favorites,"I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. With a cast like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, and Ashley Judd just to name a few, you have some of the best acting in the business. The story provides drama, a little romance and a lot of action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Really not that great...,"I saw ""Heat"" years ago and never thought much of it. Some friends encouraged me to try it again and I did. My opinion hasn't changed.I'm sorry, but this movie is basically a horrendously drawn-out 'cops and robbers' movie centred around an amazing five minute gunfight. Pacino's character came off half the time as a stereotypical ""problem"" cop. He spends the other half of the film trying to spout off asinine lines that make him sound like an obnoxious assclown.For such a solid cast, I felt there was a real lack of character development. You don't much care about Val Kilmer and Ashley Judd's failing relationship, and I found it hard to feel very upset about Natalie Portman's attempted suicide when up to that point she'd had a whole three lines of dialogue. Pacino and his wife's problems just seemed too stereotypical and stale for their to be much thought put to it.The only relationship that even remotely worked was that of De Niro and Amy Brenneman, mainly because it was force-fed to us as the movie progressed. And the whole 'De Niro/Pacino' showdown that this movie was supposed to be was somewhat of a let-down. Although their one scene together was written and acted superbly, the rest was incredibly underwhelming, including their final, pretentiously suspenseful stand off.All in all, an over-rated, overly long cop drama. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Haze of L.A. Lights Never Looked Better,"A lacquered film, yes, but brimming with thought and accepted axioms is Michael Mann's ""Heat"" (1995). You won't see any glam cops strutting their way down an imaginary runway (Michael Mann was a strong force for the TV series ""Miami Vice"") but you will see plausibly hardened characters who struggle and keep in cadence with their respective propensities.L.A.P.D. Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is a consummate professional in law enforcement and investigation. Seasoned thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a consummate professional in stealing in all its forms - he's an ironically considerate one, though (""Your money is insured by the federal government - you're not gonna lose a dime,"" he harangues a frightened bunch of customers as he's holding up a bank.). Most of the film is spent watching these two attempt to outmaneuver each other - as if this were a game of chess using real people instead of pieces made out of wood.These two men are the same type, except one plays yin to the other's yang. There's a scene of dialogue between the two in a coffee shop of all places that almost jumps off the screen it's so crammed with kinetic energy - it's like what it would be like to witness a conversation between Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. In it they both reveal their inescapable connection to their respective jobs - they love their women but cannot properly fit them in to their time-consuming routines. It's as if they're both resigned to their fates - they know one of them is going to die due to the heat coming around the cornerCoppola's ""The Godfather Part II"" is the best of all crime films and it seems appropriate that this one ranks in as a close runner-up - these two films are the only ones to have both Pacino and De Niro simultaneously in the cast. Both films are exquisite pieces of art in the guise of entertainment flicks. The former being about the gradual and inevitable annihilation of a family due to the nature of preoccupation - the latter being about the nature of preoccupation that precluded everything else.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good film,", I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"The end-result is large, noisy and borderline emblematic","Michael Mann brought the action-genre out of its formulaic, hyperbolic 1990s formula and made it ready for the new millennium with this comprehensive cat-and-mouse movie starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. It was the iconic actors' first pairing since The Godfather Part II, and the first ever film in which they shared screen-time together - although in Heat, much of the power lies in the anticipation of their encounters, not the realization of them. The basis for the film is an essentially simple crime/heist story made wide-reaching and multifaceted by crafty writing. Michael Mann had been wanting to get this idea filmed for decades; it was his magnum opus in waiting. He even made a quasi-version with the TV movie L. A. Takedown in 1989 as some sort of dress rehearsal. Luckily, he waited until he was able to get the muscle, the talent and the confidence to take the director's chair himself before rebooting his script and getting the film off the ground. The end-result is large, noisy and borderline emblematic, but also atmospheric and seductive. The direction is so tight and industrious that the enormous scale and extensive running time is not only justified, but downright necessary. Even after Mann has gone on detour after detour, you still want him to take you on another after two plus hours. And as the movie crowds you with a who's who of '90s movie stars and character actors, set up in separate but not necessarily very divergent camps of good-guys and bad-guys, you feel snugly encompassed by their dangerous fantasy world where every second of life is lived to the fullest. A crisp, slimmed down Robert De Niro, looking like a younger version of himself, gave his final great performance. Val Kilmer created a harrowingly obsessed character, and Jon Voight was more in touch with himself on-screen than he had been in a long time. The only let-down among the cast is Al Pacino, who too often resorts to shouting and staring instead of acting and reacting, although he does redeem himself with a couple of fine moments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best bank heist movie ever,"To me 'Heat' is without a doubt, one of the best movies ever known to man. It has an extremely good cast and an excellent bank scene. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro two of the world's best actors mixed together in one film was a very good idea.The most exciting thing in the film was the bank heist. The minute De Niro walked in I was switched on and found it hard to switch off after wards. They handed the customers and guards very carefully and managed to make it out of the bank with all the money and without any of the bank employees alerting the cops. It's not like movies where some people take one step in the bank and the cops on the way (Ocean's Eleven, considering it's a Vault heist).After wards came the best shootout ever. Where the crew blast there way out of the police stronghold, which would've seemed impossible for any petty thief to handle.These are my thoughts on one of the best movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The movie kept me glued to my seat from start till finish, despite its nearly 3 hour run time.  I've read various criticisms of the movie, usually involving length and/or the heavy focus given to the personal relationships of both the cops and criminals.  However, if you allow yourself to be drawn into the movie, you'll find that those aspects are actually strengths and not weaknesses.  Michael Mann doesn't shy away from anything, he wants to show us what it's like to live and breath as these characters do, and as a movie watching experience, it's absolutely gripping.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

ACTION THRILLERThis rating is purely for it's realistic action set pieces and not for it's originality, for the 'heist' thing has already been done hundreds of times before with the only difference is that in this version directed by Michael Mann the set up is much more current than say ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Rififi"" and perhaps the Hong Kong movie ""Long Arm Of The Law"" films starting from 1984 to 1989 where viewers sympathize with the heist group wondering whether or not they'll ever get away.

True Review,"After reading all the amazing reviews on here I was expecting a master piece! Spoiler... This is not even close!Questionable character relationships and interactions throughout, especially between the film's 2 main characters deniro and Pacino, just didn't buy it.The plotline deviated unnecessarily several times, its like they couldn't decide what kind of film they wanted it to be. Heist movie? Serial killer? Drama? Romantic? We had events that had no correlation or impact to the movies main plot. The film was predictable throughout and did not really amaze or shock me at any point, an absolute bore.I love lengthy films, Lord of the rings director's cut 4hrs, BRILLIANT! Godfather 3 hrs Brilliant! Avatar nearly 3 hrs Brilliant! You get the point....this however was pointlessly long! I watched it all the way to the end coz I thought there must be a great ending, shocker! There wasn't, just predictable nonsense.Worst Al Pacino performance I've ever seen, the character did not suit his acting style, deniro was excellent on his own, smart fearless criminal... Easy.

Watch This Movie !,"This ""Cops & Robbers"" movie is the Shawshank Redemption, the Platoon, the Forest Gump, the Star Wars, and the Schindler's List of it's particular genre. It is THE standard bearer for all police vs bad guys shoot'em up movies.This is NOT your run of the mill cops and robbers movie. Be most certain of that. To be frank, I don't even like this genre of films. Because it's sooo tired, and sooo played. Yet Heat is anything but boring. Ha ! How did they do this ??? I've asked myself.....well...Firstly, Heat is unusually well cast. Undeniably so. What a perfect grouping of talent welded together under an unusually good script and screenplay.The acting is first rate++. Even the B actors dish out stellar performances in Heat. The directing ~ outstanding! Talent is ubiquitous throughout this cinematic work. Razors. Really sharp folks put this together.This is a long movie pushing 3 hours. The main plot (and subplots) develops brilliantly. This movie builds in suspense as the characters are allowed to properly develop, yielding a very credible storyline. IMO, this particular feature really helped to shape this film into the wonderful gem it is.The movie has numerous events and scenes that are jarring, and truly capture the attention of the moviegoer, but they do so without hamming it up. And these play out consistently and repeatedly throughout the entire movie. There's no jumping the shark in this film. It is not ripe with cheap overacting. Neither will you be sold a conglomeration of special effects in predictable Hollywood packaging. This is not that movie. This movie is intelligently thought out. Heat, even with a seemingly ""over played"" general theme, breathes new life into Bank Heist movies with a full throated blow. Very realistic scenes.This movie fascinates me. I saw it twice when it was out at the theaters. I own the DVD and have probably watched it about 25 times since then, and will continue to occasionally watch it. It's one of my ""select"".I will not be a Spoiler. However, I will say the opening scene of the climax portion of this movie (occurs well into the movie) should only be watched with the volume turned way up. And if you have surround sound, this is THE movie to use such a system on. This scene ....screams for a high volume sound system. This particular scene lasts about 10-12 minutes. It is intensely violent yet realistic. Again, there was no hamming it up. Yet Wow what a scene! It unfolds with about as much intensity as the viewer can bare before saying ok, ""this was overdone"". Instead, it's utterly perfect in intensity and stops short of being at all ridiculous. The perfect shootout scene. No room to improve.So there you have it. I felt an opinion from a guy who absolutely abhors this genre of films might lend some credibility to this particular film. Watch it....get some popcorn, order a pizza and kickback. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the great movie of the 90's,"There are too many superlatives regarding this movie to be listed.I have viewed it about 5 times and still it entertaining. It is a very violent movie, so if you are squeamish about such things take a pass. Heat has a varied assortment of complex characters. The story line is basically about the world of violent criminals and the man who brings them together for the purpose of engaging in high profile crimes that have huge financial rewards. Denero plays the genius who leads them and Pacino the cop who wants to bring him down. The acting is first rate. Watch the interplay between DeNero and Pacino in the restaurant scene in which each is telling the other about their lives and goals. It is like watching two heavy weight champions fighting it out. I'll call it was a draw. Also look out for Dr. Bob, played by Jerimy Privin of ""Entourage"" fame. He has more hair now than he did then. Go figure. Rent or buy it, then sit back and watch a masterpiece. I think it is DeNero's best performance and one of the best ensemble casts you will ever see in a movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Am I sick for crying at the end?,"This a marvelous action film, as it combines some heavy-duty action scenes, with maximum realism (except maybe for the old machine-guns-who-never-run-out-of-ammo thing, but I'm so used to that I hardly react to it anymore.) and great work by both the director and camera people, with some actual in-depth views on the lives of both the 'good' guys and the 'bad' guys (represented mostly by Pacino and DeNiro respectively) portraying them both as something in between good and bad, yet making a clear distinction as to who we're supposed to be rooting for. And yet, we end up liking both characters, and I found myself actually hoping that DeNiro should get away free. And the end could really have been bad, I mean the whole film is a buildup to the final confrontation, but it was actually pretty OK. Sure, they could have done it better, but nine out of ten other directors/writers would have done it worse. There are of course a few things I really would have liked to see in this movie, but as it was already pushing at three hours, it's understandable that it stops where it does, even though it leaves more than one string of plot unfinished.

Nothing Special,"I accidentally set up an interesting juxtaposition with this film: the day after watching ""Heat"" I watched ""Notes on a Scandal"" (Cate Blanchett, Judith Densch). ""Scandal"" was twice as riveting and tense as ""Heat"", and this while being centered on two women schoolteachers and no guns. (I'm perfectly into cop movies, but it seems worth noting).Al Pacino mostly acted like an impressionist doing Al Pacino. Robert De Niro was much more subtle; he gets the higher grade here. Supposedly this film is a little deeper than others like it because we get to know the domestic lives of the characters. Well, not really. By the end of the film we have no idea what the attraction is between Val Kilmer's and Ashley Judd's characters or what her loyalty is to him. Given some hints of Al Pacino's character's backstory, I can't imagine why his current wife, to the extent we know her, married him. At any rate, it's the usual cliché of the detective too obsessed with his work to be present for his family. Old.Nearly every scene involving De Niro and his gang is worth watching. Nearly every scene with Pacino in that over-the-top mode of his is irritating and standard-issue for a 1970s gritty urban cop movie (except that this happens to be filmed in 1995). That includes the usual suspects, no pun intended, who people the gritty urban detective squad. So, figure 90 minutes not bad, 90 minutes irksome.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Sifting through detritus,"""Heat"" is Michael Mann's crime movie set in Los Angeles. It pits Al Pacino as Lieutenant Vincent Hanna and the L.A. police against Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley and his loyal accomplices. The film captures both sides of the story exquisitely and features excellent cinematography and a well-made score.From the start, ""Heat"" is a character-driven film. This is the film's main strength: it develops characters which are easy to become attached to and I became very interested in what fate the script had in store for each of the characters. My favorite of these characters is Al Pacino as Lieutenant Vincent Hanna. Hanna is the tough detective of old and Pacino has the gruff voice to match, but the character also gains depth from his relationship with his family. There is also well-placed humor injected into Hanna's character that was welcome. On the other side is Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley, who is also effective and develops a character of depth. There are also notable supporting performances from Val Kimer, Amy Brenneman, Dennis Haysbert and a number of others.In addition to developing its characters, ""Heat"" benefits from showing carefully planned and executed crimes and careful and methodical investigative work. There is also high quality action scenes mixed in, which are given extra meaning due to the film's rigorous characterizations. There is also the famous scene where rivals Pacino and De Niro sit down for coffee and reflect on their lives which is simply brilliant.

You find yourself rooting for Neil McCauly (DeNiro), the hardened professional thief who has no mercy and no remorse. Conversely, the veteran Police Detective (Pacino) on the tail of McCauly has his own share of marital and personal problems that make you wish he was more of a family man. HEAT is stylish and dramatic. The climax of the film, a scene where DeNiro conveys intense emotional turmoil and inward conflict without uttering a word, is extremely powerful. Great movie, highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Long movie, worth it","The movie is 45 minutes too long (if not more), but the cast is first rate, the subplots keep you interested, and the shootout scene on a L.A. street one of the best ever filmed.Had the movie been edited down, it could have been a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great stuff,"I'm having more luck with revisiting films lately than I've been having with watching new ones, and the time felt right to give Heat another shot. It's one I'm able to appreciate more as the years go on, and even if it's not perfect, it does contain a handful of perfect scenes, and not many movies can claim such a thing (all the iconic heavy-hitters, especially the renowned diner scene and the bank robbery/street shootout that comes a little later - I also love the final 10 minutes).It's always delivered when it comes to atmosphere, tension, and action, but it's the dramatic side of things I like more here than I remembered. It does a great job of having a conflict between two main characters who you find yourself caring for, though they're rather tragically opposed. There are side characters who are more outwardly villainous, but when it comes to Pacino and De Niro's lead characters, both are equal parts compelling and driven to a fault. I like the idea that this is a movie about workaholics, because that's a very relatable and everyday thing, contrasting with robberies and shootouts that probably aren't everyday occurrences to most people.I like the way it works on both those levels, and that ambition plus the fact there are so many intersecting characters (almost too many, but not quite to the point where it's a problem) keeps Heat from not being dull for a single minute of its two hours and fifty minutes. I still think there are some mildly clunky lines of dialogue here, and even more occasional shots that don't quite work (iffy green-screen occasionally standing out against the more authentic location shooting, and one bizarre moment where Al Pacino getting out of a helicopter looks comically sped-up), but these are nitpicks. Heat is a great epic, combining heightened melodrama with tense action and some surprisingly relatable characters. It's remarkable that such an immense and expansive film works as well as it does.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the top 10 most under-rated films ever.,"How this movie was ignored by the Oscars is totally beyond me, but then again so is 2001's best picture loss. This is a great crime epic. The big scenes and small scenes are crafted with equal care. It is just about as good as the first 2 Godfather's and just as haunting. Michael Mann wrote a cold, brutal and very moving story about two men who are predators and are lost in life because of their natures. We have Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro --two of the greatest actors of my generation (I'm 41) giving two of the greatest performances of their careers. Their legendary scene over a cup of coffee may ridiculous in real cops and robbers life but but, man (pun intended), it makes for unforgettable cinema. The action is as good as it gets (the bank robbery ""set piece"" is one of the top 5 shootouts ever filmed) and never seems dramatically phony i.e. thrown in just for ""action's"" sake. Like just about all great movies the supporting is wonderful. Every role is memorable. This is one of the few scripts I've ever bothered to buy. It is a long movie that is richer for its length. Earlier Mann wrote and directed a wonderful (and equally underappreciated) movie called ""Thief"" with James Caan 15 years before this one and I can't help but to think that ""Heat"" is the novel length version of ""Thief""'s short story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Fantastic Film.,"Undeniably one of the best films of the 1990's, Heat is a superb crime thriller that is both thrilling and artistic. Michael Mann has made many a great film; Manhunter and The Insider, but here he has created a work of sublime art, a film that is both violent yet oddly beautiful, repressive yet oddly emotional and optimistic and of course, it features Al Pacino and Robert De Niro on screen together for the first time, however it is the story that Michael Mann is telling which is the real star. Pacino and De Niro together may have been the driving force of the publicity of the film but they only share at least ten minutes of this 160 minute film together on screen. Mann just tells his story of what is essentially a film about two men who are both parts of one coin but who undeniably exhibit two sides. It is a testament to Mann's talent as one of the best writer/directors working today that this film works so well. The story of the cop hunting the robber and their story ending with a shoot out has been done to death, but here it feels new and original and best of all it is a story that is well told.Heat is an urban epic first of all. The film is takes place in the jungle of Los Angeles and proceeds to tell the story of two men, either side of the law who, while respecting one another, will kill each other when they get the chance. Over the course of their story Mann successfully introduces us to their lives and an interesting portrayal of both McCauley (De Niro) and Hanna (Pacino) develop. Despite being the crook of the tale, McCauley is the most sympathetic of the two men. Currently in a developing relationship with a book clerk he is experiencing love and we see how much he really cares for the woman he is falling in love with, while Hanna is stuck in a loveless marriage which is so loveless he doesn't give a damn when he learns she is cheating on him, the only thing he cares about is the fact that her lover is watching his television in one of the funniest scenes of the film. The way the film cuts from McCauley to Hanna is masterful as we get a sense of the lives the lead and how different and how similar they really are. Only Pacino and De Niro could make a film like this work.In saying while Heat is about the differences and similarities between cop and robber we also get to see the differences between these two masters of the acting worlds, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Both put in fantastic performances, no doubt, but I believe that De Niro is the better of  the two actors in this film. We see how De Niro is one of a more restrained quality, an actor who says his lines with restraint and custom whereas Pacino goes into what I can only describe as Scarface mode and shouts much of his dialog in the film. Yet when the two share the screen in the now legendary coffee shop meeting we see how brilliant they two of them are. As method actors we see how they bring across their characters and we see how truly great they are, both showing the restraint and master craftsmanship of two of Hollywood's finest. Their descriptions of the recurring dreams they have being one of the finest moments of modern cinema. Never has a scene consisting of page after page of conversation in a film script transfered so brilliant to the big screen.Even the many sub plots that take place around the De Niro/Pacino dynamic (Hanna's step daughter's depression and the disintegration of fellow thief Val Kilmer's marriage to Ashley Judd) doesn't dismantle proceedings. In fact it adds to the story and the character arcs of both cop and robber and works fantastically in a film that is one of the finest I have ever seen.To sum up Heat is a superb film. It is quite simply magnificent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Still the best after all these years,"Michael Mann's 'Heat' is one of the most gripping and tense films I have seen in my life. I don't think I will be alone in saying that I was initially attracted to the film for one reason and one reason only, to see Pacino and De Niro united on screen. I expected great things and as always from,for my money,one of the most accomplished directors around today Mann (The  Insider, Manhunter) delivered.By the end of this two and a half hour plus experience I was left speechless and all I could think was that I had just watched one of the greatest films in recent history. That was then and I am glad to say my opinion has not changed even now with films such as Gladiator(Russel Crowe) and Almost Famous(Kate Hudson) tempting me to displace Heat from my number one spot on my all time top ten(Almost Famous made it, Gladiator didn't) but the fact is that no matter how enjoyable I found these films neither left me with the same feeling Heat did.If you haven't seen Heat then I suggest you do for two reasons: 1) Even if you don't like it as much as I did it's still entertaining, 2) Excellent cast including Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer and the ever impressive Tom Seizmore'Heat' has it all, solid performances,great story and a nail biting conclusion I can't see how you couldn't have enjoyed it.

Heat review,"A prime example of how you can balance character drama and intense but intriguing action scenes.Heat, directed by Michael Mann, has more to speak than just a story about a police detective going after a professional bank robber. It's a story that emphasize the human condition, unexpected connection made by 2 people in different worlds, and it is about the philosophy our 2 leads adhered to.One of my favorite aspects is how they portray the 2 main characters, played by Pacino and De Niro. One is an experienced police detective, who is committed to his work and feels disoriented in his personal and family life, another is a professional criminal and bank robber, who follows a code and live in a secluded, isolated life, with a nihilistic perspective of life. Regardless, these 2 men shares a mutual understanding in the way they perceived life, in personal and from their point-of-view. The coffee conversation, in my opinion, is one of the best scene of this movie, which shows some strong craftsmanship in building dialogues, expositions and symbolism.Other than being a character study, Heat doesn't skip a beat in the craft of its' action sequences. It's raw, unfiltered, realistic yet incredibly innovated.In my opinion, this is one of greatest achievement of cinema that has to offer. And I can't recommend this movie enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best movie I´ve ever seen,"After watching Heat at my local complex three years ago I wasout of words because I had just seen a true masterpiece. When I Watched this film again yesterday (for the seventh time) I still agree with myself that this is the best film I´ve ever seen. Absolutely everything in this film is marvellous. The scene when Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) talks to Neil McCauley(Robert DeNiro)in the coffee shop is the highlight of the film as well as the one were DeNiro´s robber gang confronts Pacino´s Policeteam in a big shootout. All the actors,the splendid cinematography,the music,the dialogue etc makes this an extraordinary flick. Robert DeNiro portrays one of his most interesting characters ever as the tough and focused but also vulnerable Neil McCauley. Fine actors: Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Jon Voight, Val Kilmer and Diane Venora are perfect beside the dynamic duo of DeNiro-Pacino. Although the film is very long you never get bored from watching it. Michael Mann (the director) could have made an ordinary and cliché-filled Actionmovie but instead he has brought us not only great action but also lovely characters with different dimensions. This is a film for everyone and it´s in fact quite hard to put it in a special genre. Don´t dare to miss this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A cutting-edge thriller with inspired performances,"Heat is an intensely emotional experience, culminating in a superb climax. The film boasts a highly acclaimed cast, led by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino who are two of the greatest method actors ever and despite my skepticism of the combination of so many big names in one film, each member fits into their role beautifully. Director Michael Mann has created a masterpiece: beautiful screenplay and gritty realism combine with the stunningly elegant and orchestral soundtrack to produce a thrilling crime film that is elevated out of this at times unoriginal genre to greater heights. The plot examines two men on either side of the law: De Niro as the criminal genius who never lets anything get too close to him is fascinating, and Pacino as the obsessive, dedicated detective is equally engaging. Mann cleverly unites both men at a diner - here their similarities and motivations are revealed.Heat offers more to our insatiable appetites though: an intense street battle, a brilliant supporting cast, and an atmospherically charged final scene that is perfectly poised, and not over-sentimental as some declare. A much underrated film, but such an intelligent and in many respects a unique one. One criticism perhaps is the running time, which although is perhaps necessary to develop both main characters, is too long nevertheless.See it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

There's less to this than meets the eye,"It seems almost churlish to say so given the big movie names involved  Pacino, De Niro and Michael Mann, but, depending on what you want from a film, Heat, isn't really that good. As usual here in IMDb reviews it gets both 10/10 an just 1/10. Well, both are off mark. I have given it 4/10 because  well  as a movie spectacle it does the business and then some. The trouble is that Mann apparently wanted to make more than just a intelligent crook v an intelligent cop movie. Mann wanted to inject meaning. Well, he hasn't unless you're the kind of guy or gal who thinks that your average R&B pop video is meaningful. That's not to say, of course, that this is merely on the level of such a video, only that it has the same spurious significance. The usual cliché is that you often have to suspend disbelief to enjoy a tale, and Heat demands that a lot of disbelief is suspend. For one thing there is no back story: we are presented with a range of characters and must either accept them or not. But how did De Niro, portrayed as rather an intelligent cove get into crime when undoubtedly his intelligence and character would have made him a success in many more legitimate areas. On the other hand, he is remarkably ruthless, is apparently incapable of forming relationships (until he meets a girl who he thinks might be 'it'), and can see himself pursuing no other career than crime. Then there's Pacino: wedded to the job, his third marriage going down the pan, the man is an interesting case history. But no explanation is offered as to why this should be. Well, you might say, none is needed. Just accept those two characters and enjoy the action. In that case, why does Mann introduce the theme of relationship, their hold over us, their strength, their weaknesses? What was needed was another film which would examine that theme at length  but then Mann would not have had his action movie. So if that is what you want, enjoy it. But don't be taken in by the faux philosophical nature of the movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The quintessential crime drama movie.,"Heat is a very special movie. A perfect combination of excellent writing, superb acting across the board, and wonderful direction.Watching a Michael Mann film is a fulfilling experience; rewarding the attentive and thoughtful viewer. Take one of the first scenes in Heat where we see Val Kilmer purchasing something from some hardware place. Only at the end of the scene, briefly - very briefly - do we see the explosive sticker as he walks away from the camera, blink and you would have missed it. Its that attention to story telling which is all but gone these days. Most movie directors would have told you up front without hesitation what exactly is occuring and why leaving nothing to the imagination.It goes without saying the acting is top notch with the super-pairing of De Niro and Pacino. The support cast is equally good, particularly Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer (shocker), John Voight, Tom Sizemore not to mention smaller parts from Amy Brennemen, Wes Studi, Diane Venora, even Ted Levine (are you about a size 14?).Although clocking in at 3 hours, I appreciate Mann's pacing. Most movies would have tied everything up after the big shoot out climax, which actually occurs at halftime. Heat utilizes location shots for every scene and L.A. never looked cooler, especially the night shots.The score is also sublimely soothing, tetering on new age with the help of Lisa Gerard who also helped out on The Insider soundtrack. It is a perfect compliment to Mann's direction.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Mann's ""The Last of the Crime Movies"" - no more good and bad guys.","The first time I started watching ""Heat"" on the VHS I realized that something is wrong and that this isn't a traditional and classical cops-and-robbers genre, and that the film's seductive poster picture of a few masked men is just a simple promotive trick to attract the potential viewers who will surely expect a luxury of shootings, chases, fights and swearings - all settled clichees of an American crime genre. Since I didn't complete watching the movie, I rented it a few months later and gave it my full attention. I got under the skin of every replica and shot. Very soon it was more than cristaly clear what was wrong: ""Heat"" truly is a motion picture that just goes beyond the expectations of the cops-and-robbers genre and easily steams into the kingdom of movie masterpieces. Further elaborations are not necessary. ""Heat"" really is, not just because of the author's anti-thesis as the corner stone of this epic tale, ""the last crime movie"", which brings its every element, wheter it's writing, directing, acting or any other important segment of filmmaking, to complete and astounding perfection and stratified storytelling complexion which pulls the story with unbelieveble smoothness and calm, literally excelling from one shot to the next, interweaving its situations with some kind of magical, subtle and modern elevation and with juicy dialogues sharpend to the utter perfection of screen writing, surely simptomatic and authentic for the characters' surroundings and their professions. Michael Mann, probably one of the strongest and studious Hollywood directors today, breaks down the accepted thesis of life and film and asks the discussable question from which he creates the corner stone of his masterful master-piece, although remaining the exact definition of time and place of the action, and, in the end, still only fictious characters he adores so much. A parade of acting icons and Hollywood pearls shines with the foreground of picturesque characters, Pacino's appropriate mannerism and De Niro's intimistic coldness of a loner. Are there any other more suitable characters for the profiles of those two? And is there any scene in their careers that can be as historic and as fascinating as the coffee confrontation scene? The one that can, in some way, be a simbol of the plot of this unavoidable master-piece. Which is, unfortunately, the most underestimated film of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best Movie Ever?,"Yep.There's really no logical way to debate it, but, for me personally, no better film has been made.  Seriously.  I know, I know; I sound like that stupid friend of yours who keeps telling you ""Flatliners"" was the greatest thing ever, that you just don't understand the subtle nuances of Kiefer Sutherland's Oscar-worthy performance...thing is, I just can't think of any criticism of Heat that stands up under scrutiny.Too long?  Hell no.  It's epic, it's supposed to be three hours. Pretentious and heavy-handed?  No, it just takes itself seriously, which is only a crime if you're making a movie about Jesus.  Not enough interaction between DeNiro and Pacino?  Guess what: the script was written in the early eighties, it was actually supposed to be a TV mini-series, so they didn't center the story around the brand-name actors who would be playing the two main characters (maybe they made a mistake marketing the film as DeNiro and Pacino Sharing The Screen For The First Time Ever, but that's a marketing fault, not a fault of the film).So, pair the fact that there is nothing substantially wrong with this movie (and there is something a little bit wrong with EVERY movie, even Return Of The King, with the slow-motion This Is Your Life scene at Frodo's bedside) with the fact the story is held together by some of the most underrated great scenes in movie history, and you see what I'm saying.  The shoutout? Everyone knows about the kick-ass shoot-out.  The part where the cops are doing surveillance on the crooks, then realize that they're the ones being watched?  C'mon!  The part where DeNiro hooks up with Judging Amy at the diner, then gives her a glass of water in the morning, with the napkin folded all fancy?  C'mon!  The part where Ashley Judd gives Batman Forever the hand signal from the balcony?  Fuggedaboutit!At the very least, you have to agree that it's the greatest supporting cast of all time.  Jeremy Piven and Tone Loc, in the same movie?  Forget DeNiro and Pacino.I'm telling you: Heat is the greatest movie of all time.

I'm the kind of guy who prefers viewing 10 times the same good movie than 10 not-very-good different ones, I don't know how many times I viewed Heat but it seems to never bore me. And a thing I noticed : Mann knows how to prepare the action with some seemingly relaxed scenes, he mixes danger with love! A man and a woman looking at the city by night, from a high height, seem so little things floating in the air, we can feel the space, and the space between Hana and McCauley is sometimes decreasing, sometimes increasing, it's a fascinating way to show the work between hunter and prey, and when the prey becomes hunter the hunter feels that the enemy is really strong. It's like a chess game where each one can't come back against time, each one has to improvise the best answer, each one has to enhance his amount of information about the other, each one has an army under his command, one army is numerous but heavy to command, the other is a few but more quick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Jon Voigt also brings considerable depth to the performance. The best scene in the film is between Voigt and DeNiro, the two are conversing on the phone for the last time before DeNiro is to escape, the simple words they say and the meaning beneath them (set to Elliot Goldenthal's mesmirizing score) almost brought me to tears.

Heat is an excellent film all round.,"I first saw heat when I was 13 and immediately established it as one of my favourite films. While you could call it slow and/or a standard action/thriller, I feel it has an extra edge which makes it great. It is partly the acting performances by Deniro, Pacino and Kilmer. But one of the best things about this film is the realism displayed in the dialogue and the character development. Even the negro character who only has a short amount of air time is well established as man who is weighed down by a crime ridden past, has reformed, but cannot rid of the tag that his crimes have left with him. The inclusion of Val Kilmer for me was always going to boost my opinion of the film. I feel this is his best performance second only perhaps to his portrayal of Doc Holliday in Tombstone. It is not so much his acting ability or aesthetic appeal that does it for him, but his raw presence and charisma. Finally, I have to give credit to the shootout scene towards the end of the film. I have designated this as my favourite scene in a movie ever despite its violence.Great stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Even putting the soap in the soap holder in the shower he's not in character. He's Al Pacino playing Al Pacino playing a crook. He stayed in this same role to sleepwalk through ""Insomnia."" Exact same guy. Same gestures to a T. Identical. How is that acting? Robert De Niro's love scene is simply unbelievable. It's preposterous! This guy has the sex appeal of an anvil. How a beautiful babe could get passionate about this lump of dirt is beyond me. Not only is he ugly but he's surly to boot. Did these guys mail their performances in or did they use a pay phone? Anyway. To torture or not to torture? It depends on whether or not I have insomnia tonight.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"sit down, shut up, watch, learn","Firstly anyone who criticizes the film for length doesn't understand character development.The film is brilliant, if only for two set piece scenes, notably the coffee shop and the street scene after leaving the bank. The pace is generally languid which allows the two protagonists to be 3 dimensional and believable. Even down to McCauley studying a book on metalurgy to improve his professional performance. When the pace quickens the contrast is stunning and shocking.The cinematography is simply remarkable, drawing you through the screen and into some of the larger set piece scenes. Although much is made of the 2 leads, the joy of the film comes in watching some first class supporting performances. There will never be a more convincing ""crew"" as McCauley's.If you don't find this film fascinating or engrossing, you simply don't know films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the most fascinating and greatest movies ever,"Being a fan of Robert deNiro probably makes me subjective, but hey, what the hell! Heat is not just an ordinary movie in this genre, with a length of 3 hours Mann presents a portrait of two opposites who are not opposites at the same time. Showing what both main characters are about, and dive into their emotions, makes heat believable. I even felt bad for the bad guy. But briefly, every scene in this movie is excellent, every actor plays good to be in this movie and the script is perfect! Just watch it.

Best gangster film I've ever seen.,"This must be the best gangster movie I've ever seen (bought the DVD today). A big part of it reminds me of the old Miami Vice series.  The atmosphere, the music, the women, ...  But Heat even goes a little further with better action scenes.  Instead of mostly filming the good guys Heat seems to divide that 50-50.  Kinda weird because in the beginning you don't know whether you should look at the police as the good guys or the gangsters, really terrific!  What I liked most was that particular gunshot scene after De Niro & Co robbed the bank.  It is simply the best gunshot scene I've seen until today.  Only negative comment I could say about Heat is that the movie is a bit too long, even if it doesn't get boring a single time.  And maybe a little more action scenes would not have hurt. I rated it 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""The M.O. is that they're good.""","With the news that a prequel / sequel to this groundbreaking film is currently in the works in the form ofHeat 2, perhaps it is time to revisit the greatest ""clash of the titans"" ever committed to film.Michael Mann's 1995 Los Angeles crime saga clocks in at just over three hours, and stars two of America's greatest acting talents:Al PacinoandRobert De Niro(who will not be returning for the next installment). But one only need watch approximately half of that time in order to understand whyHeat (1995)sets the standard by which any and all future pairings of these two cinematic giants will be rated. And it is not just the infamous Coffee Shop scene which provides an excuse to love this film; though said scene is certainly well worth waiting for. (More on this in a moment.) No, the secret to this film creeps into frame at the very moment that the L. A. metro train glides effortlessly toward the viewer - surrounded by smoke and creaking slowly along - carrying inside a silent, brooding and patient master thief, Neil McCauley (masterfully played by DeNiro). And the secret to loving this film is just that... patience.One would expect a crime drama starringRobert De NiroandAl Pacino(in their first ""real"" pairing in film history as most agree thatThe Godfather Part II (1974)does not really count since the two mega-stars never actually share the screen) to begin with a bang. And therein lies Mann's genius. Does Mann choose to open this much anticipated cops-n-robbers action flick with a Hollywood-style, big box office bonanza of explosions and shrapnel? Nope. Instead Mann eases us into the environment that these two alpha-males will inhabit by way of a train ride. The doors slide open and out into the night steps McCauley. There is no evidence of the carnage to come as McCauley appears, only a hint of his expertise as he silently scans his surroundings, searching for a sign of anything out of order.Fast forward to a bedroom. Morning brings with it the promise of lovemaking, as we are introduced in a vastly different way to the man who will become McCauley's adversary, Detective Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (who we will come to realize is an over the top manic played brilliantly by Pacino). Hanna and his wife Justine, (played with seductive aplomb byDiane Venora) are having a moment... one neither wants interrupted. Lucky for everyone involved - characters and viewers alike - no interruption presents itself, and both are allowed to finish. Little do either know that this will be their last such moment together. For on the horizon lie several days of complicated cat and mouse antics, punctuated by the smell of cordite and the sight of death.And then comes the big bang. With an expertly planned and craftily executed tractor-trailer-rig-into armored-car smash-up, McCauley and his crew (portrayed by a world wearyVal Kilmerin what many consider his finest performance, a still high in real lifeTom Sizemoreand a gritty facedDanny Trejo) are off to the races. And what follows is the stuff of legend. Only not all of what is presented is legend... much of it is true to life.Heat (1995)was born out of a 1989 television pilot also penned by Mann, entitledL.A. Takedown (1989), and most if not all of TAKEDOWN appears in the script forHeat (1995). (Unfortunately, TAKEDOWN is only available on DVD in Region 2 countries, but is well worth viewing if you can grab a copy.) TAKEDOWN itself was based in part on stories Mann was told by his good friend andCrime Story (1986)collaboratorChuck Adamson. Adamson (along with STORY'sDennis Farina) worked as a Detective in the Chicago Police Department's Major Crimes Unit in the late 60's, and was responsible for taking down the real life Neil McCauley. In fact, the two actually had a face to face in a local coffee shop... just as DeNiro and Pacino do inHeat (1995). And the outcome was much the same.When the fateful scene finally comes... boy is it worth the wait. Having tracked McCauley's scent for several days through cold-blooded murders to successful and aborted heists, Hanna decides to up the ante and confront the man himself. He suggest a cup of joe and the two sit down for a chat. What transpires is by far the meatiest mano-y-mano ever committed to film. As the two cautiously attempt to relate to one another, they each discover that they share a common principle: They are each unflinchingly committed to one thing and one thing only. For McCauley that one thing is remaining true to his instincts and guarding himself against becoming attached to, as he puts it, ""anything you are not willing to walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner."" For Hanna, that commitment is to tracking the scent of his prey and holding onto his angst, which, according to Hanna, is the thing that ""keeps me sharp... on the edge... where I gotta be."" And it is within this discussion of their two intersecting lives, punctuated by dark words and veiled threats, that the most observant of viewers will glean a probing glimpse into the psyche of both actors. And Mann knew it when he wrote the dialogue.DeNiro: ""It is what it is. Its either that or we better both go do something else, pal.""
Pacino: ""I don't know how to do anything else.""
DeNiro: ""Neither do I.""
Pacino: ""I don't much want to either.""
DeNiro: ""Neither do I.""Then both men smile.... barely. Want to know why? Because at this very moment, both men are exposing their true feelings about acting, NOT (as some may think) discussing their character's feelings about their chosen profession. DeNiro and Pacino have let their guard down ever so briefly, and shown the world why they are the best of the best.But this film is not all about De Niro and Pacino chewing up the scenery and each other. Costars Kilmer and Sizemore (in their roles as McCauley's right-hand men Chris Shirherlis and Michael Cheritto respectively),Jon Voight(as McCauley's wounded and dogged fence Nate),Natalie Portman(as Hanna's tortured step-daughter Lauren Gustafson),Mykelti Williamson,Wes StudiandTed Levine(as Hanna's fellow Detectives in the Robbery Homicide Division Drucker, Casals and Bosko respectively),Ashley Judd(as Shirherlis' caught between love and the right path wife Charlene) andAmy Brenneman(as McCauley's lied to and frail girlfriend Eady) add so much depth to this film that it takes several viewings to fully digest the three course meal that Mann serves up. The interlocking stories of each character's life, filled with despair, pain and - at times - hope, moveHeat (1995)from the genre of ""yet another cops-n-robbers flick"" into the realm of ""cinema masterpiece.""And as for Mann's directing... Mann is THE MAN. His use of light and shadow, along with his bold and signature over-the-shoulder camera angels create a visual canvass that places the viewer squarely in mid '90's Los Angeles. Showing off the seamy underbelly of late night L. A., Mann uses this film to expose locations and scents only hinted at in former films such asTo Live and Die in L.A. (1985). (Mann would eventually expose more of this environment while producing the television seriesRobbery Homicide Division (2002)- a show sadly lacking a Blu-ray / DVD release - and while directing theTom Cruise/Jamie Foxxshow down filmCollateral (2004).)Mann is one of the cinemas most daring and detailed Directors, and this film is a high water mark in his ever expanding career. It is no wonder that fans of bothHeat (1995)andL.A. Takedown (1989)feel strongly that the former expands and betters the latter by leaps and bounds.Heat (1995)is the once and for all standard by which any and all future pairings of De Niro and Pacino will be rated. And none will match up. None could. (If you require proof, just have a look at the sorely disappointingRighteous Kill (2008)). Give this film a little patience and you will surely be rewarded. Because it is the slow build that really pays off.While stalking the crime scene that follows the previously mentioned armored car heist, Hanna offers this observation to describe McCauley's crew:""The M. O. is that they're good.""It's not just McCauley's crew that are good. They ALL are. And so is this film. It will leave you itching for the next chapter... coming soon... I hope.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

They had a meeting over coffee, the works.Also, the inspiration for the Character Vincent Hanna was modeled after a real life obsessed law enforcement officer that busts drug cartels.The shootout was designed by consulting several people who have been in real shootouts.The events are plausible more than any other crime portrayal by Hollywood.

"A truly understated masterpiece in film-making. Action movies come & go, but few stay with you for eternity. This one of my all time favs.","The one thing about 'Heat' that set it above it's peers was it's bare knuckle showcasing of the violent struggle between law enforcement & smart criminals. The scene sequences in my opinion are still unmatched to this day (2014). When you watch a movie about good vs bad guys, the natural tendency is to root for the good guys.... That premise doesn't apply here. From the opening scene to the last, this was nothing but an adrenaline rush! The acting, writing & direction of this film was phenomenal! Every part worked. Most people avoid seeing a movie twice in the theater no matter how good it was, me included. This movie is still the only one I've watched twice on the big screen. The effect watching it the second time wasn't diminished. I rented the DVD when it came out thinking I'd have gotten over it...far from it! If you like action movies that carry a story well and doesn't waste precious minutes with empty filler scenes, then you have to watch this film. If only this film had been recorded in HD (which wasn't available back then), you'd been in awe nearly two decades later! easily among my top five films ever made. If you haven't watched it, go for it, you won't be disappointed.Just to point out an obvious observation; the film is still so good that the owners won't agree to it being streamed online continuously.

"Heat, One awesome thrill ride!","Heat(1995) is a thrilling action packed evolution of a classic cops and robbers movie. Heats fast tempo story line evolves as we come to know Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), a relentless cop who places his job before all else, juggle the end of his third marriage with Justine Hanna (Diane Venora) while tracking down a crew of professional thieves. This crew of thieves is more than just your ordinary bunch of thugs. Lead by Neal McCauley (Robert De Niro), Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) this crew takes big risk big reward scores. Heat portrays the classic moral of crime doesn't pay, while the drama of the hunter stalking his prey sucks us in. Lt Hanna fist gets involved when an armored car heist gets out of control leaving three dead guards. During his relentless commitment to find the guards killer(s) we witness Lt Hanna's loosing struggle with balancing personal and professional life. His wife and step daughters desperation for his love unfold in a series of progressive cries for attention. Lt Hanna is the stereotypical cop we love, due to Pacino's compelling performance. While Hanna's personal life falls apart McCauley's life is headed for a new start. Middle aged McCauley falls in love with a lonely and genuine Eady (Amy Brenneman). As we are introduced to McCauley we fall in love with the iconic professional thief. McCauley makes the call to take one last big risk and walk away with his new love. But there is one last obstacle between him and retirement. Heats dose an excellent job of capturing interment relations and action packed scenes through the use of a extreme changes in tempo. It captures slow suspense building using dark down lit scenes and contrasts with well shot wild action that keeps us on the edge of our seats. We are intrigued by the unraveling of human relations and the series of reactions as they reverberate throughout the story.

Too much Heat,"There's a potentially great two hour movie in here someplace. Unfortunately the reality is what we have here is a mediocre three hour movie. So many scenes which could have, and should have, been cut. So many characters that are so woefully underdeveloped they serve no purpose at all and end up just taking up space. And taking up time, lots and lots of time. There are certainly some exciting and fascinating sequences but in too many places the film just slogs along with nothing of any significance whatsoever occurring. Ultimately Heat frustrates because you see what it could have been. It has a terrific cast and what should have been a terrific story if only it was told better.Of course the vast majority of hype which surrounded Heat concerned the two lead actors. Robert De Niro plays Neil McCauley, who leads a group of professional thieves in Los Angeles. Al Pacino plays Vincent Hanna who is the lead investigator on McCauley's trail. De Niro's performance is reliably brilliant. He is undoubtedly the best thing this move has to offer. He shows how subtlety can be a great asset for an actor, something Pacino apparently forgot somewhere along the way. Pacino's Vincent is a guy who goes through life screaming things at the top of his lungs for no good reason and this act gets really tired really quickly. Perhaps not coincidentally the only time in the whole film that Pacino comes back down to Earth is when he's seated across a table from De Niro. Robert De Niro, a calming influence? Who'd have ever thought it? The rest of the cast is littered with big names who have nothing much to do besides watch De Niro scheme and Pacino scream. Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria...they're all here. But we never really get to know much of anything about their characters. It's De Niro and Pacino, Pacino and De Niro, all the time. Whenever De Niro or Pacino isn't on the screen it feels as if the movie is just killing time. When these other lesser characters see their respective stories ultimately play out it's hard not to think, ""OK, whatever, I don't really care what happened to them anyway. What are De Niro and Pacino up to?"" From its beginning, through its slow, plodding middle and all the way up to its inevitable conclusion Heat is all about Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Maybe if Pacino could have toned down his act and the film didn't take so long to get where you know it was going all along, that wouldn't have been such a bad thing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Michael Mann has symphonic rhythms,"Heat is complex film worthy of multiple viewings. I want to see all Mann's films over and over. Mann creates symphonies where others create songs. He puts a team together and his collaborations sizzle with movement, sounds, and insights. His camera eyes the arm or leg with angles of an architect. Al Pacino is a favorite who can do no wrong. DeNero gives a brilliant performance. The two talk over coffee connecting as hunter and hunted. The character McCauley who DeNero plays is a thief and so is different from Francis Dolarhyde from Mann's Manhunter. The two are both criminals, but McCauley doesn't murder families like Dolarhyde. After viewing Manhunter Heat could never be as exciting psychologically.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the very great films.,"Real life does not divide all humans into good guys and bad guys and neither does this movie. The cops are a fellowship of dedicated men led by a loser who is so determined to perfect his craft that he has destroyed his three marriages. He has no friends and the only person he does not shout at is the head of the robbers. The gang of robbers are all individuals. They are honest with each other but do not hesitate to murder a guard who saw too much. So who are the good guys and the bad guys? There is a set of characters who are REALLY bad. The women are all individuals with their own hopes and lives. None are cops. One wonders if the fellowship of the homicide squad would have deteriorated if one of their numbers had been a woman.

Honestly a masterpiece of film making,"It's hard to make a movie that people will sit through for more than two hours, even back in '95 when Heat was in theaters. Heat is remarkably slow paced, tension as well slow building moving the MacGuffin through realistic and engrossing characters and a plot that just gets deeper as it goes along. It's like a '40s Black-n-White, you have to be en ok Ed from the beginning to truly get the marrow out of it.The actors are all at their peak of their careers, the direction utilizes all that skill masterfully and it's not left to the audience to just assume what they're doing. Like the first Die Hard, every shot and piece of dialogue is important, nothing wasted. Absolute masterful scene between Pacino and De Niro is so carefully crafted that you almost feel like the Directo is worried the cameras will combust from the sheer star power and performance as both actors tend to chew into the scenery alone and it's even more pronounced together in the same shot.The action is seriously well thought out, can tell that an Army of Marine was consulted for the last bank heist, rarely do you see anyone utilizing ""shoot and move"" tactics in film making. I used to show just the scene for as a training video my new Soldiers when I was a Lieutenant. It's a little dated but that's not a bad thing when it's a classic. Gives it a Time Capsule feel.Any film student worth a piss should definitely watch through and take notes. It is that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore,"Heat is an incredible stylistic movie with nuanced and layered characters which separate it from other crime thrillers. The premise of the film is interesting and compelling. A master thief against a master cop. Pacino's Vincent Hannah and De Niro's Neil McCauley are two different sides of the same coin. It's powerful and interesting to see someone who has mastered their craft the way these characters have. It's a breath of fresh air to see masterminds do their work. This is partly why protagonists like Walter White are so compelling - they are phenomenal at what they do. It's awesome to see them outwit their enemies in new innovative ways.De Niro's and Al Pacino's characters are very similar to each other and it becomes especially clear after the iconic scene in the café. This is the first time the iconic actors play in the same scene. Since they hadn't rehearsed the scene beforehand it makes the scene very genuine and convincing. They have their personal philosophies and it's difficult to say that one is better than the other. Heat is one of few movies where you root for both characters. When Pacino is on the screen you hope that he catches De Niro, but when De Niro is on the screen you hope he escapes.One of the best things about the movie is the look and atmosphere. Los Angeles is its own character in this movie. Everything is shot on location and it looks phenomenal. Even today almost 30 years later it still looks better than many newer films. Michael Mann is the master of epic movies set in cities. The cities in Mann's movies feel epic and grand.Heat also has one of the greatest action scenes ever. The shootout in downtown Los Angeles is so great. Mann is truly a genius. It's intense, amazing and so well executed! They don't make movies like they used to. Everything is practical and that is why it's so great. Even with today's technology, it's impossible to make this scene so real without actually shooting on location. No visual effect comes close to the practical effects used in Heat. The sound of the gunshots is bouncing off every building and it echoes through the whole city - it's just so epic!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Val Kilmer wears a ridiculous wig, or maybe its his real hair, which would be much worse. Some fool cast Tom Sizemore to appear in this movie. Heat features talented actresses ( Venora, Judd, Brenneman ) but the movie asks of these ladies to be part of the scenery- I can only assume this is because having good roles for the women in this movie would spoil Heat's chickensh*t macho fantasy.

The screenplay, direction, and acting are all better than anything Nicolas Cage or Kevin Spacey turned in in '95, and the assured, incredibly nuanced direction was easily far and above anything Mr. Gibson put forward in Braveheart (not that it wasn't a good movie, though).Heat handily wins the top spot in the Canons of Director Michael Mann as well as stars Pacino and DeNiro.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Different sides. Same coin,"Out of the blue, Michael Mann's Heat is still one of the best heist thrillers to date and was deemed a classic even on it's release back in '95.This movie is razor-sharp in it's writing that it shines even brighter compared to the mediocre fare we get nowadays. Thanks to Mann's meticulous attention to detail we get a complex thriller that involves smart people with resources trying to catch equally clever people. Mann who is famous for his research, based most characters on real life counterparts. Of course this isn't based on a true story, but Mann is not interested in plot than the psychology of his two stars. It's a story of two men that are driven and who's only attachment are to their respective jobs. They are ultimately willing to sacrifice others (and their own lives) for their egotistical thrills or pride. And Mann shows great restraint in having Pacino and DeNiro only briefly come face to face before the inevitable clash.That is why this isn't just another cop thriller. Movies like this are called classics because they can be enjoyed on so many levels: be it the great ensemble cast, the editing, the visceral cinematography, the music, the great sound editing, themes, the action choreography, memorable dialogue, the tedious procedures of how the story unfolds unexpectedly and so much more.. In short it is a rich experience.And one that is rewarding on each rewatch.When I was young and I saw it in 95 I was convinced that Al Pacino was the hero in this story. But now looking back it's painfully obvious that his movie doesn't have a 'hero' in a classical sense. Vincent Hanna is as ruthless and stubborn as McCauley in that they are willing to burn everything down in order to get what they want. And I think it isn't coincidental that the story is populated by addicts like gamblers, coke heads, bankers. And as much as Hannah and McCauley think they are above those type of people, they are clearly addicted on their own fix, by not giving up the hunt/the score.It has elements of Greek tragedy in that most characters are doomed by their own fate, their unwillingness to change but rather run headlong into disaster with their stubbornness. The movie was one of the first movies out of the 90's that felt real and gritty in a way shows like Homicide or The Wire feel authentic. Despite the stylistic choices of the cinematography and the music.Heat will always be a masterpiece in that it gives meaningful themes to a tired genre and with it's three hours runtime, it does never feel like it overstays it's welcome.A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Heat - N 1 of all times,"Heat by all standards is a truly exceptional movie, my personal No 1 of all times. This is a film that is a rarity as a 9.5 earthquake - happening every 50-100 years or so. and it is shattering as an earthquake. everything the characters do is great by all means. attention to detail, at the same time vision, combined.Most nice films have qualities that certainly make them good for the public eye. well this film has them all. you name it - it has it. plot - great script - very, very professionally done. characters - one time, really and I mean it - ONE TIME. play - well, what can I say. visual effects - are there any? what I mean this film is raw. Shooting scenes are as if you are personally in the middle of the shootouts. No bursting cars after 1 pistol shot, however, sorry guys to disappoint you. but that simply does not take place in reality.well, this film surpasses its time, moves above the small, trivial and fashionable at the time things that may increase sales or put it in a higher box office place. That is why its a true rarity - it has all the unique characteristics to be the strongest film I've seen so far (and trust me I've seen a lot) and at the same time to be a box office hit.Anyhow, it seems that the public is not always right on many things. What I mean is - why don't you look at the the greatest film listings for Action for example. Heat is not there my friends. I nevertheless find some interesting films in the top list - such as V for Vendeta, Batman Begins, King Kong (can you believe it?????), sin city, and the like. Unbelievable. Speechless. Dumb.I am, however, quite interested to see how this list will change down the line, lets say 11 years from now. Why eleven years? Well, because Heat was done in 1995. Lets wait how Batman, v for whatever and sin city will score 11 years down the line from now. I bet they will not be there at all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
De Niro v. Pacino... Fight!,"Not since Godfather Part 2 had Pacino and DeNiro been in a movie together and in Godfather 2 they were never on the screen at the same time. So, along comes Michael Mann and whoever else to convince these two heavy weights to do a movie together. They obviously agreed, but I wonder if part of the agreement was that the movie would be nearly three hours long? Must've been.Pacino: ""It's my movie.""
De Niro: ""It's my movie.""
Mann: ""We'll give you both your own movie within the runtime of this one.""
Pacino and De Niro: ""OK.""Even with Heat being a marathon of a movie it was still good. This was a high stakes cops and robbers movie with the leader of the cops, Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), trying to outsmart the robbers while the leader of the robbers, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), is trying to outsmart the cops. This heist movie worked because you had some big time actors and a plot that was intelligent without trying to be too clever. Both sides made some smart and shrewd moves without either of them being overly complicated and relying upon myriad of high tech plot devices. We got to see some skillful gamesmanship without there being a lot of players and a lot of moving parts.And the story within the story was one of work vs. family. We got to see two sides of the main characters: De Niro, Pacino, and Kilmer. All had a work-life and a family-life and none knew how to balance the two. Whether it's the good guy or the bad guy; if you dedicate too much time to your work then your personal life will suffer. Sure, one of the guys' job was that of a lieutenant with the LAPD and the other two were professional thieves but amazingly their personal life troubles were remarkably similar and for the same reason.Heat pitted two dedicated alpha males against one another and said ""fight"". You couldn't watch without picking a side but only one could be the winner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Classic Crime Film with an All-Time Great Cast,"'Heat' is a long, epic crime film that pits two iconic Hollywood actors against each other in a game of cat and mouse. In a nearly three-hour runtime, it explores myriad sides of crime-the criminals, the police work, the sources on the street, and the strain these lifestyles put on everyone involved. It's an ambitious undertaking in which director Michael Mann opens many doors and closely all of them successfully in a deeply satisfying way.Vincent (Pacino) is a workaholic police detective with a hard liquor habit, two failed marriages in his rearview and another likely in front of him. He doesn't want to burden his wife or anyone in his life that he cares about with the horrific events he witnesses at work on a daily basis, so he refuses to share particulars. But the lack of communication doesn't end there. He hardly shares anything with his wife, which makes her starved for attention and a deeper connection.Neil (DeNiro) is cunning criminal who spent time in the clink and will do anything to avoid a return trip. His life motto is, ""never get attached to anything that you can't walk away from in 30 seconds if you feel the heat getting too close."" A philosophy that makes him successful as a criminal makes him a failure in any personal relationship. He's alone.After a robbery gone wrong puts Neil on the police's radar, Vincent begins to investigate Neil and his team, looking to catch them in the act on their next job. As the two leading men match wits, it becomes increasingly clear that they're sharper than everyone else in the game. We get the sense that they're impressed with each other. There's a mutual respect, despite their obvious conflicting interests.DeNiro plays the part with a brooding, quiet confidence, while Pacino opts for a more boisterous and manic persona. They're both equally entertaining, and they take turns delivering classic one liners that you'll be repeating for years.These aren't the only actors of note in the film. This is a loaded cast that seems to showcase a new star every few minutes. Mann masterfully juggles all the pieces of the dense story universe he has created. The plot never drags, and the scenes are always memorable. Because of Mann's directing acumen and a lively script, the moments of conversation are as exciting as the action sequences. And, of course, every Michael Mann movie comes with distinctive, pulsing music.'Heat' deserves to be recognized among the great crime films of the past 30 years. Even 23 years after its release, it still holds up in every way. If you're a fan of the genre, you absolutely must watch this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Mann Is God!,"This is THE definitive police and thief movie for the ages. Technically brilliant, visually beautiful and not to mention some flawless performances by Pacino, Deniro, Kilmer, Judd and Gang. the café scene between the 2 greats of acting is a classic example of simple and highly effective script work, combined with some wonderful ad lib by the 2 actors. The cinematography by Dante Spinotti deserves special mention. He somehow managed to convey the essence of the scenes with style. Kudos as well to the background score. It was there when needed and rightfully not there when the conversation or action took centrestage. All in all, this movie should belong to the list of movies which budding movie makers study and learn from. Its THAT good I tell you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Nice flick to kill time on a Saturday night,"Heat is a remake of Mann's L.A. Takedown, which was supposed to be a TV series that never saw the light of day. Not a bad movie on its own. The problem with Heat is not the plot or the plausibility of the story and characters but rather the huge expectations from it starring two big names and the pressure to meet those two in a single movie at last. If you separate yourself from this notion you will enjoy the movie. It has great 90s feel to it, the cast is excellent, the shoot-out sequences are the best I've seen in an action movie. I wouldn't pick on details trying to find inconsistencies or implausibilities - it's a movie, for God's sake! The parallel private worlds of both main characters (and some of the rest) shown alongside the main events are good enough. I must say, I don't understand why Pacino and De Niro are talked to be the best ever but I actually like Pacino in this movie, perhaps him being loud, exaggerated and flamboyant fits the bill here. DeNiro, on his own, is good too. The plot doesn't allow for both of them to interact throughout the movie and that's how they should have kept it. Of course, they were forced to write the ""diner"" scene and it ruined the whole thing. The atrocious dialog in it didn't help either. Then, to add insult to the injury, they made De Niro's character betray himself and do something so out of character it was borderline laughable which led to even more laughable ending. And that's how the ruined a nice action flick.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It has never deserved the credit it deserves, for example here at imdb.com it sometimes makes it to the top 250, when in my opinion it should be at least in the top 100. Many people don't like this movie because of the length, its long but its because there are so many sub plots and the details are incredible.Characters are very human, there are no super heroes or any Rambo style characters that we see often in action/crime flicks. The shootings are extremely real with no unnecessary explosions, its completely believable. My favorite would have to be DeNiro as a cold and calculating veteran thief. I could write a lengthy comment but to keep short: Camera work 9 Plot 10 Action 10 Dialog 9",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An excellent and intelligent movie,"The two leads, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are dynamite. Pacino and De Niro have played plenty of cops and criminals in their respective careers and this would have to be a major highlight in their impressive filmographies. Al Pacino portrays Vincent Hanna as an intelligent, tough, no-nonsense, obsessive and relentless yet flawed character. Vincent might be a highly decorated cop, but he is so consumed with his work, that it takes its toll on his personal life. He has been divorced at least twice, his daughter is messed up, and his third wife is ready to divorce him. It shows that his job as a cop is his entire life. He's not the type of person to sit around all day. Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley is more restrained than his other characters in the past (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear). Neil McCauley though a career criminal, isn't portrayed as such a bad guy. He is portrayed as a human being with a life. He too, has a personal life which is parallel with Vincent's. He is intelligent, precise, violent and private, though he is lonely and does not have any attachments in his life. The only friends he has are the other criminals he works with and the love interest in his life which plays a big part in the movie later. Val Kilmer is actually pretty good in his otherwise hit-and-miss career. Other supporting actors including Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson and Ted Levine are solid and this keeps the strength of the movie together.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I don't recall a single movie of them in which they didn't deliver. Direction in the movie is of top tier. This is one of the best heist movies. The way they pick their targets and what to score or what to not is magnificent. You can feel the heat & thrill in all the corners of your body once this movies kicks in from the start along it keeps you bind with it.

A sensational master piece by Director Mann, that still relives the impact of a great blockbuster with legends Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, till this day. Adaptation of a true incident, the characters portrayed by both these actors especially that of Robert DeNiro is far from being commendable. It should have been another Academy Award for this actor. The kind of emotions portrayed by this character of a thief in loneliness and in action is amazing.

Whatever the reason, the end was so weak that it destroyed what should have been a great movie.I sometime wonder: if Hollywood made a movie of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" would Cyrano end up with the Roxanne.

the illusion of reality.....,"Heat's opening heist certainly takes you aback, but thats just a mild taste of whats about to come. Somewhere in the second act is an absolutely shocking, stomach-chewing battle sequence that may well be the most numbing action set-piece ever committed to film. Nothing else like it exists, not in the most awe-inspiring war movies nor in the most fiercely adored action flicks. Its something like what Peckinpah might have done, only ten times more riveting. Heat literally climaxes at this point - in an orgasmic fusillade of gunfire.Heat is NOT a film about ideas or realism. Despite what countless viewers will have you believe, Heat offers no symbolism or metaphor, nothing beyond the literal surface story that we see. It has nothing deeper or psychologically real to say about anything, and certainly not about the so-called relationship between hunter and hunted. All that is a mere play on words and an escape for bored people. And by asking the viewer to identify and empathize with sociopaths, Heat proves that it has more to do with machismo than justice or reality.Enough grousing about what Heat *isnt*. I come to praise this film, not bury it. We are all seduced by the spectral filmic experience that Heat is. Mann's unrivalled synthesis of sound, cinematography and music. He aims for a very high degree of visual verisimilitude, and attains it. There is no one else in Hollywood who can bend the logic of big-budget film-making in this way.I'm just sorry that this film doesn't make me contemplate a thing, other than Mann's film technique. Never can I shake off the feeling that this a gigantic comic book, or a Western in techno trappings. He does try to convey something about the essential emptiness of these two men's lives, and how they seemingly need each other. Most viewers cant wait to label that as ""existential angst"". They might like to consider that maybe these two are just closet cases. That last scene especially is a bit too much.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A film that 'fires' on all cylinders. And it just gets better with age.,"Think about the best heist films, or mere scenes, that you've ever seen and look no further than this film as one of the chief inspirations for them.Heat (1995), the legendary crime-thriller film directed and written byMichael Mann(Collateral (2004),The Insider (1999)), is a tour- de-force of direction, acting and creating an atmosphere of sheer anticipation. Perhaps most surprising is its zero Oscar nominations - easily could there have been nods for Best Picture, Lead/Supporting Actor/Actress, Director and Screenplay.Since I have seen it, there has been one scene in particular that's stayed etched in my mind and I need not regurgitate its specifics here. But anyone whose seen it remembers that legendary scene when our hero and villain finally confront one another - it's a beautiful piece of on-screen acting and features a conversation whose subtext really defines the film in a nutshell; all these guys know is the jobs they've committed too, and they're both darn good at them.""If it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna widow. Brother you are going down."" The story is certainly a complex one because there is an undeniable sense a comraderie between Lt. Hanna and Mccauley and yet they know the second they step out of that restaurant, they're each other's prey and target. One senses it's too late for either of these guys to get out before it's too late and that is really one of the themes of the film; at one point can one be able to walk away from all they know?I ramble on about this scene but the entire film is a masterpiece of its type - compelling performances, a tightly-wrapped story and top-notch direction. There's meticulousness to how everyone operates and that craft is shown to near perfection - it's a nod to the pacing as well that the three hour run time feels closer to two. This is one of the greats in a superb decade for crime films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I thought, sod it, l might as well give it a shot.Well, the first 10 minutes were as good as most good movies so l carried on. It wasn't too long before it went flat. I've seen films rated at 6* that are far more entertaining than Heat. I really want to know how people choose their ratings for films, because from what l can tell, they seem to be getting everything backwards. Inception for instance, with DiCaprio, what was that?? Over 8* and completely confusing. That one l trod water for only 25 minutes before turning it off and wondering how the hell people were even watching it, let alone enjoying it to 8.6* degree!I digress and we aren't talking about Inception. Heat is NOT an 8*+ film folks, it just isn't.It has action, sometimes, but between any action is bland conversations between very excellent actors.To buy into a film, l need to relate to the characters, care for them in some way.

Heat — High stake efficiently brutal holdups and two razor sharp minds,"Heat is the quintessential dark and dramatic cops and robber movie. It puts the best holdup crew against the best lead investigator in high stake complex scores. It's brutal, it's raw, it's crime, pure and simple. There's violence, however, it's a very more of a dramatic piece. The real juice is the opposition of the two mind, it's psychological.The score gives shiver. The photography transfixes. The acting plunges you deeply within the fabric of the movie. The story is ultra captivating. The action is breathtaking, yet simple and very real. The characters are well layered and with lots of emotional depth, yet easy to understand.You spend a lot of time with the two protagonists. You see their daily life. You get to know them. Robert De Niro plays a stone hard persona, efficient and brutally direct when needed. He's the criminal, yet he's almost endearing. Al Pacino plays a fiery angry cop who will stop at nothing, just keeping in sight of the law, to get his man. He's easy to hate, the way he yells and shut out his family life.The star studded cast who performed so well also includes: Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Justine Hanna, Ashley Judd, Hank Azaria, Danny Trejo, plus a very young Natalie Portman playing a small yet powerful role as the step daughter of the main detective. In her portrayal you can already see the great actress she became.It's a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The single greatest bank heist film ever made.,"As well as being the greatest bank robbery movie of all time, this movie is also the greatest movie I have ever seen. There are other movies I have seen that are equal to this in greatness (some examples are Tombstone, The Godfather, Unforgiven, Saving Private Ryan, The Lord of the Rings trilogy and many more) but if pressed, I might have to declare this movie to be the single greatest movie ever created.This is the story of a team of hard core tough as nails bank robbers headed by Robert Deniro's character. The other members of the team consists of Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo, and Tom Sizemore. It doesn't get any better than that. What a coup by casting director Bonnie Timmermann. This group is ""managed"" by Jon Voight, an all around criminal mastermind genius/fence. The team is also joined by a random additional bad guy when the job requires more men to pull it off. On the flip side of the coin is the good guys pursuing the bank robbers. Led by Al Pacino, the cops also include numerous fantastic actors. You will recognize these world class character actors instantly. All this acting talent drives the story along with you the viewer feeling amazingly entertained. There are numerous subplots occurring that fit into the main plot smoothly and these subplots add a good deal of interest and suspense to your viewing experience.Slap on your seat belt and and hold on tight because as you are sitting on the edge of your seat and white knuckling it through this movie, you're going to understand early on that this movie is unbelievably great.

A fast start that turns into a snooze,"I have probably tried to watch this movie a dozen times. It starts out at 100 miles an hour with an action pact heist. Then it slows down a bit with what looks like it's going to be twist and turns of a motivation behind the heist. Then the movie just stops. It turns into an absolute snooze fest where the movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It tries to incorporate some kind of family or relationship message where the criminals show off their families, and I don't care. Robert De Niro tries to peruse a relationship with a woman he met at a bar, and I don't care. Al Pacino has some kind of family drama with Natalie Portman as his daughter, and I don't care. The movie has officially ground to a halt at that point for me and literally nothing at all happens for at least 30 minutes. I can't make it past this point. I'm so bored and disinterested by this point that I'm either doing something else or I've fallen asleep. I tried to give it a chance but it's 100% a pass for me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An acting masterclass from two of cinemas greats,Pacino and De Niro are outstanding in this film and the scene in which they chat in the diner about the conflict to come is one of my top ten scenes in any film.

One of the all time great crime/action blockbusters,"""Heat"" is simply masterful on all accounts. Nearly 3 hours and not a single dull moment. It's only fitting that it was the first time acting pantheons De'Niro & Pacino teamed up on screen (excluding godfather 2), and boy did it excel in all time emphatic fashion. This is the most gripping and well put together bank robbery film in cinematic history. The character development is also amongst the greatest I've ever seen.

Vey long; amazing movie!,"I know the coffee shop scene with De Niro & Pacino is where this movie gets its acclaim. The dialog in this scene is great, and the actors in it are great.

I actually watched that scene a couple of times.Right before the final heist commences, Sizemore smiles a little at the people around him and then puts his mask on - awesome!The Waingro character is a real psycho.

You really could cut out half of the film, cause for some events there was no following and I didn't know how it did end.

The characters were absolutely real.In the context of Neil's vow to ""...not have anything in your life you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds..."" I assumed throughout the movie that he would break it for the sake of Eady.

Amazing and Brilliant! Strong and Powerful! One of the Best!,"What can I add to the flood of reactions this film engenders when anyone sees it. This is one powerhouse of a film.Val Kilmer is a perfect characterization of a criminal who has found his master in crime with Robert De Niro. De Niro is amazing as a tough guy with brains and conviction in what he does.The romantic relationships that tie the characters together are beautifully interwoven in this cinematic masterpiece that truly lives up to its name.

There is a confidence in the acting, the plot, the story, that exalts the enjoyment of this film to a sublime level that is truly a unique cinematic achievement.Jon Voight is quiet, strong and powerful - almost unnervingly so.

"Well acted, well crafted and clearly influential","Don't mind the running time, Heat will keep you on its ride for the whole movie. De Niro and Pacino sharing the screen for the first time does not disappoint one bit, and the story is smart, engaging and high octane.As of fan of The Dark Knight, I immediately realized why many have pointed to Michael Mann as one of the main influences for Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. Many of the heist scenes are echoed in TDK, which goes to show how effective the scenes are.It is these scenes as well as the investigative scenes from Pacino's character Lt. Hanna that carry the film. The personal life backstories of the main characters are necessary in moving the plot forward and creating an ideological struggle in each person's mind, but they are not what make the film memorable, particularly the angle on Neil, De Niro's character.Yet I will remember Heat mainly by the way it is carried by De Niro and Pacino, two world-class actors who balance and complement each other perfectly throughout the film, even when they don't share screen time. I shouldn't have put off watching this film for as long as I did. If you have Netflix and three hours to spare, do yourself a favor and watch Heat!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This is one of those movies where even the smaller supporting cast of actors are good. John Voigt even makes an appearance at one point. Still, Pacino and DeNiro are the ones who shine the most. Other than a prolonged boring scene (almost irrelevant to the plot), this movie is perfect. It has one of the best shootout action scenes ever. Right up until the very end, it stays at a high level.

An excellent 2-hour action film set within a nearly 3-hour movie.,"It's interesting to go back and watch something by Michael Mann after seeing his later work. I enjoyed Collateral (2004) and considered it to be a well-directed film. Of course, there's deliberate pacing and acceleration of Collateral that drew me in. Unfortunately, this biased me somewhat when I sat down to watch Heat (1995). Stylistically, both are fairly similar and use similar locales. However, at almost three hours long, some of the pacing in Heat made me think that it could have used a bit of a trim in the first half.I understand the deliberate nature of the buildup of the first half, with each event introducing some core tenet of the main characters that come to fruition by the end of the film. It helps that there's a good bit of action early on, but until the twist that happens about half-way through occurs, the comparison to the pacing of the second half makes the early part of this movie feel like molasses. Heck, I'd probably just show the action scene that starts the film, then jump to the twist and have the rest proceed as normal. That way I'd trim the running time down by a good 30-45 minutes and tighten the pacing.Fortunately, with actors like Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino (with perhaps one of the best lines he's ever yelled residing in this film), Heat is a great action film with huge payoff. The shootout mid-way through the film is perhaps one of the best I've ever seen committed to film. Additionally, the ending is a tour-de-force that pulls the trigger on all the little bits of foreshadowing to create a satisfying conclusion by the time the credits inevitably roll. Maybe Heat is no Collateral, but it's certainly worth the time to watch, regardless.An excellent 2-hour action film set within a nearly 3-hour movie, I give Heat 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Too many side stories,"If you're going to make a ""macho"" movie then stick to it. You don't need all the side story fluff that is totally unnecessary to the meat of the story which was between De Niro and Pacino. It slowed everything down. This could have been a much better movie if shorter with all the latter.They missed an opportunity for a nice suspenseful action flick.I used to like it more, but something about it seems forced and phony. Dialogue, situations that didn't ring true. Especially the way over the top drama erupted out of the blue.Did we really need the driver's back story? We got EVERYONE's love story? Why? It was ridiculous and totally irrelevant. And some of the dialogue was beyond bad, especially the scene between De Niro and Pacino. Too many stories and no focus. And Pacino pretty much yelling throughout the movie.And then the fake squibs used and the overreaction ""Hollywood"" overacting when people got shot. What an overrated mess and it gets worse each time I watch it. If you believe that cops would behave this way you need a reality check.3 Stars for the shootout scenes and Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore for the best acting.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Heat An Entertaining Crime Action Thriller With Some Flaws,"Heat is an entertaining action crime thriller with some flaws by director Michael Mann the man behind films like Collateral, Miami Vice, and the upcoming Public Enemies who does an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen. The star studded cast are terrific in their roles including Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, and Jon Voight. The rest of supporting cast are good in their small roles but aren't given much to do. The movie is a bit long with a running time of almost three hours and it could've been much shorter. The pacing was kind of slow at times too but everything else more than made up for it's few flaws. The opening heist sequence is well done and the same can go for the intense shoot out in the streets of Los Angeles. Pacino makes for an effective hero on the side of good and De Niro is equally impressive as the villain. They both prove to be worth adversaries but unfortunately they're not given much screen time together or confrontations for that matter. With it's flaws aide however Heat overall is still an enjoyable movie to watch because of the story, the action, suspense, and most of all the exceptional performances by it's lead actors.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One Word: Masterpiece!,"I've often said one of the traits of a great film is that no matter how many times you watch it, you're just as captivated and moved the 10th time as you were the first. There are very few movies that do that and Heat is one of them. Heat is the story of two men who lead very separate, yet strangely similar lives. Both men are driven by what they do best and other aspects of their life suffer as a result. One is a career criminal who's lifestyle forbids personal connections that cannot be easily severed at a moment's notice (for obvious reasons). The other is an obsessive, workaholic cop who is dedicated to getting his man, even at the cost of his family life.Circumstances reveal they are on an inevitable collision course. Both men know this, but are unwilling to waiver regardless of circumstance, simply because it's just not in their nature to do so. This leads to an amazing dialogue scene that must be seen and eventually a very tense and suspenseful confrontation that only one will survive. The characters are all very strong. Their are no cliché bad guys here, just men who've made tough decisions in life and do what they have to. These characters are created in a way where they are complex shades of of grey, you know what they do is terrible, but you empathize with their plight regardless. Pacino and Deniro are at the height of their powers here and Val Kilmer also puts in a solid performance.This film has everything. An engaging story, a fantastic cast with excellent acting, the best shootout sequence I've ever seen to this day and great pacing. I've recently seen The Town and while it's very good, I always say it's just a poor man's version of this. One of the best crime dramas ever made and one of my favourite films all time.

realistically bittersweet portrayal of humans,"Everyone needs to watch this movie. Its an exploration of men, of the choices we make in life, and of relationships.
What I loved about this movie is that it wasn't just a crime movie with really cool heists without depth to the characters, it went way beyond that. it was about these realistic character's, what they value, their pursuits, and most importantly dysfunctional ways they form bonds with others. The movie explored several family/romantic dynamics in ways that I think was beautiful and so profoundly human.
it explores several questions and here of course their dilemmas are amplified due to the extreme lifestyles of criminals and cops. Your job or your family? As in the case of Vincent whose job is to prioritize other people's lives and save them so is it okay to give it his all? . Also, the dilemma how far do you go for your personal pursuit and goals? Does Vincent's end goal excuse his methods? When you are passionate about a goal how dedicated can you be before you are labeled obsessed or it becomes unhealthy?
I loved Niels. He was portrayed perfectly and got me thinking about the question of how far is a person willing to go for the ones he loves? Can a woman ""change"" a man? At what point do you choose yourself?
Major theme: Individualism vs the need for companionship
Sometimes you must leave people behind in pursuit of your own self, is that selfish?
At the end of the movie the choices they made were in line with who they were the whole movie and it ended exactly as it should have been. I liked this specially because the movie wasn't a cliché, at the ending no one acted ""out of character"" to get surprisingly this great oh everyone formed a family and was happy every after.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Overrated Movies,"Anyone else think this film is wildly overrated? Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Mann fan, but this is too long and too self-conscious with some of the most laughable dialogue ever (mostly spoken by Diane Venora, the actress who plays Pacino's wife)Check out the dialogue on the IMDb link if you want a good laugh. Also,the ending is way too sentimental and the whole Waingro/serial subplot should have been left on the cutting room floor. Just wondered if anyone else out there thought this film did not deserve the heaps of praise (Collateral is way better in my opinion) Great Moby track though. Also, how realistic was it to have De Niro and Pacino sit down in a coffee shop for a chat--why not just set in the police station? It would have been more believable--anyway, a pretty good, if flawed film, but certainly no classic. tip. check out John Flynn's The Outfit with Robert Duvall.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The final shootout scene is the best of everything, feels like real. The suspenseful ending that makes me feel speechless for a few seconds.

A huge disappointment,"Given the rating on IMDb and the rave reviews, I had high expectations when I started to watch this film. I was extremely disappointed from the beginning. The story was poorly stitched together, the details unbelievable ( culminating in the Val Kilmer character's escape, apparently as a result of cutting off his pigtail, and the fiasco at the hotel when De Niro takes his revenge) and the acting largely uninspiring. De Niro seemed to be wandering through the film for the sake of getting his fee and Pacino was execrable, substituting shouting and bizarre facial expressions for proper acting (and we know that he can act - he just seems to have lost the knack).The only redeeming feature, as far as I am concerned, was the stunning visuals.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I love it!,"Flawless. Despite the widespread acknowledgment of Heat's sprawling nature, one of its most remarkable qualities is its unwavering confidence in its vast scale. The film offers glimpses into numerous facets of its world, hinting at a continuous existence beyond the frame, yet it refrains from fully exploring them. Remarkably, within its 3 hour runtime and extensive cast of characters and subplots, Heat maintains a sense of narrative efficiency. Each element is precisely distilled, such as Haysbert's post-prison life, which, though brief, leaves a lasting impression. Similarly, Portman's subplot may seem underdeveloped to some, yet her troubled portrayal, coupled with Mann's approach to her scenes, provides ample insight. While gaps exist, their necessity is questionable.One consequence of Heat's approach is its refusal to treat any detail as mere exposition, resulting in a wealth of memorable scenes. Personally, I adore the moment when De Niro finds Kilmer asleep on his floor, humorously highlighting Kilmer's lack of furniture. Yet, it's the subtlety of De Niro's actions, confirming what he already knows with a phone call to Judd, that truly shines. ""For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man,"" uttered by a flawed character in the midst of marital turmoil, resonates deeply, underscored by the tacit acknowledgment between the two men that much has been revealed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Drama and style aplenty here,"This crime-thriller is the story about a cop and a robber who mirror each other. The robber (Robert De Niro) has sacrificed a home life in order to maintain his life of crime, while the cop (Al Pacino) has a disastrous domestic life as a result of his work pursuing men like De Niro. The film follows both of their paths until their ultimate showdown.Heat is a well written film, even if the story isn't especially brilliant. Where it scores is in its presentation. The acting personnel are extremely good. Apart from the two leads we have a very good support cast compromising the likes of Jon Voight, Val Kilmer, Henry Rollins and Tom Sizemore. But what Heat is primarily celebrated for is in its pairing of De Niro and Pacino. Up until that point these two titans of the screen had never shared screen time together. In this film they do, although it is very sparing. They meet in the middle of the film at a diner and at the end at a night-time air-field. Their encounters are certainly powerful and mean that the sparsity of them makes them all the more potent.Director Michael Mann is the one who of course holds everything together. He controls the dramatics and injects the story with some very well staged action scenes. The shoot-out in the streets of L.A. being the most obvious example of this, it's a very finely choreographed sequence. And overall, the film has a very stylised look and feel. The photography is very good and visually the movie matches the dramatics on screen. Another Mann trademark present is the low-key soundtrack. In this one we have well-chosen electronica from the likes of Kronos Quartet, as well as a great original score by Elliot Goldenthal.It may be slightly on the over-long side but aside from this Heat is a great combination of grade A acting and cinematic style. It's one of the best crime-thrillers from the 90's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
North Film Festival finals.,"On the big screen, it 's not too cool to watch this show of police gangsters, especially the street shooting, which is very enjoyable. Of course, you can also observe the superb acting skills of Pasino and De Niro in more detail. These two are born to play against each other. It's a pity that the director's skill is still not enough. The plot is extremely lengthy. If the refining point can be more a genre template.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
what a treat,"this movie had such an awesome story.the movie has two kings in film: Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.it was as if someone just had the idea after the 2nd Godfather to see how De Niro and Pacino could act with each other. the story has both of them acting separately, and then once things get comfy, they both meet up for a chat. their conversation in the film was what made it for me besides all the awesome shooting action in it. they just acting so well together. it was some real eye candy.the movie goes for just under 3 hours, with the strangest angles. at times where you thought it would cut to such and such, either it didn't or it switched to something else that was awkward. The entire movie is made up of these strange angles that any other director besides Micheal Mann would use. it worked only because the entire movie was composed of these strange angles, creating a new way to see a film. it was cool, i bought it.SEE IT, IT WAS GREAT with many side actors who boost the performace of the film as a whole to lead De Niro and Pacino to do their work as well as they do.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pacino and De Niro- do you wanna more?,"All those who expect a great action flick will not be disappointed by Michael Mann's excellent gangster-film 'Heat'. Those who wish a little more will not be let down either. After a slow and rather conventional, and therefore pretty uninteresting beginning, the movie's rhythm gets faster and tries to tell the story of several characters (De Niro, Pacino, Kilmer, etc.) at once. The consequence of this is that the film lacks a little bit a precise focus, while the structure still is excellent. How well the different elements eventually fit together is amazing and, especially for an action film, brilliant. The two protagonists are extremely well drawn, which is mostly due to the excellent performances by Pacino and De Niro, but the cast in general (Voight, Levine, Portman, ...) is breathtaking. And let us not neglect the most important part of an action movie: the action scenes. Their choreography is an example to follow for other directors. So, all in all one of the best action films of the 90s whose acting and direction are marvelous.Rating: 84MarSco",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Legendary Actors!!!,"This movie is one of my favorite, because i love all Pacino's and De Niro's movies. Plus they also add Val Kilmer in this movie and also brand new Natalie Portman.
This movie explore very detail of human character from the two main actors, Neil's loner character and Vincent's work-addict side. I believe only two legendary actors like Pacino and De Niro can represent character of two side of a coin like Neil and VIncent. A must see movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Underwhelmed,"I have read many reviews of this film and as far as I can tell, none of them have hated on the brilliant shootout. Well they're right as it's the best scene in the film and everything else just falls flat. The drama in this film is very poorly written. I never once felt invested in Lieutenant Hanna or Neil. The action in this film is alright but the only good sequences were the one at the start and the aforementioned bank robbery. I love watching Cinefix IGN and Cinefix IGN adores this film as they ranked it 32nd on their favorites list. I have to heavily disagree with the praise they give it and rate it 5 stars. If you want to watch a epic crime thriller that takes place in Los Angeles go watch L. A Confidential as that is actually a deep, shocking film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece!,"Michael Mann has a special way, like no other, to create a special edge in every scene. He creates a presence that you can almost touch. I remember the first time i saw this complete masterpiece of a picture. I was fifteen years old and watched it in the finest cinema available in Stockholm. The movies I usually consumed at the time were significantly simpler and suffered from the lack of a manuscript with substance or lack of acting worthy of the name.Here I met, in my opinion, movie perfection for the first time. We'll see Pacino, De Niro, Kilmer, Sizemore and company deliver first- class acting throughout the film. The police, the good, In search of the bank robber, the evil one. A classic layout but with a finesse that was unprecedented in the film world.You are sitting with a high pulse throughout the entire movie and into the final scene (despite that some consider it to be American style predictable). According to me It's impossible to give this movie anything less than the highest of ratings and I still to this day hold this film as my absolute favorite of all times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A great heist movie.,"An epic crime drama pitting two of the greats on opposite sides of the law. Pacino and DeNiro square off against each other and although they only share a few scenes together, they electrify. Featuring a stellar supporting cast, dynamic city scapes, and to date, one of the greatest bank robbery scenes ever filmed. Although long, it never wavers and is an exciting watch from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
can't beat Heat,"Al Pacino and Robert Deniro are two sides of the same coin as cop and robber in this brilliant character action drama. Deniro is a master thief who s looking to put together one last huge score with his crew, while Pacino, a masterful detective is hot on his trail with his own crew attempting to take them down. Each is extremely dedicated to their respective jobs Each's life pretty much mirrors that of the other. Ying and Yang. Good and evil. With shades of gray in between. Every character in this film is given a back story and the plot is both fairly simple and intricate in it's fine details. Even at almost 3 hours, one never feels that the movie is ever dragging, because it doesn't. And yeah, you more then likely know how it's going to end before even sitting down to watch it, but it's not really about that. It's much more the journey that the destination. Highly recommendedMy Grade: A- 2-disc special editionDVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary by Director Michael Mann; and 3 Theatrical Trailers Disc 2) ""The Making Of Heat"" 3-part documentary; 2 featurettes (Pacino And De Niro: The Conversation, & Return To The Scene Of The Crime); and 11 Deleted Scenes",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Heat will make you hot!,"Rarely will I sit through a movie longer than two hours at home, but Heat was truly a movie that deserved my attention. Intricate plot details had to be caught in order to fully understand this movie. I fell in love with Chris (Val Kilmer) and his warm, dedicated love for the woman he loved. Robert De Niro enthralled me as Neil, he was sexy and strong, with an air of sophistication not usually associated with a cocky crook. Pacino was a ""spirit of the law"" cop that knew he had a job to do. ""Heat"" blurs the line of good guy/bad guy, yet continually instills a sense of right vs wrong through real life structure in the movie. A real movie, not relying on graphics and garbage, but acting and emotions, Heat is an excellent movie, especially for a rainy day.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Near Perfect Movie!!,"I am a big fan of crime thrillers. It does not take a lot of time for you to realize that you are watching a great movie. The dialogs, acting, cinematography and direction are top-notch which elevate the movie to a great level. The film features Robert De Niro who is a professional criminal and Al Pacino who is an LAPD detective tasked with catching De Niro. A film featuring two past Oscar winners in itself is a good enough reason to watch this movie. Both of them give stellar performances and the rest of the cast give a decent support to these two powerhouses. The screenplay is smart without being self indulgent. A truly spectacular movie that demands repeat viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliant film!,Just watched this again last night as it was on the telly.I had forgotten how good it was! Some really good lines and great casting.Love the relationship between Pacino and De Niro.ADD THIS TO YOUR WATCHLIST!,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Yeah, it's that good","Set aside a few hours and settle in, because you are in for a treat.Michael Mann's Heat is a sprawling L. A. crime movie, full of well-defined characters (supporting, ancillary, you name it) gritty locations and intense shootouts - a showstopper bank robbery, in particular. The thing is massive.But it all really comes down to two guys.About halfway in is the famous coffee shop scene between the two stars. De Niro is the brutally disciplined heist man who's angling for that one last job, and Pacino's the apex predator cop who lives to stop guys like him. Both are protagonists, consummate professionals and completely relatable. This is a zero-sum game and you don't want either of them to lose. Without fail, I find myself sucked into the lives of these characters - all of whom live and operate in violence (a world I want no part of) and I can't get enough.As riveting as the shootouts are (bolstered by expert weapons-handling) this is indeed a saga, one that engages from beginning to end. This is a story to get utterly lost in, and I've never had a three-hour runtime go nearly this fast. For me, this is Mann's masterpiece and that isn't hyperbole.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Heat and Hemingway,"A lot already has been said, so very briefly some lose points:The atmosphere in the movie reminds me of the atmosphere in Hemingway's novels: ""You understand this because you are a man.""The movie looks great. Nice pictures. Real slick. The same goes for the music. Really sets the right atmosphere.The two main roles are acted out very well. Many other characters are very flat, but that didn't bother me.The storyline is absolutely not credible, but hey, who cares. I don't think that was a goal of the writer anyway.The thematics are not nobel prize material, but should be challenging even to an intellectual person.My opinion: a classic in the action genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Heat is truly epic,"The coffee shop scene tells everything about this film. The human side of the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning De Niro's character (Neil). His personal conflicts are as strong as his determination and skills as a gangster. This is the magic of this film and only two fantastic actors like Pacino and De Niro could represent it so totally. Congratulations to Val Kilmer that shined and performed exceptionally well under the huge shadow of Pacino and De Niro. ""Heat"" carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted. Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you've lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart. When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again. I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own. The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen. The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering ""who could be so lucky to work with them?"". From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) ""Heat"" grabs you and pulls you in. This is a true film masterpiece. A must see !",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good cop bad guy / bad cop good guy?,"The attraction of this film is obvious in the star-power of its twin leads Pacino and De Niro. Having both come through the 70's and 80's with many career-defining roles with Al usually on the side of the Angels and Bob down with the Devils, this film can be seen as at least a semi-colon if not quite a full-stop to these actors playing these types of parts again. Myself I wouldn't have thought Michael Mann the director to get them in the same movie (even if they only meet up in two scenes), as my preconceptions of Mann back in the mid 90's pretty much begin and end with TV's style-over-content ""Miami Vice"", meaning I was expecting over-exaggerated characters, extreme situations, improbable connections, loud background music and of course lots of gunpower and violence. Well I got them all, but somehow, overblown and unbelievable as it was, as a movie it still worked.Mann plays up the duality of these two brilliant but idiosyncratic men, Pacino's Vincent Hanna and De Niro's Neil McCauley on different sides of the law and enables us to look behind the tough-guy personae to at least glimpse their lives away from crime only to discover that these two don't have a life outside the commission of crime by one and the prevention of crime by the other.Switch leads...? I don't think so. Pacino plays the all-powerful cop in his typical shouty, showy way while De Niro depicts the cool-headed, resourceful crook in his more understated but still highly characteristic way. The main scene where they meet and establish a reluctantly conceded mutual admiration is probably the film's best, two peacocks parading their feathers in front of each other. Of the supporting cast, Val Kilmer makes a big impression as the gun-happy young Maverick in thrall to his boss De Niro and while I don't know much about the two actresses who play the main protagonists' women, both more than hold their own in their scenes with their men.Of course, with Mann you get big set pieces, superbly staged, with the centrepiece being the bank heist that goes spectacularly wrong and ends up a high-volume shoot out in the shopping mall but there's also De Niro's revenge hit on his gang's snitch and the tense final shoot-out between the big two. Mann's cinematography throughout treats L.A. as almost a character in the movie with numerous night-time city-scapes as De Niro and his new girl seek to somehow rise above what they are and escape their pasts while Pacino is frequently seen in a police helicopter zooming in and out of the city's skyscrapers as he tries to keep a lid on the rampant crime on his beat. Hand in hand with the stylish visuals goes the use of music to add further shade and drama to proceedings with a suitably dense, Gothic soundtrack which almost elevate the film to a modern day grand opera.It's arguable whether Mann, De Niro or Pacino were ever this good again with all three since then making movie choices they surely would regret in hindsight if they'd thought or cared much about their own legacies. But as late-career artistic hurrahs go, this is about as good as it gets, I'd say.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You know for me the action is the juice,"Probably the greatest cops and robbers movie ever made. A masterful character driven film that doesn't disappoint. Also the acting is grade one. A masterpiece in cinema. Michael Mann has made some great movies in the past. Movie's like Ali, Collateral, Public Enemie's and Last of the Mohican's to name but a few. However Heat, I think is his masterpiece. Add in Al Pacino and Robert De'Niro intl the mix and you know that your going to see something really special. I have seen this movie many time's in the past and it never dissappoint's. Also the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. This movie is for my generation what the Godfather did for the previous generation....",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Heat"" makes me feel like I am Robert de Niro AND Al Pacino. You just cant beat that feeling!","""Heat"" makes me feel I am Robert de Niro for a minute. It gives me an instant of illusion that I could be Al Pacino as well. I can be a hero for a minute: cool, calm and collected.Isnt that the greatest thrill!What is it that makes ""Heat"" especially stand out above all the other gangster flicks? In short: the true to life depiction of heists and gun fights. They are truly riveting, like I havent seen the equal of over the last decades. I would dare to say, that ""Heat"" has one of the ultimate gun fights ever recorded on the silver screen. It is filmed in a way that gives me the impression that I was there, right smack in the middle of it, because the PHOTOGRAPHY IS ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT!But the acting performances by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro are ofcourse the real reason why everybody wants to see this movie. They both act truly magnificent! ""Heat"" will be looked upon in movie history as THE ultimate ""battle"" between Robert de Niro and Al Pacino, because these 2 legends had never acted together before in 1995.The story in short: Detective Al Pacino is trying to catch gangster Robert de Niro for a big crime he is about to commit. Both detective and gangster are lone souls, destined to loneliness forever, only to find solace in the company of each other, however hard they try to destroy each other as well. That is the bitter irony of this story.Almost clocking at 3 hours, this thriller is a contineously fueled adrenaline shot. Director Michael Mann's best work. Worthy of many rewatches, because this movie still stands strong, decades after having been made. Terrific music score as well and I mean really haunting and mesmirising music, often conjuring up ambiances which truly lift this movie up to an even higher level. One of the best gangster classics in American cinema!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best Climax,"One of the best climax movie ever, where Nolan inspired and almost stole from, for Dark Knight.It's a 3 hour long robbery film with every sides of process, from family relations to revenge. The best part is that It never slows down, heat always goes up until the last second.Al Pacino played well, Robert De Niro good as well in action scenes but he could play better in other scenes. Also there's a well acted side stories that even makes it more enjoyable to watch.9/10
