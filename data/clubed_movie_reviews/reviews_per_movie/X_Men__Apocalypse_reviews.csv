good with a couple of problems,"En Sabah Nur is Apocalypse, the first mutant who ruled ancient Egypt until he was entombed. It's the 80's. CIA agent Moira MacTaggert goes to Egypt and witnesses his emergence. He recruits his four horsemen Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel giving them greater power. Meanwhile, Raven recruits Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler from an East Berlin fight club. Alex Summers brings his younger brother Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's school. Quicksilver arrives at the school just in time to rescue almost everybody from an explosion but Professor X is kidnapped by Apocalypse.I really like the first half. There are some good introduction of the new characters. It's working fine for the most part. It hits the pinnacle with Quicksilver's rescue which is funny and exciting. It is visually dynamic and a joy to behold. The rest of the movie feels like a long slow slide into mediocrity.The most troubling problem for the continuing franchise is the use of Mystique as the leading X-Men. That character has never been in that role. JLaw is struggling to put out the intensity to match the central part. She and her character is not up to the task so far. It's also funny that her powers is to not be JLaw. The other problem is Apocalypse. I hoped for better but his mega-destruction is underwhelming. It's a lot of bland and his powers are nebulous. I actually think it would have been better to allow Apocalypse to be a two-parter. As an one-and-done villain, he isn't allowed to be anything more than a monster of the moment. With a lower level of power from him, it could be more compelling to struggle for the soul of each horseman. As it stands, the character Apocalypse is nothing special.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Gripping but Flawed X-Men Movie,"X-Men: Apocalypse is the sequel to Days of Future Past and takes place  about a decade later in the '80s. This movie entertained me from start  to finish and I can't say I was ever bored. But there are a lot of  things I was not satisfied with while watching. Starting off with the  good, Magneto and Professor X continue to be the best parts of these  movies. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is amazing and he has a really  emotional scene towards the beginning which got me locked into the  film. James McAvoy is also great as Xavier. The internal battles inside  Xavier's head were riveting. I really liked the new cast of the younger  X-Men, like Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops. Quicksilver  has another awesome scene just like the previous movie. The action is  handled very well for the most part. The first half of the movie is  terrific, but the second half brings it down.  Apocalypse as the villain was OK for me. Some scenes worked well and  others didn't. I was always skeptical of Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and  I still don't think he was the best choice. He is just like Jesse  Eisenberg as Lex Luthor for me. Apocalypse is also a small mutant  compared to the others for some reason and he's just another villain  who is obsessed with destroying the world, and his motivations are  thin. Jennifer Lawrence was a boring Mystique. She just seems  uninspired throughout the run-time and becomes tedious since she uses  the personality over and over again to play the character. Some mutants  were completely wasted here with Psylocke and Angel. There's an entire  sequence in a secret lab and it seemed there for only one reason: the  cameo of a specific person. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do  much of anything for the story in the long run. The entire thing could  have been removed and the movie would have been the same. The final  battle felt underwhelming with the whole global extinction. The problem  is they don't show any civilians dying; it's just buildings coming  apart, making it hard to care about the situation.   Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is a disappointing sequel to First Class and  Days of Future Past. But it is not at all a bad movie. Magneto and  Professor X are once again great, Apocalypse is a mixed bag, the pacing  for the movie is all over the place, and the dull second half just  brings the film down from the really good first half.  X-Men: Apocalypse gets a B-.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men,"Suffering from bizarre narrative choices and weak character development, X-Men: Apocalypse is an otherwise passable and occasionally great installment of the franchise, mainly due to the continued strong performances and glorious action set pieces.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wasn't Great but Still Deserves a Watch,"X-Men Apocalypse takes place in the 1980's, 10 years after the events in Days of Future Past. A god-like mutant has awaken and wants to destroy civilization in order to regain his rule. The X-Men must stop him before he becomes to powerful.I simply didn't find this story to be particularly interesting or believable compared to the other superhero movies in recent years. Apocalypse didn't look or feel all that powerful even though his powers would indicate he was. He was shorter than some of the mutants when in the comics he is a giant and didn't need much assistance. The gathering of the horseman was also kind of sad as he felt like he just picked up the first four mutants that he saw. There was nothing special about them, they each said I will join you but that is about it. Apocalpse is the kind of villain that you make into two movies, like what Disney is doing with Thanos. The first movie could have been used for Apocaplse to acquire his army of followers and the second could have focused on the battle and how the X-Men will respond to the situation. I guess that is why they are not doing that as the two would look similar. I personally don't think we needed another end of the world X-men movie given that we just got one. DoFP just seemed more intense of a situation which also lead to my mediocre interest in this battle.The scenes that didn't involve Apocalypse were for the most part quite enjoyable. Most notably the Quicksilver scenes as Evan Peters once again steals the show. The new actors also did great in their roles and had good chemistry with one another. Of course, this may be my own personal problem but again I find Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique to be just bland. The lines she spewed just lacked emotion and her one liners fell flat. I am glad that this was her last movie.I didn't enjoy the movie as a whole but the parts that I did like made up for the fact that it is just rather mediocre. I still recommend seeing it just be warned. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men Apocalypse may not be the best X-Men movie made but it is still enjoyable if you're an X-Men fan!,"I loved all the X-Men movies, including X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I was so hyped when I heard they were creating an X-Men movie with Apocalypse in it. I have always loved superhero movies about the end of days. I will say specific parts that I loved and thought about this film and how I would recommend it.How good is this movie? It may not top the previous X-Men movies but that doesn't mean the movie is terrible. It is all based on opinion. Don't be scared to see the movie all because critics are making this movie look bad, go see it for yourself for your own opinion. You decide whether the movie is good or not. In my opinion, it is actually good. Not great, but good.Are the younger versions of the X-Men in this film? Yes. We have a younger version of Cyclops, Jean, Nightcrawler and Storm. We also have many amazing recurring members from the previous movies such as the young Professor X who was amazing, a slight older Magneto, Mystique who is also a little older and Beast who is still young as ever. And yes, Quicksilver returns and tops his amazing scene from X-Men: Days of Future's Past.How is Apocalypse the character? Honestly, I feel that Apocalypse was a little weaker than his comic version. If he was CGI like Thanos from Guardians of the Galaxy, he would've looked more threatening and tyrannical. I could basically compare this Apocalypse to a wimp who cosplays as Apocalypse with really good make up. His role is almost similar to Ultron.Is Wolverine in this? Yes! He may have a small cameo but it is a damn excellent cameo! When Wolverine enters the screen, the film basically transforms into an R-Rated action scene. Now that is who Wolverine is. It is also based on the real weapon x origin of Wolverine. He acts like a wild animal and slashes anyone who gets in his way and even this guy who begged Wolverine for mercy got his face ripped off!How dark is this film? It is actually pretty dark. There is a lot of death and depressing moments you will feel. We also get more connected with Magneto and why he hates humanity so much. It almost felt as he was the main antagonist in this film. We see his past and his present and why he turned into a dark and yet powerful supervillain. Also, the way Apocalypse murders people is pretty brutal and frightening.Would you recommend it? Of course! Like I said, it may not top the previous X-Men films but that doesn't mean it is terrible. If you love X-Men, as well as apocalyptic superhero movies, then this is the film for you. Go see it!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Screw Rotten Tomatoes this movie is as fantastic as it could get,"Okay, this is already the fourth superhero film we have gotten so far this year. The fact that it's this good blows my mind, it's the sixth entry in the main X-Men series, and it might be the third best after X2 and Days of Future Past. Oscar Isaac gives an outstanding performance as the mutant menace: Apocalypse, he was the highlight of the film right next to Fassbender's Magneto (who never fails to deliver). In a year with pathetic and disappointing superhero film villains so far, Apocalypse gives us the layered and threatening performance we want from our villains. Evan Peters returns as Quicksilver once more to give us an amazing scene that tops the one from Days of Future Past. The newcomers are fantastic and exciting and we will certainly see them again in the future. They also finally got Cyclops right! Forget about Rotten Tomatoes and go see this film opening weekend, you won't regret!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sacrifices thematic depth and complex characters for superficial thrills and repetitive plots,"The word ""apocalypse"" brings to mind an end-of-the world event of biblical proportions. X- MEN APOCALYPSE brings to mind some Japanese anime and a yearning for the better X- men movies of the past. The third in this ""new trilogy"" that began with X-MEN FIRST CLASS, the franchise reached its high point in the epic X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but now tips back down to a rather typical tale of good vs evil intertwined with the usual hero's journey. Thankfully the masterful execution of dialogue and acting chops saves this film from sinking into mediocrity.There are lot of plot threads to follow. Fortunately or unfortunately it does not require much inferring or complex thinking to follow the story. It is very simple and it is in its simplicity that it loses out on the richness of character than past xmen movies had. Our characters are all reduced to two dimensional archetypes each with familiar story arcs. So familiar in fact that the whole movie is a pastiche of plot points taken from past xmen movies. Eric is the grief stricken blood knight who goes evil with vengeance when tragedy strikes, again. Scott jean and Kurt are the inexperienced loners who have to work together to overcome their challenges, a little like pyro, Bobby drake (ice man) and kitty pryde (shadow cat) in X-men 2. Mystique replaces wolverine as the badass wanderer who is thrown into a leadership position to guide our young loners. Xavier is once again captured and the X-men's home base is compromised, again like X-MEN 2. Powerful mutant with delusions of godhood and a gang of loyal followers is Apocalypse this time replacing magneto's role in the first 3 xmen movies. Call it homage or call it cliché, I feel that this story manages to toe the line between familiar and fresh. The familiar elements gives us a sense of the revolving nature of conflict, that history repeats despite the best intentions. The fresh elements of course add new facets to a film which could have otherwise been a complete bore, thanks to the slow burn nature of the plot which mostly sees both good guys and bad guys gathering their key players for the final showdown. Those who can appreciate a slow build up would love this while those who need their immediate action fix would be left disappointed.Divisive might be the best word to describe this movie. When the action does come, it is a special effects spectacle of mutant powers on display where everyone.......pretty much stands around shooting things at each other. Oh look, the villain is getting the upper hand! Let's shoot more! Where physical stunts and fights come, they are a thrill to behold except the dated wire work which feels artificial. Interspersed between these divisive battles are particular scenes of movie magic. Quicksilver (last see in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST) returns and we get to see the full extent of his powers once again only on a larger scale. And at least this time he has a purpose in the story other than being a just a miraculous attempt. But as mentioned earlier his motivations are touched on but not explored. His character is simplified into yet another archetype.Beneath the visual spectacle, the movie under utilises its cast of characters. Ty Sheridan's Scott Summers could have been great as the new audience surrogate, going from meek bullied loser to taking his first steps as confident leader of the X-Men. Instead he is also shoved into the background after his introduction. Kodi-smith mcfee's more feline looking Nightcrawler is also another intriguing character sidelined. Instead we get more Charles Xavier and more Eric playing out their character drama like star crossed lovers. Don't get me wrong, they are fantastic actors, especially Michael Fassbender completely nailing the tragedy of Eric's character arc. But their story came to a decent close in the last movie and this one just feels like more of the same.Apocalypse himself is a villain that is as equally divisive as the movie itself. On one hand, it seemed that the creators were going for the ""all powerful but frail"" type of villain ala emperor Palpatine of Star Wars. The snake-like menace that Oscar Isaac exudes through his sinister delivery is betrayed by a design that borders on corny. Oversized platform boots, plastic looking Armour and an ill defined set of powers all downplay the threatening presence of the villain. His motivations could have been much deeper. A commentary on modern commercialism replacing the religions of old perhaps as the new ""cult following""? Or a criticism of humanity's arrogance and self glorifying nature? Maybe even a critique on how common folk are quick to idolise mortal ""false gods"" of the influential and powerful? No, no and no. None of that thematic depth here. Apocalypse is merely your Saturday morning cartoon variety villain who wants to destroy the world to rebuild in his image.It is not a bad movie per se. Visually stunning, an easy-to-follow plot and well cast characters set to a script filled with witty dialogue that does not overdo the comedy. The acting is professional and the music by John Ottman is a grand thematic continuation of But for a grand finale it pales in comparison to films like X-MEN 2 by glossing over its deeper themes of social commentary especially, in the treatment of mutants as an allegory to prejudice against social minorities. It lacks the urgency, high stakes tension and emotional depth of DAYS OF FUTURE PAST and the chemistry among the cast is no where near XMEN FIRST CLASS. I would place it as a middling entry into the X-men franchise that succeeds in opening the doors to a whole new generation of X-men movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An enjoyable film for X-Men fans,"X-Men Apocalypse is an enjoyable experience. It has very good special effects. Stunning, if I might add. There are many characters, which is a great thing. X-Men movies are about mutants being connected and by doing everything together, they can achieve greater good.About the film: -The main antagonist Apocalypse does not feel like a scary and all-mighty villain. -His lines are simple and a bit dull. There should be more depth to them.+Great CGI +Amazing cast, Fassbender NAILED it as Magneto (once again) +Many characters +Scenes you will never forget (in the best way)I still feel like Days of Future Past is far better than Apocalypse. Only thing this movie was missing was the depth of the antagonist.Still, do yourself a favor and go watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spectacular,"This is not going to be a long review, i want to summarize my thoughts on the film, now after i just saw it in the cinema.The movie is absolutely spectacular. The effects, the settings, the pacing, the acting, the music, the direction. It is all very well done, and if the story itself had kept up with the rest, this would be close to one of the best, if not the best, superhero film to date.But the story is a bit weak, it's hard to take in a few of the twists and turns in this film, but still everything else is so brilliantly crafted, the movie pulls it off anyways, and that makes me feel i got my moneys worth. This is very important to me when i go the cinema. I need to walk out feeling i was entertained.I'm usually the guy that puts story and script first when it comes to films. Way to often when the story is bad, the script and the acting and all the rest that follows almost always seem half done. This is not the case here.This movie is like when you bake a cake, and you end up putting in a small amount of salt instead of sugar. You notice you did, but you don't have time to fix your mistake, so you bake the cake to the best of your abilities anyways. At the end it's one hell of a spectacular looking cake you made, but people notice the taste is a bit off, but somehow the added salt contributed to the flavor in a good way, and the cake was very much edible.This is how i feel after seeing this film. It is really well crafted, and i do recommend people seeing it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great closure of the new trilogy,"X-men Apocalypse has received mixed reviews from critics and some audience members, but I will say that ,is awesome no doubt. For starter it introduce the characters of Storm, Nightclawel, Cyclops, Marvel Girl and continued the thing of the new trilogy, with the First Class been in the sixties, Future in the seventies, this was in the eighties and the setting ,the costume and the references show that it was put work in to it.Now when I went to see it ,I had just finish my exam period in the university and I wanted something to light up. I get it and much more. For the title character Apocalypse I was pump and Oscar Isaak took this character ,whose freaking name is APOCALYPSE and gave an great performance ,that combine with the fact that the powers of the character were more that he fingers in my hands gave me much joy. To the story Apocalypse lived during antiquity and was praised and after a big sleep he awakes in the '80 and seeing how the world had become he decides to give lessons in power. For that he takes four persons to be his horsemen and increase their powers to maximum. Between them is also Magneto ,just THINK a buffed up MAGNETO my lord of Light protect me. Against them are the X-men who are a mix among the older team and the new students ,great!This movie like the First Clas is an X-men movie with out Wolverine in the lead role, though he makes a small cameo and I will say I was waiting to see him like that since the two thousands', the same apply to many of the new X-men who were much more in the movie than I expected and the actors done a fantastic job. Sophie Turner as Gean Grey, great choice and she is really well suited in this uncanny team, first you take the North and now the X-men I bend the knee to the new Queen of the Nerds!Now to the theme of the movie, here is family and what we are willing to do in order to have one, protect it and avenge it ,if it went there, the movie shows what are the X-men apart of superheroes ,are a family and as Macvoy says ""I feel sorry for the man who is going to hurt them (X-men)"" ,thanks Professor you are awesome. Now I get a bit why critics have hit this movie show much, it is because after Days of Future Past, Deadpool raise the standards for X-men flicks and the fact that only three weeks before Civl War was in release made many people to compare them and lets face it Civil is the best movie of Marvel so far!In the end between Batman versus Superman and Apocalypse the latter took wrongfully show mixed reviews. Also this the last movie with Jennifer Lawrence as Mustique ,pity but we end up with a high note.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I think the critics have been way too harsh in this case - It's actually rather good.,"As you can probably gather I thought this was another very good addition to the X-Men franchise. Whilst it doesn't hit the heady heights of Days of Future Past it still is a really good watch and I fail to see why it has had a mixed press.Firstly I found it to have a perfectly serviceable story, with Apocalypse and his followers recruiting the very vulnerable and angry Magneto as part of his plan to destroy civilisation and rebuild it in his image. Fassbender turns in another solid performance and you really feel his pain and confusion for the Erik/Magneto character. I also thought all the supporting cast were absolutely fine in their roles, and to me Evan Peters as Quicksilver really stole the scenes he was in and makes a fine addition to the cast. The same also goes to Tye Sheridan as Scott/Cyclops, whose back story is filled in better and with more depth than it was in the Wolverine origins film.I see the critics have been moaning about having too many characters in the film, yet I actually think it was handled better than it was in the Captain America: Civil War film. In Apocalypse the large cast do actually have something to do and contribute to the story, whereas the Captain America film felt like some were shoe horned in, which I felt made that film feel bloated and repetitive whereas this one at least get the storyline moving. I felt that Civil War felt way too long because of all the story padding yet Apocalypse, whilst also a long film, kept my interest to the end (and yes there is a post credits scene that I suspect is setting up Wolverine 3). I should also add that Apocalypse, despite it's bleak story, does have some moments of humour and wit that went down well with the audience.I also felt the surprise appearance of Wolverine fitted in nicely with the back story that we already know, particularly the one told in X Men 2 and the Origins film, nicely closing that particular characters story arc and fitting in perfectly with the circumstances surrounding his appearance in the very first X-Men film of 16 years ago. If this is to be Wolverines final appearance with the X-men then they have given him a lovely send off.I did find some minor flaws with the film though, particularly with the visual appearance of some of the characters and how their ages don't compute when the first X-men film of 2000 is taken into account. However, asides from that I thoroughly enjoyed X-Men Apocalypse and thought it was a solid & worthy addition to the other X-Men films. The films had spectacle, action, laughs and carried on with the journeys of the characters we have got to know and love over the past sixteen years.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not the best, but still a worthy addition to the saga!","Perhaps it's because I've been told how bad this movie is supposed to be by every review I've read beforehand, but this was a great (action) flick! Granted, it's not the most profound of the X-Men film. But then again, what can you expect from a film with a premise about defeating the ultimate evil? As it turns out, quite a lot actually. It's a bit more than a straight up battle royal. I won't spoil anything here but there are some scenes and lines that really do forward the plot lines of individual characters as well as the overall universe. It's not much but it is presented in such a nice package that it satisfied me (and I definitely don't like dumb action films).Having said that, the action in this film is superb. It might be that this does overshadow the plot and character development to some extent but I can't fault a film for having amazing battle scenes. I have rarely been blown away by action scenes in an X-men film. But this film definitely upped the bar. And not just by Quicksilver's amazing scene (which blows the previous out of the water).I feel this film has gotten an undeserved bad reputation. For instance, I recall critics discussing why Apocalypse was underwhelming, in both dialogue and stature. They said it was strange that he could grow tall (as seen in the trailer) but then didn't do this all the time. That is unfair criticism as there is a great explanation for why that occurred only in that particular instance.The above is just an example but overall I feel the criticism was undeserved. And it may well be that this is to be the final X-men film. If that is the case then this is the perfect ending. This film's plot development does bring the X-men saga full circle. I'm a sucker for a good origin story and this film tells the origin of all parts of the title: both Apocalypse and The X-Men themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mostly well-done with one of the best villains of the franchise. One or two flaws.,"So X-Men: Apocalypse is either the third, sixth, or ninth film in the series depending on how you're counting and stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence returning for a third time while bringing in new cast such as Oscar Isaac, Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan. The basic plot is that an ancient, powerful mutant known as En Sabah Nur has awoken in the 80s and wants to ""cleanse the earth"" of the weak and so the X-Men must stop him.As a whole, I like the X-Men franchise; despite it's bumps I've always felt it's had it's own vibe and personality and is different enough from other comic book universes such as the MCU and the not- so-connected DC properties. X-Men: Apocalypse continues in this and although shares similarities with other movie plots still feels like an X-Men movie. The stories we witness in this film are some of the finest we've seen in the franchise. The two biggest characters we've been following for years of course are Professor X and Magneto and each of them are so well-developed and incredible characters you know exactly what they are feeling and why they are where they are. Magneto's arc in this film is a highlight and from one particular scene in a forest you are hooked on his story and understand why he's doing the things he is. Professor X is great as the leader and strong-minded force who keeps the X-Men together and he really has some great scenes, especially towards the end. Another story in this movie is of course the one of the titular character himself, Apocalypse; his backstory in Ancient Egypt alone was a thrilling and well executed event and when you really see what he can do in the 80s I found him to be the most powerful and best villain they've had in the franchise. Just his voice, and mannerisms are so dark and menacing you really feel like he is an unstoppable threat.Apart from those three, other character highlights were the young Jean Grey, Cyclops and Nightcrawler who fit well into the story and I really enjoyed seeing them, and then of course Quicksilver returning from Days of Future Past doing much more in the movie including one of the best scenes of any superhero movie, beating that of his previous. Everyone else did OK but weren't really used as much; Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique doesn't do quite as much as she has done and never has her own 'action piece' as it were and then three of the horsemen, Psylocke, Angel and Storm each had one particular shot that was cool but mostly stood around until the climax where they still didn't have too much screen time.Effects wise, all the powers and abilities looked fantastic. There was a lot of CGI and green-screen during the climactic battle and for me personally I thought that all looked just fine. There were one or two specific shots which weren't particularly good in my eyes but that was it.Some problems I had with the movie was that, as I said, some characters didn't really have much screen time and/or didn't really do anything at all (looking at you Jubilee) and then another thing isn't really a problem as it is the ninth X-Men-related movie but X- Men: Apocalypse requires you to know and remember quite a bit of the past films and this universe in general, so it makes it almost inaccessible completely to the general movie-going audience and unless you've seen at least five of the other films a lot will go over your head and seem out of place. And as a final negative point there were two scenes in particular that pushed the 12A (PG-13) rating to it's limits which will be fine for a lot of people but I think some will be quite surprised at how dark they went.Other than that X-Men: Apocalypse is a really powerful and thrilling superhero movie, and for me one of the best in the series, not quite beating First Class as my favorite.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty good,"X-Men: Apocalypse was very fun, but got quite messy at parts. X-Men fans will like this just like I did. it is a huge step down from Days of Future Past and has a pretty clichéd villain. I forgave the clichéd villain because of how cool and how frightening he was. Oscar Isaac did so good as Apocalypse. The characters are well developed, but some of them do not get enough screen time and some get to much. Angel, Psyloche and Storm have no motivation, there is no reason why they agreed to help Apocalypse destroy the world. What would they gain? Overall I thought the movie was good, I had a blast watching it and will be watching it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Twizard Rating: 94,"X-Men story lines all pretty much revolve around the same theme: Humans fearing mutants and acting upon it irrationally, causing bad mutants to revolt and good mutants to attempt peace.We start off in 3600 B.C., with set pieces that showcase ancient Egypt as good as any we've seen since maybe The Mummy in 1999. Here, the first mutant known to man, En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse (though his name doesn't seem to really be important), gets betrayed and trapped underground for centuries. This dude would've given me nightmares if I saw him as a child.Then we wind up in the 1980s, with some cool zeitgeists of the era. But not too much so that it becomes a nostalgia flick--though that wouldn't be too bad either. We catch up with our X-Men stars ten years after the events in X-Men First Class. We're introduced to a few new mutants and get most of our favorites back. Apocalypse gets awoken from his long sleep and decides to assemble a team to kill off humans--along with any mutant who stands in his way.The film does a great job of balancing a cornucopia of character's story lines. Everyone is accounted for, but wisely, most of the villains aren't touched upon that much--including Apocalypse. Some may argue that he lacks a unique incentive, but when you're the most powerful mutant ever and thirst for omnipotence, what other incentive do you need? But it does go beyond that. His philosophy is Hitler-esque in that he wants to destroy who he believes to be inferior beings. And he's given a sort of false-charisma that makes the fact that he has followers believable.The only other villain for which we get sufficient depth established is Magneto--perhaps the most compelling story in the whole X-Men saga--with only Wolverine's giving it a run for its money. Magneto walks the line between good and evil at times in the series, with his fantastic dynamic/friendship with Professor Xavier furthered upon even more in this film.The action doesn't feel empty and neither does the plot. The characters are enjoyable and we don't feel cheated out of anyone's backstory. But we don't feel forced into one either. The good thing about having multiple movies and prequels is that we trust that, in time, we will know each character's origin.X-Men: Apocalypse may not have the most radical of premises within the X-Men universe, but its a subject that is still treated with much realism and ongoingness--something other franchises don't do quite as well. The civil war battle thing has been a common theme among superhero movies this year, and X-Men does it best. Something of the grandest proportions is actually at stake. Heroes and civilization as a whole may actually be destroyed.It all makes this a solid installment in the series and maybe the best superhero movie this year (so far). Plus, its plethora of characters and a creepy antagonist make the movie engaging and not feel quite as long as it is. We needed some redemption after the slap-in-the-face time travel entry, Days of Future Past, nullified the stories in a franchise we've grown to appreciate. That was more of a cool idea in the moment, while this movie is an important idea.Oh, and we also get an esoteric post-credits scene, whose meaning will most likely be forgotten by the time the next film comes out anyway.Twizard Rating: 94",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining, but inconsistent sequel in the X-Men series...","The first X-Men trilogy was weirdly obsessed with Wolverine, and by extension Rouge. I never understood why... This new trilogy is obsessed with Mystique just because America's sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence is portraying her. I don't mind it, but Mystique is no hero, she is a devious villain! And Beast should be well a Beast, but a handsome Nicholas Hoult is better to look at I presume. Storm is not a villain, she is a beloved X-Men character that has never been done justice. These are things that enrage fans over and over again.It is not about being a purist, but about honoring the original. In an age where superheros are invading our cinemas, one could do worse if one watches a film about hope and freedom, about homophobia, racism, bigotry, immigration and all sort of other social issues. And somehow none of the X-men films so far have successfully brought these themes to the screen.This film suffers from having to focus on thousands of characters and locations. Some characters like Mystique and Magneto are given substantial screen time, while others such as Psylocke are given only a few scenes. The film also tries to fit into the overall X-Men continuity, while trying to stand up on its own.A great film for a pop-corn viewing with your friends, but a sub-par X-Men film in general...

"A good film, but expected more","This movie had a difficult task, trying to top 'Days of Future Past' which in my opinion is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, while this film was good, it fails on many aspects that made the previous one so good.The acting here is very good, there is not one bad actor here. Michael Fassbender is the star performer here, the scenes in which he was the centre of, always turned out great. But I would go as far to say, we did not see enough of him. The movie follows the heroes more, but does do a great job at showing the threat of Apocalypse. Oscar Isaac as the main villain was a brilliant choice. From the trailers and posters, I believed that he would be over the top, but instead he is intimidating.The story on the other hand, is not too compelling. X-Men, X-Men 2, First Class and Days of Future Past, have all had great stories. They were all perfectly paced, with enough going on to keep you both, invested in the main characters and everything else that's going on. This film is a mess. Some characters were a complete letdown, we were made to believe that they would be kick-ass, but instead they stood in the back not uttering a word. I would say that I was not greatly disappointed in Jennifer Lawrence character here, while she was important, I believed that she did not suit well in the hero role. Mystique is a villain, and she should stay that way. By having her being an hero this time around, does seem right.This film is not bad, the critics, yet again don't know what they hell they are doing, with their ridiculous reviews, but this is not even close to being as good as the other X-men films we have had. With the exception of Origins: Wolverine (shivers). Go see the film is you are a fan of the series, and you will possibly like it, but don't expect it to be as good as the last one.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A satisfying and entertaining film,"X-Men: Apocalypse is a movie that while hated by many is also loved by many including me. It is not as good as batman v superman or civil war but it is entertaining and worth the price of admission. it never leaves you confused and the visual effects are mind blowing. It will give you a true look into the legendary characters of the X-Men and has been one of my favorite movies in 2016. This movie has humor, a great plot, character development and stays true to the source material and leaves you wanting to see the next movie. There is also some moments that make the characters human and tragic. They are shown to be viewed as they would in real life if they were to exist as they are hated and not trusted by many in the world that they live in. The villain is also very convincing and is an interesting figure in this movie. Overall, this movie is a 7/10 for me due to the reasons listed above.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A decent X men film,"X Men apocalypse adds nothing new to a landscape filled with superhero films and lots of X Men films of old, but just cause it doesn't add anything new doesn't make it a bad film. \From Xavier going bald to Magneto becoming one of the four horseman this film is standard from beginning to end, but I can't say I didn't enjoy it.It was fun to see Magento completely wrecking the X Men. And all of the end of the world stuff wasn't too bad either.I enjoyed Apocalypse as a villain even if he was cliché.The movie doesn't develop the 4 horsemen enough, but that not a bad thing at all. They didn't need to much development. What they were given was good enough for the story that was trying to be told.Quicksilver steals this movie though. He really is the best part of this franchise",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The X-men just band together to avoid the Apocalypse!,"My expectations were low coming into this one so I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It was not perfect, a Bryan Singer X-men film is never going to be perfect at this point, but it did contain a lot of cool action and quite a few mutants. Sure, I was not happy when I initially saw that Storm, Magneto and Psylocke were three of Apocalypse's horsemen in the film when none of them were in the comics; however, the story of why those three joined worked enough that I am not quite as baffled as I first was. I was disappointed by the fact that Angel was a bit more underutilized again, not sure why they find it so difficult to do him, but he does have more of a part here than in the his other film, X-men: The Last Stand which this film takes a jab at. I thought that was uncalled for, I do not understand why everyone dislikes that one so much as that one still has some of the better action sequences and fight sequences of any of the X-men films. A lot of people have been panning this one too, but as I said, I enjoyed it as I was expecting to dislike it quite a bit more than I did. It did do some things I was not fond of, but for the most part this one delivered for me.The story brings us back to Egypt where a strange being with great powers is about to transfer his consciousness over to a person who has great healing ability. This process is interrupted by people who tire of this being, claiming he is a false god and they collapse the pyramid. Unfortunately, the false god is not killed, but only locked away in a sleep. Flash years later and we witness a young Scott Summers learning his amazing ability, Mystique still trying to rescue her fellow mutants and Magneto trying to live life as an ordinary man. Things begin to be set in motion; however, and soon Apocalypse has awakened and he immediately takes a young girl who controls the weather under his wing and gives her incredible powers. He also finds a young woman named Psylocke, Angel and Magneto and he begins his plans to destroy the world and create it anew! Only the new students at Xavier's school for the gifted stand in his way of world domination!Once again, Mystique plays an important role in this film and pretty much aligns with the good guys. Once again, this baffles me as she was never that important in the comic and she never really joined up with the X-men, at least not up to the point I was reading them. They did do a good job of giving Storm and Magneto reasons for joining Apocalypse, but I was kind of disappointed by the way Psylocke was depicted as my mother who had never read the comics assumed that she was a villain in the comics. She is a good guy and though she looks the most like her character than any other character depicted in a Singer film, he managed to make her look too villainous. Nightcrawler was done well and though I still think they do not make Scott as good as he was in the comics he was done better here than the rest of the films. He actually got some good hits in this time! Of course, Quicksilver was once again quick and the most funny of the characters.So this one was good, could have been better, but I will not complain too much. The film is rated PG-13, but it has to be a pretty hard PG-13 as there were some pretty graphic deaths throughout this one. It would not have taken much more to make it an R. It was nice to have a different villain this time in Apocalypse and from the post credit scene if they do another film it will be another villain in that film as well. Though next up will be the next Wolverine film and after that probably Deadpool before another X-men comes out; granted, Deadpool more than likely does not exist in this universe though his character is owned by Fox too. Not sure how he'd do in one of these films, but I do know he would want to be the one to drop the one F-bomb in a most likely PG-13 X-men film. This one was not perfect, but better than expected so overall I was happy with the result and not mad I dropped money to see it in the theaters.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing (No Spoilers!!),"X-Men Apocalypse to me is one of the best X-Men films along with X- men Days of Future Past. The film picks up 10 years after the events of X-Men Days of Future Past, but the film also deals with some of the events that happened in X-Men First Class.Pros:I believe that the X-Men movie franchise is mainly to do with the story of Magneto, and how the tragic events in his life have affected him. X-Men Apocalypse shows the real emotion of Magneto and makes us as an audience understand why he does what he does. Michael Fassbneder really understands the character of Magneto and that helps with his performance.The way they introduced the new characters in this film was done really well. They didn't just chuck them in the film just for fan service (although they do give fan service) they fitted perfectly with the film and the actors made the pages of the comics come to life.Cons:I didn't feel that invested in the character of Apocalypse. Not saying that he was badly acted, I just found that he wasn't that interesting of a character and that made him for me the most boring part of the film.The character of Angle portrayed by Ben Hardy, if found to be a very week character and felt like he was only in the film so they could have all 4 horse man.Conclusion:The film is very entertaining and has a lot of memorable moments and it sets up for future films to come. The film also has a lot of re-play value and most decently worth buying on Blu-Ray.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The First Mutant,"When the first mutant En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac), who was worshiped as a god In Egypt, awakes in the present days, he learns how the world has been transformed in his absence.

Now the only change to save the world depends on Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and a team of young mutants.""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is another enjoyable adventure presenting the first and most powerful mutant of the world. The fight between the good and the evil is engaging and entertaining, supported by top-notch special effects that gives the sensation of a comic book on the screen.

A question for comic book fans.,"This isn't a review of X-Men Apocalypse (a movie I enjoyed, as my rating indicates). Rather it's a question-- an observation, really-- about the genre.Screenplays are based on original ideas, or they're adapted from another source, such as a book, a fairy tale, a play, a TV show, etc. Comic books have recently become a gold mine for adapted screenplays, but the genre isn't new. In 1931, the movie ""Skippy"" was based on a comic strip, and the screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. Two more nominations came in 2003, for ""American Splendor"" and ""Our Cancer Year,"" both based those respective comic book series.Most moviegoers understand that adapting a film from a book or another source means a departure from the original material. Film, after all, is a different medium with different demands on creativity, including whole armies of creative collaborators led by the director and writer(s).But fans of Marvel and DC Comics don't seem to understand that when they enter the movie theater, they're going to see a movie, not a comic book come to life. Many reviews posted here seem to be looking for absolute faithfulness to the original material, which is not only unrealistic (film has different tools), it is an insult to the creative filmmakers who adapt the material.I've seen all the X-Men movies, and the various Avengers films, and Superman and Batman, and etc.-- I'm a genuine fan of the genre. But I have read none of the comics. Not one. I was a film student, and learned to appreciate that medium on its own terms. My favorite novel is ""Moby Dick,"" but nobody needs to read Melville's masterpiece to know that the movies based on it are mediocre. Nor does anyone have to read ""Moneyball"" or ""The Martian"" or ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" or ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""Rebecca"" to know the film adaptions are good.Films must be judged on their own merits, not on how closely they adhere to the original source material. If comic book fans come to terms with that, they may find themselves enjoying the original as well as the adaptation.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-men Apocalypse was overall a good film.,"Unlike a lot of the critics, I feel most of the characters were pretty good. The fight scenes were fun and the mutant abilities were pretty cool.

"After 16 years, Bryan Singer delivers the X Men movie we've all been waiting for!","I am horrified by the people on the message boards here on this movie's threads. They're fighting each other like a bunch of hungry animals. Since when does everyone started listening to the critics? I mean, yes, to have an idea before watching a movie is good, but that's not the case these days. Critics are taking movies way too seriously these days. It's just a source of entertainment. Your life does not depend on it. Stop bad mouthing this movie for others. Okay, sorry for my rant but this has gotten out of control. Now getting back to the movie, let's just say it delivered what it promised. This movie was amazing. It really felt like you were watching something Apocalyptic. Although I don't have had a problem with Bryan Singer's X Men movies, unlike a bunch of whiny babies, this one actually felt like it was an X Men movie. A sheer resemblance of what we saw in X Men cartoons, both evolution and the 1990 ones. We actually saw the main characters of this movie in their mutant form. I have loved how Bryan always preferred acting over action in his other movies, but this one, it consists of both. I have also seen critics saying that this movie is complete CGI. Well it's not like you can do actual Apocalyptic level scenes without having any CGI effects. That's just crazy. And the CGI in this movie is beyond awesome. I already smell an Oscar for CGI for this movie. Oscar Isaac was so impressive in this movie. Even though he was buried under make up and what not, you could actually feel his performance. Michael and James once again give awesome performances. Expected nothing less from Jennifer Lawrence. At least these movies actually give spotlight to the female actresses *cough* *Marvel* *cough*. The new actors were great. So talented. Tye, Sophie, Alexandra, Kodi and of course Evan Peters were all good in their respective roles. This movie might feel a different because of it's whole world at stake thing. This is the first time X Men has done this, and they succeed really good at it. It had a perfect balance of action, humor, emotion and mutants. It was like watching a live action version of those X Men cartoons we grew up watching. Once again, please dear my friends, who would love to see these guys in MCU, it's not happening anytime soon. Let's just get over it, okay? The producer of these movies has already announced a bunch of new movies under Fox. There are X Men TV shows coming out soon, so let us enjoy these while you guys enjoy yours okay?",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Grounded in its storytelling while gorgeous in its pandemonium, Apocalypse is yet another winner from Bryan Singer.","While I prefer First Class and Days of Future Past, Apocalypse truly surprised me. It has the grandest scale of any X-Men movie, and possibly of any superhero movie period. It revolves around the first mutant born tens of thousands of years ago, En Sabah Nur, hailed as an all-powerful god in Egypt before a mutiny in the ranks caused his pyramid to collapse, burying him in the process. Fast forward to the '80s and we see Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) investigating a cult following of this mysterious mutant. Unbeknownst to her, only the smallest amount of sunlight was needed to awaken En Sabah Nur who subsequently causes an earthquake that is felt across the globe. The beginning of this movie is slow, and rightfully so. It shows the origin of Apocalypse, at least how he came to be trapped for all these millennia, and proceeds to show the individual X-Men characters in their respective settings. Magneto has a wife and child, Mystique is rescuing captured mutants like Nightcrawler and Angel, and Professor Xavier is teaching classes in his school. Soon enough, Scott Summers enrolls in the academy and meets Jean Grey. This sounds like a lot to cram into a movie, and it is, but this background was necessary as a foundation for the story to build upon, and boy does it ever.Apocalypse is one of those villains that has only one goal: world domination. Has it been done a thousand times before? Absolutely. Has it been executed as well as this? Probably not. If there was ever a practical motive for a villain to want to push the reset button on Earth, this is it. The guy's name is freaking Apocalypse and was hailed as a god in his time, and having seen how corrupt the world has become, he believes it's time for some new leadership. He has a huge ego and even huger powers to boot. He recruits some mutants, including Storm, Angel, Psylocke, and eventually Magneto, to help fulfill his global extinction plan, and it's exactly as destructive as it sounds. This might be the most catastrophic and destruction-filled action I've ever seen in a superhero movie. Cities crumble into dust, the Earth itself collapses from the inside, every nuclear warhead launches simultaneously across the world. It's pure pandemonium.The acting is superb across the board. There's no need praising McAvoy or Fassbender as they've proved themselves many times over. The newcomers are the real shockers here, especially Scott Summers played by Tye Sheridan and Jean Grey played by Sophie Turner. Both are brilliant in their roles and have great chemistry in the scenes they share. Oscar Isaac is excellent as Apocalypse. The material he's given is fairly vanilla but he pulls it off with both charisma and restraint, acting exactly how you'd expect a ten thousand year old god to act in the modern age. And the guy is just menacing to look at. He has a magnetic, commanding presence, and suitably so, being the most powerful villain ever put to screen. Evan Peters kills it as Quicksilver yet again and is given more screen time, plus another show-stealing scene for the fans of his DoFP debut. It's a large cast but it never feels unbalanced. The characters that need to shine do indeed shine, and even the background characters have their rightful place in the movie. It wasn't cluttered like it could have been. Rather, some of the best scenes in the movie are quiet character building moments.This was officially the last straw for me in regards to the credibility of critic scores. Just because it's not as good as Civil War doesn't make it a bad movie, and their criticisms of ""a cliché villain"" and ""underwritten characters"" are asinine and nitpicky. We needed a villain like this. Galactus was the closest we got to an apocalyptic villain but he was raped, mutilated, and morphed into a fart cloud in The Silver Surfer. It's about damn time we get a guy literally called Apocalypse to bring the world down to its knees. The characters are ""underwritten"" only in the sense that they don't spend twenty minutes going through each of their backstories and that's because they didn't have to. The movie captures their unique personalities and quirks within five minutes of them being on screen.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't a perfect movie but it's the epitome of a great summer blockbuster. The visuals are stunning, the chaos is immense, the humor is well placed, the pacing is spot on, the music is great (Metallica and Beethoven anyone?), and the entire film builds up to an explosive climax that delivers everything you'd want in an X-Men movie of this magnitude. If you're a fan of superhero movies, do yourself a favor and take the critic scores with a grain of sand. This is a must-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining for sure,"Once I released myself from my self proclaimed comic book opinions of how First Class ruined the timeline, I was able to thoroughly enjoy Days of Future Past. Seeing Apocalypse as the next hurdle, I was super excited for this movie. I can say I was not disappointed. I enjoyed the story line and there was tons of action. They managed to avoid the trap of comic books movies of late, re-telling of origin stories and they still managed to introduce new characters and allow for further development of others. I look forward to the future as well. I could nitpick but I would rather allow myself to enjoy as much as possible.

Everything they have erected will fall. And on the ruins of their world we will create a better world,"""Days of the Past Future"", in addition to the beautiful name, presented the audience with a high-quality project, where, in my opinion, a global event and a kind of rewriting of the history of this comic universe took place. The thing is not new to the world of comics, but it is still fresh enough for cinema. Although not the first. A few years before that, the Star Trek franchise took up rewriting the canon with the 2009 film. It turned out well. It turned out strongly at the ""Foxes"", which produced a franchise about the X-Men. And now, after a strong blockbuster of 2014, the studio takes a new height for itself with an updated Universe of its heroes, where it presents one of the most powerful villains with the unforgettable name Apocalypse.Bryan Singer, whose ""pen"" belongs to the first two original films about mutants and those ""Days of the Past Future"", sat down in the director's chair again. Corporate identity and excessive pathos have been capturing the viewer since the release of the trailer. The film itself does not lag behind and promises to become a landmark event in the Mutant Universe. Singer is easily recognized. The picture is saturated with bright colors and large-scale scenes, the project focuses on global events and excessive comics, which will definitely appeal to fans of the director's work. On the one hand, it is beautiful, large-scale and bright. On the other hand, this approach clearly pushes the characters and their development into the background. It does not remove it at all (which is only the story of Magneto in this film), but clearly shifts the emphasis towards blockbuster, not drama. And in this pursuit, the attempt to make the project dramatic also causes me, as a spectator, a noticeable dissonance. There is some kind of roll in the project, movement along the sine wave. The film takes turns going through drama, action, comedy, does it in leaps and bounds, which complicates switching from one rhythm to another. Fans, I think, will be satisfied with many of the decisions in the film, and the viewer who is not fond of reading comics can count all of the above as cons.The cast is large. The new project will once again give a new meeting to the audience with their favorite characters and introduce a lot of new ones. There are heroes of the first magnitude here, whose arches will be shown to us. Among them, of course, Charles Xavier and Eric Lansher, doomed to friendship and confrontation among themselves. They are also Professors X and Magneto, played by already beloved actors James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Minor characters will not stay away either. Although it is difficult to call them such with each subsequent part of the franchise. The role of most heroes is important and significant for the general universe. I would like to mention the game of Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Holt, Rose Byrne, Sophie Turner, Evan Peters.The villain of the picture was the Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac. The character is colorful. He had to be opposed to the heroes in such a way that it became immediately clear that this was a universal evil, a rival that would be incredibly difficult to resist. His four horsemen were also supposed to become something odious and deadly. It turned out to be average. On the one hand, the villains are dangerous and large-scale, on the other, they lack charisma, and their actions are complete. And of course, the eternal problem of the hero Fassbender will be touched upon again in this picture (as in the previous ones). Magneto is always standing between good and evil, fighting with himself and his demons, finding himself, but every new film takes up the old one again - digs into his memories and tries to be a villain again. For the third time, such a plot already causes distrust. Everything is the same, only placed in new conditions.The first third or even half of the film is intriguing and sometimes fascinating. The viewer is introduced to heroes and villains, a line of confrontation is built and even there is something similar to intrigue. But by the end, the struggle of some with others even, I remember, seemed to be some kind of protracted, well, moving in a straight line without any surprises and interesting things. That's Singer's world. But it's not bad. Rather, it is just expected.""Apocalypse"" certainly turned out to be a large-scale film. This is a beautiful movie with a lot of action and pathos. Probably, this is a distinctive feature of the paintings of this director. The film is not without problems, but for those who want to see a beautiful blockbuster, it will definitely become an interesting project.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Disappointing Endgame,"*X-Men: Apocalypse* is a visually impressive yet narratively underwhelming entry in the franchise. While the film boasts a talented cast and ambitious scale, it ultimately falls short of its potential.The titular villain, Apocalypse, is a visually striking character but lacks the depth and complexity of previous antagonists. Oscar Isaac delivers a commendable performance, but the character himself is underutilized. The film's focus on establishing a new generation of X-Men comes at the expense of character development for returning favorites.The action sequences are undeniably spectacular, showcasing the full extent of the mutants' powers. However, the film's pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exposition interrupting the momentum. The plot feels rushed, and character motivations are often unclear.Despite its flaws, *X-Men: Apocalypse* offers some memorable moments. The dynamic between Professor X and Magneto continues to be a highlight, and the introduction of younger versions of iconic characters like Cyclops and Jean Grey is promising. However, the film's overall impact is diminished by its reliance on spectacle over substance.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

They are uniting for good....,"Ten years after the Paris peace accords, Professor Charles Xavier has recruited several students at his special school with the aim to establish it as the home for humans and mutants alike as they explore their strengths and grow together in harmony. But deep in the dark ruins of Cairo, an ancient power, En Sabah Nur has been awakened after millennia and has realized that the new unrelatable world needs to be destroyed so he can establish a new order. Deemed to be the very first mutant and the all powerful one, Apocalypse needed his four horsemen to pursue his devastating plans. The students at the Xavier school must now find within them, a way to harness their powers and use them to stop the apocalypse. The students must now become the X-Men.Erik (Michael Fassbender) lives a secluded life with his wife and daughter, concealing his powers while working in a foundry where one day, he is forced to use them to prevent an accident. The incident doesn't go unnoticed by his co-workers who report it to the authorities. An unfortunate encounter drives Erik mad with rage and his resulting vulnerability is soon exploited by Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), who recruits him as his fourth horseman after Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Angel (Ben Hardy) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn). In a powerful display of his newly enhanced powers, Magneto desecrates the site of Auschwitz and threatens to build a new world for Apocalypse. Meanwhile, Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Alex Summers/Havok have been busy recruiting mutants such as Kurt/Nightcrawler and Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan). Also coming to their aid in the nick of time is Quicksilver/Peter Maximoff (Evan Peters), who steals the show each time he makes a run for it. Their sanctuary is compromised as Apocalypse learns about Charles' powers and kidnaps him to aid in his plan for gathering mutants across the globe. In the aftermath of the explosion, Hank, Mystique and Peter are taken captive by the Military, leaving Scott, Kurt and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) in their hot pursuit. The rescue effort was doomed if it wasn't for the accidental release of Weapon X, that unknowingly aided in their escape from the facility.Magneto's control of Earth's poles causes widespread destruction, killing millions as En Sabah Nur almost enslaves Charles to his will. But it's Jean's psychic powers that find the call for help from her Professor and along with the young fighters and new recruits, they race to prevent Magneto and Apocalypse from causing Earth's total annihilation.Cyclops has an engaging introduction to the team and Tye portrays the fear of his uncontrollable powers in a credible manner. Nightcrawler always has a freaked out look but is entertaining while Beast is almost underplayed in his role. Olivia Munn's brief presence has a lot of intrigue still remaining about her origins and powers of being Psylocke. Alexandra plays a young, uncertain Storm who isn't evil enough yet to choose a permanent side. Evan Peters is as witty as he is hasty and Quicksilver is by far a show stealer when on-screen. Oscar Isaac's villain isn't the all-powerful as they hyped him up to be. His God-like powers were seldom on display to be ascertained as the biggest threat to superheroes, let alone break away from the cliché of apocalyptic villains who want to recreate the world. Mystique had the entire world focusing on her eccentricity after being exposed in Paris and Jennifer Lawrence shows her reservations very well. Her performance is deliberately underplayed but she holds her position as Charles' favorite by her own merits. Michael Fassbender displays the torment and inner rage that Magneto experiences with a lot of sincerity, making it an outstanding performance as a villain. His reluctance to join his friend's school is deeply rooted in his suspicion of humans who have caused most of his tragedies. James McAvoy is extremely likable as Prof Xavier because he quite naturally charms his righteousness through to us while showing genuine care for both mutants and humans. Sophie Turner's Jean Grey surprisingly ends up being the highlight of the film and not because of her character's importance in saving the day each time. She has invested in the character that's learning to unleash her powers with a lot of reluctance at first and then realizing her true potential. She is a far better Jean Grey than her predecessor and with Mystique by her side, her development should get a lot more exciting.Director Bryan Singer (several X-Men films) is more than familiar with character introductions, mega villains and optimizing CGI to aid his storytelling and action. Yet, the film does lose the gravity of a major villain who was supposed to be the greatest nemesis of the X-Men. To see him so grossly under-utilized with just a handful of action scenes and a lot more of clichéd dialogues is quite disappointing.Apocalypse may not be the best X-Men film to date but it sure is as fun, exciting and entertaining as the best of them. What it lacks in, it makes up for in the attributes of its characters who are either too righteous or perfectly balanced now to fall on either side.8.513 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

As an avid reader of Marvel during its breakout period fifty years ago, X-Men was a nice magazine but I would guess not one of their top sellers. Back then the talents were a little more modest, Cyclops and X-Girl were around along with Angel, Iceman and Beast (not blue). As a movie franchise I would guess X-Men is Marvel's top seller, they have gotten a lot of mileage out of the characters and have almost flawlessly crossed over to a younger cast (but for Wolverine). I have seen two or three of the most recent entries at the movies, but even though I have enjoyed them they are not something I die to watch again on cable.Which brings us to the most recent X-Men. Right off I have to say that Marvel excels at casting and the newer X-Men are no exception, the new Prof. Xavier (McAvoy) continues to be spectacular as does Fassbender as the Magnetic One. I thought the rest of the characters are done well also, including Peters as Quicksilver and a stunningly gorgeous Munn as Psylocke. The adversary for the X-Men is an ancient Egyptian mutant who seems too much to handle, the problem with these apocalyptic show-downs is that the next time out they sometimes feel they have to top it (ala Avengers I and II). This movie was not something I would necessarily see again (maybe?) but it never let up and me and my 11 year old never thought of leaving early, well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
We finally get to see what the X-Men are really capable of.,"For what it is - entertainment with familiar characters - it definitely delivers. It was refreshing to see the characters use their powers as we've been expecting since the first movie, although the relatively new cast don't have the screen presence to draw us completely in.Fassbender and McAvoy are flawless in their roles, and it makes you question what kind of film this is - an action adventure comic book film, or a gut-wrenching exploration of what one is capably of after they've lost everything.There lacks the cohesion that the first two films had (the third doesn't exist), and kind of jumps between awkward humour and heavy drama. Some reveals and build up fall flat or seem too obvious.But like I said, we get to see our childhood heroes and villains really kick ass and wreck havoc. I had a lot of fun watching it.And I was never really a fan of Quicksilver before, but let's say after this film, I think he's kinda cool.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Good (But Not Great) Chapter in the X-Men Saga,"I've been a fan of the X-Men since I first read the ""Age of Apocalypse"" comics in the mid-90's, and as such I was intrigued by this film. I've of course seen all of the X-Men movies leading up to this point, which put me at an advantage over someone who wanders into this film blind.This is a reasonably good movie. The whole Egyptian element of Apocalypse's background and the setting for much of the film doesn't really work for me (it makes for a strange hybrid between comics and Egyptian mythology, in my view), but the movie is faithful to its source material in this regard. Similarly, the story is a bit convoluted, but that, too, is something that has precedence in the comic books.That said, there's much to like about this movie, from its reasonably good acting and its well done CGI effects, along with a good script overall. This is not a bad movie, by any stretch.However, there is something about this film that is hard to articulate that is simply bothersome. My biggest problem with the X-Men franchise at this stage is that it has become hackneyed. The previous installment, ""Days of Future Past"", reset much of the story's timeline so that a new generation of actors could bring us new stories to the big screen, which is great--the new cast is off to a nice start.And yet, this film feels very much like a direct sequel to ""X-Men: First Class"", a film which is itself five years old this year. And ""Apocalypse"" features so many references to previous films (including a clever self-deprecating dig at ""Last Stand"") that the movie takes on the feel of the latest chapter in a t.v. series more so than a feature length film. That serial nature of this film, and others in the series, is both the franchise's trademark feel and yet also takes away from the individual films as standalone movies.All this said, I'm going to give this movie 7/10 stars. It's well made and fun--a good popcorn movie, as they say. But it's not outstanding. Worth seeing if you're an X-Men fan or a comic book fan in general, but not mandatory viewing for those who are just fans of good movies, period.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men Apocalypse is a movie where an Egyptian god-like mutant seeks and desires world domination.,"I was worried for this movie when it was announced, partially due to the build up of X- Men's previous movie Days of Future Past. Because of DOFP success, expectations were probably building up for its next movie. And because that the original X-Men movie director Bryan Singer was directing it. I had my hopes and my concerns for X- Men: Apocalypse and when the movie came out and as I was watching it, my disappoint grew larger and larger. My first problem with this movie is the pacing. The pacing of this movie was so unusually constructed. The exposition was poorly given, and the backstory of the movie executed poorly (although it is significant enough for audiences to understand). Each scenes also seemed to stretched to unnecessary time lengths. Characters seems to just be popping out of nowhere just for the sake of the plot. The lines of certain characters seem to just be made up as the movie's going along. Almost as if the actors were improvising, trying to come up with lines that fits the plot, when in reality it just strays away from it. Acting was pretty decent, not bad, but not good either. Just a tasteless odor in your mouth, that's just overall...okay. Plot chemicals from previous X Men movies were brought back in such obvious manner that made me go ""Ugh, not this again?"" And frankly, anyone that watched other films could've seen the ending from a mile away. They were only a ""finger-full"" of scenes that were quite enjoyable to watch. For an example: the Quicksilver scene was once again quite spectacular. For those who've seen the kitchen scene in DOFP, think of that times two in this movie. It was really astonishing to see how Quicksilver reacts to a larger environment in that scene whereas in DOFP it was in a closed space. There were some ""heartfelt"" scenes with Magneto in them which contributed to the plot quite well.Final Verdict: A mediocre, mid level 7.4/10This movie isn't the worst X Men movie up to date. Considering other terrible films of X Men such as Wolverine Origins or The Last Stand. But seeing other Marvel fanboys's reviews, I've decided to give a piece of my mind to give a honest review. This movie is not a terrible watch, but if you're not too into superhero movies or at least getting disappointed, don't watch this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
XA (X-men Apocalypse) A supercharged X-men movie,"OKay the critics were over-exaggerating this movie. The movie had everything that makes a superhero movie super. Over the top action, decent story, great characterization, and a menacing villain.This movie gave me the feels I have never felt in any superhero movie before. And some of the scenes were so engaging I was afraid to blink.Now as much as I enjoyed this movie I do strongly believe Days of Future Past was much better because of better execution. XA's major problem lies with the execution of the villains(4horsemen and Apocalypse). These guys were suppose to bring the end of days in the most biblical sense and it fell short of that. The four horsemen were not utilized to to their full potential. Like Storm should have cause worldwide weather phenomenons like hurricanes forming on land, thousands of tornadoes, floods, electric storms. Psylocke could have dropped on cities like a nuke with telekinetic forces, and Archangel should have used his metal feathers to rain death on the population. And Apocalypse could have been the one pulling the strings and picking up the pieces laid waste by his horsemen. The four horsemen do not get much attention to and its just too bad. These guys were to be the ones who drive this movie and I believe if they had been more focused on this movie would have been better than DOFP.The movie didn't reach the potential that its predecessor reached, but its very enjoyable. The high-energy of this movie is nothing like you ever seen in any superhero movie. Mutants let their powers out and its fantastic. Quicksilver!!!!!! Damn!!!!!!!!!!!! Great movie all around. 2HRS 24 mins and it felt short. GO AND WATCH IT!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best superhero films ever made leaves early reviewers clueless,"X-Men: Apocalypse is absolutely amazing! The early reviewers don't seem to understand these characters and they don't understand this film. It sets a new precedent for comic book films in a world over-saturated with adaptations.The film hits every nostalgic and aesthetic beat it's supposed to without devolving into pure fan service. The writing is great. The allegory the mutant plight is for civil rights is given its due screen time. The characterization of the superheroes goes beyond their powers and outfits and at least touches the heart of who they are as people. Its main fault is juggling so many characters and so some of the acting comes off as stilted at times. In a way this is also its strength, because it manages to tell a coherent and compelling narrative with a large ensemble cast of characters, emulating the source material faithfully. It is a comic book fan's film.The action scenes are epic in scope, with stakes so high you'll be on the edge of your seat with you eyes transfixed on the action, yet never does the pacing sacrifice plot or character development for obligatory spectacle. Everything is purposefully sensational.As someone who was born in the 80s and experienced these characters' evolution through popular culture onto the big screen, I can say that X-Men: Apocalypse brings the flavor of the comics and the 90s TV show to the big screen in a way that children of the 80s and 90s love.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"What? No, no no, WHY??","This... This movie is an insult. It is not even bad, it's more than that.

After a few hours i seriously tried to find some good parts in this film, and don't get me wrong, there are good scenes in the movie, but the whole experience is just shocking.

A Great Action Movie from Start to Finish!,"If you enjoy well written, well acted, well directed fun summer action movies, go see XMen Apocalypse. Everything is spot on in this movie from beginning to end. The plot is well conceived and carried out, which is sometimes a problem with action/superhero movies (see Batman v Superman as an example of that.) The Big Baddie in the movie is intriguing, powerful, and scary. He feels real and is well acted by Oscar Isaac of Star Wars: The Force Awakens fame.All of the Xmen we love are back. We get to see origin stories for some we've known for a long time. All of the young actors, led by Jennifer Lawrence reprising her role as Mystique, are excellent. We get to see more of the delightful Quicksilver who was introduced and had one of the best scenes in XMen: Days of Future Past as well as a young Storm and a young Nightcrawler doing their thing. The action scenes with Quicksilver running here and there and Nightcrawler popping in and out of fights are some of the best you will see. Watching the conflicts of Magneto, Storm and the others trying to decide which parts of themselves they will embrace and which side of the fight to stand on brings layers to the movie beyond just the action.This stands with the best of the XMen movies and with the best of superhero movies.

"Not dull, but way too convoluted and busy","The latest in the ever-growing X-Men franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse (2016, **) is generally okay. There are several problems with it that will be noticed by even someone who's just vaguely familiar with the characters. There are too many story lines and too many characters. There are plot holes. The plot is also staggeringly familiar. Continuity with the earlier films is almost nonexistent.It's all about the first (apparently) mutant, En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac). We meet up with him in ancient Egypt as he's somehow transferring his consciousness into a new body, seeing as how his current one's decrepit. Then there's a rebellion, the transference doesn't quite take, and everyone's buried under rock and sand for centuries. Until the present, when an undercover CIA agent (don't ask) wanders to a subterranean lair in Cairo but doesn't cover up the entrance with a carpet, thus allowing the sun to come in and revive En Sabah Nur, who then proceeds to kill people with his mind and recruit mutants.Meanwhile! In eastern Europe, Magneto, I mean Eric Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is living the simple life as a factory worker with a doting wife and a little girl, which certainly means bad things will happen, as they do. (This is set after he tried to kill the president but was stopped by Mystique.) Short story long, Magneto flips the heck out, has a crisis of conscience, kills people, and flees. But not before shouting, ""What do you want from me?"" to the heavens. He's recruited by En Sabah Nur (who, by the way, is the Apocalypse of the title). En Sabah Nur's plan is to destroy Earth and build a new society, in other words the same as countless other villains.And because En Sabah Nur is such a strong mutant, he's able to get into the mind of one Charles Xavier – manipulate him, in fact. Which allows En Sabah Nur to find all the mutants he needs, and which also gives director Bryan Singer a chance to bring out a plethora of X-characters, like Storm, Psylocke, Cyclops, Beast, Angel, Havoc, Mystique (of course), and Jean Grey. Most of these characters were in earlier X-Men movies, but now they're all different ages. I don't mean different just from the other movies, I mean different relative to each other. Like in an earlier movie, two characters might be about the same age, and here they're suddenly a generation or so apart.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't dull, but it's way too convoluted for the franchise. It's almost as if no one thought there'd be any more of these films after this one, so they had to cram everyone in. The result – too many characters; a winding, tortuous plot; story lines with no real resolution; and general incoherence. It's a kitchen sink approach that just never works. Some actors fare well, such as Nicholas Hoult as Beast and Evan Peters as Quicksilver (who, incidentally, has the best scene in the movie, hands down). Some mail it in, like McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique). Some try their best, like Isaac and Fassbender. And some seem ill-equipped and over their heads, like Sophie Turner, who plays the indomitable (but young) Jean Grey. Turner is really wooden.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"ok , but with problems","The biggest problem with the movie is they didn't know what to do with Apocalypse. He is just way to powerful to go out like that and felt more like a tool just to introduce the younger X-men for upcoming movies.Then there is the Raven/ Jennifer Lawrence issue where the Actor playing the character is a bigger deal then the character should be to the plot. Do not get me wrong Raven is a pretty big character in the X-men world but not big enough to have 1/3 of the plot/screen time.The X-men movie franchise is in an odd spot with Hugh Jackman/Wolverine gone and besides Magneto , Professor X , Beast and quicksilver I'm not sure they picked the right actors for such key characters for the rest of the X-Men. Then on top of that Deadpool is doing such a great job and i believe there is room for both Franchises but it's getting to the point where i would rather see X-men characters in Deadpool movies since they seen to handle them betterThis is more of my personal thoughts rather then a review so yea........",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another X-traordinary film added to the franchise!,"I recently watched the latest instalment of the X-Men franchise. I had heard a lot of negative publicity towards the film and to be honest I think that X-Men: Apocalypse is actually a very well made and interesting movie. All of the performances in the film are flawless. However, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's performances are very powerful and bring a great deal to the film. The character Apocalypse (portrayed by Oscar Isaac) is also extremely intriguing and nothing like anything we have seen before.The storyline of the film, although following a lot of individual story lines, is very straight forward and easy to follow without being too clichéd. Singer's direction is on the money. However, he has proved himself multiple times already - so much so that I would expect nothing less.Inspiration from the comics has clearly been interwoven into this film as characters such as Psylocke are seen rocking costumes almost identical to those seen in the comics.The CGI and other special effects seen in the movie are also breath taking and it is clear that now the X-Men films have truly perfected their style. It is easy to see that many people have worked very hard to create such spectacular effects.Overall, I would give this film 8 out of 10 because it is everything a good X-Men film should be: interesting, relatable and impressive. The film even has a cameo from a very familiar friend to the franchise and, although this time he is not a front runner, it is okay because even just a taster is fun to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Excellent Visuals, 3D and lot of destruction","I have been a big fan of the X-Men Series & the Latest in the addition is no different. It's a good follow up after First Class & Days of Future Past & has much more destruction.To be fair I would say I liked the movie because the 3d effects & action sequences were excellent, However the story was weak as compared to the previous 2 movies. It's kind of getting repetitive in a sense that Magneto tries hard in each movie to be nice but situations make him choose to be the antagonist & in the climax some moral sense prevails & he chooses to be nice again.I hope the next movie in the series has a better story line that moves forward.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""X-Men Apocalypse"" is technically masterful and fun to watch, but feels like too much of a good thing.","Call 2016 ""The Year of the Superhero Battles"". After the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel went at each other in ""Batman v. Superman"" and the Avengers divided (then reunited) and conquered in ""Captain America: Civil War"", ""X-Men Apocalypse"" (PG-13, 2:24) features mutants fighting each other. They're fighting over a mutant's mutant named En Sabah Nur. But you can just call him Apocalypse. That name reveals this film's tie-in with another cinematic superhero trend of the 2010s – world domination. After the Avengers prevented a sentient A-I baddie named Ultron from destroying mankind and rebooting the world in 2015, an ancient mutant who is actually named for the end of the world tries to do the same in 2016. Or is it 1983? Heck, these movies' own characters have trouble keeping it all straight – even within the X-Men universe. In a meta reference in 2016's ""Deadpool"", as Colossus drags the title character across a bridge and says, ""You will come talk to Professor Xavier"", Deadpool understandably and hilariously responds, ""McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines can get so confusing.""I'll try to keep from confusing things further with my plot summary, by limiting character references for simplicity's sake. (To read more about who's in this movie, God has given us IMDb and Wikipedia.) In ""X-Men: Apocalypse"", a variety of human beings with special powers continues their magical mystery tour of the planet, as the supremely psychic mentor and do-gooder Professor Xavier (that's James McAvoy in this one, Mr. Pool) tries to bring out the good in all mutants - even the bad ones. Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is trying to live a quiet country life in Poland when something happens that REALLY makes him mad and he's not inclined to be magnanimous towards his enemies. We then meet three other overseas mutants who are morally ambiguous and/or evil to varying degrees. We also see the sometimes-but-not-currently-blue-hued Raven Darkhölme / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) traveling the world and recruiting (for Xavier's academy) young mutants like the teleporting Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee).Meanwhile, back at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters in Westchester, New York, Professor X is working hard to help a growing number of resident mutants. They include the telekinetic Jean Grey / Phoenix (Sophie Turner) and Scott Summers / Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), whose eyes have just started shooting out extremely destructive laser beams. The Professor has help from the also sometimes-but-not-currently-blue-hued Hank McCoy / Beast (Nicholas Hoult), but X becomes distracted by the re-emergence of his memory-impaired old flame, CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), who is in Egypt investigating the legend of an ancient mutant, who's also part of this movie's 50 Shades of Blue.Back in ancient Egypt, about five and a half millennia ago (give or take a century), En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse (an unrecognizable Oscar Isaac) continued his habit of transferring his consciousness into the younger bodies of other mutants, and, in the process, adding their powers to his personal super power arsenal. When some mutant-haters betray him, and even his current generation of four helpers (later called ""The Four Horsemen"") can't save him, he's buried underneath a collapsed pyramid and forced to take a very, very, very long sand nap. As one summary of this movie has said, ""Fast-forward to 1983 (10 years after the mind-bending, time-travelling events in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past')."" Some present-day believers unearth the king of the mutants, utter some chants, and release En Sabah Nur into the modern world. He catches up on everything he has missed (and learns to speak English) by touching a TV set and immediately begins gathering another team of mutant minions. He has decided that mankind has gone astray without his guidance and he plans to wipe out nearly all humans (whether they're evil or not) – and he doesn't even provide any of them with an ark! This harsh latter-day Darwinist will only allow the strongest to survive, destroy everything man has made, and then rebuild.""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is impressive and entertaining, but seems like a little too much of a good thing. Its visual effects, action set pieces and hair-make-up work, taken as a whole, represent the most creative and best executed that I've ever seen in a single movie. At first blush, those sets of accomplishments seemed destined for some serious awards season love (with more than a few wins). However, the film's extraordinary technical achievements are symptomatic of what's wrong with it. Although Movie Fans who are new to the X-Men franchise will be unable to appreciate the layered character development and the references to the previous films, the plot of this film does stand alone and isn't hard to follow. It's fun and awe-inspiring to watch but has too much going on. This movie naturally brings to mind previous X-Men installments, along with movies in which several (or all) of the Avengers appear. If this trend continues, Stan Lee himself (who, of course, has a brief cameo in this Marvel film, with his real-life wife) may have to develop a super power and pick up a shield or something.Come to think of it, I wonder if I'm the only one who would be interested to see Ultron and Apocalypse go up against each other. Of course, they'd both have to still be ""alive"" for that to happen, but the way the X-Men franchise plays fast and loose with timelines, anything is possible. Then there's the possibility that Ultron and Apocalypse, with their different but complementary skill sets and mutual penchant for destruction, could join forces. In that case, all the X-Men AND Avengers joining forces might still be unable to stop that dastardly duo. Even if such a battle were to be fought, the resulting movie (with cameras naturally there to capture every crash-bang-boom) would be even more cluttered than ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" which I'm giving a ""B+"".",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Overstuffed with So Many Things, Tolerable At Best.","There is a searing sense of humanity in X-MEN: APOCALYPSE's effort to thrust Magneto (Michael Fassbender), one of its key characters, into its emotional core. This allows a brief, but commanding moment establish a formidable ground to a film that aspires for enormous accomplishments. Yet these very same ambitions also seem to serve as malignant flaws that inevitably drags this Bryan Singer's desirous experiment into its very own apocalypse. While it stands with its impressive visual execution and incredible size— boasting one of the biggest character ensembles in superhero cinema—'Apocalypse' can only carry out ephemeral glories that can never compensate for the film's utter lack of structure. Ambition turns out to be this film's biggest threat.As compelling as descriptions might have made him appear, titular 'Apocalypse' (Oscar Isaac), doesn't seem capable to inspire the terror he seems to claim. For a villainous figure whose omnipotent power is meant to decimate civilizations, his efforts are mostly spent for futile chases that mostly involve expanding his network of mutants. At some point, the film shifts entirely on laying grounds for an apocalyptic battle that the narrative doesn't seem bothered to get to at a tolerable pace. Along the way, it constructs further story lines which it willingly abandons before any palpable resolution arrives. The film struggles to hold all its weight and extensions together, and yet it keeps introducing elements for which it has no evident plans to efficiently utilize. Much of this film turns out only trying to expand size, but at the expense of having a decent structure. Interesting characters get left underdeveloped, their backstories often written without congruence to the central storyline. And as it may insist, Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Professor X (James McAvoy)'s struggle runs on an emotional spine that mainly involves a campaign to retrieve Fassbender's Magneto from Apocalypse's hold. All these actors come out more powerful than their roles dictate them to be, defying the limits of their extremely poorly-written characters with strong performances that are enough to cover up for their characters' lack of development. A short but incredibly singular performance by Fassbender during the film's early minutes may be the spot where the film's sense of humanity is at its peak. Unfortunately, this distinction is relegated below technical pursuits. The ones with smaller roles are seemingly just too small to be served with affecting storyline, an apparent flaw in which Sophie Turner's Jean Grey fell.For all its narrative faults, a hope for some compensations may not at all strike as a bad idea. Singer, here, tries to build an immersive world where action sequences are filled with whizzing lethal beams and energy collisions. The one he creates inspire awe and paves way for breathtaking moments, but this is already as far it can get.'Apocalypse', in spite of its elaborate designs, doesn't quite get past its mammoth aspirations. It has a lot of stuff going on but the film itself deprives them with space to breathe, and eventually seamlessly integrate with each other in the cosmic expanse that Singer ambitiously tries to construct. So, technical splendor and terrific action setpieces, aside, the only thing that actually makes this film commendable, is the sizable amount of reverence it has paid to the canon, making this Bryan Singer's biggest fan service to date. This movie is tolerable at best.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I admit I have trouble following Magneto's sympathetic storyline; the man's a mass murderer (just saying). But the actor is incredible.My main complaint about this movie is Apocalypse. Played by a great actor, his makeup makes him look like a puppet, the voice effects make him sound like a robot, his lines are cringey, and he is hilariously overpowered. I assume he is from the comics, since he was also in the Evolutions cartoon, but perhaps he just doesn't transfer well to the big screen. Or perhaps he was just poorly represented in this movie.

"Good, but lacking in emotional depth","""Why be different when you can look like everybody else?"" Nightcrawler (the blue-hued teleporter) questions Mystique (the also naturally-blue-hued shapeshifter) in X2, to which she pointedly responds, ""because we shouldn't have to"".In The Last Stand, Storm, at learning that non-mutants have developed a cure that permanently suppresses the Mutant X-gene, cries, ""a cure for all mutants? But we don't need a cure. Since when have we become a disease?""And yet, yet there are others who feel quite differently. Those who will give anything to feel 'normal' and are only too willing to give up that which makes them special. Because as there is no doubt that innate (and often intimidating) extraordinariness renders a mutant as formidable, so too it is certain that it makes one aberrant in the eyes of others, such power-possessors only just about managing to outpace vilification, then rejection, social ostracization and even the threat of extermination.Which path then should the gifted choose for themselves? Should one live as a proud pariah or eternally condemn oneself to a fate of inert impotence? The question itself poses a seething paradox, because even if one were to pick the former things won't grow easy, the risks attendant with pacifism or aggression, the only two approaches available, then springing to life, accentuated further by the one immutable dimension to the mutant conundrum: the inability of humanity to rise above prejudices.It is these emotionally resonant thematic threads that have since its inception set the X-Men series apart from other superhero productions, interwoven as they are through deftly layered and penetrating allegory: the omnipotent thesis being the trials and inner conflicts of social misfits, the discrimination and dilemmas faced by minorities, be they ethnic, sexual, religious or whatever.Should a people assert the right to coexist under the umbrella of a proud and distinct identity or should they always aspire to blend in with the mainstream? Is society hardwired to fear those who look and behave differently? Is it really possible to convince people to think in a manner that runs counter to their primal instincts?Apocalypse is a great spectacle, as are all the X-Men movies without exception. (OK, we can forget about X-Men Origins:Wolverine for the time-being). But let's be honest here. Really honest. It is certainly not the best film of the series, the thus far unsurpassed one being Days of Future Past followed closely by First Class and X2.And this loss is chiefly down to the fact that this latest instalment, save for Magneto's backstory, which in retrospect appears tired and stale, fails to pose any searing questions or to explore the internal thought-processes and predicaments of the characters.Instead we're served just another superhero movie populated with a galaxy of CGI-enhanced mutants, whose motivations despite the actors' tremendous performances (especially from the latest entrants), fall emotionally flat.What's more, whilst the previous two instalments in the series draw on historical events of the time-periods in which they were set (The Cuban Missile Crisis and The Vietnam War), Apocalypse could well have occurred in any time frame. The film is none the richer for being set in the 80s.The plot is straightforward enough. In 1983, the mutant Apocalypse, having amassed the powers of many other mutants over millennia, awakens from a slumber and vows to destroy mankind and take over the world. With the help of his Four Horsemen, Psylocke, Storm, Archangel and a broken Magneto, Apocalypse plans to create a new for mutants- only world order. As the earth convulses in doomsday throes, the X- Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier work together to prevent Apocalypse and his team from succeeding.The performances are as usual all superb and the CGI eye-arresting. But the two performances that stand out are those of Jean Grey, whose perceptivity and latent vigour are brought alive to pitch-perfection by Sophie Turner, and of Quicksilver, played by Evan Peters, whose comic relief is so good that I will re-watch the film for just his scenes. The one disappointment however is Oscar Isaac from whom I had high expectations. It seemed like his talents have been 'overmasked' by CGI, so much so that he appears as generic a villain as any and his actions are the less menacing for it.Nevertheless, the closing battle scene is as grand and edge-of-the- eat nerve-racking as one might expect of an X-Men movie despite the fact that its enjoyment, as that of the film's as a whole, will be somewhat compromised for those not familiar with the events and characters featured in the earlier films.I give X-Men: Apocalypse a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing,"I just watched X-Men: Apocalypse and OMGosh the intro and movie itself is one of the best I've EVER seen! The storyline, acting, directing, every emotion from happy, sad to drama, comedy, suspense, action, all of the above. Superb! The actors and direction was awesome. The storyline was truly divine and suspenseful. Very particular and intriguing. Unfortunately, I haven't heard much from anyone who watched so that tells me it's underrated. I'm a fan of all X-Men movies but this one is my favorite! Definitely a much see movie!***** stars easily 😄. Great job everyone! Looking forward to the next chapter as always.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Uneven but not bad,"Ranking 'X Men: Apocalypse' alongside the other X Men films, it's for me third weakest. Better than 'Last Stand' and 'Origins' (though even they had merits), but not in the same ball park as 'X Men 2', 'First Class' and especially 'Days of Future Past' (also preferred the solid if yet-to-find-its-feet-feel first film) and only just slightly under 'The Wolverine.'There is a lot to like about 'X Men: Apocalypse'. It looks great, being very slickly filmed and photographed, production design being grittily atmospheric yet audacious, smoothly edited and with effective costumes and make-up. The special effects are of extremely good quality too, the much applauded big Quicksilver scene being particularly note worthy, and there is not an overload or underuse of them. John Ottman makes a welcome return to the series and his score is one of the more memorable and fitting (with that for 'Days of Future Past' getting first prize for the most) of the series since 'X Men 2'. The script provokes thought and doesn't make the mistake of rambling, while the action is dynamically choreographed, thrilling and emotionally charged on the whole.For effective scenes, highlights do have to be a suspenseful and very arresting opening sequence and particularly Quicksilver's super speed life-saving scene, which is one of the series' most jaw-dropping. The story starts off really well and is very diverting with anything with Magneto. There are some terrific performances here, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender (whose character writing is the meatiest here) especially apply here and they make keep the story on point and from completely derailing. Sophie Turner shows off Jean Grey's conflicts and flaws very effectively and touchingly, while Evan Peters steals every scene as Quicksilver, Nicholas Hoult continues to be fine as Beast and Hugh Jackman makes a ferociously charismatic cameo.Was mixed on Oscar Isaac (heavily made-up and unrecognisable) and Bryan Singer's direction. Actually Isaac's performance as villain Apocalypse himself is pretty decent and effectively menacing, but it's the clichéd and underwritten way in which Apocalypse is written that prevents Isaac from doing anything that special with the character that stops me from feeling more. People have said that Apocalypse here is more Ivan Ooze-clone than the character of the comic book, and it's easy to see why they would think that, this said Isaac does do a good enough job with what he had. Singer is at home in the style and the action, but when it comes to making the characters and story completely interesting and giving depth to them he isn't quite as confident as he was before, competent and stylistically classy but a bit bland.'X Men: Apocalypse' suffers from being rather too overcrowded, with a fair bit going on and with lots of characters but effectiveness of executions varies wildly. Some good characterisation and great scenes, but a lack of constant dread and urgency and too many characters given short shrift, though nowhere near as badly as in 'Last Stand' and 'Origins'. The pacing is diverting at first but starts to drag once the plot gets more rambling and more bogged down by content. 'X Men: Apocalypse' includes comic relief and romance and they don't come off well, the comic relief is very goofy and at odds tonally with everything else and the romance is completely under-developed.Jennifer Lawrence clearly looks bored too in a complete waste of Mystique, and Olivia Munn is underused and basically just eye-candy in a role that has little depth to her if at all.In conclusion, uneven but still decent. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Perfectly done,"The movie gave everything I expected from it, and more.Action? Check.Drama? Check.Funny moments and scenes? HUGE check.

I could just sit back, watch with clear mind, and enjoy.All in all, just fun to watch. 140 minutes that end with a desire for 140 more.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
New decade. New X-Men.,"'X Men: First Class' (2011) showcased the origins of the heroes and villains we had seen in the original trilogy. It brilliantly encompassed the 1960' backdrop of the power struggle between the world powers. 'Days of the Future Past' (2014), set in the 1970's, completely eradicated the established continuity-allowing Apocalypse to act as a 'soft reboot' of sorts. With Bryan Singer back to the director's chair, this film is a continuation of Days of The Future Past, in which the whole timeline had simultaneously been reset. Now set in the 1980's, the heroes face their biggest threat yet, in the form of an omnipotent and omniscient mutant called Apocalypse. He is the world's first mutant who simultaneously wants to destroy everything this new world stands for.Apocalypse starts by introducing the titular antagonist's origins in Ancient Egypt. Singer captures this mythological world rather epically and composer John Ottoman helps capture this feeling. Obviously, something doesn't go quite right, and Apocalypse is later reborn in 1983, the same year in which Star Wars; Return of the Jedi was released. I love how this film addressed the film as a little reference, but more importantly, one thing that separates the current X-Men films from other superhero films is the setting. Since 'First Class' each film makes the setting feel special, whether it be through the cinematography or props.The film reintroduces heroes such as Cyclops, Jean Gray, Storm, Angel and Nightcrawler but they are younger, less experienced and not a part of the X-Men. I really enjoyed Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers, whose ability to shoot beams of energy through his eyes acts as a burden at first, as he is unable to live a normal life. However, when he is introduced to Professor X's School For Gifted Young Youngsters, he learns that his powers are not a burden but can be used for good. Out of all the youngsters, he and Jean Gray probably had the most character development. Speaking of which, Sophie Turner's Jean Gray leaves something to be desired- I think I just need to see more of her before I judge her portrayal. Although, she does somewhat capture the anger, loneliness that Jean Gray has, because of the extent of her powers. Kodi Smit-McPhee's goofy portrayal of Nightcrawler was reminiscent of Alan Cumming's memorable performance in X Men 2. He was enjoyable and acted as the comic relief, much like Evan Peter's Quicksilver. An overriding theme of the X-Men films is identity with a particular focus on acceptance. This is one aspect of the film that I really enjoyed as Bryan Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg address these themes and generally the franchise has done a good job of tackling these themes- something 'Fantastic Four' (2015), failed miserably at doing.Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse didn't work for me because he just wasn't entertaining or captivating enough. I'm not saying he needs to break out dancing in between a fight or crack numerous jokes at the expense of the heroes, but there's something about a villain who is arguably less one dimensional. He was clearly powerful, threatening and his motives were clear as glass, but they weren't necessarily interesting. It's the sort of motive we've seen before and that's why I didn't enjoy the character.Michael Fassbender's performance is also something that stood out, particularly in the first quarter of the film as we see him trying to adjust to life as a father and husband, whilst also hiding his powers and identity from those he has met in this newly formed life. There is one scene in the forest that was fantastic and much like X Men: First Class, Fassbender gets to show off his acting prowess. The film does feature numerous characters in this ensemble and this review would go on for too long to talk about each performance, so the ones mentioned are the ones I particularly felt were worth talking about.My biggest gripe with apocalypse is the 'end-of-the-world' narrative. I think the X-Men films work better when the story is more close to the heart. To elaborate, narratives revolving around the theme of identity that highlight the divide and difficulties between a world with humans and mutants living side by side have previously allowed the X-Men franchise to stand out. That said, Apocalypse's narrative acts as a tool for conventionally forming a team, the X-Men. In this regard the narrative works, but it doesn't make the film stand out or seem unique.Apocalypse is an enjoyable film through its setting, some particular set pieces (including a particular fan favourite cameo and Evan Peter's Quicksilver) and some truly great performances fronted by Fassbender, Tye Sheridan and James McAvoy. It's problems lie in the fact that it tries to up the ante and scale, whilst world building and introducing new and old characters, meaning that in my opinion it lacks the heart of some of the other X-Men films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Should have been so easy to nail it.,"My thought process....
If you had stuck by the comics this should have been a block buster, however Apocalypse is nothing like the apocalypse of the comics and therefore sucked !!!
Also Jennifer Lawrence does not suit Mystique and her terrible acting playing a role she dislikes......
The most disappointing part for me is Jean Grey, played by an annoying actor from Game of Thrones and no i chose not to know her name, seriously they could not find a single actress to play Jean Grey that would actually look like the Jean of the comics.... 
Another character ruined and we all know how the next one will end up too.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie...but not according your girlfriend,"No spoilers.For a good or a bad - it is the (more or less) the typical X-men/Superhero/Super power movie. I'm not some sort of a mega fan or anything but I do enjoy all X-men movies. If not for anything, at least watch 'cause that's the last time that Hugh Jackman will play Wolverine. VERY sad fact for me!The movie has a lot to offer but still nothing that original (more or less). In saying that - it's very colourful and the actors are First class! Im kinda sick of Game Of Thrones actors to be in every new movie in 2016 but I guess it is, what it is.Anyhow, long story - it's a great movie to watch it in the cinema - don't wait to come out on blu-ray or anything like this.

"Not a bad movie, overly long, some strong acting.","Simple plot, lots of special effects, predictable outcome. This is the formula that drives Hollywood movies today, and this movie is no exception. The movie contains strong acting, but that is totally upstaged by the immense use of special effects which gives the movie a cartoon-like character. As this movie is based on comic book characters, that should not be surprising. The premise of the story is a shaky one - humans divided into two subspecies, one mutant and the others normal. The cause of this division is not explained. For the story to be engaging, this division has to be accepted without question. Otherwise the entire story is meaningless and contrived. The movie offers two and a half hours of almost nonstop special effects. There is some character development which adds some substance to the plot, and makes the movie more watchable. But about two-thirds of the way into the movie, the story becomes rather tedious as it moves to its inevitable outcome. The problem with comic book characters is exactly that - they are comic book characters, and frankly, how emotionally invested can anyone really become in characters that by their very nature are pure fantasy?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I will never see another Singer X-Men movie.,"For all of those writing in anything above 8 stars, I question your sanity. This movie is only a hairs breath above X-Men 3 in the entire pantheon. This movie is just bad. If you know the original source material, this movie will just kill you. A wise man once said, if you've got 4 screenwriters, you've got no good screenwriters. I've lived by that mantra, and this doesn't fail it. The writers take one of the most iconic mutant villains, second only to Magneto, and reduce him to vague and ominous (insert bad guy here) style of antagonist. Only a mixed up, ethos of the original character remains. They also take the villains original abilities and just give him any power they want. To play off this God persona of the character. It seemed like the only thing was written towards was another movie to introduce whatever cast they want to try and sign for the next 2 movies. There is one they wrote into their very own movie. ""Everyone knows the third movie is the worst."" Of course, a tongue in cheek reference to X3 (one of the worst movies I've ever seen). However, since X-Men first class, what do you know...it's the 3rd movie to try and reset the whole universe. Well, played Singer, but not well enough.

Witness the Apocalypse...,"Normally I am not overly keen on superhero movies, but still do get around to watch them in order to have seen them and also to be entertained for whatever worth they should have. However, I will say that the 2016 ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" was somewhat of a surprise to me; a surprise in a good way.The story told in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" was captivating from the very beginning and it kept being interesting right up to the end of the movie. So the entertainment value in this movie was quite good. However, how true it is to the X-Men comic book universe, I have no idea.This is a movie with a good story, but it is helped along immensely by a myriad of spectacular effects. The effects in this movie was off the charts, and in my opinion it really bore the movie a long distance.The acting in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" was good, and it is nice to see actors and actresses who portrayed characters in previous movies make a return to portray them once again. In my opinion, then the most memorable performance in this movie was done by Michael Fassbender (playing Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto) and Oscar Isaac (playing En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse).I am hoping to see more of Psylocke in future movies, as I do remember that she was my favorite character when I was reading the comic books as a young kid. And having Olivia Munn to portray Psylock in the movie was a good thing, because she really fit the role quite well and did a great job. Just a shame that she didn't have more time on the screen.I don't really care much about superhero abilities and such, but for as long as the movie is entertaining, I will endure and watch it. And I was more than genuinely entertained by ""X-Men: Apocalypse"". I will actually go as far as saying that it is the best of the X-Men movies to date.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Everyone's invited to the ""Apocalypse,"" a clunkier but still enjoyable ""X-Men"" film","After ""Days of Future Past"" bridged together the two generations of big screen X-Men into an epic time-travel blockbuster, it didn't leave a whole lot of ceiling for future ""X- Men"" movies. Nevertheless, 20th Century Fox, director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg were quick to deliver ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" bringing the X-Men's biggest villain to life.""Apocalypse"" takes place in the early '80s in the (cleverly) revised ""X-Men"" timeline. All is rather quiet on the mutant-human front: Professor X (James McAvoy) has the school up and running, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) isn't getting into too much trouble and even Erik leads a peaceful new life in Poland. But when the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur a.k.a. Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is awakened from basically a really long nap, it has a seismic impact that sends the X-Men and humanity on a crash course for annihilation.A host of familiar characters return in the form of fresh young faces as the new ""X-Men"" universe inches closer to the first version. This includes Jean Gray (Sophie Turner), Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) for the good guys and Angel (Ben Hardy), Psylocke (Oliva Munn) and even Storm (Alexandra Shipp) as mutants recruited by Apocalypse to serve as his ""horsemen,"" of which Magneto somewhat reluctantly becomes the fourth.Although ""Days of Future Past"" was pretty crowded with characters too, the story kept things compartmentalized and manageable, not to mention most of them had already been introduced in previous films. ""Apocalypse,"" however, must balance them all within one story, and it requires lots of little scenes that jump around from character to character. Kinberg does a better job at this than he did back when he wrote ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" a movie he takes a not-so-subtle jab at in one random but funny scene, but the story becomes similarly unhinged.As an all-powerful villain bent on wiping the earth clean of non-mutants, Apocalypse has the potential to be both really intimidating and cause a number of plausibility issues. Both side of that coin come into play in ""Apocalypse,"" but neither side is particularly nuanced, so the intellectual component that the ""X-Men"" franchise has done very well at times practically no-shows here. Some emotion weaves its way into the movie to varying degrees of effectiveness, particularly in individual character side stories, but physicality, visual effects and spectacle end up at the forefront of the viewing experience.The script does a good job showcasing the many characters and their talents and figuring out how to close as many holes in logic as possible (i.e. ""if that characters does 'X' couldn't that other character use their powers to do 'Y'?"") and Singer makes those clashes compelling. He's always had a good vision for this franchise and keeps ""Apocalypse"" focused and engaging enough, even when the top has been blown off and the frame becomes 99 percent CGI in the final act.Most importantly, Singer always makes sure the characters don't get lost in the chaos, which makes ""Apocalypse"" definitively better than ""The Last Stand,"" even if it is probably Singer's poorest job of sticking to his mantra. In a series that's had a lot of high points, it's not hard for ""Apocalypse"" to default into one of the lesser ""X-Men,"" but it's completely watchable and satisfying.The future of ""X-Men"" on the silver screen is a bit hazy given contracts for its big stars, but ""Apocalypse,"" in all its mayhem, restores the equilibrium that offset by ""Days of Future Past"" and the ripple effect it had on the main characters. It was a good ripple, but future installments should be able to stand a bit more on their own from now on and that's a good sign.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Good and interesting all the way through,"X -Men: Apocalypse is a superhero film and the ninth installment on the X-Men film series. It is directed by Brian Singer with a screenplay by Simon Kinberg. It stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn and Lucas Till. In Apocalypse, the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur awakens in 1983 and plans to wipe out modern civilization and take over the world, leading the X-Men to try to stop him and defeat his team of renegade mutants. I personally loved this movie from beginning to the end. I started to get emotionally invested from the Magneto scene in the woods, and from then on it was just a thrill ride. The acting is absolutely great from everyone, starting with the always amazing Michael Fassbender, who is exceptional on the role as always. The newcomers all do a really good job with the stand out, Sophie Turner who definitely does not disappoint in the iconic role. Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac who is taking over the world by storm (in this movie quiet literally), looks really good on screen, and the acting by Oscar is fine and serviceable. What irritated me the most were the special effects, which certainly could and should have been better. Even First Class had better effects than Apocalypse, I mean it's not all bad, there are scene that are great to look at but sometimes it just lost me on all the obvious green screen. The music is undeniably good though, the main theme is great and memorable. It does also feel a bit too long, especially with all the leading up scenes, but overall this is a really well made and absolutely fun entry in the X-Men franchise. The new trilogy, First Class, Days of Future Past and Apocalypse, is most certainly one of the best superhero trilogies there are.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Late review; still liking it upon re-watching it.,"I only saw this once when it came out and gave it a 7/10 but never wrote a review so I'm fixing this. I will stick to the 7 as I think it is still a great continuation of the then-reboot of the X-Men franchise. It is however not as good as the previous one, which at the time of this review is still the best X-Men movie to date in my opinion. In essence, it is on par with the fist one (First Class) and if you liked one you will like the other. There are also plenty of references for the comic books fans (like me) and overall that is a pretty enjoyable superhero flick, even if by now even the superfans like me are feeling the superhero genre fatigue.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great time-killer.,"Even though it's much worse than ""Days of Future Past"" it was still a good movie. There were some themes that actually kept me interested. The Magneto story line was absolutely gorgeous. The action was violent and well performed. But all of this doesn't make it perfect. It was filled with idiotic one liners and there was a point in the movie where the CGI landscape looked like an ""Overwatch"" map. Apocalypse didn't actually spread his wings and his sidekicks were TERRIBLE! I was very hyped for Olivia Munn as Psylocke, but she had 3-4 lines in the whole movie! She and the Angel guy had no contribution to the plot and Storm was nearly as useless as them too. It was filled with plot holes and questions that cannot be answered with the sentence: ""It's the power of the mutants"" or something like this. But at the end of the day, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is an awesome and fun movie, which actually tries to expand into some deep themes which can make the audience think after the movie has ended.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""X-Men: Apocalypse""-  A disjointed but highly entertaining continuation of the long-running franchise.","As a proud geek, I must give director Bryan Singer the utmost respect for his contributions to the world of comic to film adaptations. One of the earliest filmmakers to give comic-books the respect they deserve on the big screen, his 2000 release ""X-Men"" was one of the pioneering films of the recent surge of superhero movies that have been dominating cinemas for years now. And though the series has gone through the highest of highs and lowest of lows, I am proud to have stuck by it. Now, Singer is back again for his fourth directorial effort in the franchise, ""X-Men: Apocalypse""- a film that continues the story-arc first began in 2011's wonderful ""X-Men: First Class."" And while it may not quite live up to the promise of the best in the series, I personally found ""Apocalypse"" to be a charming and highly entertaining new chapter in the long- running series... even if it suffers a problematic script.When an ancient and deadly mutant called En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac) is wakened from a slumber thousands of years after being imprisoned, he seeks to unite ""four horsemen"" to cleanse a world he views as corrupt and wishes to rule as a godly figure. Assembling a team including the tragic but villainous Magneto (Michael Fassbender), En Sabah Nur's actions force the X-Men, lead by Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) to emerge once again to protect the world from this terrifying new threat. And their battle will bring them face to face with various figures from their past that they will need to contend with in order to save humanity.As is the case with the franchise at large, the film is an ensemble piece, and much of its success lies in the wonderful casting and the performances. Returning cast members continue to play their roles to perfection, and it was a nice surprise to see some familiar faces return who haven't been around in some time. McAvoy and Fassbender in particular continue their wonderful turns as our two friend-turned-enemy leads, and a returning Evan Peters once again steals the show as the super-fast Quicksilver. It was also a pleasure having Rose Byrne back as CIA agent Moira McTaggert following a multi-film absence in the series. She gets a lot of really nice scenes with Xavier and it reminds us how important she was to the story.New cast members are a blast, and inject new life into the film. Isaac makes for a wonderful new villain with a great sense of threat. Tye Sheridan and Sophie Turner also put in admirable roles as the new Cyclops and Jean Grey. While they aren't given much time together, they both do a fine job with the material, and you can see the seeds planted for what will eventually bloom into the full fledged relationship we saw in the original film. And I adored Alexandra Shipp as our new Storm. She probably gets the clearest arc out of all the new characters, and it came appreciated as Storm has been generally under-developed in the franchise. Honestly, the only cast member new or returning that I feel didn't do an outstanding job was Jennifer Laurence as Mystique. And I do think its because the writers are now afraid to do anything too challenging with her given her fame. As a result, she just seems a bit flat here.Singer's continued allegiance to the series also helps and is a massive benefit in this entry. His keen sense of scope and composition, along with his nice personal touches help craft the film into a solid continuation with many an awe-inspiring action set-piece and humorous character-gag. He maintains a much-appreciated sense of tonal continuity in his entries of the series, and you get the sense he is carefully trying to craft this entry to be sort-of the be-all, end- all of the entire series. And this thankfully makes up for the biggest issue here, which is the script, written by Simon Kinberg from a story he also co-wrote.The films have to this point been able to (mostly) maintain a very delicate balancing act. This is an inherent problem in any film with such a wide variety of characters and story lines playing out, and this is one of the entries in the saga where this balancing act doesn't quite work. Try as he might, Kinberg just can't juggle the various elements at play, and the film comes off as jumbled and disjointed as a result. Key pieces of character development are hastily tossed aside as soon as they are completed and major character arcs are resolved in occasionally unsatisfactory manner, causing an emotional rift to the audience. There's also the occasional odd scene here and there that feels questionable and illogical in terms of timing and placement, as though even on set, rewrites were being performed in an attempt to try and fix issues with the pacing and structure. While by no means terribly written and sporting a solid foundation, it also feels as though the film went into production before the writing had been nailed to perfection.Still, this issue is something I can overlook, in no small part thanks to the infectious charm of the bulk of the cast and for the wonderfully intense visual direction that Singer so excels at. Questionable writing is not a death sentence... sometimes a film can overcome script- related hazards if the other elements excel beyond these issues, and I think that's the case here. Many have been condemning the film for it's quick pacing and issues with character development, but to me, it wasn't a deal-breaker. Should they film have spent a bit more time in pre-production? Yeah, sure. But is it an inherently bad film because of some issues with the writing? No. Weaker than other films in the series, perhaps. But still enjoyable and entertaining despite its flaws.I give it a very solid 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
sweet dreams are not made of this,"X-Men: Apocalypse, where we get the X-Men another full ten years later (also still have barely aged a day since First Class, but whatever, movie), and now the stakes are GLOBAL! It's time for a blue-skinned Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie villain steps up to bat to take over everything to ""cleanse"" humanity, and take on his four horsemen/women for this apocalypse while the X-Men sort of race to stop him (I say sort of since they get captured at one point).This movie is... a movie, that exists. It's the textbook definition of an ""eh"" experience. I didn't hate it, there's actors in it still trying and working their butts off to dig deep into characters they've been in for three movies now (McAvoy and Fassbender come off best, Lawrence is sometimes in it and sometimes not), and there's new people (Sophie Turner for one) who are trying as well. But what they're given is... minuscule, too little, and too undercooked. This is the kind of movie that features both Beethoven's 7th symphony/2nd movement and it made me think of the Nic Cage flick Knowing and how *that* used the song better (which wasn't much at all), and then uses at another point Metallica's ""Four Horsemen"" because, hey, title!These may sound like small points, but they're what I latched on to while watching this. It's a plot that is both stupid and rehashed not only from other X-Men movies but from other movies in general. The End of the World OMG scenario doesn't cut it anymore (not that Fox will stop if Independence Day 2 is any indication, but I digress). And unlike the previous two films which were rich in character and motivation and using the period they're set in - 62 and 73, the height of Cuba and Nixon - there's not much here to distinguish it from the 80's aside from the obvious Thriller jacket and Star Wars reference (which is so out of place I'd wish that Kevin Smith could come and smack Singer across the face).Here's my analogy for X-Men: Apocalypse: if you're the kind of person who likes to go to Burger King, and you haven't had a Whopper in a little while and you go to the local Burger King and get a Whopper that's been sitting around for half an hour - so it's not inedible for it's not cooked fresh - and you eat it and go ""Well, it's a Whopper,"" and don't ask them to cook you a fresh one and take what you've received and don't ask for anything else... well, you might be fine with this movie. But it's the textbook definition of a movie with a ton of great actors without a good story.Also, if you happen to love Oscar Isaac as he's one of the most magnetic personalities in American film right now... this is a stunning low for him as a character to play. He has NOTHING here, compared to this Poe Dameron in Star Wars is Michael Corleone as far as complexity goes.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good...,"Bryan Singer and 20th Century Fox have announced the release of X-Men: Apocalypse for 2016! There's been no word on whether the film will focus on the original X-Men team or First Class, but since Hugh Jackman will be involved with the upcoming Wolverine solo film, it's likely he won't be in the cast of Fox's newest production.Just having my favorite X-men, Jubilee (our eternal Lara Jean) is already very pleasant, my number one, Vampira, was missing, yet another good sequel to the franchise, perhaps a little less dramatic than the previous ones, which does not create so much involvement as the others... I didn't like the change in the characters of Magneto's family, divergent from the comics... And several other changes from the comics, fans must be furious, revolt, but still in love with the franchise...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"not like what i expected , but still good","I don't get all the hate towards this movie. X-Men Apocalypse went really really slow , I admit that. And almost half first of the movie there barely something happened. But it's kinda necessary to built a background story to the character,which it should take a little longer because 45 minutes is not enough and make it kinda ""rush it"" because the story happened 10 years after the previous movie and I must tell you it's not really boring at all. There are some few ""funny"" scenes in this movie , although some of it maybe will make you cringe. I guess Bryan Singer kinda playing it safe because of what happened to all the hate towards BvS movie for being too ""serious"" and ""without"" humor. I guess these times you can't really make super hero movie without a funny scene.The visual effects is superb , as usual. The fighting scenes is also cool. Probably the down low about this movie is that it has a really interesting plot with something different in it which kinda cool but there's a few minor clichés and some irrelevant secene. It's really worth the watch , especially because it's visually cool and it's kinda different than any other superhero movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bloated with characters but still a blast!,"This movie was also surprisingly funny at times! Nightcrawler and Quicksilver were the comedy relief.

Progressively Harder To Pose a Credible Threat to Superheroes,"Stop me if you've heard this one before. A single humanoid with immense powers wants to wreak global death and destruction just because he can. No, that was Avengers: Age of Ultron.*beep*2 evenly matched groups of nominal heroes with a wide variety of super-human powers duke it out over some arcane movie-mcguffin dispute. No, that was Captain America: Civil War.*beep*Regular human beings stand by helplessly as their buildings are toppled, cities exploded, and fellow citizens slautered by the tens of thousands during a pissing match between 2 supposed good guys. No, that was Batman v. Superman.*beep*We know from long experience that superheroes always defeat supervillains, so where's the fun in that? It's finally reached the point of detachment wherein the only credible danger that a superhero can face is another superhero — or possibly a god.*So it is here. The god in question started off in Egypt 5600 years ago as a regular mutant (named En Sabah Nur {not that anyone cares}, portrayed by Oscar Isaac, better known as Poe Dameron from the recent Star Wars movie), but his particular power was the ability to transfer himself into the bodies of others, including other mutants. Every time he did so, he added their abilities to his own and eventually came to dominate the civilization of the Nile. But in his arrogance he was viewed by the common people as a false god, and a conspiracy among his own palace guard resulted in his being buried under a collapsed pyramid during a period of vulnerability as he was again changing bodies.Fast forward to the Reagan Era, when a CIA agent accidentally opens the ancient crypt, and empowering sunlight falls on the arcane runes which will reanimate the dormant deity. He spends some time strolling around Cairo, taking in the sights of the modern era, before recruiting 4 mutants to be his henchoids, the 4 ""horsemen"" to his Apocalypse. One of them is the grieving and misanthropic Magneto / Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender, who will grow up to be Ian McKellen). Another is weathermeister Storm (Alexandra Shipp, who will eventually become Halle Berry). And there's Angel (Ben Hardy) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn, who will grow up to be Mrs. Aaron Rodgers). His come-on to all of them is that he can enhance their nascent powers into something truly formidable.Standing in the way of his plan of world destruction / domination are the students at the School for Gifted Youngsters run by Prof. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy, wwgu2B Patrick Stewart). And it turns out that Prof. X himself has the one superpower that Apocalypse covets most of all: the ability to reach into the mind of every human on Earth.Truly gargantuan quantities of wanton destruction ensue.** These are well done, as the various FX subcontractors dominate the film. There's some pro-forma dialog, but hardly anybody gets a chance to truly act.Much of this film makes sense only if you've seen the previous ones in the X-Men series. Which I have. And I'm a comic-book fan. So I still liked it. YMMV.––––––*Altho see the wry observation: ""Captain America met 2 gods face to face; still a Christian. Iron Man met 2 gods face to face; still an atheist. The Hulk met 2 gods face to face; kicked the snot out of both of them."" (except he didn't say ""snot"")**Why can't we ever have superheroes whose skill sets involve building things? Instead, the new kid in school is Scott Summers, whose only ability is to blast the living crap out of everything he aims his laser-beam eyes at.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
SO much better than its given credit for!,"This is easily my favorite X-Men film since X2, and I was not expecting it to be. With all the negative press I'm not sure what movie most people were watching. There are some flaws but it achieves something historic in the franchise history: it gets the characters right! The film benefits from the absence of Wolverine as the main character and finally does justice to Cyclops and most importantly Jean Grey.This is the hardcore X-Men fanboy coming out in me, but Jean Grey has always been the most interesting of any character in the comics for me. Sophie Turner does a great job as a young Jean Grey afraid of her powers but learning to unleash them. It nearly makes up for the atrocity that was X3.Xavier, Magneto, Quicksilver, Beast and Mystique all shine. Jennifer Lawrence is the best she's ever been in these films and I've been dubious of her from the start. She really stepped up in this one.This film's Nightcrawler is good--not as good as X2's, but it's still great to see him. We are introduced to the new Storm, Psylocke, & Archangel, and while they could have used some extra depth they were great and I hope to see more of them going forward.Now... Apocalypse. He was fine. I think if some of his powers that were shown in the trailer had been left as a surprise for the movie he'd have had a bigger impact. He was still a great villain though, and the whole mythology around him was very cool.All in all, I went into this expecting to be disappointed and was pleasantly surprised from start to finish. If you're a fan of the series --or just the POTENTIAL of the series-- watch this. I bet you'll love it. I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It is far more enjoyable than the previous one because it doesn't try to be serious and sophisticated,"""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is seen as a disappointment by almost many fans after ""The Days of Future Past"", but I think ""Apocalypse is a better film on many counts. ""TDOFP"" didn't have comics tone, the movie took itself too seriously, the story was basic, but it tried to be sophisticated etc. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is a fun ride, but also it has also an intelligent story. The opening scene and the villain En Sabah Nur reminds me ""The Mummy"" and it was entertaining! Yes, Raven played by Lawrence has no big function in the story, she is just there, but I've started to like her character, even if I know the fact that nobody can surpass Rebecca Romijn. The parts which we visit each character with them are very interesting and enjoyable. Magneto's past being revealed was creepy and sad and masterfully done! It shows the dawn of evil inside him. ""Two new students (Jean Grey and Cyclops) in a boarding school meet and slowly fall in love"" is a cliché story tool, but that's OK. The so called platonic love of Xavier was hilarious! Angel is darker and more intense here. We witness some very important moments in X-Men history, seeing what happens to the characters we know for a very long time etc. I need to confess that I was disappointed by Quicksilver here, because his new famous scene here is a rehash of ""The Days of Future Past"" unfortunately and that one was better for sure. This one was just funny, maybe hilarious, but definitely not jaw dropping like the previous one. The relationship between Charles and Magneto is gripping and impressive here like Shakespeare plays. Wolverine scene was perfect and the most brutal Wolverine scene in any Wolverine film so far! The climactic final part is an action packed. It could have been better, but with perfect CGI, little emotion and some team work, it just delivers and the mind games were very exciting! ""Apocalypse"" is a more entertaining and more colorful film than its predecessor. It has the perfect tone for a X-Men film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great Summer Movie,I think this is an enjoyable cinematic film and as with other X Men movies the special effects are so well done. The actors save this film from being a flop because the story line is not that great. It kind of plods along there are one or two great surprising moments but it just never really goes that deep but the acting and special effects and if you love the X Men story like I do make this fun summer movie fare. I grade it enjoyable but needs some plot reworking to be great. I love Jennifer Lawrence in this movie wow is she great. I see a lot of potential with the younger actors and their story lines as well and I can't wait until the next X Men comes out.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie has aged like fine wine,"I believe that the first time I saw this movie, my expectations were so high because we had just gotten back into some good movies with this franchise. To have days of future past be so amazing and then this movie to act as it sequel, it makes more sense to watch them back to back without the three years in between. There was so much storyline to unpack, this is definitely the longest X-Men movie of them all, but they covered so much story and such a little time that I had to rewind a lot of the scenes just because I'd look away for 1 second and a major plot point would happen. The antagonist En Sabbah Nur It's honestly the most terrifying villain because not only can he destroy the earth, he has before. The entire time I was entertained but I also kept wondering why at night crawler was so crucial to the X-Men when he was obviously their newest member at that point. But I absolutely loved the story and I think that the writers and producers gave so much for the editors to work with. I think it kind of falls flat on the editing, I wish that the beats were a little tighter. But the acting was spot on and the humanity in this movie is so well represented.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mediocre,"This movie was a disappointment.I was so excited for this movie. The first trailer gave me chills. I was ready. I was prepared. I was lubricated. And you know what? This movie didn't go down smooth. It was long, rough, overstuffed, and worst of all, boring.You've seen the trailer. You know that Apocalypse wants to destroy the world. Why? Who knows at this point. There's ""false Gods"" and ""idols"" so he'll destroy the Earth ""and from the ashes, build a better one!"" But where's the real motivation? We've seen the ""bad guy wants to destroy the world and make a better one"" millions of times before, and seeing it once again was not exciting in the slightest. And Apocalypse wasn't even menacing either. What were his powers? Giving motivational speeches? Seriously, all Apocalypse does is talk and talk and say the exact same things over and over. However, he did have one AWESOME line that had to do with the Tower of Babel, but other than that nothing about his character was memorable or menacing.And what about the four horsemen? They hardly did a thing. Storm? Did nothing. Angel? Nothing. Psylocke? Nothing. They were recruited, and then dropped until the climatic battle scene at the end of the film. They weren't intimidating at all. Now, the film did a good job of setting them up (except for Psylocke in my opinion, she literally had almost nothing to do at all) but once they were recruited, I don't think they said a word ever again. They just stood there, fought a bit, and that was that.Now let's talk about Jennifer Lawrence. Please, for the love of God, get another actress. It looked like she wasn't even trying in the role. She looked so incredibly bored, so incredibly dull, that it looks like she was reading her lines directly off of the script. Everyone else at least looked like they were trying, and then Ms. Lawrence comes on screen and all enthusiasm is immediately gone. And I don't hate Jennifer Lawrence. I liked her in First Class a lot, but now it just looks like she doesn't even want to be in these movies anymore.There were some good things in this film. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely fantastic in every scene they were in. Fassbender especially had a fantastic scene in the woods, and he was about to have a fantastic scene in his place of employment (you'll know it when you see it) that was instead ruined by Apocalypse intruding and ruining the momentum. I do want to say though, that the amount of tragedy that Magneto is now suffering in this series is ridiculous. They need to stop making this character suffer over and over just for the sake of him becoming a villain; at this point it's ludicrous. McAvoy is of course great (I haven't seen him play a bad role yet) and I really hope he continues to play this role well into the future.Quicksilver returns, and his scene was just as thrilling as it was in DoFP, if a bit longer and a tad drawn out. I liked Sophie Turner as Jean Grey a lot, even if her accent was a bit spotty at times. She really did seem to be bringing her all to the role, and I look forward to watching her in future installments. I also liked how gruesome this movie was for a PG-13 film. There were some bloody, gory parts in here that literally had my jaw hit the floor, as I didn't expect to see some of the things I saw in a PG-13 superhero movie. Also, there is a sequence, that I will not spoil, that includes some very violent and very raw action, that unfortunately takes place in a section of the movie that honestly could've been cut out. The sequence, however, is great.Overall, this movie was a big disappointment, and I'm sorry to say that. I honestly thought the movie was going to be great, as I absolutely adored the first trailer, but unfortunately it is not. You can't relate or understand where the villains are coming from (except for Magneto), so it's hard for the audience to be invested in them or to care about the stakes. The amount of destruction in this film is almost pornographic, yet there is no impact as all of the carnage is seen from a distance, and not from street level, so the audience feels disconnected to everything that is happening on screen, and in a film that desperately wants its audience to fear its villains and root for its heroes, this is unforgivable, as instead being of thrilled and invested, the audience is bored and detached.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's goooood!,"Have been reading quite some reviews before deciding to write my own. My opinion? I think that this one was probably one of the best X-Men movies of all time. I mean, if you take out the first one that I watched when I was half my age now and I was amazed by it, I think the others are pretty much below this one.I read comments about the CGI, the costumes, etc. I am all for it. I also agree that the X-Men franchise has been struggling a lot with costumes and effects, more than someone would expect. I mean, we have seen nice CGI elsewhere that also looked as realistic as they can get (Deadpool for one). I can't understand why they can't make Psylocke look real when she is running on that rooftop in the final battle. This was disappointing as hell. And of course, it seems like Mystique was better off with CGI and not with this weird costume that looks like it came out of a cheap rental for Halloween.Other than that, the movie had the funny element, albeit not that much as avengers or deadpool of course, but it was nicely made. I completely digged the story about the first mutant and I liked it a lot (would be amazing to have this in ancient Greece, no?). The cast was good in their roles, although I would like to see someone else as Jean Grey. Sophie Turner did a great job but I think her looks just wasn't enough for me. I think that the previous Jean Grey cannot be surpassed.The scenario was really good also but I felt at times that the movie was too much spread out all over the place. Maybe keeping things more tight would be better for the movie. Overall, it had so much material that the easiest thing to do is to find loose ends. But that's beyond the point of such movies. For example, I also didn't like the fact that they magically build the house back and I don't think that their powers allow them to do such things, but anyways, I won't sit down and nag about the plausibility of such thing in a superhero movie!Looking at the movie afterwards, you can say lots of things and really go into details and miss the essence. My feeling while seeing it was that this is 8.5/10. I can't give halves, so I bump it down to 8 cause 9 seems too much. Apart from one or two scenes, I was truly immersed and I enjoyed every part. And of course, the nice connection in the end with the next movie was worth waiting for. This was a nicely done movie and it would be rated even higher if it wasn't so closely released with Deadpool or Civil War.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Apocalypse rises,"Marvel continues its relentless production of superhero movies with Apocalypse, the latest episode in the X-Men saga. The eponymous villain, Apocalypse, the world's first mutant, rises from centuries of slumber and to say he's unhappy with the state of the world is an understatement. As you would with a name of Apocalypse, he decides the only way forward is to wipe out humanity and start again.This is the third in the X-Men prequel series and reunites the excellent McAvoy, Fassbender and clan. There are a number of additions to the roster this time, most noticeably Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner cast as a young Jean Grey. This is a great piece of casting with her resemblance to Famke Janssen (she's tall and has red hair) and she manages to deliver a decent performance as the mighty telekinetic.The story is about what you'd expect from a superhero movie: it has a lot of fighting. This isn't on a par with Avengers but it is consistent. There is some character development, particularly with Jean Grey and Magneto, but Apocalypse could have benefited from taking a lesson from First Class and show us a bit more of their personalities and conflicts.If you're suffering from superhero movie fatigue, there isn't a great deal here to change that except that X-Men has always been an ensemble performance and isn't focused on one character. Yes, Magento and Xavier dominate but most of the other characters have a decent amount of screen-time to add some variety and mix things up. The Horseman of the Apocalypse aren't particularly well-used though, and with Apocalypse as powerful as he is, you'd have to wonder why he even needs them. Perhaps all self-respecting megalomaniacs need flunkies to do their bidding and fetch coffee.X-Men: Apocalypse is a fun ride. There's a lot to enjoy and the action doesn't let up but it does follow the formulaic superhero movie format. If you like X-Men, this is a must see but don't expect anything too deep and meaningful. Oh, and yes, there is a post- credit scene too if you can face sitting through the credits (or buy it on DVD and forward past them).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The 'Batman V Superman' of X-Men movies. (Yeah, it sucks that bad)","Just so you know where I'm coming from. I liked X-Men First Class and thought Days of Future Past was just okay. But this stinker is just bad. After 30 minutes I started looking at my watch and about an hour into the movie I wanted to walk out. Like Batman V Superman, this movie has just so much going on; it feels bloated. And did anyone else notice how bored Michael Fassbender looked in the movie? Michael Fassbender is the guy who plays Magneto and is usually an outstanding actor but he looked like he just didn't want to be there. Even during some of his emotional scenes he looks like he is just phoning it in. I'm guessing he is sick of playing the role. Anyway, the movie feels longer than it is and it isn't even watching it in theaters just for the action. And what is up with reminding us about Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique every five minutes? Even when she isn't on screen they literally show a picture or video of her. It isn't as stupid as watching Wonder Woman check her email but sh!t, the director should know better. Maybe the producers are to blame, I don't know. I just know that watching this stupid movie shouldn't feel like doing homework. This movie is a rental at best. Don't be fooled by the fanboys trying to act like the critics are wrong about this movie. I watched all of the X-Men movies and both of the spin off Wolverine movies and I'm going to straight up tell you, this movie is the worse of the lot. Does Quicksilver have a cool scene in the movie? Yes he does, but is it really worth watching a bad movie just to watch one scene? No, it isn't. Be smart and wait to watch it on a smaller screen. The only thing I liked about it was the last 2 minutes.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
enjoyable but not great,"I can understand both the haters and the fanboys because the movie is both good and bad depending on what's important to yourself. There are three aspects that are awful dialogues (sometimes quite cheesy and dull), story (main story of this film) and Apokalypse. There is some great stuff too entertainment, atmosphere and story (x-men universe related).This makes Apokalypse pretty bad as a standalone movie but it can be a enjoyable movie if like the X-men. Its definitely not the best X-men movie i would rank the X-men movies like X-men2 > First Class > Days of Future Past > Apocalypse > Last Stand > X-Men1.Watch this Movie if you know all the other X-men because it connects the old and new movies very nice together or if you just want some action, fun and entertainment.

The latest X-Men instalment fails to live up to its name,"Five months into 2016 and we are already in our fourth comic-book movie of the year. We've had the fast-talking Deadpool, the gladiatorial battle of Batman v Superman and an epic showdown between superheroes in Captain America: Civil War but now it's the turn of the X-Men in X-Men: Apocalypse, a film that doesn't quite live up to its name.After events in Washington DC, the X-Men are disbanded and living as normal a life as they can. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) runs a school for the 'gifted' mutants and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), who is seen as a hero to mutants after her actions in Washington DC, goes in search of Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a teleporter.When the one considered to be the first mutant, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), awakens from a deep sleep in 1983 Cairo and gathers his Four Horsemen; Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Angel (Ben Hardy), Psylocke (Olivia Munn) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), he plans to destroy the Earth and rebuild it in his own image.With this threat against the world looming ever large, the X-Men must unite to save it and its population, human and mutant.The biggest problem this film had was its titular villain, Apocalypse. He's just so dull and lacks any character that could have made him an interesting opponent for the X-Men. A talent like Oscar Isaac tries his best to make it work but overall, he deserves better from the writing team.It's the writing in this film that really does hold it back as well. The story feels flat, the dialogue is unbearably corny in places and there is no real room for any real character development. It's a film that runs for far too long also, coming in at just under two and a half hours, meaning there are quite a few moments that feel like they drag. It doesn't help when someone like Jennifer Lawrence is intent on sleepwalking her way through the film.The film does have some genuinely good moments, and you won't be surprised to hear that Evan Peters' Quicksilver is involved in two of them. He gets a moment similar to that in Days of Future Past, the only difference here is that it's at a really dramatic moment which the comedic elements totally nullify. No surprise either that Michael Fassbender gets a few of the more memorable as both he and James McAvoy are once again the real stand out performers.These films have never really been about going for all out spectacle however, in this one they go all guns blazing with the finale and try to deliver a huge action set-piece. Some of it works but unfortunately, the whole thing feels all too unimpressive thanks to some some dodgy CGI and uninspired fight choreography.Introducing a slate of new mutants mightn't have helped their cause in this case because they try to juggle the finale to showcase all of the talents that these mutants possess. I've spoken about the lack of character development already and it just seems strange to me that, apart from Magneto, the villains are totally void of it. Storm, Angel and Psylocke are all poorly served by the story and feel more like mere henchmen than powerful mutants. Out of all the new recruits, I was most happy with Scott Summers, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler played by Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and Kodi Smit-McPhee respectively.Jean Grey and Scott Summers in particular are dealt a better hand by the story and one of them gets one of the film's best moments, almost feeling like a middle finger to how that same character was treated in The Last Stand. There's also a very familiar face that turns up towards the end and his involvement was more welcome than I was thinking it would be.I can't say X-Men: Apocalypse is terrible because it's far from being terrible. It just doesn't live up to the standards set by First Class or Days of Future Past, which is quite disappointing. The final part of the finale and the film's closing moments do have me excited for the next instalment. Who knows, with this new team it could be the best yet.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men Apocalypse could have been better!,"I had bigger expectations about this movie, it wasn't bad but it could have been better, after ''Days of Future Past'' everything was complicated because we didn't know what happened with the characters. Thankfully this movie explains some things but I think it isn't enough. Anyway the trailer was better than the movie. The fight with Apocalypse should have been harder and Wolverine should have appeared more, he only appears on a scene and Sansa (I mean Jean ) gives him back some memories. OK this is a good idea because now we want to know what Wolverine finds out but I would have liked him to fight Apocalypse.

Fantastic! Good story with cool scenes and adorable characters:),"In this movie, the story line trace back to the last X-Men movie. At the very beginning, the scene in Egypt corresponds to the movie from the end of the last—X-Men, Days of Future Past, because of that, I got more excited when I started watching the new one.It is a whole new story, so people who have not watched the last one, even the whole series of X-Men movies, will be able to understand and really get into it. The title of this new X-Men movie is Apocalypse, who is probably the world's first mutant. He comes from the ancient Egypt, and used to reign the country with his four horsemen. His people try to rebel against him and put him to slumber for thousand years, but he raised again and try to bring destruction to the world because he thinks the world is going to the wrong direction–false Gods, politic power, and riches. He tends to cleanse the earth and be the dominant of the world. Therefore, he destroys the military weapons around the world through Professor X's mind-power.As a result, the world is under attack of Apocalypse. The main goal of the X-Men is to protect the human beings and save the world. There is definitely a coming war between Apocalypse and the X-Men. With this outline, people can find that there are more personal descriptions about some characters, such as Magneto, Storm, and Quicksilver. Those parts are also attractive, making me want to know more about them, and engaged me to the sets of their personal feelings.Generally, this movie is a really great choice for the X-Men's new audiences to watch. All the characters seem like they come to show for the first time, and they give the audiences enough information to catch up even though they only know a little bit of the former stories. The scenes of fighting and action are explicitly awesome, and it was also entertaining to see different mutants using their powers. I highly suggest people watching this movie. This new story is familiar but different because the story of X-Men series is changed by Wolverine when he goes back to the past in the last movie, Days of Future Past.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Damn good entertainment.,"First things first, I liked it. Not loved it, but really liked it.There's no going around it. It's a CGI crap-fest from the first scene to the last. With that being said, most of it looked pretty good. A few scenes where I thought ""Man, this is going to look bad on my TV."" And some scenes where amazing and made me wish I'd seen it in 3D.It starts with a fast paced scene to set up what's to come. Then it takes it time introducing us to the new characters, and show us status-quo on old ones. This is probably not helping on the 2 hour 24 minutes run time of the movie, but some of the characters would probably feel a lot more shallow without it.Then, when it finally kicks in gear, there's no turning back. A lot of great action scenes and some CGI bullsh!t that looks cool, I guess.I don't know much about the phoenix saga, other than that Brett Ratner screwed it up in X-men the last stand. therefor I can't say how accurate or well depicted it was in regards to the comic, but to me it was handled well.The acting was great. McAvoy, Isaac and Smith-McPhee stood out to me as Xavier, Magneto and Nightcrawler. the others did a great job as well. Some in recurring roles and some newcomers. Like Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan as Jean Grey and Scott Summers. Jennifer Lawrence, however, is pretty much phoning it in at this point. She looked like she wanted to be anywhere but there.One of the scenes with quicksilver stole the show and was worth the price of admission alone.On the bad side though. In a market saturated by superhero movies, I'm afraid this might go down as just one more drop in the sea. It's great entertainment, but I'm probably not going to remember much of it in a month. Could be wrong though.Totally justifiable to spend your hard earned cash on, though.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Worst X-Men movie since ""Origins: Wolverine"".","I didn't have huge expectations, but I was hoping to enjoy this movie at least more than ""Batman v Superman"". Well, I was being naive, apparently. ""Apocalypse"" is the worst comic book film of the year so far, and the worst movie from the X-Men franchise since ""Origins: Wolverine"".There are a lot of things that don't work here (uninventive fight scenes, extremely cringe-worthy and dumbed-down dialogue, a messy plot) but, as I've always said, the pillars in any film (and especially any comic book film) are the characters, and they don't work here. At all. Apocalypse is one-dimensional, dull and derivative. Magneto goes through the exact same path that we've already seen in previous movies, and it's gotten extremely predictable and tiresome. Beast's role is virtually non-existent. Xavier has lost everything that made him interesting in ""First Class"". Wolverine's cameo is pointless. Storm, Psylocke and Angel are criminally butchered by a writer who obviously doesn't give a f**k about the source material. They still don't get how the Phoenix force should work. Nightcrawler has become nothing more than a device to transport people into places. And Jennifer Lawrence gives the most lifeless iteration of Mystique we've ever seen on screen. She does literally nothing during the whole movie. The only character who shines is, once again, Quicksilver, who gives us the best scene hands down, although it isn't as surprising as it was in ""Days of Future past"".I've repeatedly read some fans of the ""X-Men"" franchise defending it over other comic book-based film series because ""the X-Men saga includes mature and deep character studies"". Well, I invite you guys to watch ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" and reassert that statement, if you have balls. It's a mishmash of CGI with an unforgivable lack of heart and emotion.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not as great as DOFP, but still a lot of fun for fans of the franchise.","The Nile Valley, 3600BC: mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is revered as a god by the Egyptians, but his growing power proves to be his downfall, at least for a few millennia, as a group of concerned humans successfully carry out a plan to trap him under a collapsing pyramid. Cut to the 1980s, and Apocalypse is finally released from his tomb, recruiting several misguided mutants (including Storm and Magneto) as his followers in order to achieve world domination.There's an awful lot going on in this latest X-Men adventure, so much so that it's a little too much to take in at times. As a result, the storytelling suffers a little, but not enough to prevent this from being another fun addition to the franchise (my favourite superhero series by far). Not as mind-blowing as Days of Future Past, but still a very entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.Evan Peters as Quicksilver once again steals the show with another awesome display of his super speed abilities, rescuing the mutants of Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted from a massive explosion, but there is plenty else to wow the senses, the film packing in lots of slick set-pieces, including the spectacular opening 'pyramid collapse' scene, Magneto (Michael Fassbender) pushing his powers to the limit, and Wolverine on the rampage (an uncredited cameo from Hugh Jackman).7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Olivia Munn as very sexy villainess Psylocke, the neat jibe about the third film in a series always being the worst, and for including Metallica's The Four Horsemen on the soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Critics are weirdos this movie ROCKED,"The critics are really tuning out when it comes to summer blockbusters and it's such a shame. I was a little worried going into this movie because of all the bad rap it's got right now. But to my surprise, it was AWESOME. And I think critics are trashing this film because they just don't care, they think it's repetitive and it's pandering to fans of the characters. I'm glad it it was made for the fans of the comics, cartoons, whatever form you grew up with, because in my opinion this is the best live action adaptation to date of the X- Men characters. But I wanna make it clear that I don't think it's better than First Class as a movie, or Days of Future Past for that matter, but it's still really good. In a bloated year of comic book movies this is one that feels the most familiar but still fresh. The X-Men franchise being out of Marvel's hands is saddening to a certain extent, but it's nice to see it provide something different from what we expect in the Avengers. My friend and I both agree it's nice to have a more balance of drama and humor in the X-men films rather then having constant humor like in the Avengers, now I'm not saying I didn't like this past month's Civil War, I really enjoyed it, but it's nice to move the focus to a more dramatic conflict and less on the one liners. There are a few problems I have that I want to address first before I describe what I love about the movie. My first problem is the four horsemen, I feel it was rushed and completely left open with not enough details. Magneto was really the only one who made sense to me why he would join Apocalypse, because with Storm, Pyslocke, and Angel you just don't get to know them at all. They play off more as henchman rather than famous characters that we know. My other problem is Apocalypse wasn't used to his full potential, I think Oscar Issac did a great job with what he was given, but his lines feel repetitive and corny at times. His powers are unexplained, I'm not too sure what exactly he can do and it would've been a nice touch to just see what other powers he's capable of. On a more positive note I LOVED the urgency they showed with him, I really felt like there was a sense of danger finally which is a hard thing to find in the MCU. With the stakes being raised, it adds the tension and I feel that's severely lacking in most of the Avengers films except for a few scenes obviously. It's nice to see everyone from First Class reconnect and reflect on the memories from that film because it adds a sense of closure to that generation of mutants, especially between Xavier and Erik. While the new generation finally join the X-Men for a potentially awesome sequel in the 90's. I have no complaints there, I loved Jean and Nightcrawler, and I thought Cyclops did fine. Quicksilver was freaking great as you might expect so I hope to see him come back. There's so much I want to talk about but I want to keep it spoiler free. But let's just say everything they hint at in this movie got me so amped up that the next X-Men is on the top of my anticipation list. If you haven't done so, BUY A TICKET TO THIS MOVIE!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underwhelming ... but has some moments for the fans,"X-Men: Apocalypse is not a bad movie... However it's going to be difficult to write a review that doesn't dwell on the negatives.First things first: the plot is way too simplistic. Introduce bad guy, gather protagonists, gather antagonists, fight. That's literally it. One could say it's a good change of pace from the way- too-complicated-for-their-own-good other superhero offerings seen recently but in this case it feels flat and linear.The cast is basically the same as X-Men: First Class. Magneto / Fassbender and Xavier / McAvoy are still good but it feels like Jennifer Lawrence doesn't want to be here? She's supposed to be jaded in this movie but plays the jaded Mystique maybe a little too well...?In terms of characters: Quicksilver is still the greatest speedster ever on the small or big screen; Bravo to Synger on his interpretation of ultimate speed and how that could basically make you almighty. Well done.The rest of the characters are somewhat disappointing: the X-Men offer so many possibilities but it looks like we are limited to that leather look introduced by Synger 15 years ago. He invented the modem super hero movie look but now he is limited to the style he invented? The costumes are a bit ridiculous and Apocalypse is the best illustration of that: Oscar Isaac looks a bit odd...kind of off. And you get that across Psylocke and her way too small panties look, angel's techno wings etc etc. Today, the X-Men could look better. And don't get me started on the blue gang (Beast and Diablo don't feel real; they really never did...)For the good: a lot of Easter eggs and fan service. The Wolverine scene is fantastic for those who know the source material. The end fight is satisfactory... but it's difficult not to be underwhelmed.The X-Men need to be reinvented on the silver screen. Fox needs to go back to that glimpse that First Class offered and that was forgotten too soon after. We need something new; no more ""Magneto is not a bad guy really!"" "" But he kills"" that we've been served for 15 years. Time for a reboot. The source material is great and deserves it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Probably the best X-Men movie to date.,"X-Men movies over the years have been pretty inconsistent in terms of their quality. You might like one only to find the next is disappointing. But even the ones that were good were still quite rough around the edges. This is where Apocalypse stands out. It doesn't just feel good but also feels like a well polished movie.The movie has a lot of strong points. Story, casting, dialog, music score, graphics, editing and action sequences are all very good. Character background/development in such a jam packed movie is always gonna be a little rushed but its still there, enough for the viewers to be able to sympathize with the characters. That is probably helped by the fact that the movie is quite long, which is a good thing.I wouldn't say X-Men Apocalypse is a classic mainly because it lacks truly epic moments. But it is nonetheless a very good and entertaining movie that may well be the best ever to come out of the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I'm not sure what the critics are complaining about...,"Fassbender, Isaac, McAvoy, Lawrence, & Peters are just a few of the incredible cast members in this film. There are moments when all of the cast has a chance to shine, which is an accomplishment given the amount of people on screen. You cannot be blamed for entering the cinema and expecting spectacle to completely eclipse character development in this film, however the characters and their motivations are not neglected. There are also no plot holes (as many people have stated). Even a character as grandiose as Isaac's Apocalypse is presented with plausible reasoning for his actions; typically, its tough to justify the ""I want to destroy the world"" plot, but it makes sense given his history.Most importantly, you can follow this film without being a comic aficionado.If you liked Days of Future Past, this will not disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
At Least We Can All Agree The Third One Is Always The Worst,"If you already know your film is gonna suck, do something to change it and not just whine about it within the film!First of all, a prequel should be what it claims to be. Preceding, previous, ""what happened before"". The storyline in this film diverges greatly from the canon of the original movies, in fact making some of this events impossible.The cast is made up of brilliant actors. Unfortunately none really get to show it because animation and special effects and action have now taken over this franchise as well. There is not a single scene where Fassbender or McAvoy could have lived up to their potential. Evan Peter's was purely comic relief and his appearance just a cheap copy of his last one in Days Of Future Past.The X-Men movies always had a wonderful depth to it, mutations being representative of any ""otherness"" in our society. Now this film about ""false Gods"" feels like American anti-Islam propaganda. Very disappointing!And last but not least, product placement ruined what was left of the film. Hank McCoy says he made special glasses for Cyclops yet we see the big fat lettering of RAY BAN in every single shot of Scott that follows. The same goes for the scenes that advertised Coca Cola, Michelin,... it was almost as horrible as in Jurassic World.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Age of Ultron of X-Men,"This year in super heroes so far: Deadpool Awesome, Dawn of Justice Entertaining but could be better, Captain America Civil War Fantastic and X Men Apocalypse.satisfactory.Following on from the previous brilliant X men films Days of Future Past and First Class, X-Men Apocalypse raises the roof several times to a whole new realm of action, destruction, and of course mutants. Now Xavier's school for mutants has become a proud established academy with many students, but a new threat has risen from the earth. Apocalypse rises to bring about a new earth and kill all life but with the help of four rogue mutants.To start off, X-Men Apocalypse defiantly promises what it delivers in the trailers and on the posters, so for the fans looking for what they see in the trailers is exactly what you get. However, this isn't a super hero masterpiece, but it is very entertaining and enjoyable. Probably not the best out of the X Men series, but impossibly no the worst. I would call this the Age of Ultron of the X-Men universe, or the better version of Man of Steal (associating with how much destruction there is).Before I talk about negatives I will go over positives: good performances by cast (especially Sophie Turner), good direction of narrative to an extent, great score, entertaining, hype building, explosive, slightly funny, and cool use of costume.One of the main problems at the beginning was that there was too much going on, and there are numerous stories going on a the same time so it gets quite crowded. Not just with the story but also characters. It tries to pull focus on too many characters which makes it kind of each person gets their time in the spotlight feel. It is also far too long, which doesn't make you bored but does slightly drag on a bit.I will also say there were moments which I call were awkward tense moments. This is when there are brief moments in the dialogue which try to be significant but are not delivered correctly. For example in Force Awakens when Ren and Rey are fighting and he mentions in a bad delivery 'I can teach you the ways of the Force' One of the strong but also weak points 0f the film is its very strong use in visual effects including CGI and editing. This consists of some remarkable scenery to be admired, but it is very repetitive and could make one dizzy.Overall X-Men Apocalypse is very entertaining, and is fourth out of eighth' place in the series. I understand its hard to always top the previous film, but this still doesn't quite reach the momentum of Future Past or First Class, but is still very good. 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
False Gods,"With it being the 9th film to date in the series, and the fourth superhero film to come out in 2016, X-Men: Apocalypse had a difficult task in keeping the genre and franchise fresh. While it struggles with some of the same problems as most of these superhero ensemble pieces do, Apocalypse serves as both a satisfying conclusion to the second X- Men trilogy and an exciting beginning to the next chapter.Bryan Singer returns to the franchise once again to direct, as do James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, Evan Peters, and Rose Byrne. Newcomers include Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler, and Alexandra Shipp as Storm. A strong point in all of the X-Men entries has been the acting, and Apocalypse is no different. McAvoy and Fassbender perfectly portray Professor X and Magneto as the two opposing viewpoints to the mutant situation. Unfortunately, they don't get as much screen time together as the two previous entries, but that makes their scenes together that much more special.As far as the newbies go, while they weren't the central focus of the films, I really connected to Jean Grey and Scott Summers. Nightcrawler provides some comedic relief and Angel doesn't really serve any purpose in the film, but Scott and Jean were handled well, especially the ladder. Being that Sophie Turner didn't completely prove herself till the last few seasons of Game of Thrones, I was skeptical of her going in. But Turner did a nice job at balancing the immense power of her character while giving her a relatable appeal that made Famke Janssen's performance so great.The introduction of Apocalypse was also a tough sell. Adapting the character from his comic-book counterpart is one thing, but I was pleased with how smoothly his origin fit into the film. It's hard finding a villain that can one up Magneto on a scene to scene basis, but Oscar Isaac's titular villain does just that. Perhaps seeing a bit more of him would have served the story more, but his short and significant scenes with each of his four horseman were enough to sell me on his ominous presence.I think some of the faults of the film involve the overabundance of characters the film decides to focus on. Every X-Men film is an ensemble piece, but 'Apocalypse' tries its hardest to do service to so many characters, and sometimes it can be a little messy. I don't think there are even scenes I really disliked, but there are some that feel unnecessary.Overall, the film succeeds at so many levels it's hard to be disappointed in the outcome. The X-Men films have always been one to pull and tug on emotions that other superhero films and blockbusters fail to do, and 'Apocalypse' definitely does that. For all of the explosions and disaster that Apocalypse causes, it still feels very personal to the X-Men, and I can certainly appreciate that type of storytelling. A little bit of extra care to the script and direction will lead to a much tighter film next time around.+Sophie Turner's Jean Grey+The newbies are handled well+Introduction of Apocalypse+Fassbender and McAvoy are once again powerhouses-Overabundance of focus on too many characters8.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Damn!  It was actually good!,"After DoFP, I was skeptical if the First Class reboot could go any further. Long story short, DoFP left so many open threads that didn't make sense that I couldn't keep them all straight. Apocalypse comes along and it was the nice shiny bow that tied up the hanging threads of DoFP. Well.. most of them anyway.Without giving too much away, Apocalypse is definitely a continuation of the First Class and DoFP timelines, so know that you won't understand much of it unless you've seen those films. You can enjoy it, sure, but don't expect to understand it. Like seeing the Avengers without seeing Iron Man or Captain America.Watching Apocalypse felt like I was watching the old Saturday morning cartoon series from the early 90s. It was nice to see Jubilee there (even if she doesn't use her 'powers') but it still left me wondering when they're finally going to bring Gambit into the picture. I suppose Colossus was off futzing with Deadpool. We even get to see Prof. X kick some ass which was nice however I won't reveal how.The end feels a lot like the end of Civil War which may be my only complaint. Without spoiling it, it also allows for the connection to the first 3 X-men in a plausible way. My only complaint might be that Weapon X was a program and not a man.In any case it's an excellent continuation to the X-Men saga that any superhero fan should go and see.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I've seen people claim that it pushes too much into the movie, and even tho there is a lot going on it's done in a coherent way that makes sense.The movie in terms of scale is incredible. You really get the feeling that these mutants are essentially gods. It has a huge emotional heart to it with serious tear jearkers at some points, yet also manages to squeeze in great humor and subtle references to fans of the comics. (I won't reveal what they are but it's pretty big) All I can say is that in terms of emotion, action, scale, and tension this movie is by far the best in the franchise.

"I think that X-Men: Days of Future Past was a little better than this one, but X-Men: Apocalypse was not bad at all.","It's 1983, ten years after Days of Future Past(Twenty years in the trilogy and yet everyone looks as young as they looked in the first film). Charles Xavier with the help of Beast and the reluctant Mystique must turn a group of students into X-Men in order to stop an ancient mutant and his minions, which includes Magneto, from wiping all of humanity out.All the actors were at their best in this film. Great performances, especially from James McAvoy as Professor X was really good. Michael Fassbender has a really good touching dramatic story.But Quicksilver turned out to be my fav mutant in this movie. They took what made him awesome in Days of Future Past and up it a level in Apocalypse which worked so well and was the best part of the whole film (even though Hugh Jackman does his cameo as the greatest X-Men of them all).The villain, Apocalypse himself I was not impressive with outside him driving the story. It was cool that Oscar Issac played the role as I'm a fan of his stuff, but once again, a superhero movie has a lackluster supervillain. I mean look at Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique who should have been a villain, but now they have to change the character altogether cause of her megastar status.I'm also still not so impressed with the way Bryain Singer handles Special effects.Anyway, it is a good flick, A lot of really cool comic book references, but at the same time a decent drama, It's starts out a little slow trying to fit everyone's origin story into the film, but in the end it's very satisfying",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The X-Men make a surprising but flawed return to the big screen,"It's been sixteen years since the debut of the X-Men franchise in 2000, and the series is shown to still be running. Director Bryan Singer has given grace to the franchise, though it has fallen victim to a few disappointments along the way, take 'X-Men: Origins' for example. This ninth installment to the series continues the story after the events of 'Days of Future Past' when our hero Wolverine traveled back in time to save the world from the tyrant robots known as The Sentinels and restored peace, though the peace for the mutants was only temporary. The film opens up in ancient Egypt with the awakening of the most powerful mutant in the world Apocalypse (played by Oscar Isaac), a mutant born thousands of years ago as a god and is capable destroying absolutely everything in this path. When the mutants learn of his return and discover this plan to completely wipe out civilization as we know it while assisted by his four horsemen: Storm (played by Alexander Shippe) Angel (played by Ben Hardy), Psylocke (played by Oliva Munn) and later joining them is Magneto (played by Michael Fassbender). To an grueling effort to save humanity, the mutants band together to defeat Apocalypse once and for all. Joining the mutants is Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), The Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quiksilver (Evan Peters), along with some newcomers including Nightcrawler (Kodi-Smit McPhee), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), and Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) assisted by Professor Charles Xavier (Jams McAvoy).This film serves a pleasant continuation to the X-Men storyline, but it's not quite as fresh as it should be, hitting a few flaws along the way. The film begins with a truly compelling premise and introduction of the main villain Apocalypse to kick off the story which follows an antagonist who is portrayed as a god. So yes, the film does seem to implant some biblical symbolism in the story including the four horseman of the Apocalypse which some may be familiar with in the Bible. The execution of the story is strong enough to maintain interest. But if there is a major flaw in the story, it lies within the pacing along with the main villain Apocalypse himself. After a compelling introduction our antagonist, the story journeys through a bloated amount of exposition, moving the plot at an unnecessarily slow pace during the first half. I can't argue that the establishment of Magneto's story and his transformation from an innocent man to a tragic anti-hero, everything else feels a bit confused, at least until the story finally kicks off during the second half. The same goes for Apocalypse. With a villain as powerful and legendary as him, viewers would expect him to be treated with proper development. The part this villain fails at providing a clear motivation as why is trying to destroy the world other than just to destroy it. Without a solid motivation, the result is a villain that feels rather underdeveloped, though he reaches redemption from a decent performance by Oscar Isaac.While the film may not bless with the most engrossing villain of the franchise, we are fortunately granted with of course, exhilarating visual effects and action sequences to pinnacle our excitement. The action sequences are fun as ever, and given by the impressive CGI, they're quite pulse-pounding to watch. The climatic battle during the final twenty minutes are easily some of the best moments. Like the previous film Days of Future Past, Quik Silver played by Evan Peters earns his time to shine in another of his big ""freeze-motion"" scene accompanied a classic 80s soundtrack (Haha!). Apocalypse on the other hand, is cool to look at but the CGI and costume design on Oscar Isaac is not too impressive or particularly scary enough to make him look menacing. Even if the visuals effects don't impress you, it's great to see some of our favorite cast members return to the screen along with newcomers like Tye Sheridan and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Cyclops and Nightcrawler. The performances are incredible, especially Michael Fassbender who delivers as captivating, emotionally-driven portrayal of the iconic Magneto. Is his performance Oscar-worthy? No, but it stands truly memorable.X-Men Apoaclypse may feel like a slight step backwards in the series, but it's solidly entertaining and marks an accomplished opportunity by director Bryan Singer as well as a worthy kickstart to the summer, even if it hits some flaws in the process. This film is worth seeing, especially for X-Men fans and bound to score big riches at the box office, much like every other Marvel-based picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good job Marvel, you ruined X-Men","To start, this review will be free of spoilers, all this will be is my reaction and thought on this movie.I got to see this movie for free with a very good friend of mine that works at my local Movie Theatre. I had high hopes for this movie, due to my personal opinion that the franchise of X-Men had been on a steady increase in quality of their productions.While sitting in the Theatre, I started to look around. In this small, packed screening room of around 40 people, I noticed only around 3 people where actually paying attention. I noticed around 5-6 people actually stand up and just leave this movie, I also noticed around 10 people sleeping, and the volume level in the room was high due to discussion. And the best part is, there was someone sitting of front of me who simply just decided to watch YouTube just right then and there.If that isn't bad enough, the story was bland and barren, and the parts of the movie that seemed to have somewhat potential, where eventually also ruined by the poor story of this film. The film seemed to go on and on. A good movie could tell the same story in half the time.I honestly would have had more fun and entertainment getting a blood test.Marvel had released a few films that had set the bar high for me on this film, but this was just so beyond marvel. Good job Marvel, you ruined X-Men.If you are a fan of a movie with CGI that will simply give you a migraine after about 3 minutes of continuous attention, and a movie with a bland story that will put you to sleep, I would highly recommend this movie.As my final thoughts, I would strongly recommend for you to save your money. This movie is a waste of time. This movie is a joke. This movie is a failure. Due to this, I would rate the movie X-Men: Apocalypse a 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It has few ups and downs but you would love to finish the movie.. It will bind you to your seats..The last thing is: I liked that JLaw wasn't emphasized too much.

Best film of Xmen series i've seen.,"X-MEN APOCALYPSE REVIEW - Finished watching one of the most Anticipated Hollywood flick of the year XMen Apocalypse and i am thrilled. Kick Ass, Faadu, Brilliant, Outstanding and bla bla, in 1 Word (in Indian Language) K A D A K.... Certainly Best Xmen series film i've watched. Better than previous Xmen films, Avengers Series in short Best Hollywood Flick of the year 2016 so far. We usually don't expect Quality film making and script from Money making entertainers but if we get Good Script with lots of entertaining elements then we call that film a Classic and exactly same happened to me after watching Apocalypse. I don't call it a Classic but yes Film has surpassed my expectations and has forced me to watch it again in theater. Probably first Hollywood film of 2016 which i will watch 2nd time in theater. Excellent writing, Tight screenplay with zero loo breaks, Outstanding VFX and 3D effects and a perfect paisa vasool entertainer as a whole. Xmen Apocalypse doesn't disappoint you in any field. The main reason is its screenplay which is entertaining throughout for 145 mins despite very less comedy. Visual effects and 3D Effects are best for any Hollywood film recently. First half lefts you on interesting note which doesn't easily happen with other money making entertainers, and then 2nd half completely surprises you with Good worthy a perfect climax. Wolverine surprises in his 2 minutes cameo. Erik's son is surprising element because of its Lightning Fast speed super power. Overall i don't have any minuses to count, this is a Perfect Entertainer for Hollywood lovers. I'm giving 8/10 stars which is really high for this kind of Entertaining Genre film. Go for this one, if you're really looking for a perfect Hollywood Entertainer and i'm sure Film won't disappoint you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"High Stakes, Colossal Destruction, but no weight to it.","""X-Men Apocalypse"" is the next film after the clean slate we got from Bryan Singer's much acclaimed DOFP. The previous did a great job at hard resetting the franchise in order to puff some fresh and newfangled air for the franchise and remove some of the plot holes that have been bothering the X-Men franchise. But what Apocalypse does is be quite simplistic or average at best, we see a lot of landmarks and infrastructure getting destroyed and a whole new cast and much potential from Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse and yet it ends up being trite and feels flat and lackluster with just a couple of standout scenes.Before you rip this review like the rest of the reviews out there, there are some aspects to this film that emerge to at least save for the dreary undertones. Like the already much talked about Quicksilver, he gives the film a way to bring in some fun and hilarious moments and his scene in the Xavier house is the most well made and aesthetically stunning in the whole 2h and 24 min run time. Once again the scenes with Fassbender's Magneto are the most emotionally driven ones in the movie. It goes to show that he has one of the most striking character arcs that has ever been explored in the whole X-Men saga. The old characters like Scott Summers, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler reintroduced are spot on and have minimal flaws to say the least. In its core as well, is a film that doesn't take itself that seriously at times and realizes how campy the 80s was. So it's not fair to say that this film wasn't fun or enjoyable, or that it lacks any spirit of exuberance.For the film's flaws, it really is quite similar to what went wrong in Age of Ultron and if you liked that film then you'll probably like this film too. The film suffers with a villain that is average to really below average. For someone who is called Apocalypse, has lived for a thousand or more years and is really god damn powerful, he doesn't pass as menacing or even evoke a feeling of dread or trepidation at all whenever he becomes present on the screen. He also is literally just evil for the sake of being evil, sure he's maybe a whole lot of a better villain that Ultron (just maybe), but the parallelisms are still there, like the reason why he wants to destroy the world is because they both looked in the media and current and past world events and thought that it was all bull crap and wanted to make a new world. Part of the reason why he felt lackluster was that there was so much thrown in to the film and some even felt like it was just there for the sake of being there without really needing to be relevant to any character arc or subplot at all. You have the introduction of young Scott Summers who we see is not in control of his powers and that's about it so he goes to Xavier's School of Gifted Children, and then he meets Jean Grey in such a clichéd way. We also get to see Nightcrawler once again since X2 and he seems just thrown it there for the sake of being there too. After their introduction, they had to cut back to Magneto, then had to cut back to Apocalypse recruiting the horsemen as well. The reason why Days of Future Past worked was because they only had 1 then eventually 2 narratives to focus on. It was 1. what was happening in the past with Wolverine and the First Class cast. and 2. what was happening in the present as they were protecting Wolverine, and the second narrative wasn't given much focus until the near end of the film. Every subplot and character arc in that film felt relevant, while in this film it just didn't mesh well together. You also have inconsistencies with Apocalypse's powers, one moment you see him taking down a group of people with just a hand move. Then you see him calling out someone instead of just using his powers to kill everyone else in his way or literally rip out a wall to get to him himself. Instead Apocalypse's screen time and everyone else's screen time are wasted in favor of average sequences with no pay off in the final battle except for a show case of their powers, what they can do, and basically defeating the villain and saving the day because we all know that a handful of them survived in the end of Days of Future Past.Verdict: 7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"While it falls under the shadow of DOFP, X-Men Apocalypse is another great entry in the superb X-Men series","With the great amount of superhero movies released today, it is difficult for many directors to deliver a high quality of movies of the course of a series. With X-Men Apocalypse, Bryan Singer may have just proved himself to be the best superhero movie director. Singer once again crafts an interesting story, balances a large cast of interesting character, and shows his ability to direct elaborate action sequences. Although the overall execution is not perfect, it still results in another entertaining superhero film. As with any superhero film, a hero (or in this case heroes) are only as good as its villain, and Apocalypse emerges as a well-done villain, which is a welcoming sight compared to some other recent superhero villains. The opening sequence provides a great backstory to the character, and perfectly establishes him a false god who can't possibly exist without the presence or physical bodies of other mutants. By the time he awakens in 1983 and begins to enact his plan of eliminating the weak, it all makes sense and has actual purpose. His role as an alien of sorts who doesn't understand today's world perfectly lends itself to his plan. It gives the character a commanding purpose, and as a result makes him feel like the all-powerful character Apocalypse is meant to be. Where X-Men Apocalypse especially shines is in its decision to go with another new cast of X-Men. Each actor does a nice job capturing the spirit of their young, inexperienced mutant. Tye Sheridan especially impressed me as Cyclops, showing the mutants growth throughout the movie from fearing his powers to becoming a member of the new X-Men. The addition of fan-favorites like Nightcrawler and Quicksilver were also pretty awesome as the two prove to be the movies biggest scene stealers. Talking about great scenes, I have to mention THAT scene. Yes, X-Men Apocalypse boasts another AMAZINGLY AWESOME Quicksilver scene that somehow transcends the previous one!!!! Combine that with the equally excellent Weapon X cameo, and you'll be sure to walk out the theater with mind blown! For all the flashy scenes that X-Men Apocalypse may boasts, it is littered with flaws. To start, coming into this movie, the X-Men storyline had already been riddled with a number of holes, and this movie only compounds the problem. Even the most dedicated fanboys will have trouble trying to piece together the events from X-Men (2000) to Apocalypse. Also, while the addition of a number of new characters did help to expand the scale of the plot, the movie definitely reaches a maximum occupancy level, which results in a number of characters serving absolutely no purpose. While X-Men Apocalypse's flaws do prevent it from being the best in the X-Men series, it in no way keeps it from being another superb superhero movie. Singer has created a fantastic formula for superhero movies that has shown itself time-and-time again with great results. His ability to create compelling characters, action sequences, and (most importantly) stories has made him one of the best superhero movie directors. X-Men Apocalypse is just another example of the greatness that results from Singer's formula.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Overlong with a bit too much drama, but much better than X-Men: Days of Future Past. A solid, if not standout comic book movie.","The music of this latest X-Men movie sucks. Challenge yourself to sit through the opening credits sequence three times in a row without initiating a divorce. You'll see what I mean. The music's a characterless Hollywood wash, generic as can be, BUT the rest of this movie isn't. In fact, this latest X-Men movie isn't bad at all.There are lots of overblown and drawn out ""screaming"" moments--you know; characters charging up their powers in a dramatic moment while screaming ""YAAAAAAAHHHH!!!"" which, kind of, you know--elicits sighs and eye rolls after a while--but it's a comic book movie about angsty teens and homophobia. You can't judge it too harshly.A standout of this movie is Apocalypse himself. He's rad. Everything about him--the acting, the menace, the costume--it's all great. Will he replace Ivan Ooze as the best purple-blue villains of cinema? I don't know. I don't *think* so, I mean, it's hard to beat Ivan Ooze as one of the greatest movie villains ever. But this portrayal of Apocalypse is up there.The returning cast of the other prequel X-Men movies are all here and in good standing. I found Quicksilver to be more endearing this time around: not as annoying as his first appearance in the X-Men: Days of Future Something-Something (which was a bad, boring movie.) Everyone involved, from Mystique to Hank to Olivia Munn's pink moon boots are great.Except Michael Fassbender, playing Magneto. Fassbender, I find, plays the same character in every movie: kind of a breathy, non-blinking, quiet, teary, sad-faced posh Brit (I know Fassbender's German.) It's no better that Magneto, yet again, loses ""everything"" at the start of the movie and, once more, plays the villain with a victim card. But we've seen it before. It's the same problem that plagued the 2014 Spiderman reboot--telling the same story again and again and again. Yes, we know Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider and accidentally causes the death of Aunt Ben (whoops!) Seeing it on screen yet again is frustrating. Everyone knows about Spiderman's backstory, just as everyone knows Magneto's motivations... perhaps all too well. We get it. He's had a hard life and feels persecuted. We're meant to feel sorry for him. But, oh my God, guys, he's the same in every X-Men movie, and there's been like, ten of them. Do something different with Magneto for the next installment... maybe make him go insane and then become possessed by the spirit of Onslaught. Then he could act like Immortan Joe (Rad!!!) Or have him really get into D&D. Maybe the next X-Men movie can be about Charles urging Magneto to move out of his basement. Or something.X-Men Apocalypse: recommended, but only if a.) you have insomnia comme moi, or b.) you can watch it for free at a friend's house with a basket of Rubic's cubes handy. And there are chips on the table.6.5",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Apocalypse Now,"X-Men: Apocalypse review (spoiler free).Director: Bryan Singer Distributor: Fox Cast: James McAvoy, 2 time Oscar Nominee Michael Fassbender*, Oscar Winner Jennifer Lawrence**, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Sophie Turner with Ben Hardy and Evan Peters, Kodi Smit-Mcphee.Plot: With the emergence of the world's first mutant, Apocalypse, the X-Men must unite to defeat his extinction level plan.After X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) being probably the best in the X-Men series and still is it made all the other X-Men films look pointless. Director Bryan Singer who made three other X-Men films returns with the ninth in the series (including Deadpool) which started back in 2000, 16 years later he directs an entirely new cast.X-Men: Apocalypse may not be as good as Days of Future Past but it is still an enjoyable Marvel film, Charles Xavier (McAvoy), Eric Lensherr Magneto (Fassbender), and Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) all return for the third and last time and those characters leave the series with a bang. With the re-introduction of Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (Smit-Mcphee), previously played by Alan Cumming and Jean Grey/Pheonix (Turner cast because of Game of Thrones), previously played by Famke Janssen the X-Men series seems to be continuing on a massive scale even there are seven previous films.This film has plenty of action and a sort of origin story with the new characters including the first ever appearance of En Sabah Nur a.k.a Apocalypse (Isaac), who is the first ever and most powerful mutant the X-Men have ever faced.Here are some points why I think this is one of the must see superhero films this year: New Characters: Although most of the characters have been seen before for example Nightcrawler, Jean Grey, Storm etc. the film also introduces new characters and they are (only two), Phsylocke played by Olivia Munn and Apocalypse played by Oscar Isaac previously know for Ex-Machina (2015) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). These two new characters make a big impact on the film and on the heroes themselves.CGI good and bad point: CGI is the main component of this film because you think superheroes it's going to be massive amounts of CGI. The CGI in this film literally makes buildings crumble and entire cities get destroyed by the shear might of Apocalypse. In some parts of the film the CGI looks a little incomplete there are few parts where it is unnecessary especially during the main battle where you can clearly tell it is a green-screen. Other than than the CGI is well used and well just a great component.One bad point: Apocalypse in the comics is an all powerful being that all of the X-Men fear even the more powerful ones, but in the film he is powerful but in my personal opinion I feel they picked the wrong actor, Oscar Isaac doesn't play evil well and that's a bad thing because I had really hopes for that character.Take the two good points into account and this is actually a pretty good superhero that does fall a little flat granted but that happens, if this was Singer's X-Men 3, if only he had made X-Men 3. Not nearly as good as Days of Future Past but still a decent addition to the X-Men franchise and hope that the X-Men series still lives on for years to come.Verdict: Enjoyable addition to the franchise with an immense ensemble of characters, but doesn't live up to the brilliance that is Days of Future Past and Apocalypse called have been played better. 8/10 Excellent.*Best performance by an Actor in a supporting role 12 Years a Slave (2013), Best performance by an Actor in a leading role Steve Jobs (2015). **Best performance by an Actress in a leading role Silver Linings Playbook (2012).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Character flaws but overall good.,"X-Men ApocalypseBryan Singer seems to have the Midas touch when it comes to X-Men movies. Not to mention The Usual Suspect being one of the best films from the 90s. This makes me excited for the remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea which will come out next year.Charles Xavier played by James McAvoy is once again almost perfect in the role I have some issues with how they wrote the movie but his performance was up there with Michael Fassbender as Magneto. Once again their friendship seems to play that card of ""oh I'm your friend, now your enemy, now your friend again."" Which is getting old.Jennifer Lawrence did seem a bit off, but not as drastic as some professional reviewers out there are saying. She's not Robert De Niro, she doesn't just make movies for money.I wish Hank McCoy spent more time as Beast and was actually a Beast. It was never on point for me. Nicholas Hoult was still a good Hank though.Moria Mactaggert, played by Rose Byrne, was just in the way. Like Lois Lane from BvS, she didn't need to be in the film. Bleh.Jean Grey and Scott Summers were my favorites of the film. Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan were great. Sophie is great in Game of Thrones and Tye was great in Mud. I can't wait for Ready Player One where he plays the Parzival.Oscar Isaac plays En Sabah Nur, he played the role they wrote well. That being said the character that Simon Kinberg and Bryan Singer wrote was way off point. Imagine Deadpool with his mouth sown shut. Yeah it's almost that bad.Verdict: Worth watching. I enjoyed it more than Batman Vs. Superman and the post credits makes me excited for the next in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"X-Men Apocalypse disappoints those who became fans of X-Men series only because of DOFP. Visually stunning cliché.,","X-Men: Apocalypse (2016): Except for Wolverine and Mystique,I always lack interest in X-Men film series.When released amidst lot of super heroes season,I found nothing special in this over hyped X-Men series.But Days of Future Past entirely changed my opinion as that movie is not only the best entry in the series but also one of the best super-hero film of all time.It has abundant entertainment and complexity which made me intrigued to the series.Did Apocalypse gave me the same feel then?Plot:Since the dawn of existence, there has been an ancient being named En Sabah Nur (Oscar Issac) who is believed by many to be the world's very first mutant. Awakened in 1983 after thousands of years in a deep slumber, he plans to rule the world and wipe out mankind with help from four new recruits Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Angel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender).Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has an issue with that, and alongside Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), and an array of younger X-Men, including Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), he looks to stop them.Plus Points:1)VFX: X-men Apocalypse is lot about destruction than intelligence.There are lot of heavy destruction scenes which are a treat for fans.VFX looked more cool in 3D.There are few pop out sequences especially during title credits and Angel's wing blades.But out of all,Quick Silver scored again with another mind blowing slow motion sequence.This may not be as best as DOFP but still it entertained.2)Performances: All the actors gave their best for their roles.Michael Fassbender and McAvoy once again shined.But the real show stealer is Sophie Turner,Evan Peters and Tye Sheridan.Jennifer Lawrence is not so blue here and looks lovely.3)Screenplay: Apocalypse is no such brain fodder like DOFP.This movie has clichéd screenplay but still it makes a entertaining one time watch.Audience never feels bored and good action scenes,humor and chemistry between all the actors played a key role in movie's engagement.Minus Points:1)Story: As I have said earlier,Apocalypse is a clichéd super hero film with a routine plot where a destruction master starts destructing everything and our heroes trying to stop destruction,,2)Weak Villain: Except having a deadly name Apocalypse looks more like a villain of Power Rangers series.I never expected such a weak antagonist in X-Men series especially after DOFP.So,X-Men Apocalypse disappoints those who became fans of X-Men series only because of DOFP.

"Don't believe the hype, Apocalypse rocks!","I went into this film after reading lots of spoiler free negative reviews, which is probably not a good idea. However, by the end of the first 30 minutes, I was already questioning the sanity of those reviewers.First up, the story is not only a good one, it's a great one, and more importantly, it makes sense.The cast is at the top of their game here, and it shows. There's a certain scene where one of the antagonists of the series loses some loved ones, and you can almost feel their pain. This is how you make a great movie, story first, then have a cast that can deliver in bringing that story to life.The special effects are first rate, and there are a lot of them, even for a movie that features superheroes doing their stuff. But there aren't many times (if any) where you think any of those scenes could have been done without a building or bridge being destroyed. Every special effect featured in Apocalypse was required to bring that part of the story to life.The movie's run time is just under 2 and a half hours, and every one of those minutes is put to good use and never wasted. When you walk out of a theatre thinking you were only in there for 90 minutes, you know that you were entertained from start to finish.Even the cameo by Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was great.If you're an X-men fan, well, a fan of the X-men movies anyway, you'll enjoy this film for sure. I'd rate it at least as good as X2, and on par with Days of future past, and a little better than The Wolverine.How this movie could be rated as anything other than excellent, is bewildering. Go see it. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's not Bad...but its not Good!,"Warning, I will be posting spoilers because I feel I can only review this movie properly by telling talking about everything. So if you don't want spoilers, then please don't read this.Again...don't read this if you don't want spoilers...Firstly, the returning cast of McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence and Hoult are cool. They don't really have in depth character journeys but they do well with what they were given. Magneto's reasoning for joining Apocalypse was a bit ham fisted. Taking him back to Auschwitz as a way to manipulate him into getting on board with a human annihilation plan didn't make much sense. I know Magneto is ruthless but that's a kind of dramatic. I like how Raven is saving mutants but I don't understand why she doesn't want to be the ""poster child"" for mutants. Her entire arc in First Class was being a ""mutant and proud"", after being insecure over her appearance and now she can spread that message but chooses not to. It kind of contradicts her character. There isn't much to say about Beast and Charles, they are good but don't really shine in this movie. Although, it was great seeing McAvoy with the iconic bald head.I definitely feel like this movie suffered from having too many characters. Singer just couldn't balance it. I feel like you cant bring iconic character to screen and have them be props, or just there for cool effects and action scene. If you want to do that, its best if you make up characters. My point is Psylocke barely has any lines and just makes the weird face throughout the whole movie. I feel like all her ""great"" moments are in the trailers, so she was underwhelming. It definitely shows that she was a last minute edition to the movie because her character is terribly under developed. Angel is another prop, although his final fight scene with Nightcrawler is pretty dope. Jubilee did not need to be in this movie. She didn't even use her powers. Not ONCE. But Cyclops introduction was good and a great nod to comics/cartoons. Jean Grey was cool and Storm was wasted as always. She did have her accent, however she didn't have much to do and in the final battle just stood around.Apocalypse I feel was a wasted villain. Since the comics, he's always had a survival of the fittest mentality but I feel like they needed to elaborate more on his reasoning for wanting to destroy the Earth. And like, what's gonna happen after we destroy the world? Secondly, you can't touch a television in the 1980s and have all of the knowledge of the world for the past 5000 years. Maybe now, with he internet but in the 80s....definitely not, that was stupid. I think this was a wasted villain and the final battle was a bit underwhelming, minus some cool visual moments. I, also, am wondering what would make Mystique think that she could take down Apocalypse? Weird.I know it seems like I'm ragging on the movie, it definitely had some cool, interesting, funny moments but I feel like the cons outweigh the pros. Quicksilver's scene definitely tops the one from DOFP. But I thought it was so convenient for him to arrive at the school at the moment Apocalypse was destroying the mansion. Also, why the hell did they kill Havok. After, three movies they just didn't let him be great. Total was of a character.This movie is not a bad movie. Some of the critics are definitely being dramatic, but I feel like this film suffers from trying to top itself and rival other superhero franchises like Superman and Civil War. I'm glad that it contains a lot more action than previous X-Men movies and I'm glad that Fox is trying to embrace the science fiction aspect of these stories, but it just falls short to me. I do have a lot more complaints but I will keep those to myself. Of course, I will never tell anyone to not see a movie. I think you should see for yourself to form your own opinion, this review is just my personal experience in words.Anyone who gives this movie a 1 is just being dramatic and knit picking. But anyone who rates this movie a 10 is just trying to battle the terrible reviewers instead of being realistic and honest.Lastly, I don't want the X-Men to go back to Marvel (as great as that would be), I think the X- Men should stay it's own universe. However, I do think the franchise suffers because of the creatives that handle bringing it to life. Kinberg and Singer should just leave this franchise alone and allow some fresh hands/eyes to take these movies to the next level. Even with DOFP erasing some continuity issues, they just bring more issues into the franchise that make your head twirl.OMG....last thing, i promise. The wolverine sequence was cool and fun to watch. But it just wasn't needed at all. That entire scene should have been the post credits. Speaking of post credits, it's nice to know that Mister Sinister exists in this universe. I guess I'm anxious to see which movie he will be a villain in; Deadpool sequel, New Mutants or the next X-men film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bland and disappointing,"I'm a big fan of the X-Men, but that's limited to the comics, as I find the films have largely failed to do the characters and plots/story arcs any justice. ""X-Men: Age of Apocalypse"" is no exception.The dialogue is cringe-inducing. The characters are flat and their portrayals are shallow at best, which is a shame, given the acting credentials of those involved. At times, the film even seems disjointed, making it feel more like a 2 1/2 hour trailer.The only redeeming features, to me, were some of the action sequences. Quicksilver, in particular, was amusing, and lent some levity to the otherwise pretty boring proceedings.In brief, I'm glad I watched this via online free streaming, as I wouldn't pay money to see it in a cinema, to buy the DVD, or even to contribute to it via any sort of subscription.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Weaker than the previous two, but still good.","X-Men Apocalypse may feel like a step down from the good Days of Future Past and the great First Class, but it's tough to hold that against considering just how good those were.Fassbender's Magneto continues to be the best thing about these movies, along with his relationship with Charles Xavier. The rest of the cast is good, and Isaac does a good job of making Apocalypse seem threatening in spite of the character design. Quicksilver steals the show (again) and a certain scene will be sure to satisfy the comic readers, although it's a shame Fox didn't keep it under wraps.The climactic battle is less Roland Emmerich-ish than the trailers suggest (thank God) and the action overall is top notch.However, three of the four horsemen are criminally under developed, and their motivations for joining Apocalypse are never explained. Possibly worse than that is the fact that Apocalypse never explains why he needs them.Moira is in this movie for no reason (although her presence does lead to some hilarious moments with Charles) and could have been cut out completely.Overall this probably won't please anyone who didn't like the previous installments, but is a far cry from the likes of The Last Stand and Origins Wolverine. It joins the first X-Men and the 2013 Wolverine in the pretty good-but-not-great category.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty good overall..,"I give this film kudos for trying to have a story, it just wasn't all that great of a story. There were good aspects to the story but nothing I'd write home about. The scenes with Peter Maximoff are pretty much the best ones in this movie. We talked about it after the movie we decided what this movie lacked was great characters, and Maximoff is a great character who saved the movie for us. I think the characters in comic books that are most entertaining are of the Spiderman and Quicksilver mold. Just fun characters who do things that allow the people making the movie to also have some fun and entertain the audience in ways that aren't just purely about the CGI.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Another Wonderful X-Men Film, With Untapped Potential to be Something Greater","X-Men: Days of Future Past was quite possibly one of the best superhero movies of all-time, and my personal favorite X-Men movie. With big footsteps to follow, X-Men: Apocalypse goes bigger and better in some aspects, and continues the franchise's path of success, but doesn't quite shine like some of its predecessors.Director and writer Bryan Singer has been able to craft some amazing stories in this growing X-Men universe, with spectacular character arcs spanning two separate main casts, and intense, intimate action steering the ship. The plot of Apocalypse gives an enticing premise, and a great story for longtime X-Men fans to love; the story of the world's first ever Mutant, the title character, and his eternal quest to rid Earth of mankind to build a new Mutant-ruled world. In ways, this is a story we've seen before with Magneto as the main antagonist with his idea of a better world run by Mutants, but the large difference here is the villain, who doesn't want to rule humanity, but extinguish it. In my opinion, Apocalypse is a terrific villain, he's introduced right from the start of the film, and his development through the movie is steady and strong. We have ourselves a great, wicked, powerful villain by the end of the movie, which at the end of the day, helps create a better story.The pacing of the film was solid for the most part, outside of a few scenes where it starts to feel choppy. One place in particular, is when Quicksilver's spectacular scene is put back-to-back with Apocalypse's first encounter with Professor X. After an epic showdown between the two characters, ending in the X Mansion, we quickly cut to an entirely different feel, with an 80's soundtrack and loads of humor. Now individually, both of these scenes are brilliant, but put side by side, Apocalypse and his awesome evil ways seem to feel dumbed down, and the movie falls out of place momentarily. Aside from that large hiccup in pacing, the movie has a good flow to its storytelling, and with that, maintains a track record of great stories being told in the X-Men franchise.The action in the film was great. It was large in scope and scale and for the most part, we get to see every character on display a least for a short time. The action sequences don't bog down the pacing of the film, each action scene is written well enough towards the progression of the plot that you won't be caught wondering what the heck is going on. The action is visually engaging, fairly well choreographed, and primarily keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The X-Men universe is a large one, and with separate time lines now a staple of the franchise, we have two actors for almost every character introduced since the first X-Men film in 2000, older and younger versions. For the most part, this has been a strength of the franchise, with two casts being able to develop the same characters. In Apocalypse, we get to see the introduction of younger versions of some iconic characters, including Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, Angel and Psylocke. Unfortunately, outside of Nightcrawler, who provides some of the films best laughs, and Cyclops, who is played very well by up-and-comer Tye Sheridan, there is some massively underwhelming development and lack of screen time for the other aforementioned characters. I would have loved to see more time spent of Jean, chiefly given that a redo of the iconic Dark Phoenix Saga is reportedly on the way. Storm, Psylocke and Angel were poorly used and heavily under powered, mainly while enlisted as three of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen that he recruits to help him conquer the Earth. The actual performances by the character's actors are frankly wonderful, but the writing of their characters were not so much.While some of the newer heroes have yet to blossom into their full potential, the likes of series mainstays Professor X (James McAvoy), Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and even fan favorite Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) all return and continue to deliver outstanding performances. Wolverine's cameo in the film just might be the best written scene with Wolvie in 16 years. He's fast, looks the part, and is brutally violent, with more blood spilled in one scene than the rest of the X-Men movies combined, a sneak preview at what's to come in next year's R- rated Wolverine movie. Along with Oscar Issac's spectacular portrayal of Apocalypse, and another wildly entertaining performance by Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the majority of the cast and their characters are done very well and are highly entertaining.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't the best film in this franchise, or arguably not even in the top 3 of films (Days of Future Past, X2 and First Class), but that doesn't mean it's not a great film. Yes, there are some inconsistencies in the pacing of the film, some criminally underused characters and a lack of overall development for those characters and the continuing growth of their arcs, and the X-Men franchise at large. However, those flaws cannot hold the film back from telling an engaging immediate story with plenty of humor, showcasing some exciting, occasionally grand action scenes, or having a huge roster of characters played extremely well by every one of their actors, with special recognition to Oscar Issac, Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the last scene of the film, which is arguably the best. It pays homage to the Bronze Age of comic books, includes terrific fan service and teases the future of the franchise. Even with consistent pressure from fans to return the X-Men film rights back to Marvel Studios and the MCU, Fox and director Bryan Singer continue to prove the doubters wrong with another great entry into the epic X-Men universe.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's fine, but not great.","I read a lot of people shouting why the other person is wrong. Which leaves me in doubt about people scoring 10 and other people scoring very low.... and basically the reason why I'm writing this review.I went to the cinema yesterday and I've a HUGE fan of anything with Marvel since I was 10 years old and that is 30+ years ago. I know all stories, read all comic etc. BUT a movie is not a comic... it can and never will be. Upfront I'm very positive towards this kinds of films.Looking at this film and comparing it with ""days of future past"" it's a lot less.... Is it a bad movie?? no, I will watch it again for sure. But is it a great movie?? no..... I walked away discussing right after the movie asking myself it if was good... and I couldn't say yes.... In my opinion it was just to much going on while personalities had not enough depth to make it work... The start of the film felt way to slow, while in the end it was nearly blowing up the screen and it was hard to catch up on what was going on.Yes the movie was nice, but not nearly as good as the previous movie, so everyone giving this a 10, I have a hard time to understand that...because you cannot score a 12 for ""days for future past"". And lets me honest that it was plot, story and movie wise a LOT better movie...It's a fine movie, but simply not great...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Perfect adaptation from the age old cartoon,"This movie met and exceeded my every expectation for the Apocalypse villain story-line. I only had vague memories of the cartoon but this movie amplified them to a new extreme. And my one stipulation, that Apocalypse be, by far, the strongest and most bad-ass mutant ever but still with a rational plan and an undeterable love of his mutant brethren, was easily satisfied. The one thing I remember thinking, about halfway through the movie, is this going to be a two-parter? But whether or not that is the case this movie ended with no disappointments. And if you like the movie and the X-men mythos you'll want to stay through the end of the credits because there is a little bit that implies what the next story-line will be about.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than expected with an unremarkable villain (7/10),"I didn't have high expectations from this movie. Amidst all the grandeur marketing for other superhero movies like Civil War and Batman v Superman, this movie had the lesser share of anticipation from the fans, which could be attributed to the fact that the trailers were quite dreary and uninspiring. Also, the movie currently holds a score of 47% approval on Rotten Tomatoes. So, critics seem to be divided on this one. That being said, I have stopped taking Rotten Tomatoes seriously ever since Furious 7 got a score of 81%I should mention that Days of Future past is one of my all time favourite superhero movies and was unanimously praised by fans and critics, so in this movie's defense, it was a tough act to follow.Possible spoilers up ahead!THE GOOD: Quicksilver: Quicksilver was one of the highlights of Days of Future Past, and the tradition carries over to this one as well. He has one incredible action scene, where he showcases the full extent of his powers. Pretty much the best part of the movie, if you ask me.The New Mutants: I really enjoyed the introduction of the new mutants like Jean Gray, Cyclops and Nightcrawler. This is a new iteration of these familiar characters from the first few X-Men films. The performances of the new actors are reminiscent of the previous films, yet stand out in their own way.Sophie Turner as Jean Gray was probably the best one of them all. She plays a conflicted yet incredibly powerful mutant, scared of her own abilities and I can't wait to see her in the future X-Men movies.Professor X and Magneto: James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are phenomenal actors and as you would expect, they continue to give brilliant performances as Professor X and Erik Lehnsherr.However, we didn't get to see a fleshed out ideological conflict between them, something which was one of the best parts of the last two films.Opening Scene: The first scene takes place in ancient Egypt where we get our first glimpse at Apocalypse, and his four mighty horsemen which kicks off the movie really well.Bizarre Mind Tripping Action Scenes: There are a few bizarre and trippy action scenes involving Professor X and Apocalypse, which I thought was a refreshing break from the usual CGI heavy climactic action scenes in summer tentpole movies. Keep an eye out for that.THE MEDIOCRE: Apocalypse: Apocalypse was unsurprisingly mediocre. The main problem with him was that his motivations didn't add up. For someone who is the titular character of the film, he just seemed like another bad guy with another clichéd world domination plan. I wish the movie could have done a better job explaining his actions. Why does he want to cleanse the world? If he has been doing this since the past several thousand years, it seems he's pretty bad at it, cause he's been unsuccessful at creating a better world every single time.Also, I wish they could have made him a bit more physically intimidating. There are several scenes where he is standing alongside the other female mutants, he is just as tall as them. They should have done the trick used in 300, and made him look like a 7 feet giant which would have definitely transformed his screen presence for the better.Perhaps the thing that somewhat saves this character from becoming any worse is his voice and Oscar Isaac's performance. This could have been a really cool character, and I really wish the writers could have done a better job with him.Psylocke: Psylocke is one of Apocalype's four horsemen portrayed by Olivia Munn, a character I was really excited to see, but sadly she didn't get the time to shine. She remained largely stoic and didn't get to say even a single dialogue in the entire film which is the consequence of juggling a plethora of characters in a 2 hour movie. I think Munn was trying to do the best, with what she was given, but the character just wasn't written well. It could have been any other XYZ villain, and that wouldn't have made a tad bit difference to the overall plot.TLDR: This is my score a few hours after the first viewing. It could change after the second viewing however.Final Verdict: 7.1/10It's a fun action movie with a stellar cast and lackluster villain. If you are expecting another Days of Future Past, you will be disappointed, but in its own merit X-Men: Apocalypse is a good time at the movies.P.S. There is a after credit scene which teases the antagonists of the future X-Men movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Don't listen to the critics,"The X Men series has had it's share of ups and downs, from the highs (The brilliant X2 and Days of Future Past) to the forgettable (Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine). Presumably the last film for returning director Brian Singer, the series will no doubt continue on without it's creator, but it's hard to see the quality continue to be this good following his departure.The cast is excellent. Returning Michael Fassbender as Magneto is even better, because he has more to do than in DoFP. Despite the title, this film is more about Magneto than Apocalypse. Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse was fantastic, it's rare that I find a comic book villain genuinely intimidating. Likewise McAvoy as Professor Charles Xavier faces his biggest challenge yet.I loved how the ending brought the series full circle, even if X Men and X2 now make no sense if you watch them straight after Apocalypse. Even with the time traveling shenanigans of Days of Future Past changing events, Nightcrawler's introduction makes no sense compared to his appearance in X2, and Alexandra Shipp's Storm looks and sounds nothing like Halle Berry. But considering the lukewarm reception to Berry's portrayal, maybe that's for the best. And considering that the timelines and character changes are at this point so convoluted that Deadpool is now making meta jokes (""McAvoy or Stewart?""), perhaps it's best not to get too wound up about the whole timeline thing.This is minor carping though. The action and special effects are top notch, and Evan Peters steals the show with another crowd pleasing Quicksilver scene. My second favorite comic book movie this year, bested only by Captain America: Civil War. Kudos, Brian Singer, once again, you have taken this series to another level.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It would be a lie to say it wasn't entertaining,"Greetings from Lithuania.To my surprise (after reading some pretty bad reviews from critics) - i had a pretty good time watching ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016). Because i'm not a fan, i was pretty lost at the beginning - although seeing all movies in the series i wasn't even sure what time line are we in it this time - its because previous film was so forgettable, i wasn't even sure what was going on in the beginning, when all of these x-men started to pop in on screen - like ""wait - wasn't he or she a villain in some previous whatever it was movie?"" Wasn't' he or she killed? Oh wait, this is a prequel. To a sequel? Wait, what?About the best thing in this movie - with every performance of a brilliant Oscar Isaac i witness, the more i believe this man will hold Oscar statue pretty soon - it's just a question of when. Although under heavy make-up and costume, he was a superbly cool villain in my opinion, who just FELT as a total bad ass of bad asses - surely some better lines for him wouldn't have hurt, script isn't strongest in this movie, but it not bad at all either. Others were pretty good, but none of them really shined.Overall, to be short as possible and honest, i'm not a fan of ""X- Men"" nor other Marvel superheroes. But it would be a lie to say i wasn't entertained for like 2 h 15 min. watching ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016). It has lots of special effects, and they were solid. It also has pretty cool scene in the middle, when someone gets to save someone - nice stuff. Film also had a nicely paced plot, although there is a lot of going on in this movie, A LOT - it was nicely paced and i wasn't bored nor i lost my interest in watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Move over DC and Marvel, it's X-Men time!","After yawning my way through Batman vs Superman (even though I'm a huge Batman fan) and really not caring much for Civil War, I finally got the chance to see the new X-Men effort.Now, I'm as disappointed as anyone that the X-Men are no longer a part of the Marvel universe. But that doesn't mean FOX doesn't know what they're doing. This movie shows that they do, actually, have a clue.They're getting new actors on board, preparing the universe for the future through the plot and making sure X-Men is going to stay a unique brand in the superhero line-up.Oh, and it's an enjoyable movie, too.Comparing Apocalypse to the above mentioned BvS and Civil War, Apocalypse was the first movie that felt like it had normal pacing (I nearly fell asleep during BvS and Civil War was also very boring at times), a good plot (both BvS and Civil War used the same mechanism in their plots and you see it coming from miles away) and actors that seemed invested in their roles.Concerning the actors, don't get me wrong: I loved Ben Affleck as Bats, but I didn't like what they did with the character. Same goes for Supes. As for Marvel, ever since Avengers 1 they seem at a loss what to do with multiple characters in a movie.Not so for X-Men, because I felt it handled the larger cast pretty well. A couple of roles absolutely do not get as much screen time, but for the most part I felt everyone played their part.What I liked best about it was that the movie wasn't afraid to actually use their powers, as ""imbalanced"" as they may seem at times (but they're not and each power displayed runs into checks and balances, that was well done).Nightcrawler is teleporting people all the time, Quicksilver goes bullet-time at times when it's actually useful... sometimes superhero movies make you feel like: ""Why didn't they just...?"" but not this one.I mentioned actors invested in their roles. Here's what I like about Apocalypse in that regard: FOX is like a football team realizing their players are getting older and that they need to start looking at the future.It's not just age, either. It's the eagerness with which actors get involved and, not to forget, our willingness to see them in certain roles. I don't know about you, but a new Thor and a new Captain America are two changes in the Marvel lineup I'm looking forward to.Heck, my favorite two things about Civil War were Spidey and Black Panther, a refreshing new set of heroes and actors!Where Days of Future Past introduced new actors, Apocalypse continues this trend and I feel like they ""bought"" the right players. Up-and-coming actors that nevertheless have enough star power to last through the next set of movies.I enjoyed Nightcrawler, Jean and Scott very much. Storm and Psylocke did't get enough screen time for me to make a judgment.And of course there's still James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender acting the sh*t out of their parts. Compare these performances to Downey Jr and Evans in Civil War (I would those performances ""tired"") and you'll see what I mean.Coming in to land, it's not Apocalypse had the most original plot or was full of things you hadn't seem before. But it was executed well and I actually cared about the characters: that's a feeling I find myself increasingly lacking with modern movies.All in all, if you haven't seen it because of the bad reviews: go ahead and invest those 2+ hours, they're well spent.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not the best but its a great one,"X-Men: Apocalypse, the mutant spectacle that unfolds with apocalyptic grandeur, lands a solid 7/10 in my cinematic saga-an ode to its magnetic performances and visually stunning set pieces. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender bring emotional depth to their roles, grounding the film amidst the cosmic chaos. The film's strength lies in its epic scale and the introduction of powerful mutants, each with their own dazzling abilities. While the plot's ambition occasionally leads to a crowded narrative, the editing navigates the complex storyline with commendable finesse. The musical score, a symphony of heroism and turmoil, adds a sonic layer that amplifies the stakes. Cinematography captures the mutant battles with a dynamic flair, showcasing the awe-inspiring spectacle of their powers.

A good sequel but not the best,"I am gonna say that the movie was somehow up-to-the-mark. Bryan Singer's Days of Future was able to capture the mutant magic much flawlessly which according to me made it the best X- Men movie till date. Yet this sequel wasn't able to do so . The plot was a bit haphazard, as there are many interlinked stories in them, overstaffed with so many things yet highly entertaining. I seriously missed proper interaction between the characters. Screen time for a few characters (AM NOT GONNA NAME THEM) could have been increased. Now coming towards the positive side, I must say that the actors gave real effort even when there was no proper chance of acting. As usual the VFX was rather outstanding. The most positive factor of the movie is the 3D. X- Men Apocalypse was filmed with 3D cameras resulting in superb 3D visuals. From the Opening Titles till the End Credits, you feel as if you are really there which I simply missed in Marvel's Captain America Civil War.Lastly I must say that X-Men Apocalypse is highly entertaining and watchable even with some serious flaws and plot holes (I AM NOT GONNA SPOIL). According to me, I advise y'all guys to watch, cause its worthy.P.S - Don't' compare it with X- Men Days of Future while watching cause DOFP is the greatest.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best Action Movie Since TFA,"I won't argue with the Comic book purists who complain about the deviations from the comics, except to say that the deviation(s) happened in XM:FC. They have followed through with the story-line they started in First Class. I understand those who don't like the sometimes good(or flip-flopping) Magneto and Mystique, but it's been that way since FC. The characters have been written/portrayed consistently IMO.I'm not a comic-book guy - I just wanted to good, entertaining film. And IMO - it delivers and then some, AND THEN SOME MORE! I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It doesn't have that bad start that BvS has, and it doesn't have the bad ending that CA:CW has. It is emotional and intense from start to finish. The story-line from FC through DOFP to Apocalypse has been consistent and compelling IMO. This is a fantastic conclusion to the trilogy.It does seem to me that there's now a heavily entrenched bandwagon paradigm(among fans and critics alike) that anything from Disney/Marvel is an instant classic when announced, but anything from any other studio is trash before it is even done with post production.

Lacking Substance,"What made the first two ""reboot"" X-Men films so engaging? The simple answer is the relationship between Charles and Erik. Unfortunately, in this film, the two characters hardly share any screen time and the lack of chemistry is felt. The plot is so grandiose and convoluted that it distracts from the heart of the franchise.On the positive side, the opening sequence was great (they always are with the X-Men films), this version of Scott Summers runs circles around James Marsden, and any scene with Quicksilver was wildly entertaining.I enjoyed diving into a different side of Erik, but the new life felt a little too reminiscent of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I also enjoyed seeing Charles transition into Professor X, however, the filmmakers made his personality a little too goofy at times.With a villain that lacked relatability and a final act that dragged on, this film is forgettable and underwhelming.Additional Note: Why does everyone have the power to make things float? It minimizes the intensity when so many mutants do the same thing.Additional Note 2: I HATED Jennifer Lawrence's forget everything speech at the end... HATED it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tops the previous one in every way possible. This series is close to as brilliant and classic as the Dark Knight trilogy.,"""Some believe that the first mutant was born thousands of years ago. He was some kind of god, and he's going to rise again."" Years after the events of the last movie the X-Men members have gone their own way and are no longer the group they once were. Eric (Fassbender) is living life quietly in Poland with a wife and daughter. Charles is still running the school and training new students every day. Things are going smooth until an ancient evil is awoken and the future of the world is threatened. Once again the X-Men must band together to save the world, but this time things get complicated because Eric is fighting against them. After watching Days of Future Past I said that they should end this franchise. The time line aspect was so perfectly done and I felt that any further movie would ruin what was done. I have really like the Newer X-Men movies and even though I thought they shouldn't have made more I still went to see this one. Once again I have to admit that I was wrong. I loved First Class and didn't know how they could do better, and they did with Days of Future Past. This one tops both of those as well. The movie is funny, tense, has a strong grip on reality while still being a comic book movie. The cast is so perfect in this and the new additions are seamlessly added and really add to the feel and excitement. It is very hard for a series to consistently top itself but this one pulls it off perfectly. The sequel curse seems to be missing this series all together. Do yourself a favor and watch this today. Overall, once again, this movie tops the previous one in every way possible. This series is close to as brilliant and classic as Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. I give this an A+.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A movie with limited magnetic attraction.,"On the day that Britain voted to leave the European Union it feels fairly appropriate to review a film with ""Apocalypse"" in the title. For me the X-Men films have always been in the 'see if I have the time' category: mildly diverting but largely forgettable. And X-Man: Apocalypse, the third in the ""prequel"" series, has a forgettability half-life significantly shorter.Starting in Mummy-esque fashion in ancient Egypt, the evil super- mutant En Sabah Nur (an almost unrecognizable Oscar Isaac) arranges for his soul to go hopping around from old mutant body to new mutant body to gather a smorgasbord of powers. In mid-hop he is brought down to earth (literally) and buried alive for several thousand years before being awoken. This happens in 1983 when CIA agent Moira Mactaggert (Rose Byrne) – thrillingly for me channelling an Indiana Jones vibe so long missing from our screens – leaves a rug-covered hole uncovered (no, seriously, I'm not making this up) and unleashes the beast. With a need to gather around him his 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' En Sabah Nur chooses the four most talented mutants (ed: read, the first four he comes across!), one of which is Eric Lehnsherr (aka Magneto, Michael Fassbender) who's in the midst of having his own 'mare of a day. Literally everyone on the planet gets progressively involved until the story builds to a huge showdown in modern day Cairo.Let's start with the positives. It's watchable and has a few high- points worthy of note. In particular, the scene where Quicksilver (Evan Peters) saves Xavier's students (plus dog and fish) from an ongoing massive blast is just hugely entertaining. And most of the acting (as you might expect from the calibre of the cast) is excellent: Michael Fassbinder; James McAvoy; Nicholas Hoult; Jennifer Lawrence and Rose Byrne all carry their parts extremely well. (I'm sure Oscar Isaac is his normal superb acting self under all of that latex, but it is almost impossible to tell). Also of note is young English Saoirse Ronan lookalike Sophie Turner (replacing Famke Janssen in playing Jean Gray).Where the film irritates though is in some lazy plotting and tangential and unnecessary diversions in Simon Kinberg's screenplay, adding to an already overlong running time. As a specific point, and while not as snort-worthyly derisive as the 'Martha-gate' scene from Batman vs Superman, there are at least a couple of allegiance switcheroos in this film that are just thoroughly unconvincing. More fundamentally, if you were pushed to say in 10 words or less what this film was about you would struggle to come up more that ""Bad guy rises and needs defeating"". None of the underlying social and racial tensions of the human/mutant struggle that made the previous films more sociologically interesting, are really of any relevance within this story.Also of enormous irritation to me is the blatant science abuse going on. Without giving too much of the plot away, there is massive magnetic disturbance to the earth that has highly selective effects: an office building is ripped apart (presumably that's the effect of tens of thousands of staples and paper clips fighting to get out?) and yet the metal bridge next to it just suffers some minor damage; a shipwreck rises from the sea bed into the sky, and yet this is all observed from an unaffected ship on the surface; and the X-Men fly into the very heart of the disturbance in a plane – – presumably one made of Tupperware or similar? Come on scriptwriters of the world – employ some decent science advisors! (It's not as if science geeks go to watch these sorts of films or anything!)As a final concern, the film depicts the casual total destruction – note: NOT the mild glazing damage meted out to Metropolis of Gotham TOTAL destruction – of Cairo and presumably the majority of its 7.7 million residents, all without pause for a flicker of concern or grief from any of the characters. Would this be acceptable if this was London, Chicago or LA? Or is it OK in the current climate because 90% of Egyptians are Moslem? I would seriously like to think not, but for me this left a bad taste in the mouth.The director is series director Bryan Singer. My message to him is that if this is the best you can do, it's time to send this pony to the retirement farm.On leaving a showing of ""The Return of the Jedi"", Jean Grey comments to her colleagues ""At Least we can all agree the third (film) is always the worst"": never a truer word spoken in jest.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

Go.See.This.Movie,"Let me start by saying I've never written a review before, despite being a total movie junkie and a regular here on IMDb, just so you know HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS MOVIE..I tried to avoid any trailers, reviews, promos and interviews for this movie because I loved Days of Future Past (DoFP) so much I honestly believed nothing could top it so I kept my expectations to a minimum. Thank God I did. This movie cannot be described using just words, I give it 10/10 for literally EVERYTHING. It had me sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time, so let's get started.In the year 1983, ten years after the events of DoFP, we get a glimpse of the 'X-men' we know and love from the first three movies; first we see how the main characters, Charles, Eric, Raven (...etc), have been growing into them, and then are reintroduced to several familiar mutants, Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm and NightCrawler (...etc) Now I really don't want to give anything away so let's just say the rest of the film takes you with them on an epic mission to save the world.Cast: I can't stress how much this cast excels at delivering all the emotional scenes with grace and simultaneously kicking-ass in the action-based ones. A few standouts to me were Michael Fassbenders' captivating portrayal of the ever-so-complicated Magneto (yet again) reminding us all why he was nominated for two Oscars, James McAvoy once again shines of compassion and wisdom as Charles Xavier, but takes his vulnerability and fear to the next level in this one, Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse was original and truly the ultimate villain, he's everything you hope for and more, Evan Peters doesn't disappoint as the funny Quicksilver, and is more than a comic relief this time, Sophie Turner did a great job playing Jean Grey; beautifully embodying her inhibition and quiet intelligence...what can I say the whole cast is phenomenal.Story and structure: The movie has so many elements and layers yet its surprisingly easy to follow, it starts off with a lot of different character story lines that all intertwine eventually. The story line kind of resembles DoFP in terms of giving you what you expect but also throwing in bits and bobs that you weren't expecting, keeping your eyes open. Clearly it was so carefully, well-edited to ensure you gain the most out of every little detail. Although there are a lot of X-men First Class flashbacks, you will be able to understand the film, but probably not appreciate as much, so I would recommend seeing that first.Cinematography and Music: Now this is why you see superhero movies in the cinema; to get the ultimate experience from all the action and excitement. Let me tell you there's a lot of CGI, but it's very well done, after all how can you create such an epic, literally 'end of the world' movie without a little bit of digital magic?In all honestly, I did not write this review to convince people to see this movie, even though they should, I wrote it out of pure love and appreciation for it; I couldn't stop thinking about how great it was, in fact if I were you I'd stop reading reviews and just go see the damn thing :)",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A real comic book movie.,"I was recently blown away by Bryan Singer's new X-men movie. As an longtime avid comic book reader it is easy to see that Singer has a real handle on comic book story telling.The first act does a great job of truly giving more depth and understanding to multiple characters. It made me glassy eyed on multiple times, and giving me chills on others.The second act, was fun and action packed. It had me on the edge of my seat.The last act, although not bad was definitely nowhere near as good as the first two portions of the title. The big bad is not a real threat, and so when the big guns are brought out it seems unwarranted. If they had done a better job of building up the villain I would have said that this was a perfect comic book film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good for one time watch!,"After watching X-MEN: Days of Future past,I had high hopes on this one and it was a good first time watch.
As I said before Days of Future Past was a gem and I could watch it any number of times and still be entertained,but this movie doesn't quite feel that way for reasons below:
1.Too much drama between scenes.
2.Too much talk and less action done.
3.Predictable plot.
Then again it had few memorable moments,some being funny and others emotional,both of which I loved.
Also I don't know why but after watching Dark Phoenix and Apocalypse it feels like ,they just made this movie to set up X-MEN for X-Men:Dark Phoenix.
In simple terms its good and is on par with X-Men: FIRST CLASS,but doesn't even come close to X-Men: Days of Future Past and Dark Phoenix.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just as good as Days Of Future Past- can't wait to see what happens next,"On Saturday, I went with a friend to go see X-Men: Apocalypse because I needed to spend some time out of the house and with my friend I haven't seen in a while. I did see DOFP in the cinema as well and I highly enjoyed that one, although I don't remember much about it other than that fantastic Quiksilver scene and the ending, and I highly enjoyed this one as well! What makes this X-Men interesting is that it revolves around different themes and other items in storytelling than in most superhero films released in this day and age, and for some, it might be easy to confuse or frustrate. But I appreciate this new brand of storytelling in this film, I think what any comic book movie should do is make you think to make it unique in its own way, and this film does that to make it something genuinely special. Oh, by the way- Oscar Isaac NAILED it as Apocalypse, he's so intimidating to the point where I would watch it solely because of him! And although all of the action sequences are so much fun, there are two of them that stole the entire movie for me- if you thought Quiksilver's scene in DOFP was amazing, you ain't seen nothing yet! I'm already seeing this movie again in the theater, and I honestly think it's that level of worthy! Also, I did see this in 3D, and although it doesn't add much to the movie's quality, the added depth does look nice in a lot of certain set-pieces, so if you love 3D, then you'll probably get a kick out of this one, and I thought it looked cool enough, so whether you watch it in 2D or 3D, this movie's a lot of fun all around.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A bit disappointing,"After having two fantastic X-men movies with first class, and days of future past, this one had a lot of expectations that it couldnt fullfill. The movie I dont think its bad, but its a downgrade compared to the others. It repeats the same storyline as other movies, some new characters barely have anything to do other than fight, some dialoge is very weird, and there are enough plot holes and conveniences for people to notice.

One of the best x-men movies,"The movie gave everything I expected from it, and more.

They add more character like psylocke, angle, young storm, young jean grey, nightcrawler, jubille and many more The most favourite one for me is quicksilver he's awesome and apocalypse is really awesome too. I think the old x-men franchise is not part of the new universe, because they changed character origins tooIf you want to watch this movie you have to watch x-men first class and x-men days of future past.

An Honest Review,"It's about time to hand things over to the MCU. Cut the cord. It died after The Last Stand and, despite all probability, they were able to pull it out of the ashes with a Reboot that left even consonant reboot haters like me with little to complain about.The pulled the X-Men out of the trash heap with First Class and in an act that was deft and as smart and stylistic as anyone could hope. They even exceeded expectation for the rebooted franchise when they brought Singer back for Days of Future Past.But then, Days of Future Past was hard to top, Chris Claremont's best and a legend for most comic nerds like me.But lightening rarely strikes twice and never thrice.Apocalypse just hurt.There is a part of the population, or at least a small segment at my local comic book store that assumed that they were just doing comic book arcs. The same segment that heard it was originally going to be titled Age of Apocalypse and assumed it would be, well, the epic late 90s Age of Apocalypse arc.Why not? They did the same with Days of Future Past. It was certainly a safe bet and really one of the best X-Men arcs that didn't have Claremont's involvement. If not that than X-Cutioners song had heavy Apocalypse involvement, or even the earlier X-Factor arc when Angel turned into Archangel.But the latter was a stretch, I mean, they already introduced Angel in The Last Stand.However, that is EXACTLY what they did, and with it they sort of destroyed the brilliant way the rebooted the franchise and left the audience with that ""uh"" feeling.All the hard work they took to establish a dual continuity between the past and future parts of the franchise was flushed down the toilet.It was rewritten. Angel, Nightcrawler, and Stryker, they were all back and totally out of continuity. And then, on the other side, Jubilee, Psylocke, and Caliban were introduced completely out of character.For the people that were paying attention to the franchise we felt robbed a reboot within a reboot and this time done exactly wrong. For the people the read the comics, again, robbed.1983 in a world that didn't feel like 1983 after the franchise did so well getting the feel of the 60s and 70s in the former installments. this 83 felt like any given sci-fi action movie setting.And then the Big Bad, Apocalypse who was so brilliantly Ayn Rand style nasty in the comics felt like an ant to the established and worn down villain Magneto. It was almost like they didn't know how to write him, couldn't be bothered to read more than the cliff notes and fell back on what they already knew.In the end, what killed Apocalypse and the entire franchise wasn't the indecisiveness that killed it in The Last Stand, this time the death came with plain lazy writing. Laziness killed Apocalypse.But hey, at least you get to see more Quicksilver...not the one from the comics, the depiction in Altron was a bit closer to Marvel's character, but still, possibly more entertaining of a character. The singular redeeming factor.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Slow for the first half... Worst script in the whole series,"Don't want to give too much away. So here's the summary:1. The first half of the movie is too slow. I understand the narrative and all. But it was like the story of Eric and the story of En Sabah Nur are from different movie. Somehow they mixed these two stories together, along with the bits of X-Men. So it didn't come out as smooth as it supposed to be for Bryan Singer's movie.2. Way too easy on recruiting/finding four horsemen. Did it mean any first 4 mutants will be the chosen ones? It looks that way.3. I'm not sure if Psylocke has any line in the whole movie. Her power looks awesome. But she's the only one wearing skimpy outfit, while the others wear armor.... sexy, I know. But it seems strange.4. Wolverine as a special guest. Great fight scene though.5. This one is a little disappointing affair for fan of Bryan Singer like me.But it was X-Men. No matter how bad or good people say about it, you'll watch it anyway. So judge it yourself. For me I'd give it 6.5 stars. But there's no half point here. So 7 it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Its not amazing, but the critics were too harsh.","This was actually my first time watching an X-men movie. I never seemed to be interested in the movie series from X-men 2000 to X-men Days of Future past. But like Captain America Civil War, (which is a great super hero movie, a must see) I once again chose to see this over the Angry Birds movie. But that's not the point. I came in with low expectations, expecting it to be only a little better than 2015s non MCU Marvel film Fantastic 4 (which is underrated, but still not good). But I actually found it quite good. Here's why:I found the story in it a rather interesting story that puts you close to the edge of the seat. It includes very funny humor, backstory that doesn't fall at a boring level, and intense , but riveting action scenes. One issue is that the bland characters (which I will get into) gives this interesting story a stale and bland side, but that still doesn't destroy this riveting action movie, Like I said, the characters in the movie are mostly bland, but with little exception. Charles Xavier, for instance is like Nick Fury from MCU films, but he lacks big personality. Raven is also a pretty bland character, and I think the writers /directors could've used the character and Jennifer Lawerence better. But some exceptions are some comic reliefs that are actually funny, and provide most of the great humor the movie has to offer. The villain Apocalypse, lacks a big villain build up, and lacks a personality, but he does have great reasoning for being a villain. In fact, it may b a character a lot of people could possibly root for.So overall, I think that this film is worth your time with Great special effects that look very believable in it's effort, and a great story and humor. It's not as good as Civil War, but it's fun exciting and exciting, trust me.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Petty movie with telenovela quality,"I know that I can't expect a masterpiece when watching superhero action movies. But X- Men Apocalypse was really hard to consume.OK... the X-Men story was always predictable. But this time the whole plot seems to be a confused mix of sequels from the other movies. Most of the activities and decisions of the people in this movie are not comprehensible and incomplete. Plus there are several illogical cuts.But the worst is the directing part. In total you see people talking for about one hour. Mostly about negligible stuff mixed with some pseudo philosophic phrases. But it seems to me that Bryan Singer knows only one camera perspective for dialogues. Flat shots to the face. No shadows, no blur, no acting. From time to time these scenes are interrupted by cheap and incongruous cgi action. Bryan Singer restricts the acting so systematic that even Michael Fassbender looks pale. Weather he is not trusting the actors or he just hates what he is doing.There is no need to do directing, producing writing and acting all together. Hollywood is full of professional directors, writers, and actors. Please let em do their jobs.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Prepared too long for the final fight, yet the final fight is too short","The first half of the movie is very very very very long. The director prepared a lot for the final boss fight, that it's even a little boring at the end, but the ""boss"" fight is not exciting enough. Personally, I think the boss is not powerful enough to deliver enough visual effects. They should shrink the preparation part and focus more on final boss fight. Still, the quality of this movie is great, while it is not a 10/10, it deserves a solid 8 to 8.5 IMO.Those who were confusing about the X Man original 3 movies can find most of their questions answered here in this movie.

World Domination Old Hat,"Comic book-wise, X-Men has always been my favorite. I was introduced to them at a very young age and have always been a fan. Movie-wise, X-Men are starting to fade. Still better than most movies but no longer able to keep up with the high bar set by other movies in the MCU. There are only so many huge and cataclysmic events that can be foiled before it becomes routine. As a quote I read once stated: ""If miracles happened everyday they wouldn't be miracles.""The nemesis of choice in this movie was Apocalypse and his goal: world domination (of course). Along with Apocalypse we were introduced to some new characters (Psylocke and Jubilee) and reintroduced to a couple of other characters (Storm, Angel, Cyclops, Jean Gray and Nightcrawler). The point in showing any character should be for displaying his/her skill set. Since the majority of the characters had already been seen at one time or another between X-Men (back in 2000) and X-Men: Apocalypse there were no real surprises with what the characters could do. If any character made me giddy it would've been Quicksilver and the demonstration of his abilities.Besides the rehashing of characters the story wasn't that compelling. Apocalypse claims to be God and wants to dominate the Earth. He frequently references himself as a deity and refers to mutants as his children. It was overly dramatic and unoriginal. I don't know if this movie is the last of the X-Men before being laid to rest but if it isn't; they need to dig deep for the next installment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men: Apocalypse (2016),"The superhero genre has gone through dramatic changes since Bryan Singer directed ""X-Men"" in 2000, and now finds itself in a precarious place. The city-level destruction that characterizes so many third acts has become visually rote and morally abhorrent. And how many more movies can we handle about white men given great power who churn out jokes and punches with equal aplomb? The genre desperately needs to diversify not just in terms of race and gender but also the kinds of stories on which filmmakers choose to focus. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" should be a corrective measure, considering its ensemble allows for the opportunity to focus on popular female and people-of-color characters. Instead, it magnifies all the worst issues of the genre, serving up a story that would have felt dated five years ago.""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is a confused, bloated mess of a film. There are several films crammed into one, all battling for the spotlight, and none of them wholly work; there is really no central story-line or heart to the film. The first hour is almost entirely in service of setting up new players and establishing what the veterans are up to. Charles Xavier/Professor X (James McAvoy) is successfully running his school for mutant kids. Raven Darkholme/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is rescuing mutants, including the walking punchline Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) on her own, and struggling with being seen as a hero. Then there are the teen-aged Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) who are struggling to cope with their powers and fledgling attraction to each other. Sheridan and Turner seem to actually be enjoying themselves but their development staggers under the weight of everything else going on around them; Jean grappling with the dark side of her abilities is especially fertile ground. One of the few evocative scenes involves her having a nightmare which rocks the school and burns the walls of her room before Xavier comforts her. Even though she gets a big hero moment at the end, it doesn't land well, given how poorly she's developed. Singer doesn't offer the scant interesting moments enough room to breathe. He's too interested in hurtling to the next plot point, the next introduction, the next fight scene.The greatest sin of ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" by far is how terribly it wastes some of the greatest modern actors.Michael Fassbender can't give Magneto's story-line the emotional depth it needs. But could any actor distract from how that story-line embodies the most onerous clichéd in regards to the treatment of women in comics? How many more wives and daughters will be killed in these kinds of films in order to give a male lead some angst?As the movie's world-destroying, god-like mutant, Oscar Isaac struggles to make Apocalypse even the least bit menacing. How can an actor as charismatic and dynamic as Isaac feel so torpid here? The failure to make Apocalypse engaging is mostly the fault of Simon Kinberg's script. These operatic, world-destroying villains don't seem to work on- screen as they do in comics. Their motivations are— at best—confusing and nonsensical. They seem so disconnected from the world the heroes move through that they almost exist in entirely different films. Perhaps, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" also exhibits the worst traits of these sort of stories in the comics, which can be damnably inert, nihilistic, and overcrowded on their own, before even being adapted for the screen. Despite Apocalypse's backstory and grandstanding, he spends more time imbuing his Four Horseman with power than wielding his own.The rest of Apocalypse's team are the smug yet forgettable Angel (Ben Hardy), Psylocke (Olivia Munn) and a young Storm (Alexandra Shipp). None of these characters are all that interesting but Psylocke and Storm embody the ways this entire series has failed its female characters; Psylocke is such a one-dimensional villain she seems two steps away from twirling a mustache. Singer and Kinberg are seemingly incapable of developing more than one female character at a time.There's also something deeply troubling about a series that trades in the language and ideas of the Civil Rights Movement without caring one iota about its characters of color. Storm is once again given very little to do. She has none of the emotional inferiority, swagger or complexity of her comic counterpart. Jubilee (Lana Condor) is such a non-factor she could be taken out entirely and nothing would change. Raven and Jean are slightly better served, but Jean's development is too inconsistent to leave much of an impact. Raven comes off far worse due to Lawrence's obvious disinterest in the role, coasting from scene to scene with none of her trademark charisma. When Raven reverts to her natural blue form (which is probably one of the worst translations of a character from page to screen in modern comic book films) her performance somehow becomes even more non-engaging.While much has been made about how superhero films rely on the destruction of cities in order to make the stakes higher for heroes, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" takes this idea to the next level with startling violence. It isn't just one city that hangs in the balance, it's the entire world. The destruction in the third act is so wide-ranging, so cataclysmic, that it zaps the film of any tension. There is no sense of danger here, only the distinct feeling that nearly everyone involved is counting down the minutes until this whole affair is over.There is one scene involving the surprisingly fun Quicksilver (Evan Peters) that gives ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" one of its only visually interesting moments. He uses his super-speed to traverse through Xavier's school saving people from an explosion, as set to ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" by The Eurythmics—a confounding music choice, to say the least. Singer finds some physical humor and levity in Quicksilver's ingenious ways of saving everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
not up to my expectations,I never reviewed a movie before and I am not reviewing this one either.I just feel that I am obligated as an Egyptian living in Cairo to say that we're not like we were depicted in the film not in the 80s not 200 years ago. It was kind of hilarious actually.I wish that this false picture is not taken seriously by viewers who don't know much about Egypt.I understand that it's a fantasy and science fiction movie so it doesn't have to be real but it is really annoying to be represented in this way.Other than that I think the movie was pretty enjoyable and entertaining and I would've enjoyed it more If I were from Colombia or something.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An epic film and a fitting tribute to the comic,"I really really really enjoyed this movie, I remember sitting in the cinema watching it thinking ""I need to watch this again, quickly!"" This was a roller-coaster of film which did justice to both the comic world and the world of film, and that's something I haven't said about other comic inspired films much. This is the best of the X-Men films, even better than ""Days of Future Past"" which took some doing, because that was previously the best of them. If I'm honest, the reboot/ new timeline has done the X-Men franchise the world of good, the films are bigger, better and darker - something the X-Men definitely deserves. I personally think they are partly responsible for the success the current MCU and DCU are having. This is the 4th superhero/comic film of the year, I personally think this is better than ""Batman vs Superman"" and ""Cpt. America: Civil War"". As an immersing spectacle to tantalize the senses this is on par, for me, with the ""Deadpool"" film, and I really enjoyed that, but for different reasons. The film was set in the 80's and delivers for the actual time period with feelings of fear and nuclear war, as well as the colour and the sound of 80's fashion and popular culture. It also delivers on the feeling of early X-Men comics, fear of mutants and man's need to control them, with characters looking to find and understand themselves and what they are capable of.Brian Singer directs and has used the new timeline created in ""X- Men: Days of Future Past"" to wonderful effects to weave a great story. The film introduces En Sabah Nur, or Apocalypse, the first mutant, woken from a deathly slumber about thousands of years. Events transpire that allow him to enlist his regular 4 horsemen to serve him and bring down humanity. His aim is to cleanse the world of the weak (humans and anyone that opposes him generally) and build the world again with him as it's ruler. Standing in his way are the X-Men, who themselves have journeys and story's unfolding at he same time. I don't want to spoil anything so that's as far as I'm taking the synopsis.The cast is brilliant and believable throughout, not just can they act but as an Englishman it's nice to see a Brit heavy cast delivering sublimely. Established characters as well as new appearances make great showings, nobody seemed out of place here. The emotional variances and deliveries were brilliant throughout, giving you everything from love to tragedy, fear to fascination, comedy to conflict. The action scenes were top notch and suited the characters in the film very well. With each unique character, a different power, and each variant is acted and delivered with class. Sometime the CGI and cabled action shots were a little obvious and overdone, but it was still damn fine eye candy and didn't ruin things. It actually served to offer the comic book physics that I'd expect. The film isn't afraid to set up a story at over two hours but it didn't drag at any point, I couldn't wait for more to happen and I certainly look forward to more X-Men films like this one.

The movie has flaws and some boring moments but overall it was enjoyable.The characters were good and as always Michael Fassbender as Magneto stole the show.  Oscar Issac as apocalypse was good but the problem is that they didn't make him so powerful like the comicsThere's a problem with the story, it didn't have the element of surprise and it was very predictable. It was basically the typical good versus evil type of story.Overall the movie was enjoyable but it could've been better The action sequences  were entertaining and surprisingly the CGI in the movie looked so much better than how it looked in the trailers.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Yawn-men,"To say that the X-men series is one of the most popular Marvel series in the world, this film does not live to the standards in my opinion.4 key points that attracted me to the series in the first place when X-men went mainstream:Character development - Story line - Suspense - ActionI did not see non of that in the new installment. Instead they dragged the film for too long with only very few action scenes.This is X-Men for goodness sake, there should be action and suspense in every single corner of the film!!!I've never fallen asleep in a cinema before... So I guess this shows how engaging the film was to it's viewers. Please note that I was not the only one that fell asleep that day.I'm struggling to keep interested in the series from performances like this.I expected more from this film, hoping it will be as successful as the Avengers series. massive disappointment.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best xmen yet,"I loved days of future past, and so this had a lot to live up too. And yes it did. I don't see many flaws at all in this movie; it has some of the best scenes, great soundtracks, a great villain, and great characters. Jean and Scott are played perfectly, and so is everyone else. Especially Quicksilver, who again has a great part. Don't listen to the other reviews, this movie is amazing. Definitely worth at least seeing a couple times :)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I really wanted to like this,"I'm a huge fan of Marvel, DC etc and loved the previous X-Men films but this one left me scratching my head wondering what happened, it was a 2h24m film of which 2 hours seems to just be talking and the 24 minutes is action.The film, for me, never really seems to get going, my wife actually fell asleep and to be honest I wasn't far behind her but if I had I would have started snoring and cleared the cinema.People will say 'well what exactly were you expecting' - I don't know to be honest but not this :( it reminded me of Civil War really which didn't hit the spot either and BvS Dawn of Justice which was just plain awful.I ended up going home disappointed and deflated in fact I was so down I ended up watching Prometheus again and that's terrible !",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Almost perfect but lack a true superhero,"Everything is exceptional beyond 1) I really miss Hugh Jackman 2) Would have showed more powerful characters, The way villain was built up would have been thumbs up if the hero powers were to be added. 3) Was waiting till the end for Hugh Jackman and was really disappointed .Although its powerful and thumbs up from my side.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A little disappointed...,"It's a shame, I was highly anticipating this movie but I left the theater...less than thrilled with the result.We begin the story with a quick backstory on Apocalypse. The story then shifts forward to the 80s where we get a lot of different introductions to new mutants, and old. Magneto is revealed to be living a normal life but his subplot felt unnecessary to the story, even though a great scene resulted in it. Xavier is finally settling in with the school and Mystique is running around being a hero (huh?). Once Apocalypse resurfaces, he begins to recruit his 4 horsemen and attempt his plan to take over the world. The rest of the film follows.This movie features some great action, an interesting villain, and a surprising amount of violence. So why didn't I love it? Well..We're introduced to SO many different characters all at once that there wasn't really anytime spent on actually developing them. Funnily enough, we got most of the character development from those we already know so much about. The writers try to connect a lot of what is happening in the movie to the sequels but it doesn't really work when there are already so many inconsistencies.I enjoy Jennifer Lawrence but Mystique leading the X-men seems ridiculously out-of-character. Sophie Turner seems really off as Jean Grey and Tye Sheridan didn't really sell me as Cyclops, then again I blame the writing for that one. Psylocke, Storm, and Angel, all seemed replaceable and weren't even remotely memorable since they feel thrown into the story. Quicksilver was great but his storyline twist felt a little tacked on.A lot of the comedy fell flat and was forced at times. The romance subplots felt underdeveloped and their is a serious lack of chemistry between Cyclops and Jean.In the end, I just wasn't impressed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not DOFP but still a great installment into the franchise that is rewarding and sets up the future of the series.,"Apocalypse is a great mix of what we've come to see from the current trilogy and like the third part in any series it takes shots at itself in great ways while still holding a serious tone.Some of the highlights of the film include the new batch of X-Men of Jubilee, Cyclops, Night crawler and Jean Grey. The overall humor in the film could be the best of any X-Men movie in the series with several cleverly placed comments.The set up for future chapters in the series, and ultimately the ending scene as well as the post credit scenes should have any fan of the comics excited about the movie and the future of the franchise.The villain in the series is the pen ultimate villain of the X-Men comic books and although I didn't feel he was done justice given how menacing he is in the 2D world, I felt they did a good job bringing him into the franchise and ultimately creating a legitimate threat against the X-Men as a whole.All in all the movie is in the upper echelon of all comic book movies, and although it's not my personal favorite in the series it holds it's own and has more mature tone then most of the bubble gum comic movies we see these days.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

These movies have to be for fun, all this drama with the characters is stupid. Mystique is not Mystique anymore but the Mockingjay. The suffering of Magneto starts to be so boring and the injections of bad things that have to happens to Eric doesn't make the situation less boring, his parents, Auswitz, the family in Poland. ....... sorry but this is X MEN and not the ""Crime and Punishment"" relax producers, writers and directors",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"I forget how many X-Men movies there have been but this latest version is a strong return for the franchise and is close to being with the best as First Class (my favourite film of the franchise to date), X-Men: Apocalypse is a character driven, emotional and yet entertaining comic book movie that will indeed keep not only the fans happy but the audience either entertained or bored.Pretty much continuing after the events of Days of Future Past and while connecting to First Class, Charles Xavier leads the path for all mutants to be taught to control their powers and live in peace among the human race. We see the younger versions of the telepathic Jean (Turner), 'Nightcrawler' Kurt (Smit-McPhee), 'Cyclops' Scott (Sheridan) and especially the return of 'Quicksilver' Peter (Peters) who was in DOFP. Their chances of peace are tested when an ancient figure known as Apocalypse aka En Sabah Nur (played by Oscar Issac, who is unrecognized with so much make up on) awakens from an deep slumber to see that the world now doesn't rely or turn to the gods as his time had, so he recruits other mutants including Magneto and plans to destroy and rebuild life in his image, thus setting Xavier and crew to reunite and confront him in an ensuring battle for peace.What I loved about this film is that 'character' is taken to levels that made FC a worthy film. In particular the performances of McAvoy, Fassbender, Issac, Turner, Peters and Byrne are great and showcase the ranges of emotion and development to make their presence in the plot worthwhile. Lawrence was good as usual but there's not much for her to expand unlike FC and DOFP. The supporting cast handle well as well.In terms of story, it does balance itself with the themes of religion, faith, redemption and choosing our destiny and it does follow wisely in a 2 1/2 running time. The action doesn't kick in till the 2nd half of the story but it does take at least under an hour to make up for the 1st half of dialogue and character development (I say this only if you are expecting something that Civil War had done much better, but this is not the case). The moments of Magneto's story were pretty much spot on, we have seen the past of his life in the previous films and his established character but here we are given to how he copes in the world, where is often in a battle to fight to know where he stands in the world.Overall, it doesn't beat Civil War by a long shot (to phrase that, the best comic book adaptation of the year) but it does prove itself to be a better installment following DOFP and using the key elements of FC to make this a rare return to the strong point of the franchise. With some key strong performances, emotional tone and a lengthy climax it's worth a watch for the die hard fans of X-Men.Nick - 3.5/5 Jay - 3/5",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fearless. Solid. X.,"X-Men: Apocalypse is the proof that the screen adaptation for a story arc from the comics can, indeed, be changed, if that change is for the best.A lot of characters to take in? Certainly, but not to worry: they were somehow able to handle it perfectly. Each character has its own importance and development (ok, not Jubilee, she is barely in the film), and that is one of the keys for a perfect script. Also, it can sometimes be very cruel and down to Earth, which is perfect, considering the giant number of movies/TV shows afraid of killing their important characters, for example. That's why I call this script a fearless one. It's not about the audience, not about what's going to happen in the future. It's about delivering a good story in the present.By the way, Simon Kinberg has, again, done a great job here. Same goes to Bryan Singer. Perfect rhythm, very well thought-out connections, characters' interactions all on point, and that list goes on and on. Surprisingly, it contains all the elements for an awesome superhero movie. Plus, I must say I couldn't be happier with how the whole movie revolves around the true meaning of ""family"", and the different forms of it.It's a 9/10 because of some repetitions from old movies through the script, mostly with Erik Lehnsherr. It's basically everything we've seen before (twice). His resolutions are so the same I had the feeling even some quotes were identical. That feeling of ""oh, I've seen this before somewhere"" it's not so good here, unfortunately.Overall, a very nicely done film that you can't miss. DO NOT listen to the critics or that friend who's comparing this to other superhero movies. This is X-Men: Apocalypse and it's everything it intends to be.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good to watch with 3D, but not the best X-men by far","The scenario keep on his way but it doesn't bring anything new at all. The first movies of this trilogy were amazing thanks their scenarios but here I just got the usual about-face.I didn't watch it in 3D, it might be better because the main part of this movie was to show off spectators. I like good effects but there were not so good and some of them really useless.I gave a 7, it's not a bad movie, I appreciated winks and actors performance particularly but none of these scenes took my breathe away as they tried to do.And Jesus please ... stop to leave before the final scene !",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Apocalypse feels like an X-men comic, but it comes at a cost","""X-men: Apocalypse"" is the first X-men film (aside from the ""Deadpool"" 2016 spin-off film) that feels like it almost completely embraced the comic book series. The new characters are mostly teenagers who are unsure/frightened of how to use their powers, and the villain, Apocalypse (played by Oscar Isaac), is the first straight-up comic book style X-men villain that isn't Magneto (Michael Fassbender), or another human villain such as William Stryker (Josh Helman).This entry in the XCU has been met with mixed reviews from professional critics. Some are saying it ""paves the way"" for the franchise to grow in a new and fresh direction, while others are bashing it when comparing it to ground breaking films in the franchise (such as ""X-men: Days of Future Past,""2014).I happen to see a lot of strengths in this film, but also a few weaknesses as well. Let me start with the strengths.""X-men: Apocalypse,"" first of all, does not feel like another typical ""Bryan Singer X-men film"" (which might be where some of the criticism comes from).Singer does not repeat the slow build up that films, such as ""X2"" (2003) and ""X-men: Days of Future Past,"" had before they build up to the final climax. The whole film (despite being one of the longest running films in the franchise at 2 hours and 24 minutes) flows by rather quickly. I never once got distracted or started wondering when this film would end, like I have with other comic book films.Singer also manages to make the action flow throughout the whole film. Many complained about how little action there was in ""X-men: Days of Future Past"" when compared to the dialogue, but ""Apocalypse"" manages to make equal time for talk and action and often combines the two together.The new cast members also impressed me, though some get more screen time than others. Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) finally is given his due justice, and has some of the best character development than he has ever had in the previous films. Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) also impressed me (I was very concerned about her casting after the first trailer), and Nightcrawler (Kodi-Smith McPhee) proves yet again that he is one of the most likable characters, next to Quicksilver (Evan Peters).Other new characters get decent amounts of screen time, though maybe not as much as they deserved from a fans standpoint. Psylocke (Olivia Munn) was one who I really enjoyed on screen and hope to see more of in the future (possibly in an upcoming Deadpool sequel or X-Force movie).Also, don't worry about the ""First Class"" cast, they get great and equal amounts of screen time as well. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) didn't take over the film like the trailers tried to make you believe, and she was written in a way that made her character's previous development useful for the plot, and not forced because of a contract.Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy both impress yet again in their strong emotional performances as younger Magneto and Charles Xavier. I hope the X-franchise continues to use them in future films, because they are magic on screen.Lastly, Evan Peters Quicksilver proves yet again that he has the most fun character in the film. If you liked his ""Days of Future Past"" scene, you will absolutely love his newest scenario. His role is much bigger in this film and a lot of the humor comes from his character alone.Now that I've sung my praises, it is time for some negatives. The biggest flaw in ""X-men: Apocalypse"" is that the film doesn't quite reach the intellectual and emotional impact that we have come to expect from previous films in the franchise (especially the ones made by Bryan Singer). There isn't much to talk/think about with the ""Civil Rights"" metaphors (in fact this film barley acknowledges it), and even the religious metaphors and ideas such as Apocalypse being a ""false god"" fall short and aren't given enough time to sink in.Apocalypse as a character also feels somewhat one-dimensional in how he wants to destroy/cleanse the world. He is never truly defined as a character, despite Oscar Isaac giving his all to the role. When he is convincing the horsemen to join him, it isn't given much thought or reason to why they join him (other than Magneto). Towards the end of the film the character improves as a villain, but by then we still don't really understand much about him. In a way this is refreshing though, because it gives the other X-men room to grow as characters and we get to watch them have fun fighting someone other than Magneto, again.In the end, ""X-men: Apocalypse"" is a solid film in the franchise and is probably one of the most entertaining films they've made. Intellectuals and fans of Bryan Singer's older X-men films may be somewhat disappointed, but the film has proved that this franchise still has new life and stories to tell.I look forward to seeing where things go from here.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another Over Stuffed Film,"Unfortunately, X-men Apocalypse doesn't live up the standards of the more successful entries, such as Days of Future Past and First Class to name the most recent. If I had to sum it up in one word, I'd say overstuffed. Which is harsh, but as a Bryan Singer helmed X-Men Film, I expected more - Bryan Singer might be losing his touch. The film is about a near god-like mutant, the first ever, and his quest to destroy the world.But first, onto the good stuff. It is safe to say the highlights of this film mainly revolve around Quicksilver. His scene is brilliantly made, and took months to complete - this could be a reason for some of the other issues of the film. It is incredibly inventive, fun and Evan Peters is a golden bit of casting in this role. I only wish we could see more, as Quicksilver's potential return is the only reason I anticipate the next film. Michael Fassbender's acting is superb, and it is evident to see this in a couple of scenes - you'll know when you see them. James Mcavoy is also charming and funny as Charles Xavier, and I wished there were more scenes between his and Fassbender. Other highlights include Nightcrawler, Angel and Wolverine, although the first two should've gained more screen time. It's worth noting that Angel is a much more interesting character before his transformation.Now the bad. As previously mentioned, it is overstuffed with too many characters. There isn't enough time for them all. Personally, I didn't really connect with the new team that well (Cyclops, Jean and Nightcrawler) but there are still some good moments between them. The four horsemen are possibly the biggest example of this however, with Psylocke and Angel not saying much and whilst Storm has a few more lines, it does not take long for any of them to join Apocalypse. It feels rushed and follows a similar problem to Batman V Superman. Magneto is the only one of the horseman that I enjoyed seeing, as I've already said, as he is the only one who you feel any emotion towards.Other problems include some of the special effects looking a tad weird, although overall they quite good; too many flashbacks to First Class (reminds us of a better film); Sophie Turner's American accent wasn't convincing at all to me, probably because I'm used to her British accent. But a big problem with this film, is a problem which I actually enjoyed seeing - Wolverine's Cameo (not a spoiler its in the trailer)Wolverines Cameo scene was completely unnecessary in the film, there is no reason for it to take place, or for Stryker to appear, other than to shoehorn Hugh Jackman in. This time taken up by this film could've been purposed to serve as more time with new characters (preferably the Horsemen) and I feel like it was a requirement from Fox to put it in, although Singer does his best to make it work. The only benefits of this scene are to highlight the premise of an R-Rated Wolverine movie - Wolverine really cuts soldiers down, there's a lot of blood for a PG-13 rated movie. I should just mention this is a violent film, there's people getting crushed, burned alive, folded and beheaded, so just warn any younger viewers of this.Finally, Apocalypse is a really mediocre villain - his power is amazing to watch, end even though it feels like he can do anything, you realise that because of the ending to Days of Future Past, that everyone makes it out okay. There isn't really much development for Apocalypse. Whilst story arcs are absent with a lot of characters here, Apocalypse's is simply to destroy the world and that's it.Overall, X-Men Apocalypse has some fun moments (watch out for Quicksilver), some emotional moments and some decent action, but is ends up with too many characters with too little character development and a lack of sensible structure, with too many scenes not being necessary, and character motivations not explained to evident.It is worth a watch, but maybe not worth going to the Cinema .Nick Will Charlie Paul.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men: Apocalypse -- Worst Superhero Movie *Ever*,"And I'm talking ""Green Lantern.""I'm kinda angry I lost my whole afternoon. There was pretty much nothing redeeming about this film at all. I have a headache from all the special effects. It was worse than the first ""Transformers"" movie.Most of the acting was bad, and when we are talking about James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, that is pretty sad. They couldn't do anything with that script!It was a total betrayal to fans, the epic graphic novel story and the *entire* X-Men mythos. None of the characters were *in* character. It destroyed even the canon of the movies. It was boring--even with all that action--it was interminable.Terrible, terrible, terrible movie. Money grabbing.

"Bad reviews ""didn't get it"".","OK, the good old ""if you didn't like it, you didn't get it"" argument might not be the coolest way to go, but it is certainly a plausible theory as far as what the hell went down the weeks after this movies release.Singers last (so far) superhero epic is fantastic. Simply great.The villain is a CLASSIC superhero villain, with echoes that goes a long way back in the comics. I don't mean just Apocalypse; his mannerisms, his presentation, his dialogue, his written approach to a 'new reality' is such a nod to other villain story lines, that my nostalgiabutton was pressed and held for the duration of the movie, and perhaps a few hours more even.Same goes for the protagonist group. The new and younger additions to the X-Crew might have some slightly annoying connotations today, as the YA movies certainly have made youth extremely mundane and tedious.

"Expect Fun, not Perfection","X-Men: Apocalypse is a very long movie that doesn't feel very long. It's not the kind of movie that is going to win awards or necessarily be remembered in 50 years, but it is the kind of movie that keeps you glued to your seat throughout, no matter how badly you have to pee or how much you want to get a refill at the concession stand.The movie has slower parts, sure, but it never really drags (which is more than I can say for Marvel Studio's ""Civil War""). Nearly all villains lack depth in superhero movies these days and Apocalypse doesn't buck this trend, but he is fun. ""Everything they've built will fall!!!"" Is my favorite trailer quote of the year so far and the line is just as cool in the actual movie.All of the action is well done and the performances solid. Standout scenes include another Quicksilver foray in slow-motion and a slightly-extended cameo from an old friend. The climax actually feels climactic (gasp) and the ending hints at more good things to come in the X-Men cinematic universe.Is this movie going to change the way you view the world? Nah.Is it worth the money and time it takes to see it? Yes yes yes.If a movie isn't aiming for profoundly thought-provoking, it should aim for fun- a target that Bryan Singer and the team at Fox have certainly hit here.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The latest X-Men film isn't completely dreadful, but you may be tempted to cancel the Apocalypse after watching it.","It's hard to fault anyone for approaching X-Men: Apocalypse with optimism. 20th Century Fox has consistently failed the Fantastic Four, but they've had a better track record in recent years with Marvel's mutants. We've been #blessed with Bryan Singer's Days Of Future Past, a brainy, bold thrill ride that uses its myriad characters to excellent effect in telling a time-twisted tale of doom and well, apocalypse. Tim Miller's snarky, wacky Deadpool proved without a doubt that the studio is willing to take a risk on a cult property and let it explode all over the silver screen, rather than neuter it out of hand. With Singer back on board and a top-notch cast, hopes are understandably high for the cataclysmic confrontation suggested by the title of this latest entry in the X- Men franchise.We're even promised the holy grail of X-Men villains: ancient mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac, buried under too many layers of make-up and prosthetics). This righteous blue-hued dude, with his huge but poorly defined power-set, is an iconic antagonist for our band of superheroes in the comics: he's been known to lay waste to Earth in the past, present and future. In Singer's incarnation, Apocalypse's four Horsemen include wing-tipped Angel (Ben Hardy); weather witch Storm (Alexandra Shipp); energy-blade-wielding Psylocke (Olivia Munn); and a bitter, broken Magneto/Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender).It's up to Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and his X-Men – superpowered students that include younger versions of uber-powerful Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and Cyclops/Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) – to stop Apocalypse from claiming the entire world for himself. Along the way, shape-shifter Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) must decide just how she can best contribute to the mutant cause in which she so firmly believes.Here's the thing: keep your expectations low – lower – lowest – and X-Men: Apocalypse may just pass muster. This is a cookie-cutter blockbuster, sliced and diced together with more efficiency than heart. It dutifully ticks boxes as it chugs along: Apocalypse recruits his acolytes. Magneto loses his heart and soul (again). Charles and Raven discuss and disagree on tactics. Superheroes face off. It's all strung together with several sequences of world- destroying action, filmed in true Roland Emmerich style.Devotees of both the movies and the comics will find things to enjoy: a twitchy, endearing young Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who looks very much like a demon but is deeply devout; another deeply amusing explosion of special effects as fan favourite Quicksilver (Evan Peters) zips through a hilarious rescue mission; and an already publicised cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) that will drive fans berserk.But think a little harder or poke at its shaky plot, and X-Men Apocalypse falls apart quite readily. The truth is that much of this film is neither inspired nor inspiring. It's okay, for the most part, but it's never great, and barely ever good. Simon Kinberg's script is a limp affair, recycling bits that worked better in other movies in the franchise but breaking very little new ground. The stakes are insanely high, but the threat never feels genuine – a feeling that is only reinforced by the clumsy and anti-climactic way in which the final showdown takes place. Can we say deus ex machina? Yes, we can.The character work that lends so much emotion and power to earlier installments like First Class and Days Of Future Past is missing here too. Too much of the story relies on emotional connections that aren't established too well, and which can only be supplied by the viewers themselves. The film meanders without much purpose through its many relationships, staging a series of first meetings or reunions that basically amount to: Jean and Cyclops meet cute! Charles and Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) meet cute! Raven and Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) meet cute!But very little of it sparks to life, and there's a troubling disregard for female agency, too, that fuels Magneto's entire emotional arc in this film. We're also told why Moira disappeared in between films, but she's not given any time to forgive what she has had to forget.At least Singer's cast does good work with what little they are given. As a re-energised Charles, McAvoy is as appealing and charming as ever. Fassbender remains a gift to the franchise: he imbues Erik with the perfect blend of heartbreak and hatred, which serves as a potent reminder of why he makes a far better antagonist than the automaton-on-evil-autopilot that is Apocalypse. In the context of the film, Lawrence delivers a decent performance. But it's still hard to shake the feeling that she's miscast in the role, with her explosive star power prompting the filmmakers to transform Raven into someone pretty much unrecognisable to comic readers.In just eight years, the genre that was once treated as the difficult bastard stepchild of the movie industry has come fully into its own. It's only May and we've already seen three superhero films hit cinemas – Captain America: Civil War: excellent; Deadpool: awesome; Batman v Superman: awful. This latest installment in the X- Men franchise falls on neither extreme. It displays a couple of flashes of brilliance, but not enough to drag it out from the uncomfortable middle ground of mediocrity it occupies. Here's hoping Singer (if he signs on to direct) and Kinberg find their footing again with the inevitable follow-up to X-Men: Apocalypse – we've already been told that it will be set in the '90s, with a rather obscure end-credits scene teasing just where the franchise will go next.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not terrible, but definitely the weakest of the 3 ""new"" X-Men films","There's a generally accepted idea that the 3rd X-Men film was the worse. Well, I have to say the same about the new semi-rebooted series. The film just failed to live up to its potential. Firstly, the villain was somehow wasted, even though Oscar Isaac did a great job. I remember watching the animated series and being intimidated by Apocalypse (even as an adult). The movie Apocalypse somehow failed to evoke the same reaction. I never really thought he was unstoppable like he was in the cartoon. Jennifer Lawrence seemed tired of her role and was phoning it in. Magneto had a great start, and I loved how they initially covered his reasoning for doing what he did, but then he just gets relegated to the background for the most part, and his reasoning for doing what he does at the end don't really seem earned like they did at the beginning. Things seem rushed near the end, and it seems they were just trying to pack in lots of cool things at the end and it gets a bit muddled. The Quicksilver scene is awesome, and is the clear highlight of the film (again). At the end of the day, it doesn't go full Transformers and highlight action scenes over story elements, but it was definitely leaning in that direction, which was a shame.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Adaptation of a Comic Book,"First and foremost, yes of course this movie does contain flaws, and the group I went to see it with actually really disliked it, and I was shocked. I love the first two in this series, Days of Future Past is my favorite, but First Class is very close. The only complaint I have is as a huge fan of the X-Men comic books and the TV series, these two previous movies were brilliant, but I never thought of them as translations from that source material. Which is where we get back to Apocalypse, this felt like the best reputation in a long time by any comic book movie, they nailed almost every single character, with the exception of maybe one of them that I will get to. Now I get to the three complaints I have heard from my friend. First, the movie felt incredibly long, and maybe this is just me but this felt so short to me, like a one hour special on the TV series almost, I personally could sit down and watch 10 hours of the X-men. Second was the movie wasn't explained about certain parts, without going into spoilers they had said it was very confusing at parts, which most of them aren't as familiar with the universe as me so I like to say that is the reason. Now we get to the main villain which if you haven't seen it understand that Apocalypse is a flawed villain in general and probably the highest degree of difficulty to pull off, now with this in mind I thought they did a great job to still get the character right. I would definitely love more and more of the X-men movies as they are still my favorite franchise thus far, and I can say they are definitely certain problem that I might have missed that I turn a blind eye to because they nailed the X-men so well.Hayden's score: 9.4/10 Definitely go check it out, this movie should be making a ton more financially.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Riveting and exciting, but a step down from First Class and Days of Future Past","Since the first ¬X-Men movie was released way back in 2000 this mutant series has been quietly carving out its own piece of the cinematic comic-book pie, with both highs (X2, First Class) and lows (Last Stand, Origins: Wolverine) but a respectably solid overall output. This 'new cast' trilogy closer can't reach the heights of the franchise's best instalments, or its two immediate predecessors, although demonstrates just how thrilling and engaging this universe can be even when not performing at its peak. Centred on the eponymous ancient mega-mutant who wakes up after a few millennia to reclaim the world as his, the dramatic undercurrent is as compelling as the all-powerful villain (despite his underwhelming look) and generates a handful of genuinely intense and evocative scenes. A second-act tete-a-tete between Professor X and Apocalypse – during which the latter is causing mass destruction accompanied by Beethoven's stirring Symphony No 7 (Algretto) – is absolutely riveting, almost matched by a potent telepathic showdown within the climax. At this stage in the X-Men evolution there is also a certain level of competence that guarantees the action scenes will be nothing less than exciting and, with Bryan Singer at the helm, constructed and executed with endless ebullience and flair. The CGI struggles on the odd occasion, which is a bit strange for such a big-budget flick, however this is a minor blip amongst a collection of otherwise rousing set pieces that, just like in Days of Future Past, boasts a superb Quicksilver sequence that tops the list. There are a few missteps that weaken the film's lasting power though: bland henchmen surrounding the big bad, Wolvie's unsatisfying involvement, and an atrociously placed Stan Lee cameo that raises giggles at the most inappropriate moment. From the returning cast James McAvoy (Professor X) and Michael Fassbender (Magento) reliably bring the gravitas – although Jennifer Lawrence looks a tad disinterested in her third time out as Mystique – whilst Oscar Isaac (as Apocalypse) and Sophie Turner (Jean Grey) impress the most out of the newcomers. Undeniably a rung below the two preceding entries on the X-Men ladder, Apocalypse is still operating at a high enough standard to be thematically absorbing in addition to entertaining on a popcorn level.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best X-Men movie to date,"Was hooked from the start, the show of powers in this movie was spot on. The action sequences where awesome was really happy with how it was all done. Quicksliver brought fun to the movie and some pretty bad ass scenes.Sophie Turner was the Jean Grey I've been waiting for since the first X- Men movie. All of the cast did great in there roles i have no complaints apart from i would have liked a little bit more of Psylocke.This is a movie that i will be re-watching a few times, i am all ready hyped for the next instalment of this franchise.Hats of to you Fox, You actually made a superhero movie i can watch over and over again besides Deadpool Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men: Apocalypse makes up for a dull villain by providing a new batch of mutants and some fun action,"What's fascinating about history is that even though the Ancient World had claimed large empires from Rome to the Greeks to the Egyptians, we still know very little about it as much of the evidence is either lost, destroyed by time, or is still under the sand waiting to be rediscovered. I took a trip to Scandinavia a while back and learned about the Norse gods that the people worshiped and said to have built the lands. While it's easy to dismiss the images and ideas of these ""gods"" as morality created for Scandinavian society, part of me does believe that the ancient world may have worked differently then the modern world does. Perhaps there was some magic centuries ago.The X-Men are a series of characters that you could argue are like modern day ""gods"" with their mutant powers. Like the gods of the old world, they could take either side of good or bad, and were controversial with the government. Their movies have done well (especially First Class and Days of Future Past) to reflect this while making it a fun blockbuster for everyone. The young mutants face their biggest challenge yet when the first mutant returns in X-Men: Apocalypse.We begin in Ancient Egypt where the world's first mutant En Sabah Nur, or better known as Apocalypse (played by Oscar Isaac) rules as pharaoh, along with four other mutants as his ""four horsemen"" until he's betrayed by fellow worshippers. He's trapped in a tomb for centuries, until he's accidentally woken and uncovered in 1983 where he decides that the human race has no place in this world. He recruits a young Cairo pickpocket, a then unknown Storm (played by Alexandria Shipp), along with a man with bird-like wings Angel (played by Ben Hardy), and telepathic energy manipulator Psylocke (played by Olivia Munn), and eventually, a heartbroken and cold Magneto (played by Michael Fassbender) to become the new Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.Meanwhile, Charles Xavier (played by James McAvoy) and Hank McCoy/Beast (played by Nicholas Hoult) has been successfully running his school for mutants, but is reluctant to call them into action. He's put his focus on students like Scott Summers/Cyclops (played by Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (played by Sophie Turner) and Jubilee. So it comes as a surprise when Raven/Mystique (played by Jennifer Lawrence) comes to the school along with a teleporter Nightcrawler (played by Kodi Smit-McPhee). They see how much of a threat Apocalypse is and join together to stop this guy from destroying everything.This movie had A LOT to follow up with, considering that Days of Future Past is one of the best super hero movies around. X-Men: Apocalypse does provide a bigger world that's taken advantage of. The introduction of Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Jubilee, and Storm are welcome to this younger franchise, as they bring some new insights on what it is to be a mutant from different perspectives. I even liked the newer villains that were usedexcept for Apocalypse. They try to give him these big powers and a cool make up design, but he is a dull and boring to hear from. You'd think that a centuries old pharaoh would have more to him then evil.The best performances are still the original four (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jenifer Lawrence, and Nicolas Hoult) who continue to evolve their characters.The action scenes do provide a lot for the X-Men to play around with. The final battle itself goes on a little long, but it did give us plenty of different mutant powers at use. Much of the story does rely on knowing what happened on the last couple of movies, so I'd defiantly say to start with First Class before coming to this.I'll give this seven Julilees out of ten. While the scope and weight isn't as large as Captain America: Civil War, X-Men: Apocalypse was a fun addition to the growing franchise. I'd say give this a watch, but if your not familiar with the X-Men, then go back and watch the others first.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wanted to like it,"I paid my money and went to see X-MEN: Apocalypse. I am an eternal optimist and although I was terribly disappointed with the first 2 Bryan Singer X-MEN movies (I mean... character re-write of Rogue was criminal). I thought maybe he would get it right this time. Unfortunately, my optimism was not repaid and the movie was again disappointing. In my opinion the problem is the stories, then are just so bland which is a direct result of the Bryan Singer re-writes from the original X-Men stories, which were awesome. BUT... Bryan Singer does not limit his poor quality story telling to the X-Men movies - No! Just look at the awful Superman returns movie from 2006. This was the pinnacle of boredom and was the worst superman story I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Maybe Hollywood is happy to throw money at poor quality stories at the expense of CGI and special effects but the paying public (I hope) will not tolerate this forever. I will avoid movies directed by Bryan Singer going forward....",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Complete over reach. Visuals over plot originality,"A pure example of over reaching, particularly with a classic. Especially, a classic that has run its full course 2 settings ago. I'm assuming the movies overall score is primarily awarded for mere aesthetics; to which one must wait long periods of time to see. Best part, Apocalypse the character, convinces a posse of 4 to follow him: 2 teenage emo's, a cougar, and magneto. Sounds like an all out apocalyptic brawl to me... Not so much. Well, it fell short, even remotely close to a chicken fight, let alone, apocalyptic. Time to drop the act and move on from this sequel. Unfortunately, it saddens me to compare this classic to anything else, but, I'm getting the feeling this sequel is following the Fast and Furious exaggeration.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X- Men : Apocalypse - A mediocre visual fest,"As much as I am a fan of X- Men series this one disappoints me a little bit especially after Days Of Future Past which was by far the best X - Men movie and one of the best comic book movies . Apocalypse was more menacing in trailer than in the movie because he doesn't do anything in this film rather than giving powers to his Horsemen . First half of the movie is pretty slow and I think that they went too far to build up hype for Apocalypse which he doesn't stand up to . Its the second half and Quicksilver that made us to watch the movie . Quicksilver is the best in this movie I mean all his scenes are well made especially his entry . All the actors did their job perfectly , its their roles that I think were short. Like Four Horsemen should have been more terrifying but they didn't do anything except Magneto . Second half is definitely worth a watch for visuals and characters because everyone gets to shine and has its moment in second half and now I come to the cameo , yes The Wolverine , his scene were very good and he was shown as the animal as he is in comics , more ruthless and more dangerous than he has ever been in movie which I think was very good for him because its what Wolverine is . All thing this movie does is that it is very good to eye but nothing exceptional . You can sure watch it but with not so much expectation but I'll say watch this because of Quicksilver because he is the only one who can make you enjoy this movie .",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this movie very much, although it wasn't quite as good as I expected. Still, it was time well worth spent, and it is a movie I will certainly be purchasing when it comes out on Blu-ray. It had action, humour, and drama. I thought that the story was good, and the characters solid. Quicksilver was my favourite, which isn't a surprise as he was in the comics as well. I didn't think that this movie was as good as ""Captain America: Civil War"" or ""Deapool"", but I did like it more than ""Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice"". Not that I didn't like that movie, I just think that Marvel do a better job, whether it is with Disney or Fox.

"Bad luck, it's good but had to live up to the expectations, spoiler: it did not.","I usually don't write reviews unless i have a great grade to give or a very awful, but for the first time i decided to write a review along with an average note. Why? For starters the movie isn't bad, its pretty darn entertaining actually, has some very emotional moments, some awesome action scenes, some great cinematography and music, some quicksilver, and it was hella ambitious in scale, and it actually was. So with all that said, why only average? Well, Days of future past is more than a good superhero flick, is an amazing film, everything about that movie was good, what Apocalypse tries is to be bigger than DOFP, and while it is it just doesn't work. DOFP felt just so much important even tho there wasn't a godlike ancient being trying to eradicate the human race.

This has brawn and brains and a whole lot of dazzle,"Gotta hand it to Bryan Singer. He knows the subject matter like it is the back of his hand. You may be watching a full-on superhero romp about mutants, but you can also feel it in your bones that the movie transcend to a different plane subversively. Just substitute mutation with the current hot-button issues like xenophobia and racism you will see a very different movie. Singer understands ostracism and social prejudice so well that his X-Men movies feel like veiled shout-outs of misunderstood people. In X-Men: Apocalypse, he has made another entry in the franchise that has brawn and brains and a whole lot of dazzle. I had a feeling that I wasn't just watching a summer popcorn movie but something relevant and important.The script is whip-smart and manages to juggle so many characters, both old and new. In one funny moment it takes a clever dig at Brett Ratner's abomination. The characters have link to the past and the future. There is pathos of the Shakespearean level and tragedy of the Greek magnitude. This is yet again a Defcon One ""End of the Earth"" scenario with the Adam of all Mutants, Apocalypse. The chap may be buried under a ton of blue makeup and housed in a blue strait-jacket, but his quiet menace shines through. This is a villain with a capital latter ""V"", well-established, religious connotations all around and his motivations thoroughly well-drawn.The action set-pieces are well done with no hint of repetitiveness. I mean we have all seen Magneto and Prof X strut their stuff but it never feels old with the tweaks incorporated. For example, Gotta love how they up the ante with the Quicksilver scene, easily one of the highlights again.If I do have some quibbles I would have to say the runtime could have been shorten (I really felt the full 2h 24min) and the final climatic smack down is exhausting to watch (it felt like it will never end). I have read some of my favourite critics' reviews and nearly all of them didn't dig the movie. Their reasons are exactly the polar opposite of what actually worked for me. This isn't as effortless and fun as X-Men: Days of Future Past, but it comes real close.3.5 / 5",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""At least we can agree that the third one is always the worst""","Michael Fassbender. Certainly one of the three best actors working today, an absolute force of raw emotional power and complexity. Any film can safely put it's faith on his shoulders, as he is the sort of actor that can single-handedly make a film work. With how little screen time he actually has in this film, I can't help but make the sad realization that the producers, writers, and Bryan Singer himself don't know who their best horse is. Every scene featuring Fassbender peaked my interest, as his performance alone carried me through the clunky writing. He's a star, and a film focused on him is the sensible direction to take this franchise, not pushing him into a corner. Let your stars shine, Fox.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't very good. There are a host of problems that plague it, but the most appalling would have to be the terribly confused storytelling. It's worth noting that this is the first X- Men film with an actual emphasis on the villain. In the past, it's always been focused on the Professor X/Magneto conflict, racial tension, the plight of being a mutant and other, more internal conflicts centered on coming to grips with mutants in society. Apocalypse, one of the X- Men's biggest foes, is an enormous presence to capture on film. I feel the film actually nailed the persona of Apocalypse, Isaac giving an intimidating, somewhat powerful performance and lending an astute physicality to him to establish that presence. What the film absolutely failed to do, however, is establish the sheer power of Apocalypse. A man who has existed for millenia, something of a god- figure whose power is virtually unlimited. He is immortal. I can't stress this enough, in the comics he is a damn force of nature, something the X- Men could really never hope to defeat in straight up battle. The film does not capture any of the profundity inherent with Apocalypse's past, really glossing over the fact that he has turned the wheel of civilization's past, allowed people's to rise and willed others to fall. He is God, always worshipped by the peoples of his time, seen as a divine power and feared as one as well. Apocalypse makes no effort to establish this deity dynamic, instead just making him out to be a sort of charismatic leader to whom conflicted mutants will flock. His powers are woefully undefined, and during the climactic fight, I couldn't help but wonder why he couldn't just snap his fingers and end it all. The final fight is fun, but very clumsily constructed and ultimately pretty drab. Multiple characters that are hyped throughout the film don't actually do anything, and the ""plans"" put in play make no sense what so ever. Character motivations feel derived from simply a desire to progress from point A to point B, not natural or authentic at all.Jennifer Lawrence is bad here. She sleepwalks through her role, and I really can't conceive why Singer decided to explore Mystique further. At this point, she seems to follow the same pattern in every film. It begins and she has little faith in humanity's tolerance of mutants, and she tends to be either a fringe figure or embedded within the villainous organization. Professor X and Beast proceed to reach out to her, convincing her of the merits of peace and instilling a hope within her for a better future. Regardless of plot progression, she always recedes back to her original state, pessimistic, kind of whiny and simplistically conflicted. She was compelling in Singer's original trilogy and I tolerated her in the first two entries within this trilogy, but at this point nothing new is added. Now I just wish they'd just leave her to her own devices, or at least give her a defined and confident worldview. She's not some all-powerful force that could endanger the entire world, nor is she a scared little child who knows little else. She's an adult woman, and she's made her choice. Can we move on?X-Men: Apocalypse, when it comes down to it, is a film of shallow delights. For the most part, I really enjoy the cast of these films. There's loads of starpower that generally aren't in these sort of stories, so it's a delight to see them hamming it up at heroes. I also was fascinated by half of the Apocalypse character, as I think some of his ideas play nicely with the general concerns of the X-Men franchise. Jean Grey is effectively constructed as a character, Cyclops, Nightcrawler and Quicksilver not as much. On even shallower level, I had quite a bit of fun with Olivia Munn as Psylocke, purely because she's attractive and I'm a guy. Magneto's time on screen was the film at it's best, and Singer's visual style as always is exemplary. Suffice to say, I had a good time with this film, despite it's overwhelming issues (hence my decent-good rating). I've been a comic-book nerd all my life and i don't see the personal utility in criticizing these sort of films, because on a basic level I appreciate them all. This film is not good, and if you are not at all a nerd in that way, you rightfully will hate this film. The writing is awful, direction scattered and the finished product just feels messy. It's a flailing effort to enter the traditional superhero film racket, with a narrative focused on a hero vs villain rather than heroes vs themselves, and it seems evident that this route may not be the best one. Apocalypse does not hold up to scrutiny at all, but the sad fact of life is that I will still see this three more times. I have more to say, but I feel bad trashing on this film, which I admittedly enjoyed quite a bit.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A messy, lifeless and outdated superhero movie","Since the Marvel Cinematic Universe came into being in 2008, the superhero genre has undergone an incredible revolution. Nowadays, we're getting numerous top-quality comic book movies year on year, so when one that doesn't quite match that comes along, it feels immensely disappointing, which is unfortunately the case with X-Men: Apocalypse.Before I get into why, however, I want to say that this isn't a terrible film. It's still got some great moments, the introduction of characters like Jean Grey, Nightcrawler and Cyclops is great to see, and, had it been released twenty years ago, it wouldn't seem so poor.However, modern superhero movies are so much more than just bad guys and good guys, and you need far more depth in a story to make an entertaining film. X-Men: Apocalypse, however, delivers a clunky, convoluted plot almost completely devoid of emotional depth, good characterisation or comic relief, and at nearly two and a half hours long, it's a real slog to get through.My biggest issue with the film comes in the form of its narrative. Although it does improve by the end of the film, the first hour and twenty minutes are very poor. Spanning between Apocalypse's creation millennia ago and the 1983, where the main story takes place, the film spends far too long flying to and fro around the world establishing various different characters' back stories, and it turns the film into a mess.Yes, the plot eventually centres its focus in the final act as it heads towards the inevitable final battle, but for a good half of the whole movie, it's very difficult to get grounded on what's going on in the greater scheme of things, which is surprising considering how well Singer's Days Of Future Past managed to handle its even more complex plot.Another problem with the film is that it feels very lifeless. One of the reasons that First Class remains my favourite X-Men film is because it had a sense of fun to it as well as being an impressive action spectacle. Apocalypse does have its obligatory Quicksilver scene (which is brilliant), but apart from that, there's very little sense of fun here, making it almost as brooding a film as Zack Snyder's DC movies, which was not great to see.But sometimes, with a degree of emotional depth and intrigue, a superhero film can still pull off a dark atmosphere. Again, however, Apocalypse fails to deliver. Throughout the whole film, there's only one scene early on with a proper emotional power, which makes the rest of the movie feel very stagnant, so I just wasn't able to get excited and wrapped up in the story.In the end, X-Men: Apocalypse is a big disappointment. Being a big, action-packed blockbuster that lacks any real intelligence or depth, it feels like it was made for release in 2003, but given the high quality that so many expect from superhero films nowadays, a film that comes across as a very stale, lifeless spectacle just doesn't impress.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't believe critics watch it yourself,"Lately, there is a trend that if you put a low score and criticize a superhero movie you feel you got a high movie literacy.I highly recommend you watch this movie first and feel about it.X-men Apocalypse must be understood by watching the old x-men movies. It evolves much on character emotions. Another recommendation is that, one must understand history a little. On what is happening in cold war or who is ""Ra, Yahweh, or Visnu"" like what apocalypse said in the trailer. Then, only you would understand that this movie is big. It is not just the fun light heart superhero movie. Watch out the performance of Apocalypse! The actor is awesome",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another mediocre X-MEN movie by Brian Singer,"I love the X-MEN saga and acknowledge that Singer made a very good job with the first two movies (specially X2 ); but I still consider X-MEN UNITED (directed by Brett Ratner) one of the best of the whole series (the movie was more expensive but even under-performing; made more money than the first two; and is still the second best of the series. Singer left X-MEN to pursue Superman; but failed and his next two movies as well. He finally returned for Days of Future Past (a huge commercial success; but as a movie far less interesting the previous installments. However; smartly Singer joined past and actual main characters in one movie and that underused trick help the movie become the highest grossing of the series. In another smart move; he end Days of Future Past with a hint of Apocalypse; the most beloved of the X-MEN comics; grating a lot of attention and expectation on this one.Well sadly this time; Singer imagination run out and the movie become a very poor mess. A lot of characters with poor development. QuickSilver (Evan Peters) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) are the only ones to give some humanity to their characters. McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence do what they can; but the script does not help. Byrne and Hoult (and the rest of the cast) has very little to do and look uncomfortable. Even Oscar Isaac fails to create a good baddie.In terms of special effects; things are not that better. Lack of imagination is everywhere. The final fight; seems copied of older movies and the FX and digital images look cheap.X-MEN interest on the saga is based on the characters. McKellen and Steward or Fassbender and McAvoy as Magneto and Xavier can carry a movie by themselves if they let them; but in this case their characters are secondary to a bunch of new mutants and a bad guy none of them interesting or close to charismatic.In brief; it could have been the best X-MEN but lack of imagination made it the worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Loud, dumb and derivative, thie empty CGI showcase is by far the worst superhero movie this year","Before Apocalypse unleashes the end of the world, there is a moment when the gifted youngsters of Professor Charles Xavier's school for mutants sneak out to the cinema to see 'Return of the Jedi'. Following a debate which of the original 'Star Wars' films is the best, a teenage Jean Grey gets the final word with the following remark: ""Well, at least we can all agree, the third one is always the worst"". Though clearly intended as a dig at Brett Ratner's oft-criticised 'The Last Stand', it is an equally prescient remark about the third superhero-versus-superhero showdown of this year, a loud, empty, overblown CGI-fest that possesses not the depth or excitement of the eminently superior 'Captain America: Civil War' nor even the grand operatic ambition of the flawed 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'.As promising as it may be to underscore the ideological divide among the mutants of waging war or making peace by introducing an all- powerful deity meant to be the first of their kind, that premise never quite comes to fruition here. Aside from world domination (which pretty much sums up describes what every other comic book villain is after), there is no purpose or motivation to Apocalypse's plan to scorch everything on the planet. Try though Oscar Isaac does, the usually charismatic actor struggles to bring much conviction to his character's monologues about restoring the strong in their rightful place atop society, not least because the actor is buried under slathered-on makeup, facial prosthetics and a costume that would make Thanos embarrassed.Seeing as how Apocalypse proves to be a disappointingly generic villain, it once again falls to James McAvoy's Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender's Magneto/ Erik Lensherr to provide the dramatic conflict on which the showdown between good and evil is based. And yet that tension between Charles' man of reason and hope versus Magneto's darker impulses has been fought so many times that it feels familiar and undercooked here, especially considering how its immediate predecessor had fleshed out the same complex relationship out so much more beautifully.That essentially reduces 'Apocalypse' to yet another superhero round- up much like the first 'X-Men' or 'X-Men: First Class', and so, for the first hour, we are introduced to newcomers Tye Sheridan's laser- sighted Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops, Sophie Turner's telekinetic Jean Grey and Teutonic teleporter Kurt Wagner a.k.a. Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). They will eventually join forces with 'First Class' regulars Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Hank McCoy a.k.a. Beast (Nicholas Hoult) to go head to head with Apocalypse's 'Four Horsemen' recruits – weather-controller Storm (Alexandra Shipp), energy- manipulator Psylocke (Olivia Munn), flight-enabled Angel (Ben Hardy) and last but not least, Magneto. News about the latter will also prompt the son he doesn't yet know about, Quiksilver (Evan Peters), to enlist in Professor Xavier's school, where he will put his fleet- footed powers to save all the students within from an explosion ripping the building apart.Given how that sequence set to Eurythmics' period-appropriate synth- jam 'Sweet Dreams' is by and large an exact copy of the crowdpleasing scene-stealing sequence in 'Days of Future Past', there is more than a nagging suspicion that director Bryan Singer (who marks his fourth 'X- Men' outing with this movie) has pretty much run out of ideas. As if compensating for an attention-deficit audience, Singer and his screenwriter Simon Kinberg cut from subplot to subplot without ever letting their audience get involved in any one storyline or character. Even though the 'X-Men' movies have always been an ensemble, Singer has always grounded them in their struggles to emerge from wealth or poverty, acceptance or rejection, confidence or self-hatred; yet this latest dumbs down their humanity in favour of pure spectacle, which proves an ultimately foolhardy choice in this era where there are just too many superheroes fighting for our attention.Even as a superhero slugfest, the action is frankly disappointing. It says a lot when Quiksilver's cheeky slo-mo turns out to be the highlight of a film that promises no less than the end of the world. At any and every opportunity, every other character reminds us of what is at stake, but the large-scale catastrophe consists of nothing more than unimpressive shots of capital cities (including New York, Sydney and Cairo) reduced to swirling CGI-dust with little sense of tragedy or consequence. The climax itself is packed with plenty of sound and fury, but comes off shockingly dull. Rather than have the Horsemen take apart the good guys as a team, Singer splits the fight into a series of mini-skirmishes that hardly do the characters or their superpowers justice. By the time Apocalypse (finally) steps into the fray after a way-too-long buildup, the battle has shifted into his mind (which, as we suspect, turns out to be pretty blank), but that change of setting barely unleashes any creative possibility for Singer to think out of this world.And coming off 'Days of Future Past', 'Apocalypse' is undoubtedly a tragic letdown. There are so many characters that even Charles and Magneto become no more than supporting acts, their perennial disagreement treated as an afterthought than the dramatic dynamo of the film. The titular villain may seem like great potential as an antagonist, but ends up vague, underwhelming and insignificant. And most notably, what used to be potent allegory about the civil rights movement or coming out in the LGBT community has now been diminished to standard, sometimes sub-standard, superhero melee, so much so that it even fails to make good use of its vibrant 1980s setting except for a couple of recognisable tunes. It may not be the apocalypse of the 'X-Men' franchise, but this dreadfully boring and derivative entry could very well portent its end.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

So-So,"What can I say, I like to root for the underdog. And since DC and Warner Bros. have metaphorically s*** the bed with Batman Vs. Superman (2016), 20th Century Fox's X-Men series (2000-Present) is the biggest superhero game in town other than Marvel. Being a fan of the comic books, growing up with the animated TV series (1992-1997), and enjoying the ever expanding bevy of merchandising material, I admit I am bias when it comes to this particular IP. Of course I enjoyed the high- water mark that is X-Men: First Class (2011). Yes, I unabashedly love the original movie trilogy. Yes I even like X- Men: Last Stand (2006). These guys have been doing the superhero team-up shtick on the big screen much longer than some. At their best, their aesthetic gives those lapsing into superhero fatigue but still looking for that explosive kick a much needed respite. At their worst their soulless, characterless and confusing cash-grabs that cheapen the civil rights subtext that gives the X-Men their unique flavor.X-Men: Apocalypse begins in ancient Egypt where a gaggle of mutants are adored by throngs of people witnessing a processional. Apocalypse (Isaac) heads the pack and is about to transfer his consciousness into a self-healing mutant when something goes wrong. Fast-forward to 1983 where Charles Xavier's (McAvoy) school has just enrolled series regulars Scott Summers (Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Turner). Meanwhile Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Fassbender) attempts to live a normal life in Poland after the events of Days of Future Past (2014) have made him the world's most wanted man. Thanks to the sleuthing of CIA agent Moira Mactaggert (Byrne), Apocalypse is unleashed and sees humanity's dominance over mutants as reason to pretty much end the world.X-Men: Apocalypse lies somewhere in the middle of the pack as far as quality. The action, while occasionally repetitive never ceases to amaze and newcomers Sheridan, Turner and Alexandra Shipp as Storm manage to find deeper dimensions to their characters despite finding precious little time to do so. Additionally, the emotional epicenter at the core of this film (and indeed every X-Men film), the relationship between Charles and Magneto remains as complex as ever.Yet with so many mutants crowding the halls of Xavier's School for Gifted Youth, not to mention the streets of central Europe, it's truly impossible to really let a lot resonate. X-Men: Apocalypse has enough story to fill three films yet with a huge amount of characters to appreciate and the same dour cinematic choices of its predecessors, the film feels simultaneously rushed and turgid. The inclusion of fan favorites Nightcrawler (Smit-McPhee) and Quicksilver (Peters) manage to serve as convenient plot devices or worse, contrived fan-service that detracts completely from the plot.It's really hard to get excited one way or the other about X-Men: Apocalypse especially in a year that simultaneously gave us a truly great superhero film in the form of Captain America: Civil War (2016) and one of the worst in the aforementioned Batman Vs. Superman. X- Men: Apocalypse isn't even the best X-Men movie this year; that distinction is deservedly bestowed upon Deadpool (2016) which called out the aging series for being too far up it's own a**.All said and done however, the newest X-Men movie still has a couple of showstopping performances. The talents of James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan, if utilized correctly next time, will assure that the franchises' best days aren't behind it. For now, those very performances saved this film from completely cratering to the ground.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This Movie is a solid 7 out of 10,The movies isn't quite a 4* of of 5 just below it but its definitely better then the average movie out there. And it actually makes sense. If you are not formiliar with the x-men universe the movie. You would likely rate it at 60-62% unformiliar with it. I can see a few plot gaps that may cause some to lower it to average 5/10 but only a few would rate it as low as 4.Thats it. Worth a watch. Do suggest watching previous x-men movies first in the film order. X-men / X2 xmen united / xmen united / x-men first class / x-men days of future past. Then this movie.Leaving the Wolverine movies separate. Just a suggestion from a movie buff.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"When critics don't do their job properly, you know it's time to create an IMDb account.","Since 2011, I've been praising Matthew Vaughn's ""X-Men: First Class"" as one of my favorite movies of all time. Witnessing X-Men: Apocalypse has still left me in shock at how the 3rd installment to the prequel trilogy has now made my 'all-time' list too.No spoilers ahead, but I will say this: WHAT A FINALE!From hearing John Ottman's 'Suite from X2' in the introduction to the new and equally hilarious Quicksilver sequence, this film really does have it all. Given you've seen ""First Class"" and ""Days of Future Past"", I strongly urge all movie goers to see this conclusion. The audacity critics have to slay this film is beyond me, they really have lost their touch. Please don't be another sheep in the crowd and listen to those morons, believe me, buy yourself a ticket and see how this piece rounds the series off well.P.S. This is my first ever review.

Engaging,"The story doesn't really seem to have continued from the previous instalment, but that is how X-Men is able to entice both old and new audiences. Each X-Men movie has new characters introduced while still having the core characters at it's centre.The acting is great, as returning actors and actresses have already established their characters and know how to portray them. Those new to the franchise also do well and it's quite refreshing to see young faces portraying characters already established in the universe. Quicksilver's unique character personality really shines through, and is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. Not only does Peters do a great job with expressing his character, but the visual effects, editing and directing, all played a part in creating this and the rest of the personas.Speaking of visual effects, the action is very well done, and the effects for the superpowers are exciting to watch. The vibrant colours as well, add to the immersive feel of the movie.Having said all that, while it was cool to watch, it wasn't as exciting as the previous X-Men film. It was still interesting and I enjoyed watching it, but it seemed more like it was setting up for more things to come. It felt like it was lacking something, which I can't really pinpoint what exactly. The screenplay is well written and has many comedic lines which add character to the film. But the constant switching between good and evil was a little tiresome and predictable to me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good SciFi innit!,"Just finished watching X-Men Apocalypse, I confess I'm a little late to the party but, damn that was good, I had only ever seen a trailer and really had no idea what to expect, should have had double popcorn it would have been worth it.It seems from some of the reviews that there are people watching SciFi that don't seem to understand what it means, this was to date the best X-Men film I've seen and I mean best, this was edge of the seat excitement I gave this film 9 out of 10, couldn't go higher that would put it up with infinity war and End Game and it wasn't that good, the only slight disappointment was Apocalypse, he wasn't quite as apocalyptic as I thought he would be, I expected the X-Men to have a little more trouble with him still good movie and any true SciFi fan will enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An underwhelming and frustrating film,"Since 2000, Marvel and 20th Century Fox have created a number of movies with the X-Men, usually led by director Bryan Singer, who is also at the helm of their latest installment, X-Men: Apocalypse. There have been some great films like Days of Future Past, and some pretty bad ones like X-Men Origins, and this movie lies in between. Boasting a great cast, led by James McEvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, and some great characters, this movie ends up being an underwhelming and slightly frustrating film as you reach the credits. But it also manages to spice up some memorable moments, in particular a scene involving Quicksilver.The movie lacks in several areas, with one standing out the most being the plot. The plot is very simple yet bloated at the same time. You begin with the antagonist, Apocalypse, and introducing his origins. Then the protagonists, which are the X-Men, gather a force which can hopefully sustain itself against Apocalypse, who also gathers his own followers. It sounds very simple, yet when you see the movie, it starts to get confusing. As of late, superhero films such as Captain America: Civil and Deadpool have attempted to expand the genre, whilst this film continues with a very cliché story and archetypal villain. If it were a couple of years ago, I might not make the same case as these movies were only beginning to be a part of the movie industry. Another downside is the misuse of some of the cast, in particular Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. Apocalypse doesn't seem the least menacing or frightening, which isn't entirely the fault of Oscar, but maybe the writers. Likewise with Jennifer, who feels much underused in the context of the story. Some of the other characters feel very forgettable, especially some members of Apocalypse's team (Angel, Psylocke). They aren't that interesting and are very one- dimensional.The final battle was good, though a little underwhelming, which had the occasional wince of bad CGI. Magneto's transformation was by far the best of all the characters, and probably one of the only sides of the story you can get emotionally involved in. Fassbender did really well in his performance, especially given he had quite a change in character throughout the movie. McEvoy as usual was great as Professor X, and some of the young newcomers proved they are capable of being part of a massive blockbuster. Its movie worth watching as it is fun and enjoyable ride, but make sure you enter with low expectations.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Apocalyptic Levels of Entertaining Nonsense,"X-Men: Apocalypse is a movie about an ancient Egyptian mutant Pharaoh with blue skin and godlike powers who transfers his soul between bodies via magic golden goo using his solar powered pyramid who gets buried underground for thousands of years by his servants who didn't like him then wakes up in 1983 and decides to destroy/take over the world. Naturally, this results in many scenes featuring explosions, lasers, people punching each other, exposition about destroying or saving the world, some brief emotional interludes, and of course, more explosions and punching.Silliness aside, X-Men: Apocalypse is filled with lots and lots of, well, stuff. People, places, things, ideas, and everything else. Anytime one person, place, thing, or idea starts to get developed, all of a sudden something else is happening. We go from serious dramatic sequence, to superfluous semi-comedic fluff, to introducing this character, then that character, to giant CGI action scene, then introducing another unnecessary character, to lofty dialogue about the nature of good and evil, to a scene played for laughs set to pop music, to a psychic battle set inside a character's mind, and so on and so on. It's all over the place. Needless to say, movies like this have their place, particularly in the comic book genre; however, this certainly isn't the best the genre has to offer. A smaller cast of characters, a more consistent tone, and a shorter run time all would've helped this have more staying power.The movie does certainly have some genuinely great scenes scattered throughout. Unfortunately, many of them feel incredibly out of place in this glorious mess of a movie. That being said, for what this movie is, it works well enough to be tolerable and fairly entertaining throughout. However, it should be noted that if you have no familiarity with the X-Men comics and/or previous movies, it will make very little sense. But if every once and a while you like to see an over-the-top big budget movie that has 173 characters and subplots with giant computer generated battles and supervillains scheming to destroy/take over the world, you'll probably like this. The spectacle of it is impressive at the very least.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men was better than Civil War....,"Not better than Winter Soldier and Avengers. Winter Soldier was perfect.But Civil War seriously unforgivably sucked. Hard to follow and understand, it was a mess. Shows how people's IQ's dropped since Winter Soldier. Also shows how people are too prideful to admit......Civil War was aimed for children and not for adults.Even Tech-insider admits Rotten Tomatoes almost had them fooled. X-Men easily beats the #%#& out of Civil War.It actually had creepy death scenes, kills. Civil war had playful endless CG fights. Civil War did not live up to it's name. Apocalypse did. Even bad reviews didn't kill the franchise, but extended with Deadpool 2, X-Force and another X- Men Franchise. I do plan seeing all of them in theater and buy every ticket.Oscar Isaac is incredible as a fantasy villain. I also loved the artistic bright blue colors, brings you into the world of Marvel Universe's comic book art and style. This movie was 10/10.Almost took out a point, because Apocalypse's powers where not all revealed in the movie. But he is suppose to come back, so we will see in the future, maybe New Mutants.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better, bigger and cut for kids","I didn't expect much and I didn't get much. As a sci-fi movie it was good; as an X-men movie it felt barely average. Typical villain, the usual back and forth between mutants switching from one side to another, the Stan Lee cameo, the end credits scene. In the end, it didn't feel like anything.That was its largest flaw: with all the scenes of personal loss, mental torture, mass killing, shootings and evisceration I didn't feel one damn thing. Personal loss was used as a generic token to change someone's behavior in a way that made no sense, the torture and the killing were carefully doctored to show almost no blood and no people that one might feel connected to in any way. Surely we are all used to faceless soldiers dying in droves and even if you know rationally that the New York bridge and the Sydney opera and the entire city of Cairo were full of people, you don't see any bodies, any suffering and the movie makes sure you don't care.What was the purpose of it all, then, if all your efforts are pushed into CGI and making your audience not care? I know it's Marvel fatigue, but at the same time the movie was simply bland. And not by accident, but on purpose. Enjoy your two hours of heroic clichés and expensive special effects and, while you think of the plot and the characters, imagine you are watching the cartoon. It will help.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not as good as ""Civil War"" but not as bad as ""Batman vs. Superman""","This takes place in 1983 and has the X-Men getting together to battle an ancient alien named Apocalypse who wants to rebuild the world...and run it.Good (sometimes very good) superhero film. There's plenty of action and excitement. However the plot is vague and more than a little convoluted and slow-moving at times. Also some of the heroes (notably Storm and Angel) get very little screen time. Also Cyclops comes across as a bit of a jerk. Worst of all in Nicholas Hoult who is just terrible as Beast...and yes I'm aware he's played him before. Way too thin for the role. However the rest of the actors are all good in their roles. Also Wolverine pops up briefly. His sequence is VERY bloody and violent--way too much for a PG-13 film. By the way it adds nothing to the plot. I'm guessing he was put in just to satisfy the fans.

Not thinking as a fan,"The movie tells us the story of the first and most powerful mutant in the world, Who was kept underneath and in totally darkness. Long after he comes back to defeat humankind, beings that have taken control by hurting his mutants sons.Having not seen or reading any kind of comic and with all the x men movies already seen I want to say that this is a great movie. Especially because in this case some characters brought magic. This movie will make you laugh a little, but even more, the movie will make you feel defeated and powerless, and that is because of the villain, which is actually a great character.I would say that in my opinion there are two characters to highlight in the movie. I don't want to spoil the movie, so, I hope you will find them.Not everything is good. The movie is predictable. The story, even though it tries hard not to be a cliché, is actually led by the same mechanism of superhero movies, which will let you how the good ones always come together to win.

A good movie with character problems.,"Overall it's good. The positives do push the negatives, but slightly. I am a huge X men fan, and this one feel a little flat for me. The acting is great, but the writing not so great. They didn't do good with Storm, Psylocke, Angel, and Apocalypse. The opening scene is amazing, but after that I couldn't feel worried that the X men were at a serious risk. Apocalypse wasn't scary, he felt like a wimp. Like I said before, the acting was good. I felt Oscar Issac did good from what he could, Michael Fassbender was amazing, and so was James Mcavoy. The introduction to the new X men was executed well, and I can't wait to see them more involved in the universe. I recommend seeing this film if you like the X men.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great visual effects,"This film tells the story of how mutants become stronger, how they unite and betray one another in a fight against an ancient Egyptian God that aims to destroy the world and rebuild from ashes.""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is filled with my favourite stars, and I have been looking forward to watching it. The story is a bit slow paced because there is a lot of detail to be told. How each mutant comes about, and how they befriend, familiarise and cooperate with each other is told. There is a lot of background story, and at times I think the story could be a bit faster.Fortunately, the film is filled with very good visual effects, such as the scene of the College exploding. That scene showcases the great visual effects achieved by the team, and provides comic relief in an otherwise tense scene.For the post credit scene, there is a bit of a pause between the end of the credits and the post credit scene, which made the cinema goers wondering if they sat through the credits for nothing. After watching the scene, that thought did cross my mind, unfortunately.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
First Class is still the best,"I had moderate expectations for Apocalypse. I'm not a big fan of the first X-Men Trilogy but since First Class, in 2011, I've grown to like this franchise very much. First Class was and still is the best of the bunch for me. My moderate expectations came from the fact that I believe Days of a Future Past fell a bit short in comparison with FC, but I still enjoyed it a whole lot. Bryan Singer is not one of my favourite directors and since he established this franchise, I guess his films lack the boldness and freshness that Matthew Vaughn brought to the series.Now it's time to review Apocalypse. The first sequences of it were mind-blowing. Egypt, an old Apocalypse putting his consciousness on a newer body, the False God fighters and the colapse of the pyramids were just amazing to watch. Then it settles a bit and starts building-up to the final clash between Apocalypse and the X-Men.Despite roughly being 2 and an half hours long, I never felt it was dragging or boring. The action scenes were great and the more character development bit were fine. A big shout-out to the casting team : both Tye Sheridan and Sophie Turner were impeccable as the new Cyclops and Jean Grey.Oscar Isaac as I feared was only average as Apocalypse and the new actors didn't bring much to the table - Olivia Munn is sexy, yes, but not much more than that. Magneto, Prof. Xavier and Raven are the standouts once more. After three entries I feel connected to their characters in way I'm not with the others. Charle's and Erik's ideological fight drives the plot as it did on the previous films and Apocalypse gives more attention to Michael Fassbender's character pain and grief. Fassbender is really the best of the film. He acts so perfectly. He truly is Magneto. Above else, he is Erik Lensherr. Evan Peter's Quicksilver continues to steal every scene he's in and the slow-motion sequences are one of the best bits of the film.Plotwise, its what you'd expect from a big super-hero blockbuster. Simple and clichied, but it still works for the fun factor. We're gonna see this film to be entertained for 2:30 hours and nothing more. Its a popcorn flick and its what you think it is. Oh, and there's a very very sweet cameo in the middle which blew my mind.I just don't know if it deserves the RT rating. Its certainly better than 49%. But will it be alongside Wolverine 3, the last we see of X-Men in the future?I hope not. Specially, if another director with fresh ideas is on board.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A perfect way to close the trilogy!,"X-Men: Apocalypse is not as good as First Class and Days Of Future Past;It's a solid entry with a big ending! I really enjoyed Apocalypse but at times it felt a bit cheesy but the movie takes place in the 80's so they attempted to give it an authentic era feel. The beginning was a bit slow and by slow I mean that there's a lot of dialogue going on and that's because i think they wanted to built the character of Apocalypse. besides that there are tons of great moments, especially another fantastic scene with Quicksilver. another concern about the movie is that Apocalypse himself never feels threatening. When he shows up, he seems like you should be afraid, but by the end of the movie he seems under powered and you wonder why his followers worked for him at the first place. Also Angel and Psylocke could have been more central to the 4 horseman. the final battle was epic and ransom and characters had nice costumes too! to sum up it's a highly entertaining film to watch especially for the fans but for some others it might not pass!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bryan Singer wasn't able to follow in his own footsteps,"In the end, director Bryan Singer wasn't able to follow in his own footsteps after the formidable Days of Future Past. He delivers an overstuffed movie with poorly developed characters. And obviously my intro was a hoax because superhero fatigue looms heavily over this movie. Though it's not all bad; X-Men: Apocalypse is colorful, funny at times and ballsy. It's a spectacular film that's more appetizing to comic book fans than movie fans, but will still get the general audience excited for sequels.X-Men: Apocalypse is the movie equivalent of a: ""Study"" buddy Pretty to look at, casual fun, proper entertainment.

"Entertaining, but mostly forgettable!","I loved Days of Future Past, despite the puzzled narrative and cloudy second half it was still a hugely entertaining film that I could return to any day. X-Men: Apocalypse however, feels more dull than awesome.There are some truly great concepts that I'll get to later, but I constantly got this feeling that this film was just padding for this series. They wanted one more film, and so tacked on another unnecessary concept and storyline.Now, it's great seeing Nightcrawler back after his last appearance in X2, and he once again makes for a cool character, but just like most of the cool characters in this film, he does very little.That's one of the big problems with this film, the plot is on autopilot. No-one needs to really do anything because the plot's moving along by itself.Mystique spends the first half of the film running around doing... something that has little relevance to anything really, and Nightcrawler just tags along for most of the story.Cyclops makes a return, only to again do very little. He only becomes important during the film's climax where he joins the fight against Apocalypse.Oh boy, let's talk about Apocalypse. He's the bad guy, that's about it. This has to be one of the most boring villains in the series. He wants to destroy everything, simple as. There's no struggle, there's no character whatsoever. He's little more than a plot device.However there is one character I would like to talk about, and that's the legendary Quicksilver. His introduction at Xavier's academy beats the classic kitchen scene from Days of Future Past 100 times over. It's such an awesome scene.And I guess I kinder like Jean Grey as well as her telekinetic powers make for some nice scenes. But everyone else feels like they're just along for the ride, and that extends to the villains to.Apocalypse barely even has to try to convince Angel and Storm to join him, two characters who should've been awesome but just spend their time standing in the background while the real antagonist makes his demands.Visually, this is a good looking film. The GCI is OK although I dare say they could've been a little more imaginative but it works so I won't go too deep. The make up effects are highly impressive most of the time and nothing stands out to me as looking cheap or unconvincing.The acting is the best thing about this film. Sophie Turner and Evan Peters are my favourites but everyone is doing their best with what they've been given. Even Lana Condor who, considering this was her first ever acting role, is doing a great job.Overall, X-Men Apocalypse isn't bad, but it could've been so much more. Unlike most of it's predecessors, the imagination just isn't there. The characters are little more than plot devices, the villains are uninteresting and most of it just feels like the film trying to keep itself going under the weight of strong but badly constructed themes.The plot is thin, the characters are weak and the whole thing is entirely forgettable, but at least we'll always have the Quicksilver scene.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What is the general MCU format??? No story...no plot...no character development...just a bunch of ppl kicking asses and blowing up stuff from the word ""go""...add with it cheesy one-liners n repetitive humour n thats it!!! Thats pretty much what 9 out of 10 MCU movies are all about!!! And what better way to compensate for a lack of true content!!!X-Men has always been different and in my opinion...better!!! This franchise has always been darker...more mature...more plot driven...more character driven!!! Every X-Men movie including this one has content good enough to hold its audience without special effects and over-the-top-action scenes!!! For how many MCU movies can u say this???X-Men: Apocalypse had me hooked from the first scene and kept me engaged throughout!!! There is very little to almost no action till before the climax but the content as usual is good enough to keep u hooked!!! N the action lovers needn't be disappointed...the last 30 minutes has sufficient to makeup for the whole movie!!! N that by the way is a real fight!!! Where both teams give in their 100% to take the other down!!! The airport scene in Civil war was more like a new form of bromance!!!QUICKSILVER WAS AWESOME!!!! Once again he ruled!!!! He was awesome!!! Did I say that already??? Who cares!!! I can just keep saying it!!!James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were amazing!!! This is another thing about this franchise...it gives more space to its actors than most other superhero movies!!! Loved Sophie Turner as Jean Grey cant wait to see more!!! I was a little disappointed in Mystique!!! In the last 2 installments not only did she play a pivotal role but her character was really twisted...conflicted...i think mysterious is the word!!! In this one its pretty one-dimensional...still way better than Black Widow though!!!Not to give away spoilers...there was a major cameo...lets say Weapon X...that I feel should have been handled better!!!One last thing...for the Civil War lovers who are complaining about the villain here...Apocalypse was about to destroy the world and did actually destroy almost half of it in the process...please remind me what did the Civil War villain Zemo do??? Right!!! Make Iron Man and Captain America fight...except wasn't that going to happen anyway...followed by their disagreement on the peace accords??? What did he really make happen that wasn't already going to happen??? Nothing!!!

"Haus Verdict: Weak villain, much CGI, not much sense. The elements are there, but it doesn't hum. But that Quicksilver scene is the flippin' mustard.","An omnipotent deity falls into a thousand-year sleep, leaving humanity to fend for itself. I know what you're thinking--ah, so that's why there haven't been any Haus reviews!--but no, my flock. 'Tis not my apologia. 'Tis, rather, the soft undergirding of what passes for a backstory to X-Men: Apocalypse.Quick recap: First Class (2011) was awesome, a fact attributable entirely to Matthew Vaughn's direction. Bryan Singer's 2014 Days of Future Past was a messy muddle, though plenty of people seemed to love it. Singer's now back with Apocalypse, which is--to put it kindly--a trifle uneven.Whereas some superhero films cling to reality by the tenderest of bowlines, the X-Men franchise cast off from those shores long before it ever got green-lit. As you probably know, the various characters wield arbitrary and wholly impossible powers, which absent careful story-rigging would lead to some very uneven title fights indeed. As usual, there's really no sense belaboring the lack of realism in the X-Men films, but it's perhaps worth noting that unlike some of its sibling installments, this one doesn't even try a pseudoscience gloss. Mutants here are closer to gods, which is perhaps how they're properly seen. (Once I decided this, in fact, I enjoyed the climactic battle a good deal more.)Story wise? Well, as the trailer suggests, an ancient Egyptian mutant/god (Apocalypse, who according to the credits is played by an unrecognizable and deeply slumming Oscar Isaac) awakens from his poorly-explained sleep to seek--what else?-- the destruction of the world. He identifies other mutants as henchmen and augments their powers. Some mutants join him, others try to stop him. He wrecks some things (largely of the Egyptian variety) though never manages effectively to convey his motivation for pretty much anything he does. (He's also not frightening, coming off more like a lumbering eighties action figure with seaweed-colored pancake makeup.) Humans, perhaps mercifully, play virtually no role in this film--eschewing even their traditional duties of gawking helplessly as heroes and villains wreak havoc. A couple of cut scenes show Pentagon-types wringing their hands, but that's about it. Mutants Only.Coolest scene ever. Coolest scene ever. The good? An absolutely brilliant (and appropriately long) scene featuring Quicksilver racing through frozen time takes the Haus trophy for best Sweet Dreams montage ever put to film. Evan Peters (that's right, Kick Ass's best friend) playing Quicksilver-- that's great too. Olivia Munn's monotone glare. Olivia Munn's outfit (for comedic value, natch). Legitimately strong performances by the main leads.The bad? The story leaves aforementioned main leads often with little or nothing to do. The villain is lame. It's long. Is any of this tied to reality in any form at all? And this may be sacrilegious, but I really didn't find much of the CGI to be that good. Your mileage may vary.The big question is, should you see it? Eh, maybe. If you've already seen Captain America: Civil War (a far better version of Marvel hero overload that's also out now) and Zootopia (a fabulous Pixar film, still playing as I write), and you still fancy a summer blockbuster type experience, this one isn't all bad. I've seen worse. And for an X-Men film, around these parts, that puts it right around the middle of the pack.Haus Verdict: Weak villain, much CGI, not much sense. The elements are there, but it doesn't hum. But that Quicksilver scene is the flippin' mustard.X-Men: Apocalypse opens everywhere today, May 27.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Ridiculous plot, laughable characters and unwatchable CGI.","My ""mission"" to watch the complete X-Men cinematic saga chronologically continues. It took me several months to recover from the Wolverine origin movie and I genuinely thought that it was impossible to do worse than that. Unfortunately I was wrong. The main issue for me is the length. Almost two hours and half are definitely too much for this story. There are tons of unnecessarily long sequences that keep stopping the main narration: the movie needed to be heavily polished, by cutting a lot of boring and repetitive scenes. The script is ridiculous and there are tons of things that do not add up: characters are changing sides with no logical explanations. Magneto does not do anything remarkable, and the film would be even better without him. Wolverine appears for a few minutes, having no impact on the plot. The villain is unappealing despite being portrayed by the talented Oscar Isaac. The defenders of En Sabah Nur are just ridiculous to say the least. Seems to me that the director just threw out a few popular characters, probably to attract fans, but did not know what to do with them. At least the acting was pretty solid overall.From a technical perspective this flick is no better: I could easily spot when a scene was shot in front of a green screen. Visual effects and CGI quality are pretty bad, especially if we consider that this is a blockbuster. To be fair, there are a few sequences towards the end that are a bit better, but overall the VFX are pretty much disappointing. I am really worried about watching the next chapter of this franchise.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The worst of the series.,"""I've been called many things over many lifetimes: Ra, Krishna, and Yahweh. I was there to spark and fan the flame of man's awakening, to spin the wheel of civilization.""Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac)Yep, we're in trouble as you can tell from that quote. Sounds almost like a power-deluded presidential candidate. I would call X-Men: Apocalypse ""absurd,"" but even that dramatic genre has an element of believability, such as waiting for a god that never shows. Waiting for Apocalypse produces only a doomed demi-god from very ancient Egypt, visiting the 1980's and taking over the world.Besides the usual Hollywood fire and brimstone, this hot mess has no redeeming conceit, such as a race of mothers nursing humanity to evil. I can't tell you the special circumstance other than weeping over Apocalypse because the great actor underneath is so hidden he could be a reality TV host firing everyone who doesn't agree with him.Except for Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique in a very skin-tight costume, even the CGI is ugly, disguised under tons of smashing rocks, rocks all over, nowhere near aesthetically inspiring. The crew of X-Men is pretty much dealing with two men, the aforementioned Apocalypse and the estranged Magneto (Michael Fassbender). As in the case of James McAvoy as Xavier and Fassbender, these two superb actors pale next to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, possibly because those Shakespearean Brits brought so much gravity from so many years of living. No fault of the younger actors, who are given scant smart dialogue that abounded, for instance, in the anti-heroic Deadpool.Other marvels such as The Avengers do quite well in the character and wisecracking categories; the X men are humorless except for some attempts from younger heroes like Nightcrawler (Kodi Smitt-McPhee) and Quicksilver (Evan Peters), e.g., ""No matter how fast I run, I always seem to be too late.""A bright note is the thematic capstone declaring the key to human success, companionship:""It's over, Charles. You are beaten."" (Apocalypse) ""You'll never win."" (Xavier) ""Why not?"" (Apocalypse) ""Because you are alone . . . and I am not."" (Xavier)",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A superhero epic of glorious ambition.,"I trust professional critics in many scenarios. On many occasions, I tend to agree with the critical consensus for the most part. However, sometimes the critical consensus falls into a viewpoint I cannot bring myself to agree with. The film has some serious issues in regards to its pacing and treatment of some of the cast, however, X-Men: Apocalypse has managed to do something no other comic book film to date has ever done to date, to bring the scope of the original comic's mythos successfully to the screen. The films begins in 3600 B.C. as a rebellion in ancient Egypt causes the god-like mutant Apocalypse into a long stasis. In 1983 as Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has taken charge of a new generation of mutants at his school and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) is living a life of peace with a family. However, their idyllic lives are now threatened by the re-emergence of Apocalypse, who recruits four powerful mutants to be his horseman in a mad quest to take over the entire planet. It is up to the X-Men, old and new, to stop him. Apocalypse has been widely criticised as being extremely dull and with a 144-minute runtime, the film definitely takes its sweet time getting to the grand finale. But what it does use that expansive runtime for is key bits of world building, and as a comic-book and literature fan, I'll take good world building over a rushed, propulsive plot any day. Apocalypse has an epic scale, and the massive build up certainly helps to add weight to the explosive climax, but some elements of the film's scale work against it. The cast is huge and many members are either underutilised or under-written to an embarrassing degree. Magneto has a compelling, dramatic story in the film's beginning, but gets little to no resolution when the dust clears. The Four Horsemen are the worst offenders, with Storm, Psylocke and Angel practically having about 5 lines of dialogue between them in the entire film. However, the rest of the film's cast manages to salvage their parts in fantastic fashion. Singer used Days of Future Past to establish the 'First Class Timeline' as standing alongside but separate to the original X-Men film universe and James McAvoy continues to distinguish himself as a different Professor X who's funny and yet heartfelt performance stands alongside Patrick Stewart's iconic portrayal of the character. Newcomers Scott Summers/Cyclops, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler bring a fresh and welcome set of perspectives to the film and it's nice to finally see a Cyclops audiences can truly empathise with on screen. Oscar Isaac does the best he can as the maniacal main villain, Apocalypse, but the character is fairly one-dimensional and audience reactions to him will be hit or miss depending on your preference. A character that has been proved to be consistently excellent and a standout, though, is Evan Peter's Quicksilver, who plays a much larger and more involved role here than his previous outing in Days of Future Past. He has another standout, spectacle scene and probably the best action sequence in the film all to himself. This speedster is right on the money with solid characterisation and a strong performance from Peters. Despite all negatives I could pick up on with the slow-moving plot, some weak sections of the cast and a few other completely forgettable technical nit-picks, Apocalypse certainly knows how to show its audience a good, fan-service filled time. One thing I could never criticise the X-Men franchise of is becoming stale, especially Singer's entries, which is a lot more than I can say for most of Marvel's last few entries in their cinematic universe. With the original film, Singer redefined the superhero genre in cinema, with X-2 he created a multi-layered conflict between multiple factions of humans and mutants and with Days of Future Past he gave audiences a gripping time travel adventure. Apocalypse takes a step even further away from the franchise's 'based in reality' roots but does so with grandeur and confident swagger, while retaining a sense of realistic emotion and genuinely funny humour that never overplay's itself. The film is a behemoth, a comic-book epic of a level of ambition I've never seen successfully put to screen before. The film does something that no other film has ever done: made me feel like I'm watching a comic brought to life from page to screen right before my eyes, and the feeling is absolutely glorious. The action is electrifying, the powers bright and flashy and displayed in their full glory, from Psylocke's energy sword to Cyclops eye beam. This is X-Men for the people who loved the original stories in their Chris Claremont days or grew up watching the 1992 animated series. The soundtrack even gets into the sometimes ridiculous mood of things, jumping from eighties pop to a grand, bombastic score when appropriate. By time the obviously shoehorned in Weapon X appearance comes into play, you're too immersed in the spectacular gravitas of the film to care and you've strapped yourself securely in for a rollicking good time. In the end, X-Men: Apocalypse ends up being one of the most memorable comic-book films to date, perhaps because it is easily the most comic-booky film I've seen yet, in that it showcases this set of compelling super-powered characters in an event of such grand scale, I thought it could only appear on the page. Ignore the critics and make your way down to your local cinema to make up your own mind. Any fan of superheroes, especially of X-Men, will most likely appreciate the ambition on display here, even more so that it works so splendidly. In my opinion, it's far superior to Civil War. In fact, X-Men: Apocalypse may well be my favourite comic-book film since X-2 came out in 2003, and it definitely serves as an appropriate send-off to the 'First Class' as a new generation of X-Men begins.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visual Effects far outweigh the story telling and theatricality,"Overall, I really enjoy the strong and fantastic visual effects, nevertheless I have some of questions:1) What is the motivation of the followers of the ""God"". If the memory is eliminated from human after each return of the ""God"" to the earth, what makes the followers keeping on calling the ""God"" back; If not, why these followers insisting on calling back the ""God"" to restart the civilization by massive destruction, as the price is so huge.2) why the ""God"" need to find teammates, seems he can easily control the human minds (a fact here is he fires all the nuclear to the sky through invading and control the mind of the soldiers)3) the ""God""'s intention is destroy the current civilization, seems firing all the nuclear weapons down to the earth is ten times enough to destroy the earth, why he is so stupid.4) why the ""God"" is easily be betrayed. what is the motivation of his ""teammates"", seems not clearly presented.5) finally, why the ""God"" is defeated without even sweat, a girl who overcomes her inner fear become the last straw of the ""God"", hard to accept.6）I had thought our Magneto is a faithful men, but he had a bastard; and his bastard are eager but reluctant to tell him the truth.....why why why.....even in face of the destroy of the earth.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the reason why you shouldn't listen to the critics,"As the title say, this movie is Apocalyptic. The destructive is great, and it's awesome. My expectation for this movie was quiet high and this movie has done it very well, even though Days of Future Past felt slightly better.Actually I'm a bit surprised when people get confused with the story at the beginning. When you already saw the other X-men movies, the story won't be that hard to understand. The beginning was to introduced the villains and re-introduced some mutants from the first trilogy, and then the conflict started to rise. The best part came when Quicksilver did his scene, just like he did in the Days of Future Past, but this time he got more part.But there's also some shortage, like the conflicts and the problem solving are quiet simple, and there's some CGI that looks cheap.Overall, this movie is worth to watch.

One of the top X-Men movies,"REVIEW (Non-Spoiler): X-Men Apocalypse does justice to the X-Men franchise, the film is consistent with it's plot, performances and action. Oscar Issac has done a tremendous job as Apocalypse and he might the next best X-Men villain after Magneto. James McAvoy and Micheal Fassbender have done it again, the duo has good chemistry and balance.Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg did a great job of juggling around all these characters, giving all of them their moment to shine. The new actors added to this film work really well and portray their characters in a new light. There are places where the film could improve, this film has so much potential for greatness. The only drawback of this movie is to be released couple of weeks after Captain America: Civil War.With all that said, X-Men Apocalypse is a good, serious drama with right doses of action and humor. This might be in one of my top 5 X- Men movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""All is revealed""","X-Men Apocalypse is the third movie in the New Generation X-Men movie franchise and while it is a great movie that not only ups the stakes by giving us one of the best and most memorable villains in the X-Men franchise Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur) but it also has the best cast of characters we have seen so far including Jean Grey, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Storm and Psylocke with a few cameos including Wolverine and a small appearance by Jubilation Lee sadly she shows no powers but is still technically in the movie.The movie goes back and forth between the good guys storyline The X-Men and the bad guys storyline Apocalypse I enjoyed the mixture of scenes as normally we just see the good guys who come across the bad guys after all the preparation and planning that ultimately leads to the movies climax but here we get to see Apocalypse awaken in the future where humans are in charge and he has no allies or friends discover the world around him and find mutants to help him overtake the world as he imbues each of them with more power and a faster evolution rate and they become his four horseman his bodyguards after seeing both sides build up a force by different means and tactics when we do get to the movies climax it's difficult to just cheer for the X-Men when you've got to know the other sides way of doing things and there personal struggles even if they are evil and want to take over the world.There sadly aren't that many fight scene's in the movie most of the movie comprises of dialogue and character development but when the action does get started it is visually stunning, fast paced and intense so it really makes all the build up worth while for a better story and overall a better end fight with real stakes involved.I recommend this movie to any X-Men and comic book movie fan while it's not on the same quality level as the Avengers it's still worth watching and it certainly entertains.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Best Film 2016, And The Last Time...","You have to see it from the zero point, this includes the opening titles.The story combines biblical historiographical edgings and messianic, with some traces of modern conspiracy theory,that give the argument a solid and intriguing background.In the meantime, it appears Wolverine with a ruthless and bloody intervention.Comes a character who was this today ""capped"" but from now becomes a figure mythical and unavoidable.The actor who plays shod like a glove, He played a memorable role, if not endearing, that will remain forever in the retina of the spectators.And talking about nonexistent characters, I mean ""Quicksilver"" (For us agree that except for comic fans, nobody gave $ 2 per Quicksilver, and from now enshrined as an almost obligatory figure of the saga. Very welcome the revival of this character, and its interpretation by Evan Peters). As I was going, it is the scene of 'Sweet Dream's of Eurythmics. Without fear or exaggeration, It is one of the best scenes in all cinema history, but the best. And without doubt, it is a landmark that will remain in history and that marks a before and after in the world films.On the other hand, the villain of the film is really intimidating, because it embodies nothing more and nothing less than the figure of God.What more can I say? The film is long but very bearable. Charls Xavier and Magneto impeccable, with the rest of the characters in his fledgling side. In total, it is not perfect, but worth watching if only for the scene 2 'arrival of ""Quiecksilver"" because alone all palms, laurels takes, and is a 10 Absolute. Bravo ""X-Men Apocalypse"". Viva ""In Sabah Nur"", Viva ""Quicksilver"", And death all Detractors of the film. (Mental shortsighted.).PS: Added 5.22.2016. I must clarify and recognize that I am a fool for it. He had not seen ""X-Men Days of Future Past"", had happened to me, and I saw her just now. Having seen before, maybe it would have slowed a little surprise effect that generated in me the scene of Quicksilver, but not much, I still think it's the best scene in movie history.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the most forgettable X-Men movies,"X-Men: Apocalypse is the kind of a movie that will make you remember all the good scenes, and you will forget why you hated it. But when you rewatch it you realise that nothing makes sense. But for me, however, I only came to watch the CGI stuff. I haven't read the source material. Neither do I have any idea about who Apocalypse is and what he wants. So I'm gonna judge this movie entirely based on what happens in it, how the CGI is and how all the characters are. And trust me, it fails in half the things.So first of all, I really liked the idea of an ancient mutant coming out of Egypt to learn about the current affairs and then deciding to take over the world. Though I wouldn't have given any points to this movie for this plot since it's a comic book adaptation, I will still give it extra points for showing it so nicely. Then there was the scene where Cyclops gets his powers. I don't know why, but I used to think this scene was from X-Men Origins: Wolverine. So after that there's a scene where Magneto is shown to have given up his previous life and started living as a family man, but the mutant hunters storm his house and kill his family. I really found that scene emotional.But after that the movie started feeling like it's crumbling down. The same Apocalypse who saves Storm by using sand to cut down everyone's head suddenly decides to never use this power. And also, what is a Storm with a mowahawk even doing in Egypt? It was never said that she's from there. There is a cage match between Warren Worthington III and Nightcrawler, and Mystique comes over there to get Nightcrawler out of there. But it doesn't make sense. How was Nightcrawler even captured in the first place? Couldn't he just teleport out of the cage? Also Mystique is someone completely different this time. I know she can change her look, but even her original look changes.And then there's of course the most iconic scene of this movie: Quicksilver saving all the kids from the explosion! But later on the whole point of that scene gets ruined when the army comes up and captures them anyway. They are transported into a secret lab, and guess what? Wolverine is also there. He was obviously brought in there for a scene that could be shown in the trailer, because then he's gone and lost forever. So anyway, Charles is captured by Apocalypse, the good guys fight the evil guys, something something happy ending and that's it.Most of the scenes in X-Men: Apocalypse were forgettable. The memorable scenes, well, I forgot they were from this movie. To write this review I had to watch Honest Trailers and Cinemasins just to remember what all happened in this movie. Like I said before, I used to think Scott getting his powers in the middle of the class was from X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I thought Quicksilver saving everyone was from Days of the Future Past. Same goes for the getting arrested scene, the Wolverine fight scene - I thought it was all from the prequel. Now I will have to edit my reviews for those movies too.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Apocalypse of the X-Men Franchise,"The arch villain here is a toad-faced, scowling, bore whose wit and intelligence are almost as subpar as the script. How does this world-destroying tyrant recruit mutants? Why he changes the hair color for Storm, fixes up the ruffled feathers of Angel, and mutters ""join me""!. Apparently, this is sure-fire recruitment inducement for superhuman mutants.Meanwhile, I pity the Hank McCoy/Beast character who is either an uninteresting accountant-type character or an embarrassing, useless, big, blue lug. Numerous scenes of mass slaughter and the military literally mopping up pools of blood do nothing to improve the viewer's experience either.Otherwise, the film is over-stuffed with random CGI effects and a plethora of sidekick characters that are left awkwardly standing around. If it weren't for James McAvoy's performance of Xavier mildly holding my interest, I would have rated this film even lower.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Empty Grand Spectacle,"Apocalypse is the lamest villain I've ever seen in an X-Men movie, it makes Deadpool from X-Men Origins look subtle. I believe this movie has the Dawn of Justice problem, except probably a little better. People would defend it to how close it looks from the comics, when the argument they would point out is only from the aesthetic. Example: The movie may have Psylocke's look, powers and leotard, however remains cipher that it's close to Batman v Superman's Wonder Woman. The movie throws in a ton of characters and cannot even juggle enough from them, especially when it comes to Jean Grey. She is supposed to be important to the story, but her arc is rushed and her involvement from the climax felt extremely unearned. Fans of the old movies might find the returning young characters such as Cyclops and Nightcrawler fun, but that's only for the sake of familiarity and if this is the first time you've encounter these characters, then you won't find anything remarkable from them. Good performances do help, mostly from Michael Fassbender, even when Magneto here is underwritten as ever, he manages to make a rather contrived sequence quite powerful. But even then, when he starts becoming the villain again, the bombast just compromises every talent on screen.The movie is heavy on CG, but short on tension. All we see are spectacle, that it gets too exhausting that you're almost like watching a Roland Emmerich movie. It all looks cool, but there is nothing really exciting about it. To be fair, it's still quite watchable and fans might go crazy about its fan service like Wolverine (it's shown in the trailer,) bald Professor X and Mystique wearing her original costume. But even with these aesthetics, it's still pretty empty. These characters are too burdened from the past that it's kind of missing the point.Oscar Isaac tries, but the role is just too silly to be taken seriously. James McAvoy does his best as Xavier. Tye Sheridan is the best cinematic Scott Summers so far, but that isn't saying much since this franchise never even cared for this character. Michael Fassbender is seriously the only one who can exceed from the film's shortcomings.Overall, X-Men Apocalypse is pretty to look at, but the lack of enough connection with this rich amount of characters and tension towards the situation and the villain just rob all the fun. It's far from boring, at least. You can find worse ways to kill your two hours, but still, it's like the Mutant Apocalypse game; if you're looking for some action that looks like the comics, then you may have a blast, but movies aren't videogames. There has to be a story to impact the experience. And there is rarely any elements from the story here that actually flow. It's far from a blunder, but X-Men movies have become better than this. This movie is nothing more than a bucket of candies.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Boring, weakest X-Men movie so far","I love x-men comics and characters and mainly have been happy with the movie franchise. I really enjoyed First Class and DOFP and so eagerly anticipated this one. Such a shame. Apocalypse is one of the most powerful villains in Marvel history but failed to deliver on screen. He was powerful but not that scary. He was too small and should have been bigger dons more intimating. Wolverine does pop up but did not really enjoy the sequence. Quicksilver is a great character and I love the guy who plays the role. In DOFP he had an awesome sequence which they repeated in Apocalypse. It was good but almost felt like a repeat. Quicksilver is ridiculously powerful in these movies and is way off. He just ain't that powerful in the comics. Jean Grey I found boring, young Scott irritating. Jennifer Lawrence is going through the motions. Again she plays a character who just isn't as key of big in the comics but is portrayed as one of the big players in the recent movies and gets way too much screen time. This is only because it is Lawrence in the role and they want to capitalise of her Hunger Games fame. She even acts like Katniss Everdeen with all the kids looking up to her like their saviour. I like the bald and wheelchaired version of Charles better. Fassbender is always great as Magneto and continues to rock the role. Storm and Psylocke were fine but we found out little about them. Angel was really lame. The action sequences were pretty awful. It wound me up when Charles said ""Goodbye old friend"" as he and Eric said goodbyes and giggled. Magneto has just caused a major global catastrophe and killed loads of innocent people but all is forgiven cos he helped out at the end. I worry about the next movie. Dark Phoenix is such a key story to the franchise and I just think Sophie Turner will struggle to pull it off. I don't like her acting, it is so dull and monotone. A real step back for the x-men series. I hope they can recover",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Worst of Bryan Singer's X-MEN Movies,"X-MEN: APOCALYPSE is the worst film in the franchise since X-MEN: ORIGINS. I don't think any X-MEN movie will ever be as big a failure as ORIGINS, but believe me when I say I'd rather watch THE LAST STAND again before I ever revisit APOCALYPSE. That relative disappointment, while wreaking as much havoc with the source material as APOCALYPSE, was at least entertaining to sit through. I was so incredibly bored with this latest X- Men adventure that I could've fallen asleep in the theater. It's nearly two and a half hours long and I can count moments I actually enjoyed in this movie on one hand. My distaste for the movie is even more depressing because there has not been an X-Men comic storyline I've been more excited to see on the big screen than one featuring Apocalypse. This movie should've been a surefire success. It incorporates my favorite X-Men villain with promises then of seeing his Four Horsemen, and it has the chance to dramatically affect the future of the X-Men cinematic universe and perhaps take things in an exciting new direction. What we got instead was a lukewarm villain who never felt threatening in the least who's wasted in a dull globe-trotting ""adventure"" where we spend half the movie waiting for Apocalypse to recruit his Horsemen before returning to Egypt for a big messy final battle where Magneto, as the most powerful member of Apocalypse's posse, unleashes a CG debris storm visually identical to countless other summer blockbusters.For an Apocalypse storyline to have been done any real justice, it would've needed to been released as a trilogy of films. The brief moment of excitement I experienced when it was revealed the 2016 movie would adapt Apocalypse for the big screen was short-lived when I realized they'd be cramming everything into a single movie. There was a lot of promise in introducing this major villain but it was squandered pretty painfully. As Fox often does, they've made modifications to characters to fit their movie universe but the basic premise of Apocalypse remains intact. Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is the world's oldest mutant, dating back to ancient Egypt and beyond. He's a mutant of immense power who, as the movie opens, is having his essence transferred into a new host mutant which gives him a couple benefits: (1) a form of immortality and (2) access to his host mutant's abilities, adding them to Apocalypse's existing roster. He's betrayed in ancient times and left trapped under the rubble of a collapsed pyramid in stasis before he's uncovered in the early 1980's and reawakened. He takes a quick look around at the state of the world and despises that humans have risen to power over mutant-kind. Apocalypse, a firm believer in ""survival of the fittest"", decides to remind the world who's in charge. He recruits his ""Four Horsemen"", powerful mutants who serve as his lieutenants and protectors in his moments of weakness: in this case, he's collected Storm, Angel, Psylocke, and Magneto.Now just because the movie is boring and squanders an awesome opportunity doesn't mean it's a total bust. There are a few small moments I appreciated. There's a quip as the latest batch of X-kids are exiting a movie theater after having watched RETURN OF THE JEDI and someone (I think it was Jean Grey) cracks a joke about the third movie in trilogy is always the weakest. I'm sure they'd intended it as a dig at Brett Ratner's THE LAST STAND but, sorry Bryan Singer, it just as readily applies to APOCALYPSE and that's honestly how I read it. Around the same time, we get the Quicksilver sequence. I'm sure most people can agree that Quicksilver's slow-motion escape sequence in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST was the most memorable moment so the studios, also recognizing that, give us yet another in APOCALYPSE as Quicksilver arrives at the X-Mansion just in time to evacuate everyone in super speeds to the beat of Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"". A rehash from a studio hoping to capitalize on the love for the original sequence? Sure, but it works. And finally, the only other moment in the entire film where I felt the briefest flash of hope for this surely never-ending film franchise was the very last minute in the movie when the new (old) team of X-Men are assembled in the Danger Room in costumes that more accurate to their comic counterparts than they've ever been before in these Fox movies.APOCALYPSE was a real bummer of an X-MEN movie but I'm not going to let it ruin any anticipation of future movies. The series is now, what? 9 movies in? And we've had only a couple that disappointed me and one that was a total misfire. My problems with APOCALYPSE aren't enough to override the fun I've had in this series in so many of the other films. X-MEN movies aren't going anywhere anytime soon and my frustration with APOCALYPSE will eventually fade, and all we can do is hope that Singer gives us a better film when he returns with his new vision of the Dark Phoenix arc.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Good But Flawed Film,"So next on my list of X-Men films to watch was the end of the so called First Class trilogy Apocalypse and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the X-Men go up against the first ever mutant Apocalypse who has a group of mutants with him including Magneto.Main Character
This film struggles to really establish a main character here which I will talk more about in the review, but I have decided on a couple of them for the purpose of the review. Michael Fassbender plays Magneto once again and he acts rings around everybody else in this film. He has the emotion here, you really care about his character and feel sympathy for him, throughout this whole trilogy Magneto has been the most interesting character and this film he is given even more depth and it really makes him the character you attach to. James McAvoy is also back as Charles Xavier and he is good in the role, he continues his development from the previous film and it is nice to see him in the mentor role that we expect of him at this point. It is a bit of a shame though that he isn't actually in this film that much and feels like a bit of an afterthought at times.Supporting Characters
Evan Peters is back as Quicksilver and he is actually given more to do here. He was a real highlight from Days Of Future Past and he is just as great here and just adds a lot here and actually has a bit of a character arc which is nice to see. Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, Tye Sheridan as Cyclops and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler all do good jobs in their roles. Out of the new characters here they are the best and even though the film struggles to actually develop their characters they do their best with the role. Then we get to the rest of the cast, Oscar Issac plays Apocalypse and even though he is a great actor, I just didn't care about his character at all. You can tell he is trying, but he isn't given anything to work with, he is just a generic bad guy who wants to destroy the world and when you compare him to his comic book version it feels like a missed opportunity. I have liked Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique in the previous two films, but she is just annoying in this one. Her character has gone miles backwards from the previous film and it is just clear that she didn't want to sit in a make up chair which hurt her character in the end. Something similar happens with Nicholas Hoult as Beast here, I gave his character the benefit of the doubt in the previous film but here it also feels like he can't be bothered with the costume/makeup and again it hurts the character. But then there are those characters such as Storm, Angel and Psylocke who are just wasted and not given any time to shine.Story
Really the story isn't particularly interesting, but I am going to give it some positive thoughts due to how well it deals with Magnetos personal journey and story which is really interesting and makes you really care about him. But really the film is all over the place, it tries to introduce lots of new characters and it struggles to balance it, I mean Apocalypse doesn't do anything for over an hour which is pretty unacceptable. I mean then you get to his grand plan which is so boring and mundane that it doesn't bring you in and enough and cause you to truly get invested. Also there is a really jarring part of the film, I won't go into spoilers but it feels really out of place and literally like it is just here just to include a cameo that is good but not worth the effort.Script
The script is okay, there are some good dramatic dialogue and scenes here for sure, also there are a couple of nice bits of humour but not enough to make this film better. There aren't really any scenes of dialogue that stand out, and the way the film is written makes it feel like the film jumps all over the place and a bit hard to follow.Style
The style of the film is actually a big positive for me, the action scenes are great. They are over the top and exciting, they showcase the characters powers well and makes it feel really high scale that some of the other films don't. Also even though the story struggles, the film is actually paced quite well and the nearly 2 hours 30 mins runtime flies by quite quickly and actually makes this quite an easy watch.Overall
Overall, I think this is a good X-Men film. It does many things right but also does many things wrong. If you want to watch a fun action film the Apocalypse might be worth a watch but if you aren't a fan of the X-Men, this isn't going to change your mind.Rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Forgettable entry in the series.,"Oh, what have they done? The X-Men series built a reputation on being a stylish fantasy series. Unfortunately, this addition is not as stylish and didn't feel as special as the other films in the series.The film offers nothing to distinguish itself from they myriad of 'I want to rule the world' fantasy films out there. It played like just another one of these fantasy films, with familiar characters scattered here and there. 'Apocalypse' is also all over the place, with way too much going on, and definitely too CGI-heavy. The over-use of CGI removes every inch of realism (despite the film being a fantasy, off course, but I mean within the context of the genre). The most interesting scene by far was Quicksilver's rescue mission prior to a huge explosion. Very well done!Even the regular X-Men characters were not as interesting. Neither was the story. It was too formulaic and not gripping in the least. With a run time of 144 minutes (yawn) I was quite relieved when it ended. (Uhm, how did it end again? Oh well, see, its forgettable...)",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
nothing we haven't seen already,"Just ten years after an event that forever changed history, trouble still lies ahead for both mutant and human populations when the original, all-powerful mutant En Sabah Nur awakens with a mission to ""cleanse"" the world and build a better one. Naturally, this attracts the attention of Xavier, Magneto, Mystique et al who are caught in the path of his destruction. Lugubrious addition to the X-Men saga initially seems ambitious and exciting, but stumbles over its excessive narratives, provides little in terms of character, and fails to overcome a feeling of redundancy. Livens up a bit in its third act, but till then it doesn't bring much of anything new to the table, nor does it provide an honest ending to resolve any of the series' long-standing continuity issues. **",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A decent watch but didn't match the expectation,"Unfortunately, Singer's latest and likely last trip to the X-Men universe has its sights set lower than the altering of history. The movie was not so good match compared to its predecessor Days of Future Past however the actors gets engaged themselves very well (including new starcast, Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan). All the thematic interest and character dimension that's defined the best of this series falls away for a conventional action display. The final battle sequel was not so convincing. Instead of using 3D graphics, Singer used wide shots for every X-man battle. Overall, the movie was not matching its previous films, however Singer manages to still make it watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It would be one thing if they conpromised looks for talent, but she isnt a good actor either. Psylocke is the pinnacle of hot chicks in comics and Olivia has short stumpy calves attached to bulky gapless thighs and hips that look like square blocks, complete with no butt. Im not body shaming at all, its exactly the same as if i thought i could play Thor, i cant for obvious reasons.

Using the MCU Formula,"The reason I think people don't like this one as much as the prior 2 is they turned it into an mcu movie, too much off key comedy even to the point of interrupting scenes of drama.

-times when the dialogue is poorly written
-cgi that looks worse than the prior 2 films
-why is Mystique with the X-men at the end when she's a villain in X-men (could they have built up to X-men 1 without creating more timeline confusion)

"the best one, excellent effects in the Quicksilver scene's","What a coincidence, just seen Gods Of Egypt (2016) and immediately I went to see X Men Apocalypse. When the flick started it immediately took us back to the Egypt era, I was confused. What has this to do with the X men universe but it came clear quickly. The oldest mutant came from that era and he is back to conquer everything.This time the X men flick is full of action, not that much of talking going on like in the earlier flicks. And the effects used are awesome, especially when Quicksilver is doing his thing. That sequence is superb. There's even a bit of fun to catch if you look closely. But the villain too, Apocalypse is excellent too.Even as all characters are done by new actors it didn't bother me at all. This one delivered the real stuff. Open ending of course so here we go.

Enjoyably Mediocre,"I'm quite torn about this movie, as it is quite a 'different' movie. It has an intriguing enough story line, with mostly convincing characters and impressive visuals...I certainly enjoyed it while watching it, but after the fact I could not find a reason why I enjoyed it so much.It is certainly a film with many flaws. As an 'action movie', the action scenes were not too innovative or even impressive. The fights are largely what has been seen before in the X-Men franchise, just less of it compared to Days of Future Past. As a 'superhero ensemble piece', the fact that it was an 'ensemble' definitely took away from individual story arcs. With nobody really developing from the start of the film to the end of the film, at least not clearly. As a movie, the plot was incredibly cliché without many stakes.Superhero movies don't necessarily need heroes to die in order to have stakes, it just needs emotional weight and connection between characters, and these connections being morphed or broken (like Captain America: Civil War). Apocalypse however, had no such stakes, only the threat of world destruction...which obviously would not be accomplished.Though character arcs were lacking in this film, performances by the leads were mainly good. With the clear exception of Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, who continues to feel like she has no connection with the character whatsoever. Both McAvoy and Fassbender gave great performances as usual, with great chemistry between them as usual. Especially with that one scene of Fassbender in the woods, the emotional layers in his performance were incredible. All the new X-Men also gave good performances, though the ensemble element drowned them and cut their development short.All up, Apocalypse wasn't the worse X-Men movie, but it is far from the best. It's still worth a watch for X-Men franchise fans, but I doubt it will entice any new viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
People like this garbage,It's pretty crazy how many people really like this movie. In my opinion this is one of the worst xmen movies. That being said there are some positives. Michael Fassbender was brilliant and to do what he did with magneto with so little to work with Is phenomenal. And I'd be lying if I said that the sweet dreams are made of these scene wasn't one of the best scenes in supervo media.But that's really all I liked about it. Oscar iaasc was really wasted on this poor film. Apocalypse was such a lame villian compared to how cool he should have been. The whole Villian tries to make mutants the superior race kinda fell flat in this one compared to the other one. It feels kind of lazy and drags on too long.

Visually spectacular but underwhelming,"The trailer for this latest instalment of the X-Men reboot/prequel franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse had my quite excited. I thoroughly enjoyed both X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days Of Future Past so I figured this third film in the series is sure to deliver.I won't go as far as saying that I didn't enjoy this film, because I did. The effects were flawless, the action sequences were amazing and it was great to see a little bit more about the history of the X-Men. However, the movie left me feeling slightly underwhelmed.Played by the always engaging Oscar Isaac, the main villain in the film lacked motivation for me. I found that whilst I knew what his aim was, I didn't truly connect with what his motivations were. I also felt like there was a huge amount of 'filler' scenes in the lead up to the climax, which had me a little bored. Not only this, but being a stickler for consistency and details, there were two things that bothered me which may not have even registered to any other (sane) human being.Firstly, Sophie Turner plays a younger version of Jean Grey who you may remember from quite a few of the previous X-Men films (played by Famke Janssen). Granted I haven't seen the previous films in a while but I can't really see the resemblance there – this was particularly bothersome to me when all other characters' prequel counterparts were cast so well. It may be a little nit-picky but I can't change the fact that pathetic things like this annoy me.Secondly, we come to be introduced to an early incarnation of the character Storm. I won't spoil the film for you but all I will say is that she is meant to originate from Egypt yet miraculously when we come to the 'modern day' X-Men, Storm (played by Halle Berry at the time), has a pretty clean cut American accent. You may recall my previous qualms regarding Marvel and the astounding evolving of accents at super- speed in my review for Captain America: Civil War. Again, something that most people won't bat an eyelid at but it's the details that are overlooked which disappoints me. It gives off a vibe that the filmmakers just didn't care enough, and in turn, why should I care about this movie and the characters that reside within it's realm?Other than these small intricacies, I will still maintain that it is an enjoyable film and I do anticipate what's in store for the mutants in films to come. I just hope they at least get their accents right in the next onemotherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The X-Men franchise has lost its touch,"X-Men Apocalypse left me with the same feeling I got after Batman vs. Superman. I'm getting tired of those franchises putting it on too thick. You know why Deadpool was so fantastic? It was fresh and fast paced. I am getting sick of re-watching origin stories (Magneto turning evil, then back to good for the third (?) time) of every X-Men character, while having to content myself with villains that get NO character development. I mean, true, the Deadpool-villains were one-dimensional too, but that was about the movie's only flaw. This time? Psylocke is just a pretty face and body with a cool weapon. Angel is just an angry wing man.The other two were forgettable as well. Worst of all the chief villain. Jeez! I just can't care about the action, when the characters are that bland. (Like in Batman vs Superman, when a totally underdeveloped Wonder Woman joins the finale. Nobody cares, right?) In the good old days of X-Men (1), these characters had some flavor to them. The studio was having fun with them. That kid Pyro, for example? Remember him? The only fun character left now is Quicksilver. Rebecca Romjin, now SHE was a fun Mystique. I think I'm ready to let go of the X-Men franchise now. Too bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome!,"This will be short and to the point. The movie was great. Not perfection, but how many movies are? That being said, some people here who gives this movie a low rating are either difficult to please or just brain dead and is hard of understanding. If your beef is that the movie doesn't mesh with the comics exactly, then you need therapy. Try using your little noggin to figure out why that is. I only gave it an 8 be a use I don't rate anything a perfect score because there is always something out of place, even if I don't notice it. I'll definitely see it again, though. Apparently IMDb wants me to dig deep within my soul and come up with more filler so that I can post this review. So be it then. I think this was THE X-men movie we've been waiting for. Days of future past was awesome to, just not as awesome. I can't wait until the next one. Mr. Sinister, baby!

You Either like it or Dislike it But enjoy it.,"Just like B v S this year, X-MEN: Apocalypse is super-ambitious but just doesn't know how put all its ideas together in a very interesting way. But unlike BvS X-men partially succeeded in actually making you feel that there are some missing story lines or backstories that could help make this into a really good film.Don't get wrong I enjoy this movie for about 2/3 of it, but mainly because I lowered my expectations--to the point where I checked my brain out of the door, but it is a pretty straight forward story which lacks any form of complexity--which only engrosses you here and there, and for the rest of its running-time makes you wonder, ""uumm, I think Fox is tired of the X-men franchise.""The Direction is pretty tired at this point when it comes to Singer's Vision of the X-men. I don't know if I can see him direct another X-men movie, but interestingly enough Apocalypse left me wanting more.A great Cast, lead by Michael Fassbender as Magneto, who for the most part has a pretty interesting story, but just like the movie itself it collapsed under the fact ""we need a big CGI-heavy battle at the end of this, which feels ""small"" in comparison to Captain America: Civil War's either fight scenes, but they tried. Then you have Oscar Isaac who is heavily underutilized as the main villain Apocalypse. His story has a strong beginning, rather interesting and just plummeted into disaster by the end. And I asked myself, would it have been better if Apocalypse was completely Motion Capture (like they did with Thanos in the Avengers movie) and make him looked more like the Comic Book and Animated TV series version. Just saying, it wouldn't take anything away from the movie.Throughout the movie I asked myself, what is Apocalypse big vision or motivation? Is he supposed to be a threat to the world or the X-men? For a man with all that power at his disposal why does he need the ""Four Horsemen"" to conquer the world? And even when he has the Four Horsemen under his control He doesn't do much but reaping the Earth/Nations Apart; monumental landmarks among other things. But not once, I was at the edge of my seat. No Threats or Danger. Nothing at all to make you invest in it emotionally, or cerebral enough like its processors.The Visual Effects are great, but so repetitive and common place that they don't ""WOW"" you, but the simple moving and establishing shots made up for that.And for the STORY/SCREENPLAY, it is the complete letdown. It Could've been way better than what was presented considering the Apocalypse story-line is one of the most herald X-men comics.With that been said, I enjoyed Apocalypse for what it is. I think Superhero Movie fatigue is setting in even for the filmmakers. So, am I looking forward to another X-men film? You bet I am. But, in 10 years or so, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy Apocalypse...it is just a Movie Matinée in its core-a Transformers movie per say-but with common sense.NOTE: I don't know if Apocalypse worth its $234 million price tag. They could have made a better movie with half of that.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X6: Judgment Day,"""Days of Future Past"", the previous X-Men entry, had visions of a stark post- apocalyptic future ala Terminator, and now comes ""Apocalypse"", taking cues from eschatological lore with its titular megavillain threatening to destroy all to achieve his own vision of grandeur, forcing the X-Men to unite as one to stop this fallen god. It's pretty darn good.Do not be fooled by its comic-book brand; this is a biblical quasi-disaster film disguised as a superhero film, chock full of thrilling action and urgent, no- nonsense heroics, something that is sorely lacking in most superhero films today (I'm looking at you, BvS and Civil War). Both movies lack the human touch that Singer has given ever-so generously in his films, making the X-Men grounded and human while blossoming with their gifts. The stark difference between this film and Civil War/the DCU shows during one particularly harrowing scene involving Fassbender's Magneto in a Polish forest, which elevates this into a real film with real characters. The humor seems natural, too, save for another scene of fine trolling involving audience favorite Quicksilver that is all too similar to his scene in the previous film.Still, despite a script that offers nothing new to the table, hats off to director Bryan Singer, proving himself yet again as the golden goose of the franchise, for delivering the superhero goods with balanced, kinda old-fashioned storytelling and a plethora of fine performances from all cast members, especially Oscar Isaac as its titular villainous anti-Messiah. It's very operatic, overtly theatrical without being hammy, and it contrasts nicely with the rest of the grounded characters, truly fitting for a villain named ""Apocalypse.""",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not as good as the previous two films, but entertaining.","When X -Men first came out in the year 2000 comic book movies were still finding their feet as we didn't yet have the MCU, The Dark Knight trilogy or even Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy. Now 16 years later the X-Men Universe has been joined by Marvel and DC in the superhero movie universe brigade/thing. Having helmed three of the previous X-Men films, including Days of Future Past, Bryan Singer has again been trusted in bringing the mutants to the big screen.It's now the 1980's and the first mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) has awoken and displeased by the culture he has awoken within (perhaps if he had awoken in the 60's he would have been more chill) decides to eliminate humans from the planet so that mutants can truly rule supreme. He recruits the orphan girl Storm (Alexandra Shripp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn), cage fighter Angel (Ben Hardy) and everyone's favourite metal detector Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Elsewhere Professor X (James McAvoy) is running his institute for the gifted with Hank (Nicholas Hoult) and new student Scott/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) arrives alongside current student Jean Grey (Sophie Turner). Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) also stops by with Nightcrawler (Kodi-Smit Mcphee) as she is worried about Magneto's well being following a traumatic event. Quicksilver (Evan Peters) is also alerted to this as he feels he needs to bond with Magneto who is his father. Whilst Professor X looks into Magneto's disappearance he comes across Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) again, as there were not enough sub-plots apparently.Basically there's a lot going on, and it's mostly entertaining but doesn't really feel weighted in anything because there isn't enough time for the film to fit everything in. Apocalypse was one of my favourite villains from the old cartoon series and I didn't feel his more 'subtle' design was effective. Oscar Isaac is a terrific actor but his performance felt very repetitive and stifling, not because of his lack of ability, but there wasn't enough time or nuance devoted in the film's run time to keep him interesting. All of the returning players perform ably; Fassbender delivers a fine mix of gaunt expressions and passionate vengeance of a man going over the edge. Whilst the newcomers all perform promisingly in their roles they don't get enough material to truly flourish and end up simply being promising additions. Whereas in Captain America Civil War Tom Holland was a great Peter Parker/Spiderman in Apocalypse Sophie Turner seems that she could be a good Jean Grey, and Tye Sheridan could be a good Cyclops etc. but they hover on the periphery battling for screen time with all the other characters. Having stolen the show in Days of Future of Past with a breath-taking slow motion (or fast motion I suppose?) sequence Quicksilver returns with a similar scene here. It isn't as good, going for a bigger is better approach, it is funny in parts but lacks the surprise and intricate detail it had in Days of Future Past. Then we get lots of worldwide destruction that makes Man of Steel look conservative by comparison, say what you will about DC's attitude to city wide destruction at least in Batman vs Superman they showed the destruction from a personal perspective to add dramatic weight. In Apocalypse we watch as cities are sucked into the sky and feel simply that the animators did a stylish job with it, but no empathy whatsoever.Despite my hang ups X-Men: Apocalypse has enough impressive action beats to be entertaining without being immersive. There are some funny gags, and impressive special effects but very little dramatic stakes. It's definitely the weakest film of the ""New class"" trilogy (First Class and Days of Future Past being superior) but with an impressive cast to sell it does the job.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A True Superhero Movie,"This movie is not without flaws. So, why did I give it a perfect score? Because no movie is without flaws and this one surpassed my expectations and took me on a journey that I had never been on before. Now, this movie is not to be watched as a standalone film. If you are thinking about watching this movie, watch First Class and Days of Future Past back to back. The reason for this is because Apocalypse has so much emotion packed into it that it would be lost if you haven't recently watched the previous two. That being said, this movie was incredibly balanced on the emotional scale. I found myself feeling anger, sadness, happiness, and suspense at different, perfectly timed points throughout the film. There was never a dull moment or a scene I could cut out. Everything just worked. That being said, there were a couple of minor flaws, all of which can be overlooked by the full scale of the movie. I also must applaud director Bryan Singer, as he managed to take over 10 super-powered mutants, put them all in one movie, and give them all equal standing throughout the film. I didn't see too much of one character or too little of another (though I would've liked to see more of all of them). Every character had their strengths and weaknesses that fit together with their own individual stories. And my biggest praise for this film is that it did something that no other superhero movie has really done for me: every character pushed the limits of their powers. It wasn't like the Avengers where every time they throw their hammer or punch a bad guy they don't even show a sign of struggle. I could feel the characters giving it their all as they fought off a truly formidable foe. Everything in this movie worked: the humor, the action, the story; all of it. I could nitpick here and there, but I won't, because it seems like the rest of the critics have done enough of that already. If you go into this movie with the last two under your belt and an open mind, you will come out feeling like you can take on the world.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Poor antagonist, flat screenplay and lacks overall innovation, but holds its ground rather loosely with likable familiar characters and epic action sequences","Watching X-Men: Apocalypse got me mired in conflicted thoughts as it keeps blowing hot and cold too frequently. Firstly, when you cast such a charismatic and talented actor like Oscar Isaac - you don't hide him under a thick layer of prosthetics where you neither get to see him nor he can show his acting prowess. Secondly, such an uninteresting character for an antagonist doesn't work if a movie has to rise above the heap of well-written superhero movies. Lastly, one would expect Bryan Singer who is the creator of this universe on the big screen with an experience of creating tense thrillers would come up with such a flat screenplay.This installment goes right to the start with the emergence of the early mutant through a ritual in ancient Egypt. When this procedure was interrupted by a few rebels, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) lies in hibernation for thousands of years and is resurrected by a bunch of modern Egyptians for unknown reasons. Upon waking up, he catches up with the history thus far by inserting his hand inside a television that was playing a news channel - Duh. His modus operandi includes recruiting 4 other mutants and calling them 'The Four Horsemen' - the Biblical reference to bringer of Apocalypse and he goes about recruiting them with neither shortlisting from a potential list of candidates nor verifying their capabilities. They all even gather for a pose with Metallica's 'Four Horsemen' blaring in the background symbolically which was too cheesy.On the other hand, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) seems to have mastered his art and removes all of Moira's (Rose Byrne) memories and conveniently puts it back at the end - that's one hell of a memory management. While the Professor is focussing his energies towards making his school for mutants bigger than it is, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) is hailed as a hero for her efforts in the previous installment in preventing a disaster at the White House and she has a lot of budding mutants looking up to her. Erik (Michael Fassbender) is living a peaceful life and even has a family until an incident provokes him to use his special powers which eventually leads to the death of his family. Apocalypse disturbs this delicate balance of their peaceful co-existence which starts the fight of Good against Evil.It starts promisingly (not in any spectacular way though) on both the fronts - emergence of the early mutant and meet & greet of the existing mutants but loses the plot midway. First with the negatives - there is no edge-of-the-seat screenplay which was a marquee element of the first 2 installments of the prequel series, the visual effects though ambitious - lacks the finishing it requires (where some explosions look like they are straight from the 90s action movies), the spectacular Quicksilver (Evan Peters) show from 'The Days of Future Past' is disintegrated into an insensitive and uninteresting romp. Even after having reality expectations that is apt for a comic book remake, it gets too silly and childish many a times without the cheeky factor. Even the cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is so muddled that I wish it wasn't there. The inexplicable need to destroy infrastructure or killing innocent civilians or police personnel without leading to a conscious consequence never grows into a solid drama.It does have some bright spots though, especially the refreshing character of Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), great character development for Raven, subdued performance by Michael Fassbender, ambitious visual effects and an epic background score. GoT fans get to see a powerful and independent Sansa (as Jean Grey (played by Sophie Turner)) who isn't short of attitude as well. It does seem to have reintroduced the origins of most characters which completes the cycle to merge the two trilogies.Poor antagonist, flat screenplay and lacks overall innovation, but holds its ground rather loosely with likable familiar characters and epic action sequences.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Spoiler-Free Review,"The X-Men are back in the sixth movie in the X-Men franchise and the fourth to be directed by Bryan Singer. While this is the end of the second X-Men trilogy, it also feels like a new beginning. The main thing to understand with X-Men: Apocalypse is that you shouldn't listen to most of the critics lambasting it for its vast number of characters and story lines. Even though there is a lot that goes on in X-Men: Apocalypse, it's all emotionally engaging and most importantly, fun.X-Men: Apocalypse takes place ten years after the events of Days of Future Past in 1983. The world's very first mutant from Ancient Egypt, a being named Apocalypse who thinks himself a god, awakens from suspended animation and sees how the world has become without his leadership. Apocalypse sets out to destroy almost the entire Earth to start humanity over anew, with only those pesky X-Men standing in his way. In a nutshell, that's the entire movie, but what gives X- Men: Apocalypse its emotional resonance is the fact that it is the sixth X-Men movie.This is a direct sequel in the way that The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars. The movie makers don't waste time reminding us who these characters are or what they're doing, they simply assume we've watched every other X-Men movie. While there might be a few passive fans of the franchise who do not like this approach, as a fan who has seen all of the X-Men movies multiple times, I was on cloud nine practically the entire runtime. On top of that, this one and Days of Future Past feel like the movie makers are finally embracing the more comic bookish nature of the X-Men. There are a lot more fantastical images in this one that look and feel as if they were taken straight from the pages of the comic books, and as a comic book fan, that's just icing on an already delicious cake.Overall, I absolutely loved X-Men: Apocalypse and it's my personal favorite superhero movie of 2016 so far. I know those are fighting words, but all of my favorite X-Men are represented in this movie and shine brighter than these movies have ever let them shine. From the teenage reintroductions to Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Nightcrawler, it's like Bryan Singer was reading my mind Professor X style to deliver the X-Men movie I've wanted for years.I give X-Men: Apocalypse a 9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not the Best in The Franchise, Not the Worst,","X-Men: Apocalypse is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a great cast. It certainly has some great moments and a slew of excellent new cast members playing younger versions of well known X-Men characters. Sophie Turner really stands out as Jean Grey, Tye Sheridan is an excellent fit for Cyclops and Kodi Smit-Mcphee has great physicality as Nightcrawler.The story itself is ineffective, it never really pulled me in, lingering on long, comic book elements to ensure that the whole Apocalypse story makes sense to people. The villain himself is also dull, Oscar Isaac is a stellar actor, but there was nothing he could do to make this character's cliché dialogue unique.There is also far too much action in this film, that takes away from developing these new characters and further establishing Professor X and Magneto. The biggest downfall, for me, had to be Jennifer Lawrence, who I do usually like as an actress, but her heart was not here at all, she looked tired and bored of this series throughout, not even making the effort of acting like she wanted to be there.The fact that this whole movie is basically an origin story of how Professor X lost his hair does not say much. While it has its moments, X-Men: Apocalypse gets tedious and is overall a disappointing installment for the franchise.The X-Men must reunite to put a stop to a powerful mutant known as Apocalypse.Best Performance: James McAvoy / Worst Performance: Jennifer Lawrence",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Muddled. Bloated. Uninspiring.,"Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class was a highly refreshing take on the origin stories of the significant members of X-Men universe. A reboot of the series (sort of), it made really effective use of the provided clean slate to put up a thoroughly gripping tale that delivered on all fronts. Three years later, X-Men: Days of Future Past followed which allowed director Bryan Singer to return to the franchise he himself brought to life back in 2000. And it didn't just succeed as a worthy sequel to First Class but also served as a fitting conclusion to the original X-Men trilogy.What impressed me most about Days of Future Past was the remarkable balance it exhibited while juggling different timelines, in addition to its exquisite handling of the arcs of multitudes of characters, all carried out without compromising with the entertainment factor. The post-credit sequence in that movie did tease an ambitious storyline for the next instalment and that's what X- Men: Apocalypse is. But this time, Bryan Singer fails to duplicate what he pulled off so seamlessly in his last venture, for Apocalypse is a muddled, bloated & uninspiring second sequel that works only in bits n pieces.The story of X-Men: Apocalypse takes place in the 1980s, a decade after the events of the last film. Charles Xavier (Professor X) has created a haven for his students in his school, enrolling troubled mutants like Scott Summers & Jean Grey. Eric Lehnsherr (Magneto) is living a low-profile life in Poland with a family of his own, while Raven (Mystique) has kept herself busy over the years, freeing enslaved mutants from their captivity. But all of them are brought into conflict when En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse, the world's first mutant, awakens after centuries and, disillusioned with what the world has become in his absence, decides to destroy & remake it.Directed by Bryan Singer, Apocalypse opens on a promising note, for the prologue set in ancient Egypt that covers the tale of En Sabah Nur is intriguing, brilliantly shot & brims with excitement. Even the segment dealing with Eric's life in Poland is quite fascinating but the remainder of the plot fails to keep the interest alive as it delves into a familiar territory and ultimately finishes on a dull, predictable & uninteresting note. Simon Kinberg's screenplay isn't up to the mark either plus it appears as if he wrote the script in a hurry by skipping over deeper character introspections & proper polishing of the final draft, just so that the film can make it to its theatrical release date.Production design team once again does a stellar job at recreating the given timeline. Cinematography aims for a darker tone than its predecessors, the desaturated colour palette adds a grim vibe to its frames, and although the entire picture is encapsulated with an overcast feel, the images retain its sharpness & clarity. Editing is a total mess, for its 144 minutes of runtime is severely felt during the second half, many moments end up overstaying its welcome as the plot meanders over trivial stuff, and overall, the different subplots fail to merge into a unified whole. Visual effects is state-of-the-art stuff yet much of it comes off as nothing but empty spectacle, and even John Ottman's score is a letdown for the most part.Coming to the performances, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult & Rose Byrne return to reprise their respective roles of Professor X, Magneto, Mystique, Beast & Moira MacTaggert and all of them exhibit greater comfort in their character's skin and play their part convincingly. McAvoy & Fassbender once again stand out from the rest, Lawrence is no slouch either, while both Hoult & Byrne do a capable job with what they are given. Also returning to the fold is Evan Peters as Quicksilver and he pretty much steals the show with another swashbuckling slow-mo sequence but this time, he's beaten by Hugh Jackman whose cameo as Wolverine is a major highlight of X-Men: Apocalypse, in my opinion.The new additions comprise of Oscar Isaac (En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse), Sophie Turner (Jean Grey), Tye Sheridan (Cyclops), Kodi Smit-McPhee (Nightcrawler), Olivia Munn (Psylocke), Alexandra Shipp (Storm) & Ben Hardy (Angel). Playing what's supposed to be the most powerful mutant to surface on the big screen so far, Isaac is totally wasted in his role as Apocalypse fails to live up to his image, is never for once intimidating & is just another addition in the long list of clichéd villains. Turner is more Sansa Stark than Jean Grey here, Smit-McPhee is downright hilarious and plays the comic relief part to near-perfection, while Munn chips in with a strong input. But since she isn't given enough screen time, she is unable to fully explore her character.On an overall scale, lacking the freshness of First Class and creative delights of Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse is the weakest chapter of the three, and it ultimately is to this prequel series what The Last Stand was to the original trilogy. Having directed three films of this franchise previously, this is the first time Singer has struggled to put up a gripping tale about mutants on the film canvas. Not everything is a disaster here but some little refinements in the script would have resulted in a wholly different & better movie. Taking too long to set all its pieces on the board, providing no depth to its new set of characters (especially the main villain), ineffectively handling the arcs of returning characters, putting more emphasis on CGI spectacle & overloaded action, further fractured by its terribly written climax, and downright mediocre in content, X-Men: Apocalypse continues the long-existing Hollywood tradition of finishing a trilogy on a weak, underwhelming & frustrating note.

If you don't like this kind of superhero movies just don't watch it then,Despise a lot of negative reviewers that score this movie the absolute lowest possible X-Men: Apocalypse still manages to score an above 7 stars rating. That resumes it all. If you take all the scores and have a score of seven or more you can be sure the movie isn't as bad as some negative critics want to make you believe. It might not be the best X-Men movie ever but it sure is entertaining enough to me. And the story isn't bad at all. Au contrary I thought the script was well written with a lot of action like we are used to. The characters are what they are. If you don't like superheroes then you should just not watch these kind of movies. There are plenty enough other movies to chose from if you're not into this genre. So let people that like this genre have a bit of fun and stop the unfounded negative reviews.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Only criticism i have is i expected a little more form the four horsemen but that isn't enough to slate this film like the critics have. Once more all the actors are superb especially Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse who is very menacing and sinister. Tye Sheridan is a fantastic Scott Summers, as for Sophie Turner well she is superb as Jean Grey perfection.

"A Few Good Moments, Otherwise Unremarkable","The X-Men movies have been really hit or miss lately. Days of Future Past is good, Logan is really good; X-Men Origins: Wolverine is bad, Dark Phoenix is really bad. Apocalypse isn't as bad as X-Men Origins, but it's not as good as Logan or Days of Future Past. The problem with Apocalypse is that it really doesn't do anything that particularly stands out from the other X-Men movies. With superhero movies in general, people often complain about the plots being too similar, and this is where that comes into effect. At least with the MCU and some of the DCEU, each movie feels different because of new environments of elements of different genres being incorporated, even if there's a lot of shared plot elements between the movies. With the X-Men movies, on the other hand, you have the same characters, many of the same ideas, and many shared locations.There are two particularly memorable scenes: the first is the opening fight scene, which takes place in Ancient Egypt. The second is the Quicksilver scene. Anyone who saw it knows what that means. A lot of people complained about Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Apocalypse, but I liked it. It's very different from the comics, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. He felt distinctly Egyptian, which sets him apart aesthetically from other similar villains. Other than that, the returning cast is pretty good, and the effects are nice as well. The soundtrack has some epic moments in it as well. All in all, Apocalypse is a middle-of-the-pack superhero movie, as well as a middle-of-the-pack X-Men movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A solid entry into the series, but not on par with its two excellent predecessors","X-Men: Apocalypse is the latest installment in the X-Men franchise and the third film in the rebooted series. While not on par with its two excellent predecessors, I still found it to be a solid entry into the series. However, I recommend seeing the original two films first.In 1983, the mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) awakens from a millennial-long sleep and vows to destroy mankind and take over the world. With the help of his Four Horsemen; Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Archangel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Apocalypse plans to create a world for mutants only. It is up to the X-Men, lead by Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), to work together and prevent Apocalypse and his team from succeeding.Filled with all of the explosive action and comic relief one would expect from the franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse unfortunately falls a bit short of being equally as good as the two great films that preceded it. The story would be hard to follow unless one has seen the previous films. With that said, I still really enjoyed the film for what it was. I particularly enjoyed the way that it expended on Magneto's story and showed how he just wants to be accepted for who he is, despite his mutant powers. I also really liked Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones) as the young Jean Grey. However, it is Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who steals the show in some of the funniest comic relief I have ever seen in a Marvel film. I can only recommend this film to those who have seen all of the previous X-Men Movies, if you haven't then I say watch them first.I rate it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The weakest of the X-Men prequels,"After the game changer that was X-Men Days of Future Past, we got X-Men Apocalypse, a movie set in the 1980s that mixes awesome action and visual effects with a confusing plotline that draws heavily from the culture of the 80s mixed in with the comic books. The only good thing in this movie is Quicksilver, Wolverine in his next to last role in the franchise, and the use of Beethoven's 7th in the film score. Worthy of a rental. Hopefully Dark Phoenix puts the franchise to rest just like Logan made the end of Wolverine.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not The Grand Finale We Hoped For,"X-Men: Apocalypse is a jumbled and sometimes confusing mess of a movie. From the unbalanced CGI, to the one-dimensional title villain and the dreadful, mismatched pacing throughout, this is a car crash that you cant help but to watch. Not because of the gripping story or its characters but because you're waiting for something to happen to make you care about this movie. This film (as well as the previous 2 films) are carried and driven by Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Magneto. You see and feel his pain of wanting to do right and live a normal life but is always thwarted by some circumstance that causes conflict within himself. Oscar Issac's Apocalypse is a character that is limited to one- dimensional views of a world he left behind and has now rejoined. One of the most intelligent and fearsome of all the Marvel foes, he has been reduced to basically giving his outlook on humanity but really has no substance as to why he wants to cleanse the world for only the strong to survive. Arch Angel doesn't do much until the end fighting scene. Psylocke basically followed suit but did the best with what she was given (Which wasn't much at all) and Storm portrayed as she was in the comics and Alexandra Shipp just might make you forget about Halle Berry (even with a believable African accent) The introduction of the new timeline X-Men characters are a fresher take on the ones that we have come to love and trust. Jean Grey is solid and Cyclops is actually played with some kind of conviction. Problem with this is, in an ensemble cast they get taken out and re- added to the shuffle when its convenient to push the plot forward which doesn't give you much time to get acquainted with the new actors much. Of course the person who stole the show in the last movie does it here again. Quicksilver holds it down in all his scenes and the ""Mansion Run"" is going to be the most talked about scene of the whole movie, ITS THAT DAMN FUN TO WATCH.The thing is this: Its not a bad movie, it was average at best. First Class and Days of Future Past raised the bar for a grand finale that was severely underwhelming. In a series of movies, you build up to the finale and it has to end with a bang. The movie had a couple good action scenes but it cant make up its mind as to what it wants to be and focus on. Is it actually about Apocalypse? Does it want to focus on Mystique trying to find her place in the world? Erik and Charles not seeing eye to eye due to different ideals again? Jean and Scott learning to understand each other? Quicksilver's revelation? There are too many different stories that are trying to be told and if feels like a mess. A bunch of scenes with little or no cohesion. You could see what they were trying to do but the execution was severely flawed.Sad to say that this doesn't look or feel like a Bryan Singer movie, but more like an ensemble of directors that lacked any kind of cohesion with the scenes. The dry attempts at humor and way too much cheesiness only cheapened what could have been a solid send off. This movie didn't end the trilogy with a bang, not even a whimper. It was more like ""Meh"". Make sure you stay for the end credit scene because marvel fanboys and purists might geek out quite a bit. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Blame it to the Russo's,"The movie starts with unrealistic CGI, for a ritual ground that has been used for thousand years, everything looks so fresh and brand new, with sort of high-tech equipment. It should be old and mystical. Then it follows with some gore actions which made my kids close their eyes. I beginning to think I made mistake by taking them to watch this movie. Thanks God that it become more kid-friendly throughout the time. While my kids have quite a good time, I think it's below my expectation.Take the explosion that happens in the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. It make my kids laughs, while I feel that scene is not suppose to be funny. And then we meet Wolverine and Col Stryker, which turns out they're just cameos. And then the action.Perhaps I put my expectation about the action quite high, because they are Marvel's characters just like Captain America and friends. And Civil Wars has just released so it's unavoidable to compare both. Civil Wars is full of spectacular action, with heroes which not just rely only on their gift but primarily on their skills. While this X- Men movie, the actions have simple, uncreative choreography which just relying on their gifts. These heroes almost has no skill. Blame it to the Russo's whose made the final battle in this X-Men series looks like just some people trying to hit their opponent as hard as they can.If I watched this movie alone, I may give lower score.

special effects does not a movie make,"They tried to just completely wow and overwhelm with special effects. Story line and character development was non-existent. Apocalypse casting and makeup was atrocious; he should be huge/muscular, intimidating, scary, a force to be reckoned with. They should have made this into a 2 part movie and really developed character background stories and an actual plot. It was hilarious and definitely unintentional foreshadowing when Jean Gray/Scott Summers/etc saw Return of the Jedi and jean says, ""the third movie is never as good"". The only reason I give this movie a rating as high as 6/10 is because the wolverine scene was amazing and so was the fight between Charles Xavier and Apocalypse in Xavier's mind.

Apart from that we also have a really good end sequence (action), that really helps the movie out.

Mummy Resurrected Meets the X-Men,"""Why be different when you can look like everybody else?"" Nightcrawler (the blue-hued teleporter) questions Mystique (the also naturally-blue-hued shapeshifter) in X2, to which she pointedly responds, ""because we shouldn't have to"".In The Last Stand, Storm, at learning that non-mutants have developed a cure that permanently suppresses the Mutant X-gene, cries, ""a cure for all mutants? But we don't need a cure. Since when have we become a disease?""And yet, yet there are others who feel quite differently. Those who will give anything to feel 'normal' and are only too willing to give up that which makes them special. Because just as there is no doubt that innate (and often intimidating) extra-ordinariness renders a mutant as formidable, so too it is certain that it makes one aberrant in the eyes of others, such power-possessors only just about managing to outpace vilification, then rejection, social ostracization and even the threat of extermination.Which path then should the gifted choose for themselves? Should one live as a proud pariah or eternally condemn oneself to the fate of inert impotence? The question itself poses a seething paradox, because even if one were to pick the former things won't ever grow easy, the risks attendant with pacifism or aggression, the only two approaches available, then springing to life, accentuated further by the one immutable dimension to the mutant conundrum: the inability of humans to rise above their prejudices.It is these emotionally resonant thematic threads that have since its inception set the XMen series apart from other superhero productions, interwoven as they are through deftly layered and penetrating allegory: the omnipotent thesis being the trials and inner conflicts of social misfits, the discrimination and dilemmas faced by minorities, be they ethnic, sexual, religious or whatever.Should a people assert the right to coexist under the umbrella of a proud and distinct identity or should they always aspire to blend in with the mainstream? Is society hardwired to fear those who look and behave differently? Is it possible to convince people to think in a manner that runs counter to their primal instincts?Apocalypse is a great spectacle, as are all the XMen movies without exception. But let's be honest here. Really honest. It is not the best film of the franchise, the thus far unsurpassed one being Days of Future Past followed closely by First Class and X2.And this is chiefly down to the fact that this latest instalment, save for Magneto's backstory, which in retrospect appears tired and stale, fails to pose any searing questions or to explore the though- processes and predicaments of the characters.Instead we're served just another superhero movie populated with a galaxy of CGI-enhanced mutants, whose motivations despite the actors' tremendous performances (especially from the latest entrants), fall emotionally flat.What's more, whilst the previous two instalments in the series drew on historical events in the time-period in which they were set (Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam War), Apocalypse could well have occurred at any time period. The film is none the richer for being set in the 80s.The plot is straightforward. In 1983, the mutant Apocalypse, having amassed the powers of many other mutants over millennia, awakens from a slumber and vows to destroy mankind and take over the world. With the help of his Four Horsemen, Psylocke, Storm, Archangel and a broken Magneto, Apocalypse plans to create a new for mutants-only world. As the earth convulses in doomsday throes, the X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier work together to prevent Apocalypse and his team from succeeding.The performances are as usual all superb and the CGI eye-arresting. But the two performances that stand out are those of Jean Grey, whose perceptivity and latent vigour were brought alive to pitch-perfection by Sophie Turner, and of Quicksilver, played by Evan Peters, whose comic relief was so good that I will re-watch the film for just his scenes. I had high expectations from Oscar Isaac, but it seemed like his acting talents have been overmasked by CGI, so much so that he appears as generic a villain as any and his actions are the less menacing for it.Nevertheless, the closing battle scene is as grand and edge-of-the- eat nerve-racking as one might expect of an XMen movie; but do note that its enjoyment and understanding, as of that of the film's as whole, will be compromised on for those not familiar with the events and characters of the previous XMen films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

So, instead of giving us a fresh adventure with the newer cast, we get a film that clearly prioritizes style above substance. There's very little action, the characters are comically inaccurate and/or don't have any impact whatsoever, and Apocalypse himself, the Thanos or Darkseid of X-Men, is nothing more than someone that's just powerful because... movie said so.Origins Wolverine is Logan compared to X-Men Apocalypse.

Don't listen to critics! This movie absolutely popped my brain!,"There has been a trend in Hollywood lately, several trends in fact. One of these trends is the overproduction of mindless or crass films, which sadly, are usually the ones that are well received and make a lot of money. X-Men Apocalypse is not dumb Deadpool, or an action-packed Civil War film, which was thin on plot and high on action. I loved Civil War but X-Men Apocalypse is a different animal all together. X-Men Apocalypse is a very theological film, full of wonderful writing and deep, insightful character arcs that make you consider the human condition.X-Men: Apocalypse makes you realize that being transcendent doesn't mean you have more knowledge than everyone else, or that you are smarter. It means that you grew past your own inner torments and don't let the pains of your past affect you and your future.It's also a bit dark, darker than any other Superhero film I've ever seen, including BVS. The Magneto scenes in this movie made be cry my eyes out, they were that disturbing! That's all I'll saw without spoiling anything, but man, I don't know how this film didn't get an R- Rating. I saw a lot of people walk out of the theater with their kids and I don't blame them. But anyway, back to what made the movie great.The acting by Fassbander and McAvoy. As good as it gets in the genre. Then we have Singer's excellent direction, and brilliantly paced story, which had a good blend of character driven drama, humor and of course, an excellent plot. However, some of the sets looked cheap at times, and I had wished that the film had more extras during the action scenes. Luckily, whenever Apocalypse did something terrible, we'd get a news report every now and then, which helped you realize that so many people were indeed affected.Speaking of Apocalypse, Oscar Issac absolutely stole this film. Say what you want about his look, but man, Boris Karloff move over! He looks just like him! I thought he was scary as hell and had some of the best lines in the film. He kinda had that Darth Vadar thing going for him for a while, and I actually agreed with 90% of his philosophy about humans and our destructive behavior.It saddens me to see so many people dislike this brilliant piece of cinema. I agree, that it was a bit more plot driven than the last movie, but hey, some of the best science fiction novels are plot driven. I don't mind theology every once in a while, we need more of it in Hollywood, and like BVS before it, it seems like people cannot stand esoteric films anymore. And that my friends, is a tragedy.9/10.

The most epic and ambitious superhero movie of 2016 that did not fail to deliver,"In X-MEN: APOCALYPSE the stakes are higher, the X-Men are battling against a god-like mutant. X-MEN: APOCALYPSE is an EPIC movie for comic book movie lovers. X-Men Apocalypse had a great balance of drama and action, it was a tearjerker and an adrenaline inducer. For a 2 and a 1/2 hour movie I did not feel the length of this movie, from the beginning till the end i was hooked. It was gorier than the previous X-Men films (excluding Deadpool), especially the intro where you'll go ""ooh that was savage"" but nonetheless the intro worked for me, it got me hooked and interested on this movie.Critics were harsh on this movie, after I watched the movie I went home and looked at the reviews, and I was shocked that it got this reception. I could not remember myself getting bored on this movie. I had a great expectation for this movie and for me it did not fail to deliver!This movie really showed the ""true birth"" of the X-Men, it wasn't another Jennifer Lawrence movie, in this movie they really gave each character a spotlight. Olivia Munn, Lana Condor, and Alexandra Shipp were born to be their respective characters. All the actors were on point in this film, especially Fassbender. Every scene Magneto was in really connected to the audience, it was perfect.All characters stood out in this movie, each and every character's abilities were showcased in this film, except Jubilee's which is sad because I was expecting to see Jubilee in action but psshh it's just a minor thing, and at least Jubilee finally had some screen time and dialogue. Kodi Smit-McPhee's performance as Nightcrawler was a killer! This version of Nightcrawler is very close to the one in X- Men: Evolution (Animated Series).The Quicksilver scene was awesome.The cameo of this character that you may (if you watched the trailer) or may not know was fantastic. This ""act"" had a horror/action feel, it really showed that this character was made to be a killing-thing, and gave hint to this character's intimacy with another character in the future.The climax was very epic that i left the cinema with goosebumps all over me. Whatever you have seen on the trailers, FORGET IT! The trailers were nothing compared to what the movie had shown. IT WAS UNEXPECTED.In my opinion, this is by far the best comic book movie of 2016 and the best X-Men movie ... so far.Kudos to Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg!""ALL IS REVEALED""",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

He has a plan to disarm the world of nuclear weapons, then Earth will be easier to defeat. So all the good guys at Xavior's school must learn to use their power It enters around Jean and Scott, so as usual, there are cool special effects with mutant powers.

Video Review for X-men Apocalypse,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYUjxwSVPqsHere is the link to my X-men Apocalypse Movie Review. I have a few problems with it but in general it was a huge surprise for me with how much I enjoyed it. X-men movies have always had a formula with following a subliminal message of civil rights and discrimination. This movie doesn't follow in those footsteps and tends to be more of just a regular superhero movie. Nevertheless it still can compete right up along side with Civil War for how entertaining and emotional it was.X-men Apocalypse although less mature, doesn't have the greatest structure with plot, and has a few boring scenes. This movie still manages to be good with its amazing characters. Check out my video for a more in depth look at it. No Spoilers",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertainingish,"My head hurt trying to follow this nonsensical plot. This movie is so bad that though it may be funny - but it is not so bad that its good. The effects are bad. Its trying to be dark for some reason, which doesn't work. The actors are bad. The script is bad. The direction is bad. This movie is not worth watching. Everything about this movie sucks.I don't recommend this movie and its not worth watching or even talking about. Even fans should agree that this movie is bad.

The Best X-Men Movie So Far!,"I read a review of X-Men: Apocalypse giving it 6/10. It said it was tired, needing new ideas.I've just seen X-Men: Apocalypse. I LOVED it. Up until now X-Men 2 was my fave, but Apocalypse knocked it out of the park.What's more, not only do I think Apocalypse is the best X-Men film yet I'm going on record and say it's the best superhero film of 2016.It's easily better than Batman V Superman and honestly, whilst I loved Civil War I came out feeling something was missing. Maybe my expectations had been too high, possibly expecting more than Marvel was willing to give...Apocalypse though feels like it's giving us everything it has. Quite frankly I feel that the Apocalypse character has laid down the gauntlet and Thanos will have a tough job to top it when the MCU tackle Infinity War.I'm not expecting everyone to share my opinion (I'm sure a lot will blindly rate Civil War higher)... But dammit, I think X-Men: Apocalypse deserves credit - it got my adrenalin pumping and at the end I was buzzing for more.20th Century Fox may not have a clue how to handle Fantastic Four but it just nailed the X-Men.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The third one's always the worst,"Well, this isn't technically the 3rd film in the ever expanding X-Men franchise, but it is the 3rd in the prequel trilogy, and it's hopefully the last. X-Men Apocalypse is about the alleged first mutant who wants to ""cleanse"" the Earth and keep alive only the strong. The X-Men try to stop him, and the film starts in Ancient Egypt and this is never a good sign as the plot has too many strands which makes it rather complex. This isn't a criticism as all the plot elements are nicely brought together and overall the plot is OK. Michael Fassbender returns as Magneto and his character is seen in a different light in the 1st act; it's good character development for Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence and James McAvoy do what you expect them to do, which is put in good performances. They aren't challenged as the script is nothing special but it's certainly not the worst writing I've seen.So what I've said so far suggests the film is mediocre and this is true but it needn't of been. The part of the film, leading up to the final battle is actually pretty enjoyable. It moves along well and I was really getting into the film. Couple this with Quicksilver's scene( the best part of the film by a mile) and it looks like a grand finale is in store. However, the finale is very predictable, as you could easily guess what was going to happen and there was no intrigue there at all. It was very standard action movie CGI stuff, so I actually found it pretty boring and it really spoils the good work of the rest of the film. It feels like the film builds to a climax that isn't what is should be: it's just a CGI, seen it all before fest. Despite this, the newcomers Ben Hardy and Sophie Turner excel in there roles and show why they should be in more blockbusters in the future.Overall, the decent script and decent acting can't help X-Men Apocalypse which loses it way in the final act, even though the promise was there. The predictability of the finale and the CGI heavy action really make it boring. I'm all for action scenes but this needed to feel more realistic (if that's possible in a superhero film) and more physical. I enjoyed parts of it, but it could of been so much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually great...Storyline poor,"I will make it short...this movie was visually great and the acting by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Oscar Isaac was awesome.But as usual we have a Marvel movie that does not quite stick to the comic. Apocalypse is supposed to be immortal and invulnerable. So, I was surprised that he had to transfer bodies and that he was defeated. Bryan Singer could have have written a different ending to make the movie more interesting.We have mutants that powers were enhanced to their full potential by Apocalypse and yet were easily beaten by these little inexperienced children.For once, I would love to see a movie where the human race actually gets defeated and mutants gets to rule. Charles X needs to grow up and realize that the human race will never accept mutants and we cannot live together in peace. Humans needs to realize who's boss and submit.Isn't that how the world is since day 1. Submission to those who are the most powerful. Food for thought.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Had its flaws, but still a good movie","A friend and I watched this movie in the theater a week ago. To be honest, neither of us are up to date with the X-Men film franchise. Example, for me I've only seen the original trilogy and the Origins: Wolverine. I've seen parts of First Class on a friend's computer.As an viewer watching X-Men: Apocalypse, I was ""introduced"" to younger versions of the classic characters we all know. I am actually surprised to see the younger versions of these characters portrayed well. I'm really impressed with Sophie Turner's take on the character Jean Grey, originally portrayed by Famke Janssen. I can clearly tell Sophie has studied Famke's performance in order to keep the character consistent in what we've already know about Jean Grey's personality.The only thing I had concern was that there were so many main characters it was difficult to identify with each character. I felt I really didn't care about the other characters with the exception of Michael Fassbender's character Magneto. Spending so much time with the characters I felt that it slowed the movie down. I personally like slow movies, but for a movie like X-Men: Apocalypse (or any superhero action movie for that matter), I felt the pacing could be picked up. However, at least it was done by director Bryan Singer. Watching his films featuring an ensemble cast I felt overall he handled them well, giving each of his characters enough screen time even though at times like I've mentioned above it slowed the pacing down.The action scenes in the last part of the movie were done well overall. There's a sequence involving the antagonist and Professor Xavier battling each other both, but not in a physical sense exactly. You'll see when you watch.Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is not a bad movie. It just that it could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely a great movie you won't want to miss!,"I ended up going to see this movie because my friend was talking it up saying how great it's going to be and I gotta say; he was not wrong at all! X-Men Apocalypse is definitely worth watching (and re-watching since it's so good and full of action) even if you haven't seen the other X-Men movies. I haven't seen the others either but after watching this one, it is now my mission to watch every single X-Men movie since I loved this one and can't get enough of the X-Men. Perfect cast, spot- on music choices, great visual/sound effects, and overall an amazing movie.

"X- Meh.Average at best. - Lukewarm, apathy actors. (5/10)","I was really looking forward watching this movie. But The CGI effects must have been expensive, because it seems the production saved money on the actors and plot. Apocalypse, the first mutant, neither his exact powers, nor his origin story, how he became the first mutant is revealed. Fassbender, as Magneto and in some degree McAvoy are the 2 exceptions. ""Sansa Stark"" was a horrible miscast for Jane Grey. Liveless, anemic , her ability is to put her finger to the temple, not even that is believable.This movie isn't as bad as ""Batman vs. Superman"" but still, the stand-ins for Cyclops, Storm, even Nightcrawler horrible. Chubby Mystique is hilarious.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
At least alright,"After the amazing ""X-Men: Days Of Future Past"", we were all hyped about the next movie coming up featuring beloved villain Apocalypse. It was a tough act to follow, but it wouldn't have been that enjoyable either way. There are a lot of pros and cons, but the cons dominate here. What was weird about this movie was that it seems like Apocalypse didn't even do that much. I mean, he didn't talk a lot and he just sort of stood around a lot. We should have seen more of his origin and the exact point that he was created. He was older than Ancient Egypt. Also, why was this a prequel to the original movies? We already showed with ""X-Men: First Class"" that a good prequel could be made.There's no point in placing this in the past. We even got another great movie taking place at this time which made more sense via time travel. Wolverine does in fact appear in this movie, but only briefly. Yeah, when you think about it, his presence is pretty pointless. It's like they were just trying to give him a brief cameo like Professor X in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". The weirdest part has to be this idiotic move Apocalypse does. In one scene, he actually has access to all the world's nuclear weapons and then he throws them all in the sky. Why doesn't he just, I don't know, USE THEM to kill people?! I guess one could argue that he didn't want to kill everyone and just rule over them, but that makes no sense. It's later shown that he does want to rebuild the Earth from the ruins he'll create. Why not just use those missiles to do it? It would have been the easiest thing to do. All they had to say was that Havoc severed the ties with Apocalypse so he couldn't fulfill his mission.There's one scene where the characters come out of watching ""Return Of The Jedi"" and remark that they're sure the third one (this) was the worst. Is that meant to be a shot at itself? The third X-Men movie was considered by many people to be the worst, but most everyone agrees now that ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was the worst. ""The Phantom Menace"" was the fourth created, which again, could be a reference to the fourth X-Men movie. Ironically, this movie is now in between. I also saw ""Up The Academy"" listed there, which could be another injoke as that movie was discredited by the people at MAD Magazine how the first Wolverine movie was.For all the flak I give this movie, it's still by no means really bad. It's great to see Quicksilver again and he is as entertaining as ever. Yeah, they do reuse a lot of jokes from his first appearance, but they still work pretty well. The scenes with Magneto are actually really well done. The best part in the whole movie is probably him seeing his daughter die and his reaction. These are really sincere scenes and they advance the story well. The visuals are really good in this. Still, it's too long and the last fight scene just seems to go on forever. Even the scene after the credits goes on forever! I do like the idea of them showing more of the characters and their fates. I say that while it's better than ""Batman Vs. Superman"", it's nowhere near as good as ""Captain America: Civil War"". It's fine for a single watch, but nothing you'd want to return to. **1/2",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Way over the top & tons of holes & contradictions,"I usually love marvel movies and have liked pretty much all the X- men franchise to date, but this movie was just retarded. It's great that special effects wise we can do pretty much anything nowadays, but this movie took that idea and just went too much with it to the point where everything was ridiculous.I'm certainly glad I didn't pay to see this. I guess every movie mo matter how good or bad rubs some people the wrong way and I guess that was this for me. I just felt that everything power and destruction wise was just too much to the point where I was no longer enjoying a movie but rather being reminded that I was seeing one.Part of the thing I hate about evolution especially when it comes to movies is just how they feel they need to one up everything, but what those retards don't realize is that at a certain point it just all looks fake and stupid, and that's pretty much how this movie ended up for me.Far as time lines, it seems to me they broke so many aspects of peoples encounters and other such that it just seems ridiculous. Wasn't it just a couple movies back that Kurt was introduced and Jean and Storm found him, and didn't know of him? Yet they were in this movie all together? So many stupid things like that plus the over the top powers just made this an utter mess...",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Passable but not as good as First Class and Days of Future Past,"Younger versions of the Xmen come together to battle the most powerful mutant in the world, who has been trapped and sleeping since 3500 BC. For me, going to the movies is always a fun night out, but this wasn't necessarily a fun movie. There are some great sequences and some yawn inspiring dialogue... ""Use your Powers!"" Some really good acting gets lost in poor camera angles and cinematography.The editing and direction seem to weigh down what was probably a decent script. There was probably a better movie there, but the editor didn't find it. This movie suffers from the same meandering that plagued Last Stand. The over-use of CGI, especially in the final battle sequence didn't help either. Characters that are wasted: Magneto, Angel, Jubilee, Havoc and definitely Jean Grey. Characters that shine, Apocalypse, Cyclops, Quicksilver(when he's not spouting awkward dialogue). Worst chemistry between James Mcavoy and Rose Byrne, surprising given how well they worked in First Class. It's worth seeing just for a few standout sequences though, especially another great quicksilver rescue and a psychic battle of the minds.Miscellaneous thought, the opening night 3D viewing I attended at 730pm was almost empty.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good climax to the trilogy but could have been better,"After seeing the first two of the new X-Men movies, I had hoped that the third one in the trilogy would bring something slightly different to what we've already seen in previous movies. Apocalypse being one of my all time favourite comic villains, I couldn't wait to see this omnipotent being come to life on the big screen. First Class was great, DOFP was fantastic and I really wanted this to be exquisite, but unfortunately it fell short of exquisite to just being 'quite good'. I enjoyed it as part of a trilogy, as a good end to an otherwise great series. It had a lot of fanfare, which I really enjoyed, I loved that they included the retro comic book look of the characters. I really enjoyed the cameos of certain characters like Jubilee, who we all remember from comics and TV series. I even enjoyed the plot for the most part, but what I didn't much like much was Apocalypse himself. I always thought when watching the trailer that his look, voice and overall demeanour didn't really match what I would imagine an intimidating being would look like. I remember watching the cartoons and really feeling intimidated by this all powerful being, but I didn't much feel the same way whilst watching Oscar Isaacs version of him. That's not to say Isaac played him badly, on the contrary, I think he done a great job, but I think the character could have been made so much better than what he was. It just seemed like certain scenes were just squeezed in, with odd lines that Apocalypse would say, which didn't much fit with the scene in which he was saying it. The horsemen were really good, I really liked their looks and powers, very good interpretation of the comics. Though I thought that Psylocke and Angel were very underused and would liked to have seen more of them, perhaps a bit of back story. I enjoyed Alexandra Shipp's portrayal of Storm and her African accent was great, much better than Halle Berry's version in my opinion and I hope to see more of her in future instalments. There was a good amount of humour to the movie, which seemed at times a little forced, but overall understandable, as it needed to balance the really dark parts, which there were some. At times I even thought to myself that it could have actually been a 15 rating (R-rated) movie. Quicksilver, there's not much to say, but great as usual, funny, awesome, fast and his slow-mo scene cool, not DOFP awesome, but definitely very cool! The story was very good, very much an Age of Ultron type story, cleansing the world etc, but that was always Apocalypse' goal and they got that pretty much on point. The last fight scene will leave everyone pretty excited for the future of X'Men and the different story lines that could be adopted. I left the cinema feeling like I had a good time, but with something slightly missing. It's definitely worth watching, there is an after credit scene, which isn't really worth staying for, but you might as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Generic,cliché and wasted.Oscar Isaac did a good job but his character was just unfocused and badly written.His plans is just to take over the world which we have seen so many times from now and his costume is just terrible(I'm sorry I just can't).The cast was fantastic but it was again unfocused.The main Characters were great especially Nightcrawler which was great,cyclops was charming,Jean Grey was not bad,Havoc was lovable Beast was good and finally the best Professor X.The 4 horsemen were underdeveloped except for magneto,whos was just fantastic in the film,Psyloche is just there for some reason,Angel was underdeveloped and storm was okay but again underdeveloped another one which is not from the 4 horsesemen is blue katniss(Katniss Everdeen/Mystique) who was annoying and cringe worthy.I almost forgot about Quicksilver,he stole the whole me for me in just one scene and that scene was creative and well executed.Verdict:The film has so much potential but it suffered by an unfocused Story and a emotional scenes which was completely wasted ,Underdeveloped characters,weak and clichéd villain,dull 1st act and unbalanced because of the overabundance of characters.X-Men is the good example if a franchise is now tired and run out of new ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen,"I've never really been the biggest fan of X-men movies, but when I saw Days of Future's Past and Deadpool, my faith in the X-men franchise was restored, and was excited to see a follow up to a great movie.

Imbalanced...,"First things first, movie is good, but there's a lot more that could've been better, like they can link the movie with X MEN Origins: Wolverine, as there is a sequence where it feels connected but not the way it should, the story, well every comic fan knows what and who apocalypse is, but his get-up and make-up was awful, and people who are not familiar with comics will definitely don't feel connected to the story.Psiloc has finally mad her debut in the series, and she is how she was in the comics (only thing that relieved in the movie to see her that way)but still her character and her powers needed explanation too, she's probably one of the influential mutant but they just avoided her may be due to the whip which makes her similar to Wonder-Woman.The movie has became more of a special effects treat rather than a complete package, although there are elements which you'd like too, this movie is made for Magneto, or naming it X MEN:Magneto will not be a bad idea, and yes, you must watch it if you are a fan of him...

Say Hello To The Worst X-Men Film You'll Ever See,"X-Men: Apocalypse is one of my most hated films of 2016. I concur, there are far worse movies but this drew my ire for its outright thrashing of childhood memories that saw Apocalypse as the baddest, meanest adversary of the X-Men. By no means do I pin the blame on Oscar Isaac. Rather, Simon Kinberg's script was the most boring & generic as they come for end of the world villains, that he deserves jail time. Apocalypse then comes off as a non-menacing god-like villain, with unconvincing motivations who spends half of time on trivial things such as dressing up his cohorts. I dare say it, but Ultron was a more compelling villain than this cheap, knock off version of Ivan Ooze that Brian Singer calls Apocalypse. Disgusting.As for his dearest heroes, Singer & his co-writing misfits massively fail to convey worthy character arches while also rendering noteworthy supporting characters as irrelevant. Olivia Munn's Psylocke & Lana Condor's Jubilee are some of the characters to receive the short end of the stick, with the former relegated to a ""just look hot"", one trick pony while the latter just had to be present. What a waste. On the other hand, the storylines of Michael Fassbender's Magneto & Sophia Turner's Jean Grey have become either overused to the point of predictability, or absolutely blindsiding due to poor character development. Either way, the turnouts from these horribly executed story pieces are always convenient, furthering the falsity & cheap thrills of the worst X-Men film yet.Lastly & most dire of all its woes, was the subpar action. The heaps of praise earned by Days of Future Past for its stylish & no holds barred spectacle of mutant abilities was nowhere to be found in Apocalypse. In it's place are the least creative choreographies, muddled with CGI, slow moving stunts & horrible entrances & poses. These account for the blandest fight scenes in the era of superhero films, and that's saying a lot.Overall, my disappointment with X-Men: Apocalypse is beyond measure. It's regression from DOFP is all too apparent, as it it veers away from the successful set pieces of its predecessor but maintains it's two weakest points: abhorrent screenplay & mismanaged characters. Blech. 3/10PS
This film is so bad, that this might be the longest negative review I have ever made!",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A step down from its predecessors but still, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" never ends the fun","Bryan Singer continues the ""X-Men"" cinematic lore with a continuation to the ""First Class"" storyline. We see the team formed then divided in the 60s, clashed in the 70s and regrouped in the 80s. This time, a powerful, ancient mutant named En Sabah Nur or Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) resurfaces and aims to reform a new world but destroying our own. So, it is up to Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and his band of mutants to stop Apocalypse and his Four Horsemen from (what else?) taking over the world.Now, I am an avid follower of the ""X-Men"" lore. Although I have not read the comics, I follow some story lines that shape up the universe. And I praise Bryan Singer for his efforts ever since the first ""X-Men"" movie until his return from departure for being involved in ""X-Men: First Class"" to bring the complex superhero team to silver screen form. I tell this as a strong compliment, for Singer made a bold risk with ""X-Men: Apocalypse"", whether the repercussions are good or bad.To give its credit, Singer, along with collaborator Simon Kinberg, knows the ""X-Men"" story lines all too well. But fanfare does not weigh as much as narrative. (Still, for comic book fans, watch out for Easter eggs.) Being too familiar of the storyline makes this the most derivative part of the franchise. And it all feels predictably formulaic: mutants are outcasts but they are given a chance when a baddie emerges, and all is well. Despite the amount of great moments, the narrative lacks the heftiness of its predecessors. And it does not help that the jarring editing jumps like a jumping bean, shifting from one lighter tone to a heavier one. When the story fell flat, the same goes for the cast.To be fair, this is an undeniable cast ensemble, mixing the originals, from McAvoy, Lawrence, Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult as Beast and Rose Byrne in a returning role, with the new generation, from Tye Sheridan as Cyclops, Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Kurt/Nightcrawler, Alexandra Shipp as Ororo Munroe/Storm and Olivia Munn as Psylocke. Seeing every mutant interact feels like watching the 90s animated series. But even with that, majority of the characters have no arc. The one that has a recognizable one is Erik Lensherr, who goes through the same plot beats but with winning effect. Michael Fassbender really made a compelling performance as a mutant desiring to live normally, only to be brought down by his unwanted powers. The rest are there to drive the plot, sadly. Then we go to the main villain. As Apocalypse, Oscar Isaac makes up the character for its intimidating presence but gives too little of a payoff, making him generic and kind of disappointing.However there are indeed moments, like Evan Peters topping with another Quicksilver's slow-motion scene, Smit-McPhee's Nightcrawler being an effective comic relief and the final battle in Egypt. But it cannot help rescue ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" from a derivative plot, a clichéd villain, haphazard editing, a confused tone, a mix of professional and amateur special effects, the absence of deeper themes and missed opportunities with the cast. Still, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is a fun ride, thanks to its enthusiastic and well-committed cast, thrilling action scenes and wonderful moments. It may be a fallout from ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", but this Bryan Singer's boldest move for the franchise, better or worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The basic idea of these movies is that over the years, the ever-so-popular comics have held us in trance, and now we can see the characters and their stories live on the big screen, performed by excellent actors (read ordinary humans). I think that's the kind of psychological trick that does it for the superhero/comic-based movies (I'd include Bond movies too). You can't judge it in the ways you judge a movie from the realistic genres. I think its high time specific critics developed for this genre or the existing critics to get an update on the 'criticizing'.The star, for me, as usual, was The Wolverine. The way the scene was built up took me back to the same for Dr. Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (I know, too much romanticism, But it was a real treat to watch). I'll really miss him in the forthcoming movies, if Wolverine III is really the end.Sophie Turner (as Jean Grey) adds another jewel to her already dazzling tiara. She is quite an actress for her age.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Well, at least we can all agree the third one's always the worst.""","FILM: 6.0
Rewatching X-Men: Apocalypse, I can't help but chuckle at the inside joke when Jean Grey says, ""Well, at least we can all agree the third one's always the worst."" It's a bold move by the screenwriters, but sadly, it only highlights the film's shortcomings. This being the third in the prequel trilogy, it indeed turns out to be the weakest of the three, making that quip feel like an own goal.Bryan Singer, who has directed some of the best films in the franchise, doesn't quite rise to the occasion here. While he doesn't do a terrible job, this is undoubtedly his weakest entry. The story is disappointingly average, revolving around the tired ""ancient evil arises to wipe the world clean"" trope that we've seen in many films before - looking at you, Blade: Trinity.Performance-wise, it's a mixed bag. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy deliver exceptional performances, as always, bringing depth to their characters. On the flip side, Sophie Turner comes off as wooden, and Jennifer Lawrence looks visibly bored, as if she's just going through the motions. Oscar Isaac, who plays the titular villain, is somewhere in between, but ultimately feels miscast in a role that doesn't play to his strengths. Rose Byrne's return is a welcome one, and she slots in nicely.The action scenes are generally good, though the finale feels overlong and a bit tedious. The standout, however, is Evan Peters as Quicksilver. His impressive slow-motion sequence is a show-stealer, just as it was in the previous film. Peters' scenes alone are worth the price of admission, showcasing creativity and fun in an otherwise middling film.Despite some strong performances and entertaining moments, X-Men: Apocalypse struggles with a weak plot and uneven character portrayals. It's not a terrible film, but it fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessors. For me, it's a decent but ultimately underwhelming entry in the X-Men saga.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

Hyped title- It's all that,"To begin with I had very high hopes with X-men: Apocalypse. One can look at the name and just look at the enemy mutant in the trailers and get set in top most gear, but my friends I would like to put a stop at that.Yes this review contain spoilers, the story is simple a new mutant is introduced which is all powerful and oldest of them all. If it were just that would have been enough but this mutant is capable of enhancing power of other mutants. He team ups with others to wage war on defensive mutants and humans in general, which has to be fought and overcome. The idea of such a mutant was not welcomed in my thoughts.I liked introduction of new mutants. More with reference to control their powers in given circumstances could have been added.Quicksilver action sequence was great. I personally feel Cyclops could have been come up with controlling his energy naturally all by himself.Still the comparison comes with other x-men movies. For me the movie was average.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than I expected,"When I saw early glimpses of the film, I thought Apocalypse looked a bit naff, but Issac played him well. I especially like the darkness he brought to the character. Was a really entertaining film, the opening scene was done really well and set the pace which never lets up for long. Plenty of action scenes and fighting plus the CGI wasn't over bearing or too obvious.I think the film was unfairly slammed by critics, a common critique was it had too many characters. I thought they had a pretty solid function in the story and weren't just thrown in like Ant man (Civil War)was seemingly kidnapped in a van and asked if he basically wanted to go on a mission that would put him on the most wanted list, which he did for no other reason because hes Ant man and hes funny. All in all a great edition to the X-men series, wonder how many prequels they will get out of it though seems never ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Interesting Big Bad drives this one, tho' weak ending","When it comes to fantastic-fiction I'm a sucker for a well-written, well-played, all-powerful Big Bad: individuals like The Emperor, Unicron, Ommadon, Sephiroth, Voldemort etc all add a certain memorable awe to a media experience, more so than abstract threats like the military, tech or future-corps...and more so than familiar figures like the 'friend-turned-foe' trope (i.e. Magneto et al).An out-of-nowhere godlike figure suddenly changing all the rules can add a fresh deep layer to the mythology of a fantastic-fiction series. Thanos famously made such an impression in the Avengers movie series, and here for X-Men the 'Apocalypse' character makes a similar impact. He's interesting, mysterious, impresses with his immense power...he makes us wonder how on Earth someone like that will be defeated......alas, the way the writers conjured up the ending doesn't feel satisfying or earned. A certain character - with an unconvincing plot build-up - somehow becoming the Big Deus Ex Machina feels off with the rest of the movie. If you thought Rey Skywalker's ascent to All-Powerful-Jedi wasn't believable, wait until you get a load of Apocalypse's ending!Elsewhere, Magneto (the most 'magnetic' character of this trilogy, mostly thanks to Fassbender's sheer presence) gets a confused, inconsistent & dissatisfying storyline to complete his arc.Those disappointments aside the rest is fine: decent entertainment value, good FX, exciting set-pieces, excellent 3D with massive depth and some deep pop-outs.But they missed a trick not going the Thanos route with Apocalypse and making it into a two-parter, with a brutal cliffhanger in-between. Instead the next movie in this series is Dark Phoenix, and the reviews are so poor (and that character so bland) I'm just gonna skip it. Logan is on the watchlist, tho'.Overall, this X-Men Trilogy was fun and worth watching. The middle-film - Days of Future Past - is the standout title.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So the era of big budget messy comic book films continues,"This is not Bryan Singer's fault. I love the usual suspects and the first two X-Men films. I can definitely see a leaky script and studio meddling here.I don't get it? Why does every comic book film since the advent of the Avengers have to be these poorly paced bloated CGI messes? And are we really following the messy continuity and character arcs of First Class ?Re-watching Singer's first 2 films I realised how brilliant they are and how much I dislike everything since. Those first two films basically showed us how less is more. I found it strange how back in 2000, when comic-book films were still finding their footing, Fox decided to adapt one of Marvel's longest running and convoluted properties of a team of superheros where the roster constantly changes. Especially with a relatively low budget considering what they cost now. But it worked, since Singer stuck to limiting the characters, grounding the story and stylistic elements and focusing on the main themes of persecution and prejudice. And they hold up really well.It was unfortunate how the first two films focused a little too much on Wolverine. But hey, the character is the most popular and he serves a purpose so it really never bothered anyone. However for this new reboot/prequel series, I DO NOT CARE ABOUT MYSTIQUE! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP TRYING TO MAKE HER HAPPEN! STOP TRYING TO MAKE HER A PIVOTAL CHARACTER! I don't care that the studio got Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence to play her. She is a shapeshifter, what good is that going to do when you are fighting a demigod who can bend reality?Oh yeah the villain, Apocalypse. He is your generic villain that wants to end the world while ensnaring other mutants to do his bidding while he speaks in a Buffalo Bill monotone. What you expected a villain on par with Ian McKellan's Magneto or Brian Cox's Stryker who were actually layered and multi-dimensional?And yeah Fassbender's Magneto is so all over the place? What are his ideologies? What are his convictions? Why is he still on good terms in Prof X even though he paralysed him and dropped a baseball stadium over the white-house only furthering the fear of mutants?Usually I moan about character development especially with a film that features an ensemble cast, but actually some were done right. Jean Grey and Cyclops were actually pretty interesting. We see them young and trying to develop their powers, although still they have yet to explain why Cyclops can't control his beams while his eyes are opened (hitting his head in a plane crash). And Jean Grey is mostly a telekinetic so why did they focus on her telepathy so much? The Quicksilver scenes were awesome as usual with his slowed down perception. One character who I felt somewhat got the Shaft was storm, as early in the film she became Apocalypse's underling. She is one of my favourite X-Men and is very powerful but we don't see her use them in a useful way.The pacing. There is one sub-plot which came out of nowhere and was used for fan service. And the many of the Mystique scenes.Ultimately this suffers from Age of Ultron syndrome. This is not a bad movie. Nowhere near the mess of Batman vs Superman. However it does not have the balance of Captain America Civil War. It is still another CGI orgy. In the end I really like the first two Singer films. They were so in tune with the themes of the comic book and didn't really care about the look so this film is not my cup of tea. If you like the flashy stuff and not really care about character dynamics then you should be fine with it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Every X-MEN fans has to watch this.,"Alright so this is my first time writing a review on IMDb, just for the sake of this particular title.X-Men: Apocalypse has a slow start in beginning, a lot of characters had to be introduced so a lot of background stories were re-looked here and there. It was pretty hard to follow at first but slowly everything makes sense towards half-part of the movie.Then comes the climax.... I was so immersed by the action packed scene with my mouth wide opened. (plus PLENTY of goosebumps). CGI was top-notch. I mean we are talking about the world-coming-to-an-end-destruction-scale AKA. APOCALYPSE. Kudos to the effects team!!!NOW, the casts. Simply marvelous NEW X-MEN (Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm etc etc.) Quicksilver stole my heart in every hilarious scene he is in, as per Days of Future Past. Few heart-wrenching scenes came from Magneto (Michael Fassbender) as well. All cast played their parts well be it major like James McAvoy or minor like the NightCrawler kid, they cant obviously fit every character into 144 minutes *too many*Point is, this movie is not overly-done. I can tell that everyone in my cinema were so thrilled and satisfied at the end-credits. You MUST watch this flick if you are one true X-MEN fan.P.S: Do not compare it with Marvel/DC/other superhero movies as they are not relevant. Just sit back and enjoy OK? :-)",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, but should have been better","An ancient mutant resurfaces in Egypt, threatening the human race.This is an enjoyable film with some good character moments and superhero spectacle.There is a lot going on in 'X-Men Apocalypse', but it has a pretty simple premise of a baddie resurfacing to take over Earth. Given the stakes, it probably would have been better to introduce the character of En Sabah Nur in the earlier films and possibly make 'Apocalypse' a two-parter like the 'Avengers' movies did with Thanos, so it does not feel so crammed and rushed. However, I personally do not think it is a bad movie, it just feels like there was the potential for it to be an epic story that the writers and filmmakers missed.The 80s setting is fun but shows no consistency with the other prequel/reboot trilogy movies given that nobody seems to have aged since 'X-Men: First Class'. Whilst it is a bit distracting, it is not a showstopper.All the younger versions of various characters are established well such as Ororo, Kurt, Scott and Jean. Quicksilver has another excellent sequence that is easily the best superpower spectacle sequence of the movie. I far prefer seeing powers used to save people rather than fight antagonists so this is especially satisfying.That being said, one long established character has a great cameo that involves a lot of quite nasty violence, but it is necessary for the situation and is well placed in the story.One scene involving Erik Lehnsherr is well made, but in the grand scheme of the franchise feels a slightly excessive and contrived way of entrenching his already hardline stance towards humanity that I do not think was needed.Everything builds up to a finale of action spectacle and effects that is technically very well created, but for me suffers a bit of superpower excess. It does not have the same level of craziness as the ending of 'The Last Stand', but if you get fatigued at the sight of characters doing battle in front of green screens waving their arms about whilst various brightly coloured, animated images flash about the screen, you have been warned.All actors are solid, particularly Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Evan Peters, and Jennifer Lawrence. Oscar Issac does his best, but unfortunately most of his expressions are hidden under the makeup and costuming.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Let down of the year,"Days of future past was my favorite of the series so far. It was confusing as hell but at the end they managed to deliver a good movie with good explanations. Because of that i had some high expectations about the newest one to the family X-Men: Apocalypse. But was i ever so disappointed. This is by far the worst superhero movie came out this year. (Yes including the dawn of justice) It was easily predictable, had way too many clichés and cameos, didn't have much of a story,.. just plain bad. And the most disappointing thing for me was how they handled Magnito. He's put through the same thing all over. Quicksilver part was alright i guess.. Felt repeated. (and if he did all that he could've easily stopped Stryker team yea?) But all that heat aside, i'll admit i'm a fan and i enjoyed seeing my favorite heroes fight. I should give credits to the CGI team as well. Seeing jean turn into phoenix was awesome. It was just right there on the table but still. And those 5 minutes with wolverine in it was the best bit from the whole movie. For me at least. Just for those i'll mark 3 stars. Other than that, Disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Screw the 'Critics' and other negative reviews about this film,"Before watching the movie, I usually see how people are reacting to the movie and after seeing the ratings that this movie got, I did not expect much from this movie!! But, after watching it, I was blown away and honestly I don't have any clue why there is a lot of negativity surrounding this movie!!Anyways, this movie was very very good and as I did not expect much before going to the movie, I really liked it. Although this movie takes sometime to build the story up, after that is done, the plot was much clearer, intense and amazing!!All the actors were amazing, they did justice to their roles and It is nice to see the characters that I liked in a new way and it was not at all disappointing!! Before ending this, If I don't tell about the CGI in the movie, I would not be doing a wrong thing!! The graphics were amazing and one of the best effects in the recent past!!Overall, It is an amazing movie and it delivers what every X-Men fan would want!!

Way better than First Class and Future Past,"This was actually a decent movie. Certainly compared to the other two in this series. Plenty of action, and some actual character development. I still don't like the way Singer screwed with the established characters, but at least this time it wasn't encumbered by a bad story. The acting was better this time too. What's funny is that this movie finally established a solid basis for future films, just as it concluded the possibility of there being any in this franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than expected! definitely best x-men movie so far!,"I went to see it with lowest expectations. I figured, Civil War and Dawn of Justice were ones that were supposed to be best this year. I WAS SO WRONG! Fox nailed it this year! Deadpool will most likely be best secondary movie (compared to Suicide Squad and Dr Strange), and without a doubt - Apocalypse was best Main movie these three companies had to offer.I am surprised rotten tomatoes are against this movie as well (but after Dawn of Justice, I stopped paying attention to that. It's most definite - they are working in Disney's favor, not in favor of quality) ). If you go to see this movie, you'll get: * Amazing soundtrack, best one out of all x-men movies (along with Deadpool - best soundtrack in comic book movies so far award goes to Fox);* promising new actors(Cyclops, Storm, Jean... well Jean was least promising, but it's only start!) who will without a doubt replace old trio we all grew up with;* Amazing story line. They asked right questions, as always - you can pull parallels with our world with no trouble. Heck, throughout movie, on moments I've felt I wanted Apocalypse to succeed. That's sign of how well written movie is;* Some funny scenes. Some seem forced, which is downside, but most scenes with Quicksilver had me laughing my butt off;* Whole movie is what we waited for. All characters are AT THEIR BEST, THROUGHOUT whole movie. Unlike in other big two, characters don't get weaker and stronger on moments;* AMAZING BATTLES! And after such a long time, fights that I remember from cartoons were finally translated to big screen. Especially Xavier's fights. God, I didn't even knew how much I desired those until I saw it happen.---When ya sum it up - it's best X-men movie ever made. And if we have post credit scene in mind (you'll might need to google it, I know I did), boy they can build A LOT now... we can get at least 2, 3 more QUALITY x-men movies. Whoever took charge for these new x-men, KNOWS what they should do.Downside exists. Downside is definitely that if you haven't figured out time-lines until now, you're gonna have some trouble. Even if you did, on moments time-line can be bit hard to get. Romance isn't really something none of superhero movies (Except Deadpool) manages to deliver. That's something what might break the tempo for you. And lastly, if you've seen more than just one trailer, there's a chance you'll feel few moments are spoiled for you. It's best not to watch more than one trailer. :)Rating 9/10, downsides don't affect it way too much, but they exist. It doesn't change fact that it's best X-men movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fitting finale,"'X-Men: Apocalypse' is the sixth X-Men film and the final piece in the second trilogy (2011-2016), fitting in after 'Days of Future Past' and before 'X-Men' (2000). Although the time travel of the previous film does leave a somewhat altered ""reality"", so it doesn't necessarily all fit together nicely. Plot's pretty simple - Apocalypse/En Sabah Nur (Isaac) is the first mutant, with the ability to collect other mutants' powers, and he's now been resurrected and wants to destroy the world so only the strong survive. Plenty of Nazi parallels, and they use Magneto (Fassbender) and his Jewish past to emphasize this.Some of the films like repeating the same territory, as they have to re-establish the ""new"" characters: Jean (Turner), Cyclops (Sheridan), Havoc (Till), Nightcrawler (Smit-McPhee) and how they fit in with Xavier (McAvoy) and his school. I guess after the other two films, they needed Mystique (Lawrence), but I'm not sure why she needs to play such a big part. And Beast (Hoult) is mostly wasted, along with Apocalypse's Horsemen - Storm (Shipp), Psylocke (Munn) & Angel (Hardy). Some great CGI and large-scale chaos shown, but also some nice soft-touch moments, particularly between Charles & Erik - something Singer did well in the original film. One of the best bits is near the end when they almost verbatim repeat something from the 2000 film - and there's another nice tongue-in-cheek moment when they come out of seeing 'Return of the Jedi' (forgot to mention the film's set in 1983!)I loved Metallica's 'The Four Horsemen' playing when Apocalypse turns Angel into the metal-winged Archangel, worked great for the scene. Quicksilver (Peters) - despite being dead in the 'Avengers' films and only 10 years younger than Fassbender - is a very welcome addition here and has some great moments, particularly the Eurythmics bit. It doesn't follow any particular comic storyline completely, but borrows from a few, with only a few nods to the 1990s 'Age of Apocalypse'. Magneto's motivation could've been better, for me, but the scenes he and Xavier are in are always good. Issac is menacing but not too over-the-top as Apocalypse, but somehow, even with the world (slowly!) crumbling, it doesn't all click quite as well as you feel it could. Definitely a worthy addition to the franchise, but still a shame they never reached the pinnacle set by the original X-Men film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An okay addition to the Xmen Franchise...,"Having watched Days of Future Past, which I thought was by far the best X-men film i'd seen, I had high hopes for Apocalypse, regardless of reviews which didn't seem too promising.I have to disagree with some of the reviews here about this film - it wasn't particularly good. It just slots in with your run of the mill superhero film and won't be remembered when the sequel is released.Positives:Some of the action scenes are excellent. CGI seems to have improved again in recent films and Apocalypse is no exception.I think the casting of Sophie Turner and Alex Shipp is a great move. Being a GOT watcher, I liked her introduction into this franchise. I'd never seen Alex before but that girl can do something different with Storm and move away from the Halle Berry rendition.Not so Positives:It's getting difficult to do something really different with these kind of films; there wasn't any shock (for someone that hasn't read the comics). Having seen Civil War recently, this story really lacked that unique edge, whereas it's competition had me from the beginning to the end. Apocalypse as a villain bored me. I won't lie. He could have been so much more exciting! Instead it was just another bad guy wanting to start the world over again.It'll be interesting to see what happens next with the X-men Franchise. With the end teaser, hopefully it will be something new to keep up with the other Marvel projects that are leading the way.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Muddy and Under-Explained, Apocalypse is a Spectacle Without Substance","Despite the marked increase in bloody violence over the franchise's previous chapters (perhaps a reflection of the similar shift in comics during the '80s) this is possibly the most inoffensive X-Men film yet. It's so stuffed with winks, nods and fan service, lingering in the introduction of each new(ish) character, that at times it can seem like the plot is just an afterthought. Our story is ultra-light, with a focus on flashy effects, and only occasionally hints at the deeper, more interesting insights we were promised in trailers. Alas, the new villain's history (and the fascinating potential of its influence in a literally biblical sense) is relegated to a fleeting vignette before the opening credits. His plans for the elimination of our society and the construction of a newer, better, model are left frustratingly vague and confusing. Just take our word for it, I guess, that he's a meanie. The problems we experienced in Days of Future Past with Quicksilver's game-breaking powers (and their subsequently convenient writing-out at the climax) are back again, this time joined by several more ultra-powerful mutants. They, too, are conveniently absent or forgetful when push comes to shove, giving the impression that the climactic scene is on rails. I hate to sound like I'm coming down hard on this film, because there's plenty it does well. Visually, it's as loyal a big screen depiction as we've ever seen of the big Marvel franchise, and there's loads to celebrate in a visual sense. It's crammed with treats for the dedicated fan and generates a fine action scene, but beneath the surface it's nothing special. Not bad, not a waste of time, just... far from extraordinary.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but worst one of the Trilogy,"Before i watched this movie,i wasn't really pumped up for it neither was i expecting a lot from it and after i watched it the result was okay.What i can say is that X:Men Apocalypse is like the Age of Ultron or Transformers of the X:Men universe and that appealed to me because they tried to do something different with the franchise,its almost more like a blockbuster movie than a drama-like comic book movie that they did with X-Men:First Class and Days of Future Past and i liked that they took a different route.This movie was long though and that's fine as long as it is captivating,but some scenes where just dragging on and on like the multiple times Apocalypse was recruiting his ""Housemen"" which began to feel a bit longer than it needed to be.One advantage though is that the characters of the movie were developed nicely and key moments between them didn't feel rushed which was a plus,however for a comic book movie it takes a longer time than usual for the movie to kick on.Best way i can describe it is like this is a film of two halves as the first half is slow paced and plot hand-holding while the second half had a faster pace full of action and explosions.Most of the new characters in this movie are great like Scott Summers,Jean Grey and Nightcrawler,i really liked the way how these characters were handled because they are given a good backstory and their introduction is quick.I especially liked Tye Sheridan's Cyclops because in the past X:Men movies Cyclops was never given as much time as i hoped and in this one they all are.Psylocke however wasn't used as much as i hoped,Olivia Munn was OK as Psylocke but she didn't do much in the movie,its like she is just there and not really fleshed out(she did have some cool action scenes though),also Alexandra Shipp's Storm is another case as she was introduced well but felt flat as the movie went on.Quicksilver is back in this movie and he is again awesome as he had another speed scene and i am glad to say it was bigger and better than the speed sequence he had in Days of Future past.One character i wasn't sure about was Magneto,i really doubted if he needed to be in this movie because Apocalypse was the major villain in the movie.Magneto starts out well as he is given a simple arc and you understand why he joins Apocalypse to destroy the world,but at the end of the movie his arc doesn't come to a satisfactory conclusion as he took a backseat and felt like he didn't have a voice of his own and that is what i was afraid of.Out of the Trilogy,X-Men Apocalypse is the one with the most action,although there isn't much when compared to the length of the movie,because the movie starts out with an action sequence but after that there isn't another one for a long time until the last third of the movie which is fine because like First Class and Days of Future Past it was interesting enough and it was cool to see the more action in an X-Men movie as both First Class and Days of Future Past didn't have a lot of it,although there was a downside as some of the action didn't have much fluidity and came of a bit stiff.Now the villain.Apocalypse was a mixed bag for me in this movie,he had a satisfactory reason for destroying the world or remaking it,he is given a brief introduction but he was an interesting enough villain as the movie went on (and he monologuing for days).He was manipulative and powerful which i enjoyed,but during the last act of the movie he somehow falls flat as he had this particular arc in this movie,but it just felt sluggish and unnecessary and in the end he doesn't have a strong impact like previous villains had.In terms of Story it really isn't that great compared to First Class and DOFP,it is bigger but not better as it didn't have much dramatic moments which you are used to seeing in the X:Men movies and some scenes didn't have the gravitas it should have which is really disappointing.There is a lot of good humour in this movie as well which for me is always welcomed,The Wolverine Cameo was awesome and without giving much away Jean Grey in the last act...nailed it....nailed it.X:Men Apocalypse maybe not as great its prequels,but it is an enjoyable movie with in its own right and it really makes me more excited for more X:Men films to come.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"See this movie in context and it's epic. See it as a stand-alone film, and you miss the point","""Promise me you'll find us...the X-Men...guide us.""This was Logan/Wolverine's plea to a young Charles Xavier/Professor X in the previous installment of the X-Men franchise, Days of Future Past. That film essentially gave the franchise a fresh start, free of it's past mistakes (ahem,The Last Stand, ahem). Now, we get to see what director Bryan Singer can do with his second chance.It's 1983, exactly ten years after the future-changing events of Days of Future Past. Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is full of students, Eric Lensherr/Magneto is living low in Poland with a new family, and mutants, while not openly persecuted, still feel like outsiders.Along comes En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac (Poe Damaran, is that you under all that makeup?). He's the world's first mutant, buried in stasis in Egypt after his subjects betrayed him 5000 years ago. Now he awakens to a world that doesn't worship any one god (read this as 'him'), and he sets about to fulfill his name, with the help of his Four Horsemen (Magneto, a young Ororo Monroe/Storm, Psylocke, and Angel).Faced against the end of the world, Xavier and his students must band together and fight, as Charles states: ""Those of you who have the greatest power, protect those who don't.""This film is basically the X-Men version of The Avengers. Most people familiar with the X-Men films know who the major players will be, and here we see them as separate people with their own problems who will come together to protect the people of the earth (at least X-Men aren't squeamish about saying their team catch phrases on screen, unlike some.)Now, for those who are seeing this as their first foray into the X-Men universe: don't see this film yet. The plot will seem incredibly shallow without the character backstories that have been established, and in some cases rewritten, over the past 15 years.The reviewers who saw this early clearly did not have this mindset. However, I have to concede some of their points that, yes, the dialogue seems somewhat repetitive and dull at times, elements that are repeated from previous films seem cheaper and less fulfilling the second time around, and there was really no feeling of suspense. But honestly, this is a superhero movie, are there really any true shockers in those?In short, you won't regret seeing this film if you are a fan of the X-Men franchise. The last film erased their mistakes. This new one is not a new mistake, but they now have no room for error going forward.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More of the same from Singer.  Whether that's a bad thing or not....,"With a name like Apocalypse you've got to expect big things. The true definition of the word expects to exhibit destruction of biblical proportions and that's exactly what we have been promised here. Our gang of misfits are up against the first mutant that ever existed and the most powerful, or so they say. Imagine people's surprise when pre-release set photography showed their supposed ultra-baddie looking like Ivan Ooze from the Power Rangers Movie. Under the heavy prosthetics lies the superb acting talent of Oscar Isaac, a man with enough grit to pull off a truly menacing antagonist but, thanks to their overzealous make-up team, the movie took a worrying turn before it even had a chance to hit the screens. Bryan Singer announced that this is a 'monster of a movie' and that audiences have not seen 'this level of destruction in any previous X-Men movie'. That may be the case but has the monster he created come back to destroy him?We catch up with our heroes seven years after the events of Days of Future Past. Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and Hank McCoy's (Nicholas Hoult) School for Gifted Youngsters is thriving with new editions; a pale and lifeless Jean Grey (Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner), a lovable and creepy Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and the all- American reject Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan). Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) is now a mercenary, picking up stray mutants who are being abused by humans and sending them into hiding, a far cry from the slippery assassin given to us from Rebecca Romijn in the original trilogy. She's a hero in the eyes of other mutants and greatly admired, especially from an impressionable Storm, played here by Alexandra Shipp sporting a pretty cool Mohawk. Unfortunately for Shipp, her Mohawk is all that's cool about her as she barely gets the opportunity to shine.As the great Deadpool once said, 'These timelines are so confusing.' Thanks to the events of Days of Future Past, this movie is set with an alternate timeline giving Singer the green light to reintroduce characters who existed in the previous movies. Olivia Munn plays Psylocke, a mutant who is clearly a lot older in 1983 than her first appearance (played by Mei Melancon) in The Last Stand which was based in present day. Ben Hardy received a lot of attention in the press for his portrayal of Angel (mainly because he looks cool), a role taken by a Ben Foster who, at the time, is younger than the likes of Storm and Jean Grey. And Raven is a good guy now! Who knew?!The reintroduction of the prominent characters in the series immediately becomes premise for constant nods to the original trilogy, something Singer was annoyingly guilty of in Days of Future Past. He's not necessarily doing it because he likes to blow his own horn but because he finds out what works for his movie and milks it for all it's worth. Quicksilver is a prime example of this; Evan Peters stole the show last time with his quick quips and hilarious slow-mo action sequence aptly played along to 'Time in a Bottle' by Jim Croce. Well, he's back with an equally hilarious, extended scene and a few more lines this time around. However, after the initial reintroduction, it's almost like Singer doesn't know what to do with him and what seems like a prominent story line fades into the background with the rest of the ""new editions"".That brings us to the main man himself, Apocalypse. Singer's decision to put Isaac in a suit rather than have a fully rendered CGI version of the character (like Marvel's Thanos) is so that he can fully interact with other characters on screen but the size of his character makes him less than impressive. It's not just the fact that he looks ridiculous, they don't impact on what makes him such a serious threat. Apocalypse existed as a God amongst men for centuries before some of his followers buried him alive in a tomb, only to be rudely awakened by a snooping Moira McTaggart (Rose Byrne returning to her role from First Class). He has the ability to transport his body into other mutants and with that picking up their powers along the way. The idea of Apocalypse should be terrifying but what we're given is another unimpressive, run-of-the-mill, bad guy set up to be defeated by an untrained team of kids and a pep- talk.On a positive note, while we all complain about movies that contain too much CGI, in reality that is why we watch these movies, so that we can see what cannot be done with average special effects. X-Men are certainly good at that and you will not be disappointed with action sequences. Any fan of the series will enjoy this movie for the gratuity of it and they have certainly spent money and time building their apocalyptic World with some exceptional visuals.On the way into the cinema a friend of mine told me that he was, 'a bit superhero' d out' and at the moment I'd be inclined to agree with him (Gasp! Shock! Horror!). What we expect as an audience to is to be entertained in new and exciting ways but if all they can do is churn out the same movie with a slightly different cast then, in that respect, audiences are going to lose interest. X-Men: Apocalypse is not as bad as the critics make out if you can accept that this is a comic book movie made for the sole purpose of pure, unadulterated, nonsensical entertainment and you can look past Oscar Isaac's horrendously silly costume.Ivan Oopocalypse.

Apocalypse Now,"The film begins in Ancient Egypt where En Sabah Nur is worshipped as a god. He is Apocalypse, the first mutant and he can amass the powers of other mutants.After an attempt to kill him goes wrong his followers awaken him in 1983 and Apocalypse recruits his four horsemen, a team of mutants that includes Magneto reeling from the death of his wife and child in the Polish forest and a young Storm who has been residing in Egypt. They intend to create a new world order by destroying the previous world first.Professor X and Raven have to lead a new team against them that includes Cyclops, new to the academy and who starts a teen romance with Jean Grey. Comic relief is provided by Nightcrawler who sports a Thriller style leather jacket.This is a bloated film with thin characterisation and even the 1980s period setting was rather empty in comparison of the sheen of First Class which was set in the 1960s. Do not get me started as to how Professor Xavier and Magneto do not age, these guys should be nearing 50 now and look nothing like Patrick Stewart's and Ian McKellan's older versions.The whole film is an empty spectacle. So Magneto just wants to live an ordinary working life but when he saves someone at a factory we know he can wave goodbye to his family.I even found the film rather morally dubious. We are in a scene set in a former Nazi concentration camp. Magneto asks Apocalypse where was he when his family were getting killed. Apocalypse mentions something like he was unable to help. Well something tells me with a name like Apocalypse he would had admired the havoc that the Nazi's created with the holocaust. After all he only plans to destroy the world himself, men, women, children, animal life, plant life and Magneto helps out as countless people die in the climax.The film has some nice touches, a zinger of a joke about the third film in the trilogy (which this is) never being as good as the younger X Men come out from watching Return of the Jedi in a cinema.The best scenes in the film is when the school is blown up, the students are saved by Quicksilver who literally just dropped by in a slow motion sequence set to the Eurythmics song 'Sweet Dreams.'However much of the film lacks resonance it is moderately entertaining but also a by the numbers action film. We think here we go again. Magneto has just killed millions but Professor X wants to see the good in him.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
