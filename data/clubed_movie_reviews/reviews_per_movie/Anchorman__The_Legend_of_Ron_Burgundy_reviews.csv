Funny Anchorman,"This summer I've seen several intentionally stupid funny movies, and enjoyed them. Adam McKay's ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is no exception. Seems that my taste for high concept cinema has been influenced by the summer-- well not really. This movie written by McKay and it's star Will Ferrell is an outrageous and completely over the top comedy. Applaud Will Ferrell as the mind bendingly stupid and self absorbed, San Diego newscaster, Ron Burgundy. Will Ferrell is genius in playing Ron straight without character dispersions. Ferrell creates a great deadpan sense with his cohabiting dog, Baxter, and the fact that his character Ron Burgundy will read ANYTHING on the teleprompter, his tragic flaw, well at least one of several, is priceless. Ferrell also never crosses the line of being a complete jerk which is an amazing accomplishment. In fact, Ferrell gives Ron a muted charm-- he really does grow on you.Basically, ""Anchorman"" is an extended sitcom. Ron is informed by his station manager, Ed (a funny Fred Willard), that he will have a co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone (a hot Christina Applegate). Turns out that Veronica was a woman whom was immune to Ron's vast charm at a wild news crew party. Veronica is beautiful, ambitious, and smart. She too has aspirations of being a Network Anchor. The Boys Club news crew which include sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), feature story guy Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and the dumb as a post weatherman Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) all make their play for Veronica. However, she falls for Ron in spite of himself. Ron eventually woos her affections in a totally wacky jazz flute display. The screen writing is so skewed in a good way, and it has absolutely no shame. There is a classic scene with Ron's dog Baxter, and a bridge that according to my bud, John, shatters a fundamental script writing rule. In another memorable scene Ron gives an erroneous translation of the name San Diego to Veronica that is hilarious. ""Anchorman"" also benefits from cameos of talented actors, most notably Vince Vaughn as Wes Mantooth, the rival station anchor. Christina Applegate looks great, and truly has a talent for comedy.""Anchorman"" is completely over the top, and ignores any boundaries. That really makes it work. ""Anchorman"" is broad stroke farce done well. Will Ferrell demonstrates great comedic gifts. I want to see what he creates next. For now, ""Anchorman"" is just great fun, and very funny stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quite good for its genre...,"...that genre being ""manly men behaving stupidly"". Its charm is in the fact that it is not pretending to be anything other than what it is - it does not try to get you to do anything other than laugh. The film is also responsible for giving Steve Carell his breakthrough role as Brick, the news weatherman who can hardly assemble a coherent sentence.The film centers around Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), a local news anchorman in San Diego at an unspecified time. From the fashions and music, it could be anytime between 1968 and 1975. Ron is basically a lecherous yet likable leisure suit Larry who is mainly a face - he has no real journalistic talents or instincts. He simply reads the news that others report. The trouble begins when the station manager hires a new newswoman, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) who at first is given only fluff pieces to do. The big step forward for Veronica is that she is working as a reporter at all. This was considered women's lib in 1970 - just being admitted to the club. This did not exempt you from all kinds of hazing and sexual harassment, which was considered the price of admission. A romance develops between Ron and Veronica that ends quite abruptly when Ron is late to the set and Veronica goes on in his place. She does so well that she and Ron become co-anchors and the war begins - Veronica against every other man in the newsroom, all who feel threatened by a woman anchoring the news. However, Veronica plays it smart and takes advantage of the fact that Ron will say anything that comes across the teleprompter without even thinking about it.Normally I don't like these kinds of films at all, but for some reason this one just gets funnier every time I watch it. Especially funny is the conclusion, with actual investigative reporter Bill Kurtis discussing the destinies of everyone at the station.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You've probably heard many of the jokes already,"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a completely ridiculous, yet very hilarious movie. There are so many quotable lines in this movie that even if you haven't seen it, you've probably heard many of the jokes already. It's a great balance between situational comedy and absolute absurdity. Plus, there's even some actual story mixed in with the humor. This is one Will Ferrell movie that I think hits the comedy nail right on the head.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
more a pleasant parody than a biting satire,"""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" takes us back to those halcyon days of the 1970's, when the hair was as big as the lapels and women were just beginning to assume their rightful place in America's television newsrooms.Will Ferrell plays a Ted Baxter-type anchorman (is it mere coincidence that his dog is named Baxter?) - vain, narcissistic, none too gifted in the brains department - who has worked for years as the sole news dispenser at a top-rated San Diego station. All is going well for Ron Burgundy until the station manager decides the newscast needs a bit more ""diversity"" and hires a female reporter named Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) to come on board. Cornerstone is a brainy, blow-dried blonde with a driving ambition to be the first female anchor on network news. Since most of the men who work at the station, including Burgundy, are dyed-in-the-wool misogynists, Ms. Cornerstone faces an uphill battle of sexist comments, schoolboy pranks, and subtle (and not so subtle) undermining as she climbs her way to the top (though she is not above pulling a few dirty tricks herself to get what she wants). Things really get dicey when Burgundy and Cornerstone begin dating and quickly fall in love, a situation rife with potential disaster as Cornerstone begins to encroach on Burgundy's professional territory.""Anchorman"" is a light-hearted, enjoyable little comedy that, unlike a full-throated satire (say, like ""Network""), often goes for the easy laugh instead of the incisive barb. The movie is at its best when it is parodying the corny graphics and the tendency to over hype the trivial (""Panda Watch: Day 46"") that define modern newscasts - and at its worst when it is indulging in silly, often scatological jokes and slapstick throw away bits. Like most mainstream comedies, the humor in ""Anchorman"" ranges from the mildly funny to the downright hilarious, the latter including a clever ""West Side Story"" parody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee-slapping high note.Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles. Moreover, writer/director Adam McKay provides a smattering of guest appearances from such well known stars as Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and even Ben Stiller, many of who are not listed in the official credits.""Anchorman"" goes down easily - a bit too easily, perhaps, for a film that, with a little more courage, might have become a scathing satire on an industry that could do with a little merciless skewering right about now. Still, ""Anchorman"" is fun while it lasts - and these days we'll settle for what we can get when it comes to laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This absurd comedy had to convince me...and somehow it did,"When Anchorman came into theaters, I avoided it like a dead sewer rat. When it came onto HBO, I pretended it didn't exist. In fact, I would not have even LOOKED at it had my remote control not stuck on the stupid channel. So I watched a few minutes. I didn't laugh. I wasn't surprised.Then one day, surfing the premium movie channels, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the offerings. So I turned on Anchorman, about 5 minutes in. For the next hour and a half, I proceeded to laugh hysterically. Scene after scene, line after line, I found new reasons to laugh. By the end, I could hardly breathe.Unconvinced that I had stumbled upon a a re-watchable movie, I tested and retested it over and over. And over. Result confirmed.Anchorman tells a simple story: acclaimed (and consequently arrogant) news anchor Ron Burgundy is forced to adapt when an attractive new female member of the Channel 4 news team (Applegate) begins changing the way he and his quirky news team work. That's it. This story is predictable, prescription-esquire, boring. But Anchorman does not draw it's strength from story. It draws from the hilarious situations. It draws from randomness. It draws from brief--but memorable--cameos. It draws from those 100 or so unforgettable one-liners.That is, if you're looking for cinema, for a fine work of craftsmanship, a eloquent script, and an Oscar nomination, go watch a FILM. If you find randomness hilarious, then watch this MOVIE.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Consistent and thorough silliness keep this above-average comedy afloat,"I went to ""Anchorman"" expecting another super-mainstream, lowest-common-denominator, SNL-derived romp. Now, these aren't the worst movies in the world, to be sure. ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Old School"" are pretty agreeable ways to while away the time. But usually about an hour in to these affairs, I've had enough of the broadness and predictability, which starts to get downright oppressive. It's not just that they're lowbrow--it's that they're so overwhelmingly, disappointingly conventional.Luckily, this isn't what ""Anchorman"" is. ""Anchorman"" is a refreshingly off-kilter outing from an unlikely source--Will Ferrell, the current reigning lord of middle-of-the-road fratboy Sandlerism. The film has a lot more in common with Mel Brooks and Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker than anything in the SNL family tree. It prizes out-and-out silliness and absurdity over bathroom humor and penis jokes (though there's plenty of the latter, don't worry), and pulls it off admirably. In essence, the key to this stuff is never letting off of the goofiness even for a second--the audience should never be allowed to take anything seriously.""Anchorman"" achieves this with exceedingly silly and bizarre dialogue complemented by killer comic performances from Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Vince Vaughn and Steve Carrel. You'd have to be lobotomized to maintain a straight face through lines like ""It's made with bits of real panther. So you know it's good."" and ""I'm riding a big, furry tractor!"" The direction and pacing are also pretty solid at times, and the requisite celeb cameos are very nicely done (especially in one particular scene which I wouldn't dream of ruining).The film's not without its flaws, certainly. Chief among them is the wasting of one of the best comic character actors in the biz: Fred Willard. If ever there was someone born to play a smarmy local TV newsman, Willard is it. But he's inexplicably cast here as a dull station suit, while David Koechner plods through the sportscaster role that was clearly meant for him--passable but certainly not as inspired as Willard would have been. Also, I think that the story would have benefited if Vaughn and his cronies, the closest thing to villains in this lightheaded romp, had a little more face time.But these are comparatively minor problems--the point is that Ferrel has given us something that's really funny in a way that's appreciably different from the endless SNL movie-mill. It's not Monty Python, but it is a healthy departure from what has become the comic mainstream. Most importantly, the laughs are frequent, long, and deep--check it out and you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The perfected art of being stupid,"In a year packed with comedies that were all a bit stupid and silly (and all seemed to feature Ben Stiller), Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy reigns supreme above them all. This is a movie that is well aware of its own stupidity, and best of all, it is able to embrace it skillfully so that it is exactly as silly and immature as it wants to be. It is such a great comedy; I'd consider it the Naked Gun of our generation.As apposed to many, many, other comedies, Anchorman actually gets better as it moves along. Most of the time a comedy like this will use up all the laughs in the first hour and then try to take a serious, lovey-dovey turn in the last act. There are more laughs in the last half hour than in the first half hour, which usually is never the case. It's as if there was some mathematical comedic formula that spread the laughs out in a way that it was consistently funny. Or, maybe they just got lucky. I dunno.I loved all the characters in the movie, every role no matter how small had a great moment or two. Will Ferrel of course, the star of the movie who is just perfect as Ron. He's so so funny 'cause he's such a lovable idiot. Even Christina Appelgate, who was in a role that quite honestly anyone could have done, is able to make it her own and provide some laughs. There is a scene that has a lot of cameos that was hilarious as well. It was one of those moments that takes you completely by surprise.So, what else can I say except that I loved Anchorman! It's the best ""stupid"" comedy I've seen in years. This is Will Ferrel at his best and it will be hard to top.My rating: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It's got a few laughs but don't expect a whole lot more,"To me, the Ron Burgundy story feels a lot like a Saturday Night Live sketch that lasts a bit too long--though it certainly has its funny moments. If you are expecting a film as hilarious as TALLADEGA NIGHTS, this one just isn't up to it, but it is an amiable time-passer.Will Farrell stars as the title character--a very popular fictional anchorman in San Diego in the 1970s. Ron is consistently #1 in the ratings and on top of his game when a new female reporter (Christina Applegate) arrives at the station. She is competent and pretty but in the sexist 70s world of this film, that just isn't enough. Ron and the rest of the staff just want to sleep with her and won't give her a chance at any serious news stories. With all the double-entendres and sexist remarks, this aspect of the story seemed to go on forever--plus the relationship between the two characters just seemed flat and unconvincing--even for such a slight comedy. Their interactions or the sexist remarks might have been really funny one or two or even three times, but after a while it was all like beating the proverbial dead horse--it just stopped being funny. What were funny, though, were the strange random little plot twists here and there not related to the relationship between Farrell and Applegate. I loved the fight scene between the various reporters from the local stations as well as the scenes with the dog--they were so weird and funny that they made the film worth seeing. So in other words, when the plot was ignored, the film soared!Overall, a reasonably funny but not especially inspired comedy that is about the same quality level as SEMI-PRO--both decent Will Farrell comedies, but certainly not as memorable as TALLADEGA NIGHTS or STRANGER THAN FICTION. This was mostly because the jokes fell pretty flat after a while and there wasn't enough to sustain an entire full-length film.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"A legendary comedy, Will Ferrell at his best","Apart from spawning multiple memes over the years, this movie also got quite a few laughs out of me. The comedy isn't what you'd call 'high brow' but that's because it's aimed at the 'immature kid' in all of us, and that's why it makes us laugh.

Very funny -- but very stupid,"If you're in the mood for just plain stupid humor, this is the movie for you!Will Farrell brings his brand of earnest smarminess, along with the cheesiest mustache since Jim Carrey's in _Me, Myself, and Irene_, to his role as the eponymous Ron Burgundy.The 70's is brought to hilarious life -- everyone smokes, the San Diego sky is clotted with smog, there is no such thing as ""sexual harassment"" as an issue - it's just a way of life. It's like the goofier side of _Boogie Nights_.Recommended if you're tired of seriously good movies!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst movie ever,"Not clever, not funny, not a good story, really really bad . The worst example of American ""comedy "" and a waste of a lot of talent. Will Ferrell is never funny , so that doesn't help , but the supporting cast is well wasted. Obvious slapstick humour, crude sight ""gags"" and some poorly executed Monty python rip offs were cringe worthy. How they made a sequel out of this mess is beyond me. Some reviewers rate it well, which I guess encourages the low brow appreciation society that enjoys these sort of films to watch a sequel, or even watch this excruciating tripe again, I'm writing this in 2023 after seeing it for the first time, so perhaps it's just aged badly?? Very very badly.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Legend Of Ron Burgandy and Veronica Cornerstone,"I had been avoiding myself from watching 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' for a long time because I thought that it would be another one of those wannabe non-funny comedies. I liked Ferrell a lot in comedies like 'Legally Blonde' and 'Stranger Than Fiction' where he really downplays the humour but I saw some of his Saturday Night Live sketches and many were plain awful. Anyway, I later found out that the cast also included Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd and Steve Carell and so I was curious to how Ferrell works with these talented comedy actors.So that's that and now, after having seen it, I must add that 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is a laugh riot. It superbly spoofs the 70s. Adam McKay brings together an excellent comedic cast playing colourful characters. Ferrell and Applegate are at the centre of the film and both are stupendous! But the supporting cast that includes David Koechner as a 'macho' wannabe who's actually a closet homosexual, Paul Rudd as a virgin stud, Steven Carell as a mentally stunted weatherman and Fred Willard as the laid back boss equally stand out with their gags and superb comic timing. Just when I was thinking that it would be funny if Vince Vaughn was part of the cast, he appears on screen as the 'deadly' rival. There are also notable cameos by a psychopathic Tim Robbins, a Hispanic Ben Stiller, an armless Luke Wilson and Jack Black as a cruel junkie.I'd recommend to watch the movie with English subtitles as there are some hilarious lines between Burgundy's dog and a bear which is spoken in animal language. There are so many more laugh-out-loud moments that it's hard for me to single out a particular scene. Which one shall I say? The scene where he plays the flute to impress Veronica, Veronica screaming 'Ron!' (in typical 70's melodramatic style) when he gets fired, the entire bear awakening sequence, the battle between the anchormen, Veronica challenging Ed with her three strengths: screwing, fighting and news-reading ....there's just too many.While being an out-and-out comedy, it does bring forth some serious issues like gender equality (which was still a problem in the 70s). Though the undertone is serious, it's all presented in a comedic way but it never makes fun of the issue. For example, Veronica is continuously harassed by her male co-workers but she stays strong without succumbing to their rudeness.'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is a joyride all the way. Whether one likes the film or not, I'm sure they at least would have a good laugh.",,Anonymous,Comedy
It's Summertime: Lighten Up and Laugh Without Guilt: No Thinking Necessary,"The most devoted cineastes and the average hoi polloi moviegoers both need to kick back and laugh, without probing or analysis, at a goofball, outrageously funny comedy with zero depth. And that's exactly what director Adam McKay (also co-writer with star Will Ferrell) provides in ""Anchorman."" A very warm summer day, like today, was perfect for the quick gags and physical comedy of this nutty flick. Maybe it's even more of a relief for us folks who are still arguing with each other about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Control Room,"" documentaries that make us confront a difficult present and a tenuous future.Will Ferrell is TV news anchor Ron Burgundy in 1970s San Diego. This is Pre-B.W. (Barbara Walters), a dark age when men reported the news almost exclusively. Burgundy, shallow and self-absorbed without redemption, chases skirts and is so genuinely stupid he reads ANYTHING on the teleprompter. His news crew consists of adulators and one misfit, Brick Tamland, played with unremitting mental blankness by Steve Carrell. Burgundy's dog is a delight, a pooch who can bark in a few languages.The ""Men's Club"" is jolted by the station honcho's decision to add a woman to the newsroom, largely to appease the network satraps. He says it's necessary in the interests of ""diversity,"" a word one staff member doesn't even understand. Enter pretty but tough Veronica Corningstone, Christina Applegate. Applegate makes what really is a tough comedic role work completely.A misadventure by Burgundy results in Veronica's pinch-hitting chance to anchor the evening news. Veronica scores big time. She and Ron are already lovers and she expects him to be thrilled that his absence was her big break. No way and the rest of the film is Ron's Revenge and Veronica's Counterattack.A subplot is the rivalry between Ron and his crew and the mobile news gatherers of competing stations. This ends in a donnybrook reminiscent of the silent film era having no rhyme or reason. The other stations' combatants are led by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. Robbins, one of the most intelligent and versatile personalities in film and stage today, should be watched closely. He almost loses his composure acting the zany script. Even Jack Black makes it into the flick as a dedicated junkie.Don't miss the outtakes as the end credits role, especially Ferrell's last comment on what the movie really is.Pure summer fun-laugh, be happy.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The bomb.com!,"As I sit and watch Anchorman for what must be the 1000th time, I can't help but ask myself; WHY? Well, the answer is simple. This movie freaking rocks! It boasts an unbelievable amount of one-liners that I am spouting constantly. It could quite possibly become the most often quoted movie ever. Will Ferrell's over-the-top performance, along with other cast members equally daring acts, makes you wonder how much of the movie was scripted, and how much was ad-lib. All of the characters support each other so well, that it is nearly impossible not to have a favorite line from each one.I am not a fan of all of Ferrell's movies (especially Kicking and Screaming), but this one will be near the top of my list for years to come, I'm sure.Because, as we all know, 'Sixty percent of the time, it works every time!'",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Funny Idiots Of TV News,"Will Ferrell and company seem to be 2 decades late in satirizing the leisure-suit era of over-blown TV personalities. Then again, the biggest change from that time to this is that now the ego-twit types in the news game are not just local, they're national. So either 'Anchorman' is way late for the party or it's very timely. Look, I don't really care which. Is it funny? Will it show you a silly, good time? Sure, and I think silliness is the best you can expect from such a soft-boiled egg. This parody is not trying to hurt anybody for real, just poke them gently in the rib cage. But even though this one drives in the slow lane when it should be speeding down the humour highway, the movie made me laugh...sometimes in spite of myself.What surprised me was that it gets funnier as it goes along, especially when the cartoon violence escalates. It's hard to take anything seriously, but an old-fashioned rumble is so stupidly violent that it's just too funny for words. The movie sports plenty of cameos, most of them unveiled in this one scene. In fact, everybody Ferrell ever met seems to be in this flick. His rumble opponents are rival anchors from 3 different stations and they happen to be recognizable movie stars too. I enjoyed this one idiotic scene so much, that it made every limp moment that came before seem funnier.So what's the story then? Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a sensationally arrogant and dumb San Diego news anchor. His goofy co-stars (including Paul Rudd & the scarily dim Steve Carrell) are also his only friends until Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives to spike their testosterone punch. Soon she's sharing Burgundy's desk and his bed. But the men resent this woman (the first female anchor ever, apparently) and humorous trouble brews. Fred Willard plays the boss and straight man, which is a bit of a disappointment. He's too hilarious to be so serious.Will Ferrell is so popular right now, his script could have been a fiery turd and the flick would STILL make a huge profit. He & rookie director Adam McKay (a colleague from Ferrell's SNL days) co-authored the screenplay, which was probably left wide open for hours worth of improvs. A stronger director might have held out for even better jokes. An experienced director might have tightened things up and paced the movie better. The abundant flaws don't do serious damage. I may not remember much about 'Anchorman' in 3 months, but lots of chuckles were yanked outta me this afternoon. If you want to laugh at foolishness by the Will Ferrell troupe, this fake news story might be the ticket. Or it might not...",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""Anchorman"" soars past stupidity on colorful, quirky characters","You won't get an argument out of me that ""Anchorman"" is just a stupid movie. It just delivers stupidity with a barbaric yet ingenious sense of creativity that makes it the best comedy that a mind from ""Saturday Night Live"" has ever come up with.SNL writer/director Adam McKay didn't have to do much for this film, only assemble an incredible ensemble filled with some of the best improvising minds in Hollywood. Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell are just the highlights for what is a tremendously talented cast that sells you crap like it's gold and you buy right into it.Ferrell is Ron Burgundy, easily his best and most unique character of all time, an anchorman for a San Diego news affiliate in the 1970s who thinks he's the biggest thing ever/God's gift to women. He's remarkably stupid with an odd set of talents and an air like he's really smart and awesome. Carrell and Rudd are two of the other reporters: one a retarded weatherman and the other an over-cocky ladies man/field reporter that makes Burgundy look smart. Carrell's performance is golden although clearly written by someone with the decency of a ten-year-old. Rounding out the cast is on-the-rise female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) who balances out the ridiculous humor a bit and I also am partial to the immaculate Fred Willard who is the news director.Still, in all its shear ridiculousness, ""Anchorman"" shines. Its characters and random sequences never dreamed of before because they are so utterly preposterous work despite your inclinations for them to be horrible. That said, ""Anchorman"" is not going to work for everyone and amidst the trash that followed it it won't appear as totally original in the future. But nevertheless, the trials and tribulations of the lovable Ron Burgundy really work better than what happens to most stupid comedy protagonists when it comes to getting you to care. It's really Ferrell's best comedic persona and the only one he could revisit with any success.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ferrell's weakest yet..,"Sure this movie will make millions due to Ferrell's popularity, not to mention the fantastic trailers.. but I must say I was rather disappointed at how lame this movie is. So many moments felt like they were taken right off an Elementary School playground; the scene where Christina Applegate tells Ron Burgundy that he has bad hair is a perfect example. It just wasn't that funny.Much of the humor was so lame that I found myself doing a ""half-chuckle"" because lines were so often not really funny, but mildly amusing at best. Make no mistake, there are few belly laugh's in this one.Even if you're a die-hard Ferrell fan I would suggest you go see it as a matinee or wait for the DVD to rent.

Steve Carell is awesome as the dimwit idiot. The cameos(and there are plenty)provide enough laughs.

We need a negative scale for this..,"I've seen a lot of senseless and juvenile films in my day and have a pretty thick skin. This movie stunk and was insulting at every level.. Just for kicks, whenever I see a repulsive stinker I look at the ads to see what stiff had to sell their soul to give any cred to an outright bomb. As I saw this well after the DVD release, it was too late to scan newspaper print blurbs, but I'm floored that Ebert gave it three stars and the IMDb User rating is +6. I haven't seen formulated, brainless, waste-of-time drivel like this in years, and that's saying a lot. I'm even incensed over who dignified this crap with a cameo!

Anchorman: The Legend of Will Ferrell's Comedy,"*** 1/2Starring: Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Steve Carell, and Paul Rudd.Famous anchorman Ron Burgundy is on top of the world.  He's got fame, friends, ladies, and his beloved dog.  But all that changes as he develops a rivalry with his new female co-anchor Veronica Corningstone.Without question this is Will Ferrell's best work.  His over-the-top acting and his over-the-top hair fits perfectly in the title role.  And surprisingly, he's not the best part.  Steve Carell, as the ""retarded"" weatherman steals just about every scene he's in.Hilarious movie, but not exactly for the ones who don't exactly like ""stupid"" movies.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprisingly really funny. Well worth a watch,"As a rule I don't like Will Ferrell, it fact I don't find him funny at all, so I was really surprised by how funny I actually liked this film. Maybe the context of this film, the 70s setting allowing the sexist jokes to be satirical rather than tasteless, made it for me. Maybe Ferrell is just funnier in this. In fact I kind of forgot it was actually Ferrell as I found his performance truly brilliant- and hilarious. Having said that I think Steve Carell, who I normally hate even more, stole the show. His character and the way he played it was really funny. Maybe it just fitted in with the ludicrousness of the film's setting. The whole set-up was an interesting one, which led to some interesting dialogue about sexism, not too serious, but enough to be noticed. Finally, after Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Jack Black, and others popped up for cameos I was gone. I really enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If Fox News was like This I Would Watch It,"Halloween came and went and I was Ron Burgundy, and then I realized I haven't reviewed one of the funniest movies ever made, Anchorman. With the second movie just around the corner there is no better time to review this movie. Anchorman launched Will Ferrell's career and basically jump started Steve Carell's career. Anchorman is the story of a 1960s Anchorman, Ron Burgundy who struggles with the changing times and the threat of a female anchor. This movie is hysterical from beginning to end and is brilliant in its writing and performances.Will Ferrell was on SNL but when he left Anchorman took Hollywood by storm. The witty lines and catchphrases of Ron Burgundy made him a pop culture icon. Ron is a brilliant character who is played perfectly by Will Ferrell. His relationships with all other characters are unique and funny in different ways. His main relationship is his with Veronica Corningstone but my favorite is his relationship with Baxter. Baxter is Ron's dog and the very first scene we see with him he barks and Ron apparently speaks dogs and its very funny. Then the shot with Baxter in the pajamas is my favorite in the entire movie. Baxter is the greatest dog in any movie, there I said it. I would name my dog Baxter if I had one.A comedy has to be memorable and quotable. This movie is one of the most quotable movies I have ever seen. I know scenes word for word just because they are funny. The sky rocket in flight scene to when Ron yells ""cannonball"" I could go off on every funny quote but then it wouldn't be a review. The writing in this movie was fantastic. The scenes were well put together and you can tell when Ferrell is improvising. Her says things like ""by the beard of Zeus."" Nobody wrote that, it was on the top of his head, but it works. Ferrell has a talent for improve, witty comments. He is the clear star of the movie but there is just enough room for the spotlight to be shared.Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Fred Willard are also very funny but Steve Carell shines bright in this movie. Fred Willard is a lot of weird people in a lot of weird movies but his running gag with his phone calls about his son never gets old. Carell plays Brick, just from his name you know he is funny. In his opening scene he says ""years later a doctor will tell me I'm mentally retarded."" Perfect. His comedy is well placed and more subtle than anything. ""Brick where did you get the hand grenade?"" ""I don't know."" He says, need I say more. We all know that scene. It's the best scene.The best scene in this movie is one I see on TV all the time. It's the battle of the news teams. Basically, its complete anarchy and nonstop laughs. There are a million cameos in this movie, including Ben Stiller, Seth Rogan, Vince Vaughn, Fred Armisen, Jack Black, and even Danny Trejo. I like it when comedies have cameos, especially with big name stars, because they can be so effective in such a small time. Stiller has one or two lines but it adds so much to the scene and makes it that much funnier.Comedies tend to drag on a little bit in the middle to get a hold of the story and build up to a hilarious climax and ending. This movie kind of does that after Ron's interaction with Jack Black. The movie takes a dive and isn't as funny as the rest but the movie can't be 100% funny. The story was ridiculous but it had a meaning. It showed the change in American society and how women were becoming a bigger part of it. The movie did need to portray that message and it did. I usually don't like that in comedies, but I can look past it for this movie.Overall, Anchorman was a riot of laughs. Every time I watch this movie, I laugh. I laugh at the same things I've laughed at millions of times before. If this movie is on TV I sit and watch it. I can jump in at any moment and enjoy it. I can watch this movie over and over. I watched it twice in a month and still enjoyed it. I can watch it alone but its better with other people. For that, Anchorman gets the WillyT Comedic Crest and the WillyT Seal of Approval. Go see this movie if you haven't, and you stay classy.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bad hair day in San Diego,"The curse for some of our photogenic news anchors appears to be having a bad hair day, or not being suitably clothed with the right pastel colors in front of the camera. Or so, it seems to be the message of this, sometimes funny, spoof about the folks that deliver the news on television, especially in California.Director Adam McKay, with the help of the star of this film, Will Ferrell, have come out with a screen play that tries to make fun out of some of the local Southern California's anchors. They treat the news as entertainment, or so it appears to be the case. One never sees any crisis in their broadcasts, and being caught without makeup, or heaven forbid hair spray, will send them into a frenzy.The battle for ratings is at the core of most of these broadcasts. The more ridiculous the items being given coverage in their thirty minutes format, the better. In fact, the greatest single item of interest for the many networks in the area seem to be the coverage of the birth of a baby panda in the San Diego zoo, where one anchor woman, by accident, is sent by a rival anchor into the pit where some grizzly bears are housed. But never fear, Ron Burgundy, anchor extraordinaire, comes to her rescue and the resulting footage beats the competition and the baby panda takes second seat to the sensational feat accomplished by the anchorman.There are some funny moments in the film, which falls into the gross genre. The sexual jokes at the station, at the expense of the young woman who is hired, are tasteless, at best. The sequence of the fighting anchors in a free for all leaves one of them with only one arm, but before the film ends, he'll lose the other one as well.Will Ferrell, the funny man of the hour, has some good opportunities where to shine; after all, this is a vehicle tailor made for him! Christina Applegate shows she can keep herself going. Paul Rudd is totally wasted; Fred Willard ditto. In some cameos we see by Luke Wilson, Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller, among others.The best way to approach this movie is to watch it without any expectations, as it will probably appear better with that type of viewing attitude.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Rare Treat,"So many comedy movies I have seen over the years just don't seem to be able to get it absolutely right. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a rare exception. It's silly yet smart, touching yet cringing. It's not just the lines that will have you in stitches but the the casts' delivery and spot on comedic performances that will have you fighting to breathe. Will Ferrell is at his absolute best in this film. He knows the character of Ron Burgundy like the back of his hand and you believe every second of his performance even during the scenes where you are finding some sub plots to be a little far fetched (but that just adds to the outrageous hilarious nature the film is going for.) Christina Applegate is a standout too, She isn't just reciting the script while trying to seem convincing (much like her character could have turned out had she been in the wrong hands) she brings heart, integrity and a hell of a lot of hilarity to her performance. And the comedic/romantic/sexual chemistry between her and Ferrell is very enjoyable and works exceedingly well. Supporting cast is perfect as usual, but what else would you expect from Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd, who in their career have proved that these kinds of movies are what they do best. Some great cameos too. This movie will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More of the same,"Re-watched this the other on DVD as I hadn't seen it in a while, here's my review.""Anchorman"" is the story of fictional 70's anchorman Ron Burgundy (Ferrell), king of the news anchors in San Diego. The times are changing though and after Burgundy is unable to go on-air one night, reporter Veronica Corningstone (Applegate, in her best work since ""Married....With Children) fills in so well that she's given a co-anchor role, a first for a woman. Burgundy and his news team are dumbstruck and set out to sabotage her career, in the process doing themselves some damage too. Will they turn her off anchor work for good? See it to find out.OK, with some funny scenes but nothing extremely memorable, the highlights being Burgundy doing vocal warm-ups (make sure you see the extras disc), the news team fights (with cameos from Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller amongst others) and most scenes with Brick (played by Steve Carell). A bit too stupid in spots, as is the case with most Ferell movies, but enough jokes to make it easily re-watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Are you serious?,"I've heard a lot about ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy."" After all, it made Will Ferrell famous to movie audiences. I've heard it been called everything from just hilarious to being one of the defining comedies of our time. Surprised was I to find out that ""Anchorman"" is not only overrated, it's downright unwatchable.Ron Burgandy (Will Ferrell) is Ron Burgandy, San Diego's most famous news reporter with an ego to match. Everything seems to be perfect for Ron, until a new reporter, a beautiful female(!) named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) threatens his seat of power.I've seen a few of Will Ferrell's movies, and I have to admit that I am not a fan. He can be funny, like in ""Elf"" or ""Old School."" But here he's so obnoxious that it's torture to watch him ""be funny."" All he does is yell and scream a lot and act like a guy with a big ego. It isn't funny.Everyone here is extremely stupid. That's not inherently a bad thing; being dumb can be funny. Take a look at ""Borat;"" they don't get any dumber than that guy. But what makes ""Borat"" funny and ""Anchroman"" a trial is how it plays dumb. ""Borat"" intelligently rips apart the dumbest parts of American culture. ""Anchorman"" plays dumb by acting like middle schoolers. What I mean is that ""Anchorman"" thinks its being funny by being crude. Crude does not necessarily equal funny. It has to be clever, which ""Anchorman"" is definitely not.My God, this is an awful movie. I don't think I've ever had a worse time watching a movie, and that includes ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" That is a record that I hope I never break.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Will Ferrell creates the uber-manly character,"This is a great film starring the hilarious Will Ferrell who plays Ron Burgandy the manly news anchor broadcasting live from the 1970s San Diego. The film looks great and the recreation to a time gone by is incredibly accurate.

Will Ferrell however towers over everyone-this is his movie and Ron Burgandy is a character I know is bound to become legendary.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Dumb, has its moments","I enjoy most of Will Ferrell's movies. He knows how to take unusual characters and make them his own. But Anchorman is just too stupid.

Possibly the best comedy of the last 20 years,"As movies have gotten more.. .congealed in the late 2010's into 2020, where genres are mostly undefinable from one another, I am reminded that this might be one of the best comedy movies of the past 20 years. Don't kid me, there is some good competition, 40 Year Old Virgin, Bridesmaids, Superbad, and some other classic bangers come to mind. For what it's worth, Anchorman still remains endlessly quotable and endlessly entertaining. Ron Burgundy is a man out of his time character. Out of his element, and more importantly, just funny. I've personally seen this movie countless times, and each time it intrigues me to no end. With endless quotable lines and dialog you can use over in your own life (I've for sure, when I've been asked to explain something I didn't want to have said I love lamp with a serious face), this movie slaps. I do hope some day we can get true comedies again, but being that there are funny moments in almost all movies nowadays, the laugh-a-minute comedy seems like a style in the past.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Anchorman: 7/10,"I have mixed feelings about Will Ferrell. I think he's a very funny guy and a great improviser, but I still can't let bygones be bygones and forgive him for making Old School. Although I didn't get around to seeing Elf, I think that Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is the movie to make Ferrell a comedy star or not. If his name alone can fill theaters, I think he'll be hot property for studios in the future. The trailers for Anchorman made it look promising. I had watched the trailer many times and kept on laughing. I had hoped that all of the best parts weren't given away in the trailers, and much to my surprise, most of the material in the trailer wasn't even included in the final movie, which I guess was both a blessing and a curse. It showed that there was even more riotous material than was in the trailer, but it also meant that some of the great stuff from the trailer couldn't be in the movie.Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is a macho, chauvinistic, popular news anchorman in San Diego in the 1970s. He and his news team, which consists of field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sports anchor Champ Kind (David Koechner) and low IQed Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), are the number one news team in town. However, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) joins the news team and threatens the masculinity of the station, but also it threatens Ron's job. Ron and his news team try to do whatever they can to stop Veronica from becoming the first female anchor, while still trying to get in bed with her.The whole premise seems like it's some sort of Saturday Night Live sketch stretched into a movie (almost like a Weekend Update movie-now that would be awesome), especially since Ferrell, an SNL alum, co-wrote the movie. But it's just a silly, funny, stupid movie that has little plot and relies chiefly on Ferrell's improvisation. He's a great improviser, and it shows, because it often takes center stage, taking it from where it belongs: Steve Carrell. Playing the dimwitted Brick, he has some great lines and actions. He says my favorite line in the whole movie. I won't spoil it here, but it's in an argument with a rival station (led by Vince Vaughn). That brings me to another point. It seems like they don't even try to stay coherent (like the stylings of The Naked Gun and those types of movies). It's that type of comedic styling that's always the funniest.The laughs seemed to be coming in at a pretty steady pace, but the main problem is that this low-brow humor didn't warrant that large of laughs. They were regular, but they weren't that large. You can't expect perfection, but when you have so much material, I would think you'd try to find the best of the best. Maybe when this movie is released onto DVD there will actually be good deleted scenes. Whenever there's a movie with so much material to use, they always bring it down to about 90 minutes. Couldn't they bring it up another half hour? It'd work, I think. But anyway, Anchorman is a great, leading-role making performance by Will Ferrell, and enough consistent laughs to satisfy most people. Just beware that whenever Ferrell's name is on a poster, it usually equates to stupid humor. But there's nothing wrong with that, is there?My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for sexual humor, language and comic violence.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Modern Day Monty Python,"Ridiculous, hilarious and endlessly quotable, ""Anchorman"" is a modern-day classic comedy.

Lazy Will Ferrell flick without jokes or storyline,"I think Will Ferrell is a funny guy, I really do. The problem with ""Anchorman"" is, like many movies based on SNL spoofs, it relies solely on the charisma of its leading actor and forgets to include actual gags. From start to finish ""Anchorman"" is just lazy writing. The story never goes anywhere and there are virtually no real jokes whatsoever. The audience is supposed to laugh at the way Ferrell delivers his line (which takes the whole flick dangerously close to Adam Sandler terrain) or his tasteless looks and stupidity (haha, his suit is so 70's, haha, he thinks he's sexy, but he's really fat and hairy, haha, he thinks San Diego means ""a whale's vagina"" in German). All of this may appeal to the intellect of a 10-year old, but not necessarily to people older than that. There are cameos by the usual suspects, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, all of which make it a bit too easy on themselves lately and think anything they do and say is automatically funny and will guarantee another hit movie. Well, so far this kind of movies is fairly successful, but maybe the makers and protagonists should stop now and then and think about where Chevy Chase is today. Maybe that would teach them not to treat their success so inflationary and put more effort into their work.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

He is Chevy Chase with a heart and a brain. The supporting cast of this farce is outstanding, and the cameos are pretty funny: I enjoyed Jack Black as a biker who loves dogs, Tim Robbins as a ruthless gang leader, and Ben Stiller as a crazed Hispanic (I really didnt buy him as a Hispanic, but he was funny, anyway). This film had tons of comedic talent, and most of it was well-used; except for Steve Carell. Not buying Steve as a complete idiot; he has too much native intelligence and sensitivity to be the idiot he tried to portray. Other than that faux pax, the film is pretty funny.

"Silly, goofy and very funny in spurts","Although ""Anchorman"" lacks the inspired lunacy of, say, ""Airplane!"" (1980) or ""Hot Shots!"" (1991), I found myself laughing more than I expected and probably more than I should have.This is an amiable comedy that, when it works, does so because of the earnest performances by Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Fred Willard and Steve Carell, who almost steals the film as Brick Tamland, the world's dumbest weatherman.This is essentially an extended comedy sketch. Even at a mere 90 minutes, it seems stretched a bit too much. The comedy that works is the satire on TV coverage, when the film parodies the news business. The news bits and the TV station's promos are funny because, although the film is set in the 1970s, local TV stations even today resort to corny promos to win over their audiences.The humor clearly is lowbrow and that's fine. There are as many hits as misses, but when the comedy hits, it's hilarious. The love scene's pretty funny, and there's a hysterically funny awkward moment when Ron offers to take Veronica on a tour of San Diego. Too bad the actual tour doesn't prove to be funny.When writers Ferrell and Adam McKay, who also directed, go for broad sweeps, the comedy just isn't there. They're straining for laughs and the scenes don't work. An all-out brawl seems utterly pointless and an impromptu jazz flute scene is sporadically funny. It goes on for too long, as does an a cappella sequence by the news team. The cameos are interesting, but do we really need to see Ben Stiller in every movie?Ferrell throws himself so enthusiastically into Ron Burgundy that it's tough not to like this chap. I wish they had more fun with the teleprompter or had him bungle real news. On the other hand, Fred Willard makes deadpan comedy an art form (watch his hilarious turn as Buck Laughlin in 2000's ""Best in Show""), yet the writers don't give him enough funny stuff with which to work. His one-sided phone conversations were ripe for terrific comedy, but they fall flat.An intermittently funny film, ""Anchorman"" comes apart at the end in an unfunny bit set in a zoo covering ""the greatest story in the history of the world."" I realize I might be in the minority here, but I found nothing humorous here. It had the potential to be sidesplittingly uproarious but, instead, seemed awfully forced. The film called for a stronger, funnier denouement. But, by then, the writers apparently had run out of ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Unanchored,"This is a simple exercise in humor by going out of bounds. Well, this has energy.It does have what I call folding, being a show about a show and show business. But that element is mundane, of the ""Zoolander"" variety.I've been studying bounds recently. You might call them norms or conventions...Much of humor comes from understanding where those bounds are at that moment and with that particular audience  and then stepping just over them. So much humor can be seen this way just by allowing different boundaries to think about.If the distance of the step is tiny, the humor is considered sophisticated and is often missed by the less sharp or attuned. If the stepping over is a big step, the humor is considered broad, crass.We like the small steps because it shows more skill, even intelligence and it points out the humor in ""real"" life. So we remember it. Sometimes it changes us.This is broad and crass. Purveyors of this sort of thing make up for that weakness by shooting in many directions, and at least all the big ones: sex, status, life, religion...When that's your formula, you can only accomplish so much. It all boils down to whether it has energy and whether the overall rhythm of the thing has a groove.

"Funny, but not as much as Old School","Anchorman, the comedy about female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) coming to a San Diego news program, and stealing the main anchor spot from the pompus 5 time local emmy winner anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell),   starts of with plenty of laughs, but towards the end, it gets to a point with the style of comedy is gets redundant, especially Steve Carell's character, who while giving some good laughs, just gets tedious. Will Ferrell does a great job as Ron Burgundy, along with his collleagues, played by (discluding Carell), David Koechner, and Paul Rudd. And cameos by Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Vince Vaughn (who actually has a pretty important role) keep the film from getting boring.

But things are about to change in the news reporting, when an attractive ambitious female reporter by the name of Veronica Corningstone (Christine Applegate) joins the team. At first, Ron and especially his field reporters truly hate her until Ron falls for her. At first, Ron and Veronica get along and they started dating. But when Ron is late for reporting the news, Veronica takes his place. The public seems to love her, so she shares the news with Ron. Now Ron becomes Furious and it becomes battle of the sexes.Directed by Adam McKay (Step Brothers, Talladega Nights:The Ballard of Ricky Bobby) made an amusing tongue in cheek take of the 1970's. Farrell is certainly hilarious in his role as a arrogant Anchorman. The actors are playing his fellow field reports are certainly having an great time, especially Carell playing the dumbest in the bunch. It is one of those movies, where the cast & crew seems to be having an great time. Fred Willard appears in a supporting as the News Director. Although the original version of the movie tested so badly, McKay had to re-shoot the movie for a second time. Basically removing the original sub-plot involving bank thieves. That version could be seen in ""Wake Up, Ron Burgundy"" on the two-disc set of ""Anchorman"". Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit-parts or cameos, which most of them are uncredited. ""Anchorman"" certainly went on to have an huge cult following on DVD and TV, if you haven't seen this. Don't miss, one of the most craziest and surprisingly original comedy of the decade. Written by the director and Co-Star:Farrell. Also available in Unrated Edition. (****/*****).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Ferrell at his best, but Carell steals the show","From the very first frame, Anchorman grabs your attention and never lets go. The quotability of this film is off the charts - every line seems tailor-made for water-cooler conversations and late-night reenactments. Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy may be the headline act, but it's the razor-sharp, often bizarre dialogue that turns this film into a quotable goldmine.Enter Steve Carell as the incomparable Brick Tamland. His performance is nothing short of scene-stealing brilliance. Carell's portrayal of the clueless and socially awkward weatherman is a comedic triumph that elevates Anchorman to a whole new level. Every line that comes out of Brick's mouth is a gem, and Carell's commitment to the absurdity of the character is unparalleled.The absurdity in Anchorman reaches its peak, and that's saying something in a film where a group of news anchors engages in an all-out street brawl. The clever satire on the 1970s newsroom is amplified by the outlandish scenarios and exaggerated characters. Anchorman strikes the perfect balance between social commentary and laugh-out-loud absurdity, creating an unforgettable comedic experience.Adam McKay's direction showcases a keen understanding of comedic timing and the power of improvisation. The chemistry among the ensemble cast, including the comedic dynamo that is Steve Carell, is palpable. The film's energy is infectious, and every absurd twist in the plot keeps you hooked and laughing.Let's not forget the soundtrack, a perfect accompaniment to the film's retro vibes. The music, paired with the film's absurdity, creates an atmosphere that is as immersive as it is hilarious.Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is not just a movie; it's a quotable, laugh-inducing phenomenon. If you haven't experienced the sheer joy of Anchorman, you're missing out on one of the most quotable and absurdly entertaining comedies of all time. A perfect 10? Absolutely, and then some.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It really does try hard,"Yeah, Will Farrell is funny. The problem is finding him a vehicle to convey that humor. For the most part, he has had co-starring and support roles. In them, you can see the humor, but you wonder if he could carry a film by himself. Well, he kind of can. Of course in this film, he does surround himself with some comedic talent, the cast is loaded. Moreover, there are cameos from some of his buddies, Stiller, Wilson, Vaughn, etc.. However, the film does start to falter and almost collapse towards the last thirty minutes. The story, which was somewhatsecondary to begin with, seems to have no real closer. Will this film make you laugh? Yes, it will, some of the one-liners are very funny. Is this a well crafted comedy? No, not even close. So in the end, I give it a mixed review. If you love Farrell and you want to see insanity, go see it! However, if you are looking for some comedy which is perhaps a little more creative, well, have you heard of""Napoleon Dynamite""?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Sound premise; humor level 5th-7th grade,"I enjoyed Will Ferrill's ""Elf"" a little more than ""Anchorman.""The story is based on a very sound premise: the difficulty in accepting cultural change, specifically women becoming broadcast anchors, giving the news, being primary hosts.  I hate to admit that when I first heard a female voice (Susan Stanburg) doing the anchor job on NPR (National Public Radio), it was shocking, unsettling, too foreign to me. But I adapted fairly quickly and appreciated her talent and that paved the way for more easily accepting women in many anchor or special expert positions.  Now, all I can do is shake my head in wonder at why that was such an initial problem for me.So the story is based on a very significant cultural change our country has gone through and if it was difficult for me, it must have been FAR more difficult for males in the broadcasting industry whose careers were threatened.  (I'm sure that men and women have gone/are going  through similar transitions in many professions -- law, medicine, teaching, clergy, police, the military, etc. -- with more still yet to come.)""Anchorman"" parodies this with what is, in essence a series of skits.  To me, the level of humor seemed around the 5th - 7th grade level, quite far from what could be characterized as dry or sophisticated.I think seeing the film is worthwhile to reinforce memories of that significant cultural change. Each of us will find some gags that are funny and some too juvenile.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tried too hard to be campy.,"The basic story is a chauvinist anchorman is replaced by a woman. In the process, we get several gags from ""Westside Story."" The back story is San Diego, and something going on with a panda.This movie is a good idea but poorly executed. They tried too hard to be campy. When all else failed they fill in with lewdness or gratuitous potty mouth.For people that think, they are watching the wrong version that just might be as there are a theatrical version and an extended cut.The voice-over commentary on the DVD is worse than the movie. So, if you watch streaming that is missing the commentary you have not missed.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Stay classy. And thanks for stopping by.,"Will Ferrell is priceless as Ron Burgundy, a pompous egomaniac who reigns supreme as a local TV anchor in San Diego. This he does with the help of his ""team"" - field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sports anchor Champ Kind (David Koechner), and weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell). They find their macho, sexist world threatened by the arrival of ambitious, gorgeous Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who's determined to prove her worth.""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is one of those ""stupid and damn proud of it"" lowbrow comedies, but, as written by Ferrell and director Adam McKay, it actually works pretty well. It does have a reasonably high quotient of successful gags, even if some of them didn't really land for this viewer.It really benefits from the go-for-broke performances of its talented cast (also including Fred Willard, Chris Parnell, Kathryn Hahn, and Fred Armisen), with Ferrell, Rudd, Koechner, and the hilarious Carell proving to have great chemistry. Applegates' bright presence also really helps a lot. And there's a steady parade of familiar faces in cameo performances both credited and uncredited.Fortunately, I laughed often enough and hard enough to rate this as a good comedy. The best gags tend to get weighted towards the earlier portions of the picture, but ""Anchorman"" does send you away with a smile on your face due to some funny outtakes during the closing credits (including, amusingly enough, one for ""Smokey and the Bandit II""!).Narrated by Bill Kurtis.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An Okay Comedy - But there is Better,"I had too high of hopes for this movie I think, being a huge Will Ferrell fan. Don't get me wrong - it is funny - just not as hilarious as I had assumed it would be. There are plenty of chuckles and cameos to keep you interested in the film, but it is not something I could see over and over again. The outrageous moments seem a little forced to me. Plus the chemistry between the cast is lacking something and even the reels during the credits are not that fantastic. I did enjoy the 1970s feel, but it wasn't enough to salvage the whole movie. I can't help but compare this film to Dodgeball which is much more bizarre and laugh out loud funny, with superb comedic chemistry between all the players. If you need to choose between the two, see Dodgeball.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Mostly Goes Down Smooth,"'Anchorman', set in San Diego, tells the story of lead anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) as he struggles to come to terms with the concept of sexual equality within the work place when Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) joins his local network. The film is very much a parody of 1970's local news anchors with an array of increasingly garish suits and facial hair indicating a strong emphasis on appearance, no matter how terrible the news. For instance in one scene involving a fight between several news teams there is just one rule, 'No touching of hair or face'. It also seems to indicate that the 1970's was a rather dull decade for news reporting with water skiing squirrels and a pregnant panda two of the biggest leads!If you like your comedies big on character development and complex narrative, Anchorman is not for you. Whilst it does touch upon themes of gender inequality in a profession that was just coming to terms with the concept of women as 'anchorwomen', you do get the impression this is merely a sideshow for the gags and hence for the most part the film has almost zero depth. When Burgundy replies 'that doesn't make sense' in relation to one of the movies most quoted lines about the Sex Panter cologne '60% of the time it works every time' you know where he's coming from as must of the hundred or so one liners in this film ('Saint Damien's Beard!', Great Odin's Raven') will leave you scratching your head at the sheer absurdity of it all. Yet at the same time they are so off the cuff as to be equally brilliant and instantly remind you of classics such as 'Airplane!' or 'The Naked Gun' that were packed with so many verbal gags that a lack of story was irrelevant.In fact, when the film begins and the credits reveal that this film was written by Will Ferrell himself you begin to wonder how much of the film was improvised as they went along. Whilst the humour can be crude('Why don't you go back to your home on Whore Island', 'Mr Burgundy you have a massive erection')it never steps over the line into gross out comedy. It is a testament to Ferrell that despite the fact that Ron Burgundy is one of the most self centred, sexist characters in film you find yourself strangely warming to him. Equally excellent is his co star Christina Applegate as his rival for lead anchor. There are also strong performances from the rest of Burgundy's team, for instance Paul Rudd as reporter in the field Brian Fantana and the intellectually challenged Brick Tamland played by Steve Carrell ('years later doctors will tell me I have an IQ of 48').Whilst it is refreshing to see a comedy that provides consistent laughs throughout its duration it is perhaps fair to say in the main these are moderate rather than side-splitting. Also, whilst the fight scene between rival news crews is amusing it does seem little more than a who's who with cameos from Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller etc. It is perhaps fair to say that the material is at its funniest when it is closer to the bone in parodying the 'anchorman' of the 1970's. Despite this, this is still one of the best comedies of recent years and if you watch it without asking too many probing questions it appears nothing but a much of people having fun? And what's wrong with that? For in the main, as Ron Burgundy says 'it goes down smooth'.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good fun if you enjoy wacky, offbeat comedies","Silly, childish comedies like 'Anchorman' are always divisive. There are a lot of people who hate these types of films, while for others they turn out to be real guilty pleasures. For this one, I'm the latter. 'Anchorman' did crack me up on more than one occasion and I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. It's one of those that's just so stupid you must be dead inside if you don't crack a smile.The ridiculous plot and goofy characters mean that the laughs come thick and fast and, unlike a lot of other comedies of its kind, it never runs out of stupid situations and jokes. Will Ferrell was the sole reason I decided to give this movie a chance and he didn't disappoint, he was hilarious throughout as the anchor. For entertainment value, 'Anchorman' is great, but those who can bear silly humour and cheap gags should probably look elsewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny Comedy with a Good Story.,"Review:
'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is a comedy film directed by Adam McKay.
Adam McKay kills it in his directorial debut with Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. He really thrived bringing what could have been a very dumb SNL skit type of comedy and made it something more. There were no jokes that didn't hit, and it go all go all the time.
It's the 1970s, and San Diego super-sexist anchorman Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is the top dog in local TV, but that's all about to change when ambitious reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives as a new employee at his station.
This is the first movie which brought Will Ferrell and Adam McKay together for brilliant comedic performances of both parts. Will Ferrell was unbelievably funny as the lead Ron Burgundy. As well as masterful comedic and quotable lines, and a once-in-a-lifetime legendary comedic cast with Steve Carrell, Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, David Koecher and Christina Applegate, great acting by everyone in the film for a comedy movie, every joke hit for me.
People still quote lines from this film today, well over a decade later, which is a pretty good indicator whether a film is good or not. It's childish, offensive & in many parts just straight up ridiculous, but there's no denying the genuine laughs this movie delivers. Many say this is where Will Ferrell peaked & they might just be right.
Overall, this movie has tons of laughs and it's very memorable. It Will Ferrell at his best being partnered up with Adam McKay. I can recommend this movie to anybody who loves a good, funny comedy movie.

Just awful,"The best thing I can say about Anchorman is that it was shot in focus for at least the first 50 minutes of the movie. After that I couldn't tell you as I'd left to go do something less mind-numbingly idiotic than watch the movie.I'm not even speaking from the point of view of a high-brow aficionado. Although my two favourite genres are technological thrillers and sci fi, I do enjoy silliness in the from of movies like American Pie. I've even been known to willingly watch and laugh at Beavis and Butthead. But Anchorman is so bad that I actually cringed with sympathy for the embarrassment the people who made it must feel.This is without doubt the very worst movie I've ever attempted to watch.

"Awful, predictable, boring, unfunny, walked out...","I love movies. I'll see a really good movie nine times, paying full admission at the theater. I'm not really a critic. Give me a good story with interesting characters and I won't notice small editing flaws. I'm very willing to suspend disbelief and escape into the plot. I've walked out on 4 movies in my lifetime. This was one of them. I went to see it with two people who love to laugh at the movies. They usually get the whole theater laughing. No one laughed in Anchorman. It was truly awful. I am especially disappointed because my favorite movie critic, Gary Cogill, really liked it. He almost never recommends a bad movie, but this movie was poorly written and acted, had no plot, was completely predictable, and boring. We stayed 20 minutes to give it a fair chance.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Sketch Comedy Alums Slap Each Other Silly,"The standard-bearer for Will Ferrell's own personal subgenre, which can best be summarized as ""gather a giant circle of friends, run them through the wardrobe department, amuse each other and burn film."" I'm not sure how much of this plot was actually set to paper before it caught a studio green light, but it can't have been more advanced than just a few broad strokes. Arrogant 1970s TV news anchor is challenged by a female rival - yeah, we've probably written enough. When can we start filming?Fortunately for Ferrell (and for the viewing audience), he and his buddies are really freaking good at plucking nuggets of comic gold from thin air. None of the best bits have anything to do with the plot, nor do they need to; a truth which liberates the cast to venture as far from the beaten path as they please. Effectively a poker-faced comedic arms race, Anchorman's every scene sees its stars on the verge of breaking character because the things they're hearing and saying are so bluntly, outrageously absurd. There's a certain delight to dreaming up a really good phrase or reaction, and its traces are painted on almost every face in almost every scene. They can't wait to try their next improv punchline, or to hear what comes out of the others' mouths. That inclusive, free-spirited energy carries right through the screen. The comedians' visible glee and unguarded attitudes make us feel like we're a part of the group, not just an unrelated observer.Anchorman is the type of flick you'll watch with an unbroken grin, even when there's no immediate reason for it. Pure funny, just for the sake of funny. Maybe it's a little loud, infantile and repetitive, but it doesn't really strive to do anything more than play around and soak up the resulting laughs. Plenty of those to go around.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not much more to it than that and the story is simple but it was definitely funny which is all this movie needed to be. The sequel was very disappointing though.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Cinematic junk food,"Judging from the state (and unaccountable success)of this movie, it seems that audience standards are declining as the spoof comedy becomes increasingly difficult for Hollywood filmmakers to successfully pull off without blundering into juvenile crassness. One condition is probably a result of the other - although which came first is open to conjecture - and, considering the film's success, it seems as if it will be a long time before things are turned around.Anchorman 'satirises' US TV of the 70s with a deftness of touch as subtle as Will Ferrell's wig and a vast appetite for laughs that it never comes close to satisfying. This is cinematic junk food: too bland, too homogeneous and too lacking in substance to offer any real nourishment, and simply offering a quick fix to those who don't care what they ingest just as long as it offers them a few moments of escape. Too often, while watching this flick, you get the feeling that the writers are just throwing every idea they have - good, bad or indifferent - at the screen in the hope that someone somewhere will find it amusing. Hit and miss comparisons are redundant here because the hits don't exist. Even the moments that should work don't because the makers overplay their hand each time they come close to hitting on a funny idea.On this evidence, Will Ferrell is a better comedy actor than he is a comedy writer, and only his clever performance salvages anything from the untidy wreckage of this collision of scenes. Christina Applegate looks good but contributes little while Ferrell's sidekicks are mostly just irritating. Nothing meshes here: the plot is repeatedly sacrificed in favour of another weak gag; touched with inspired insanity, plot doesn't matter - the humour is enough to carry the viewer - but here the weakness of the material simply serves as a constant reminder that nothing is happening - and its not happening in a very unfunny way.Even the out-takes aren't funny.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"""Im Ron Burgundy.  Go f*** yourself San Diego""","Let me start by saying that I am not Will Ferrells biggest fan. I have enjoyed many of his films but, like Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey before him, it always feels like he is playing the same character over and over. The problem that I have with him is that this particular character was perfected in Anchorman - if he ever plays a better role than Ron Burgundy I will be (pleasantly) surprised.Lets not beat around the bush. This is Ferrells film. He wrote and starred and it is clear that it plays to his strengths as a comedian. There is not a scene he is in where he isn't perfect. He will not be winning any best actor awards for these types of performance and rightly so but for the roles he plays, his performance as Ron Burgundy is second to none.This film is so, so funny. From start to finish the humour comes thick and fast. There are some really off the wall moments (the gang fight springs instantly to mind) and some stupidly childish moments (Sex Panther anyone?!) and these sit along some great one liners (the teleprompter scene to which the subject refers and the reaction of Ron to it are priceless) and set pieces. There is no way that I can even start to bookmark the comedy in the film. It is a potent mixture that comes together effectively to create a wild ride that ensures you are never bored. It is as far from high brow as you can get but at the same time sufficiently above dick and fart jokes as to let it stand out from the crowd.Ferrell is supported by a stellar cast, a who's who of film comedians in the 2000's. Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell (who has limited focus but steals the scenes he is in) are the most obvious but Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan and Luke Wilson pop up to add to the fun. They are clearly enjoying themselves and their performances bar none are brilliant.I cannot give high enough praise to Anchorman. It is never going to win Oscars but as a pure, balls out, hilarious film you are going to struggle to find anything better. The highest praise that I can give is that I have now watched Anchorman at least 5 times now and am not even close to tiring of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I don't know how a person's arm being cut off, a dog being kicked off a bridge, a woman (played by the poor Christina Applegate) being called a dirty bitch, can be funny.

"A Silly, but Delightful Comedy","Anchorman launches us into the world of the 1970's broadcast journalism with local San Diego anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) as the poster boy for men behaving badly. His supporting anchors introduce themselves by breaking the fourth wall with all the casual gusto of their on-air person as. There's good-IL'-boy Champ Kind (David Koechner) with sports, ladies' man Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) in the field, and dumb-as-a-Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) on weather. Soon, new reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) enters the fray. Improbably, Ron and Veronica hit it off until a series of events puts her in the co-anchor seat and professional jealousy rips them apart, sending Ron on a downward spiral.Anchorman is funny from beginning to end, mainly thanks to Ferrell's incessant and skillful need to be zany at all moments of filming. Ferrell is so good at turning even the worst material into something witty that there is really no point in analyzing the script; the only thing that can be said is that the script obviously gave Ferrell and the rest of the cast free range to work their magic, and also throws in some calculated jabs at the television journalism. For instance, for the entire movie all of the news stations are clambering over the story of a pregnant panda at the zoo, labeling it as ""the story of the decade."" Funny enough, this isn't too far from the truth as local news tends to put a huge emphasis on unimportant animal stories.Written by Will Farrell and director Adam McKay, it's a campy, extended ""Saturday Night Live"" skit - but an amusing one. While Ferrell embodies the clueless buffoon, he and Applegate have a cheerful comedic chemistry which is even more apparent in the outtakes that play over the final credits. Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and Vice Vaughn pop up in cameos, and the soundtrack is a delight.Overall: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Timeless classic...,"I love this movie, from going and watching it when it first came out in theaters, to buying it first thing as it was released on dvd. One of the most quotable comedy films of the 2000s in my opinion. Will Ferrell was so funny with some of his phrases and did a little improv in the film too which was fun. Same goes for the rest of the all-star cast.One big thing about this film is, that I ended up acquiring a very dear friend to me that played in it. And still friends with her this very day. Her name is Darcy Donavan and she played ""Sherry""/""Hot Blonde"" in this film.That scene of the movie she was in tagged the line that has been ranked as one of the top phrases from the film where Will said, ""Well...hello...you pointed to your boobies.""A funny story too one that Darcy has shared many times is they wanted her to say something to him to throw him off and use as a blooper.

"""I love... carpet. I love... desk. I love... lamp.""","A consistently funny movie whose humour is very similar to that of Seth McFarlane's ""Family Guy"", minus the flashbacks and never-ending chicken fights. The basics are still more or less the same: thin, largely inconsequential plot line, one-dimensional characters, non-sequiturs, gay jokes, and half-baked social satire. Steve Carell dominates every scene he's in as the slightly challenged reporter Brick. Though the plot, as I said, is impossible to care very much about, the film never bores thanks to an endless onslaught of dumb jokes and a great cast. Ferrell, Koechner, Carell and the incomparable Paul Rudd are perfect as a quartet of misogynist, homophobic news reporters whose lives are turned up-side-down when an ambitious woman (gasp!), played by Christina Applegate, starts working at their office.Some might say that the social satire doesn't work, but I think that in a time when page after page in newspapers are devoted to the likes of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, the notion that a pregnant panda becomes a huge national event doesn't seem so absurd. Overall very entertaining in a ""I think I just got substantially dumber"" kind of way. If the steady stream of gags don't do it for you, there's always the virtual marathon of cameos to enjoy: Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Danny Trejo, Vince Vaughn, Fred Willard, Missi Pyle, Seth Rogen, the list goes on. 60% of the time, you'll like this movie 100% of the time.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I simply felt cheated when I left the theater.Laughing is something you shouldn't have to work at, but here the humor was hard to uncover. Ferrell's humor reminds me of the old sports adage ""You can't win by just throwing your jockstrap out on the field (or floor), you must actually play the game."" Ferrell walks into a scene and looks or says something stupid and we're expected to laugh? How about this line; ""I love lamp, I love carpet..."".",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I can't wait to own this movie!!!,"This movie was hilarious. I think I missed a few lines because I was laughing so hard. The jokes were consistently funny, and a certain scene featuring a dog and some bears was one of the funniest ever. The cast is great. The jokes are almost always dead on. There are plenty of cameos. What more could you ask for?Will Ferrell is amazing as Ron Burgundy, and Christina Applegate is adorable, but the real star is Steve Carell of Daily Show fame. His innocent yet ultimately mentally retarded character often steals scenes, as does Burgandy's dog Baxter. The audience clapped loudly for Baxter's triumphs.I had and still have no desire to see Elf, but this movie was long anticipated and well worth it. One of the funniest I've seen in a long time.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Like a Cartoon,"I can only recommend this movie because it is no more than its intentions. When it begin, I thought it was at least trying to be somewhat realistic. Once I got over that, it turned out to be pretty funny. In nearly every instance, the most outrageous kind of behavior was presented. The romantic angle and the seriousness of the young woman, striving to be an anchor herself in the good old boys' club, becomes as ridiculous as the whole Will Ferrell schtick. Scenes are borrowed from other movies (The Sandlot with the guys from the other TV station on bikes or Gangs of New York with brutality and dismemberment). I did find Ron Bergundy charming. Everything is locker room, but they are all such boobs that you can't take them seriously. The fact that the world is set on its ear over the birth of a panda while other more serious stuff gets no time at all is pretty believable. Those other three guys are hilarious. I loved the photo shoots they used to lead in to the news. If you want something that has no real message because it is so sophomoric, but you can laugh at the implausible (an almost cartoonish sense), go ahead and blow and hour and a half on this. Just don't expect to be enlightened.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny but inconsistent with only a few memorable segments,"Being a big fan of Will Ferrell and ""SNL"" humor in general I made a blind buy with the ""Anchorman"" DVD. I had heard it was supposed to be very funny, and to some extent it is - there are a few scenes that are hilarious, and a few clever/subtle jokes that you might miss on first viewing.However, I was overall disappointed with the film, and felt it was a bit too silly and over-the-top. I do enjoy silly comedies but this one was just a bit too childish - the first ten minutes are awful stuff, with not a single good joke, and just loads of lame sex gags.However the ""Gangs of New York"" battle spoof is utterly hilarious and no doubt the scene I will remember most. It has a handful of really funny jokes - ""Oh yeah? Well you're about to be in dead place!"" being one of them.The cameos are really amusing - Ben Stiller, Vince Vaugn, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, and Tim Robbins amongst them (there are also some SNL actor cameos scattered throughout). However the one thought I came away with was this: Ben Stiller really needs to slow down the amount of movies he's starring in! Cameo or not....Ferrell is funny as always and (as always) never breaks character. He's good at doing this and like Phil Hartman is the sort of comedian who, even off-screen, still seems to act distant and humorous. Ron Burgundy is a funny character, and Ferrell portrays him well. The movie's sexist commentary of the 1970s and the clever news group insights are worth watching for, as are some of the few funny scenes - however overall this really is a disappointment, being too childish and stupid, and I for one just felt it missed a lot of potential.That said, some of the jokes will stay with you, like, ""Because you're probably wanted for murder."" It's a testament to Ferrell's abilities that he can make unfunny lines very funny, relying solely on pronunciation and delivery for effectiveness.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Dumb, but very funny","I was not expecting it to work, especially after seeing the dreadful The Other Guys recently which to my understanding also had director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell together. But somehow it did. Although it is very dumb in places, some of the plot with its episodic feel has the feeling of an overlong comedy sketch even with its interesting observations about the workplace and battle-of-the-sexes and there is the odd puerile joke that doesn't work. However, the film is quite short, moves quickly and the hit jokes more than make up for the misses, the best of them being the moment when Burgundy slips the announcer a fistful of cash to introduce his co-host as ""Tits McGee"". The film looks good too, with the photography and editing crisp and make-up, sets and costumes top-notch, and the script is very funny and smart. McKay's direction is good, and the enthusiastic playing of the cast gives the film an extra list. Will Ferrell, who I don't care for usually, gives one of his funnier and better performances, Steve Carell comes very close to stealing the movie in a zany turn and Christina Applegate is on sparkling form. I also enjoyed the cameo appearances of Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller, and also of Danny Trejo. All in all, a dumb movie but also a very funny one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A fantastic comedy, full of quotable one-liners. Ferrell will have you talking like Ron Burgendy by the end.","Having never really watched a Will Ferrell movie, except for his roll as the evil villain in 'Zoolander' I expected this film to be full of slapstick and ridiculous moments as such, selling out for a few cheap laughs.This film goes way beyond cheap laughs and progresses to what i would regard as 'Genius' comedy moments full of well scripted one-liners (some very cheesy but fully quotable) and well timed by all the cast.In short, the film is based in 1970's Chicago, San Diego. ""In a time when Ugly people were allowed to be on TV"" top local anchorman Ron Burgundy(Ferrell) and his news team Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) Champ Kind (David Koechner) and Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) are challenged by the emergence of a female newsreader, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) joining the team, jostling with Ron for the lead anchor chair in the newsroom.With cameo appearances from an all star cast including Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black amongst others.

Proofs that a comedy needs to be more than just silly to be a great one.,"The story already forces you to not take this movie seriously. There basically is no plot-line, as a matter of fact, this is one of those movies in which the story really isn't relevant. The movie could had had any other story-line but just have the same silly characters, dialog and situations, regardless of.It's one of this silly over-the-top comedies, that has both some big hits and huge misses. The good and funny moments definitely make this movie worthwhile but it simply is not the best or most consistent comedies around. The movie relies (too much) on its silly over-the-top comedy characters. The actors that portray them are definitely good and obviously very experienced in the comedy-genre, so they still make most part of the movie and its jokes work out fine but because of its inconsistency this movie is also a quite forgettable one, even though it certainly had some memorable moments. It's a movie that's perhaps fun to watch once but I don't think I want to watch it again any time soon.In the end it really are the actors that definitely make this movie a worthwhile one. I didn't necessarily liked Will Ferrell in the main role, in my opinion Ferrell is better and funnier when he plays smaller comedy roles, in similar movies like this one. Perhaps also a reason why I didn't liked this movie that much. But the supporting cast is really superb. Of course no matter what she ever does, Christina Applegate shall always be remembered as Kelly Bundy from ""Married with Children"" but in this movie she shows that she can handle other comedy roles just as well and just as convincing. Other stellar comedy roles are there from Steve Carell, Paul Rudd and Fred Willard. Some fun cameos are there from; Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Danny Trejo, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller. I just love how these guys always pop up in to each other movies, just for the fun of it. It makes this movie for the fans of the silly-comedies from the late '90's and '00's still a bit of a must-see and a recommendable movie, despite its flaws.It's fun that the movie is set in the '70's but it unfortunately doesn't do enough with this fact, comical-wise. A missed opportunity in my opinion.It overall is a fun, silly brainless movie to watch, that will certainly entertaining but don't expect it to make a lasting hilarious impression.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Amazing!,"I just looked at the votes that people have already cast for this movie on imdb.com, and I am amazed at how many gave this movie a 10! There must be some hard-core Will Ferrell fans out there.Let me state first that I'm not familiar with Will Ferrell, but I am assuming that he is one of a long line of Saturday Night Live comedians trying to make it in the movie world. I'm not sure if Ron Burgundy is a character from SNL that was brought to the big screen, but it certainly has that flavor to it.Well, many of the reasons that I totally detested this movie fall in line with many of the reasons that I stopped watching SNL decades ago. The characters in ""Anchorman"" (and SNL) have been dumbed down to such a low level that they are annoying and straining for laughs constantly. The majority of the attempted humor in this movie was derived from characters acting just plain stupid in normal situations. That can be used effectively if it isn't overdone in a movie, but it just never ends in this movie.A few positive things about this movie: There really wasn't much of the ""potty"" humor that seems to be required in just about every Hollywood comedy these days. Also, Christina Applegate does a decent job as a more talented reporter, and actually is much funnier than most of the characters when she plays it ""straight"" against the stupidity of the other characters. This is actually a totally opposite character from her days as Kelly Bundy on ""Married ... with Children"", she she does it quite well. Also, she seems to be becoming even more attractive as time passes by - she looks quite stunning in many of the shots. A final positive note: The theater was almost entirely empty on the opening weekend Friday night.If I went to this movie by myself (which really wouldn't have happened), I would have walked out within the first 20 minutes. Since I was with a friend (her suggested movie, of course), I roughed it.I will state that judging by the votes already on imdb, many people do seem to like this type of humor. So, if you think that the previews of this movie were hilarious, you will probably enjoy the movie - the previews capture the soul of the movie pretty well, without showing you all the things you would think are ""funny stuff"".However, if you aren't sure whether you will like this movie based upon what you see in the previews, you should stay away - this movie gets very tiring and predictable fast.My rating: 1 (... Only because '0' wasn't an option)",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Anchorman,"My first reaction to the film Anchorman when I saw it, I thought this movie was lame and boring but then after I saw the entire film it was really funny. The impression that the film had on me was it's stupidity and , at the same time it was really hilarious. The theme that really jumps out of it was how guys express their manliness.The movie is really cool and funny as the character's lines are really random, especially Brick's dialogues. The major characters are Ron Burgandy, which was played by Will Ferell, Veronica Corningstone played by Christina Applegate, Brian Fantana played by Paul Rudd, Brick Tamland played by Steve Carell and Champ Kind is played by David Koecher. The movie is about four anchorman that are number one rated on T.V. news. They are very manly in every way. They need to be well dressed, need to have an eloquent speech; from their mind it is eloquent but on reality it is stupid, and the most important thing for them is their hair. Everything is going quite well until they got mixed up by a woman and their boss put her as Ron Burgandy's co-anchor. From that point, their manliness went down and messed up.Some background scenes were really unrealistic. Just like how the dog got kicked by some guy that Ron Burgandy had an argument on the road, went down on the river and is still alive. It is really crazy. The scene shots are simple but well framed. The cinematography did look quite well for a movie of 70s. The camera angles, the backgrounds scenes and how the director cut the film and changed the background eagerly after the scene was made were really nice and well filmed.All the actors and actresses gave out their best performance just to make this movie really funny. In this movie you'll notice that everything is exaggerated. The lines were delivered and acted very exaggerated.The film really got me laughing. It is stupid and hilarious. I would definitely going to recommend this movie to my family and friends so, they could have a laugh from it. Comedic films are really good movies because through this people would really have a time to stop thinking about the dilemmas that they are currently facing but just to have their time to smile and just to relax.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Over the top  silly,"This film is perhaps one of the silliest films ever made. Nothing in it can be taken serious or whats ever. There its just massive sequences of silly, childish and absurd scenes going on. Yeah, it's funny in about...60% of the time? But sure, there is nothing more added in this film. A strong critic against the TV News, perhaps?Also, some jokes sounds way too forced and not funny at all (The famous 'Fart Jokes, frequently used in the Judd Apatow's works or related material). The characters are way too dumb and silly for my taste. This coming from a big fan of super-silly comedies. Seriously. It' almost tiring to see that much of cartoon-ish characters sharing the same place on the screen.Yes, it has his Laugh out Load moments, more than one, guarantee. The cameos were remarkable moments as well.

Great absurdist comedy,"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy loves spontaneous insanity. It's an unpredictable comedy in which the most random things can happen at any given moment and the results are often glorious. It's super quotable, really funny and uses the overall stupidity for great jokes as well as solid commentary on workplace harassment.Will Ferrell is amazing as Ron Burgundy, who might be his greatest character. All of his lines are delivered with such a hilariously exaggerated nature. His performance is even better because he's supported by David Koechner, Paul Rudd, and Steve Carell who are all just as absurd. Christina Applegate has to play it more straight but still gets to have a lot of fun.Adam McKay's direction has a manic energy that helps to prevent the plot-less shenanigans from feeling too disjointed. This is such a strong directorial debut, purely on the comedic timing opposed to any visual dynamism, although its narration, animated sequence and epic news fight all add significantly to the films complete and total commitment to the bit.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Afternoon Delight ... Sorta,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Fellow SNL writers and alum (Director) Adam McKay and Will Ferrell deliver a decent comedy with solid writing and mediocre direction.  It misses being a great comedy because it fails to provide any ""Classic moments or lines"" that we associate with the great ones.  We can all quote lines from ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Office Space"" and ""Caddyshack"", but my guess is ""Anchorman"" will fade to black.  I say this despite the pure genius of Will Ferrell, who is the funniest guy working today in film.  He prevents the film from sliding into nothingness.  His physical presence and facial gestures are enough to keep the audience smiling ... but rarely howling.  Christina Applegate (""Married With Children"") is miscast and mostly awful in her poorly written role.  Jury is out on whether she will make a successful transition to film.  Overall, I was definitely hoping for better.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Absolutely Hilarious,"I really don't like commenting on movies after seeing them only once, unless they are terrible, but this is an exception. I saw Anchorman last night and can proudly say, that after one viewing, it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I mean, a movie with Will Ferrell with that hair and mustache standing in front of the camera and just making faces and saying random gibberish would be funny. Obviously this means Will Farrell steals just about every scene he is in, but to balance it out more a lot of time went into to making the other characters have very good one liners and some of the scenes where they are all together are some of the finest comedy scenes ever shot.Now in a comedy movie I don't look for story development, great acting, or meaningful love scenes, but I do want very good characters and good writing talent and this is what I got with this movie. To top it off the story isn't half bad (For a comedy movie, very original), the acting is very good for a comedy, and while I'm a strong believer that comedy and romance do not work, Ferrell seems to make it funny.I really don't like ruining good movies for people by telling them stuff that happens in them, so what I'll do is just do some generalization type things:I've never laughed more during a boner scene. - While Ferrell is the funniest anchor, Steve Carrell steals a few scenes from him. - Next to Chuck Norris in Dodgeball, which has nothing on this movie, Jack Black has the greatest cameo ever in a comedy movie. - You don't need to speak Spanish in order to get the best joke in the movie... You just need to think stereotypes are funny.That's it, I'm done. This is the funniest movie I've scene since Old School and I'm going to have to see it again before I say it's funniest than that movie. This is definitely Will Ferrell's best staring roll and I hope he keeps making hilarious movies... He's easily the next Adam Sandler. Perhaps someday he will make a movie that can dethrone Happy Gilmore as the funniest movie ever, but until then... Enjoy what ya got.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Will Ferrell Makes Comic News,"Will Ferrell proves himself a comedy star in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."" In it, he stars as Burgundy, the top news anchor in San Diego in the mid-1970s. He's a stylish maven with a way with words. He leads a news team made up of Champ Kind (played by David Koechner), the crude sports reporter; Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), the sleazy field reporter; and Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), the dimwitted weatherman. Burgundy finds his world turned upside-down with the addition of a female reporter named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). The result is a hilarious tale with outrageous scenes, such as the news anchor war (which features cameos by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and Luke Wilson).

The film has been taken to by young and old. i myself had a conversation with a man of 70 years old in work about the film. he agreed on most of the points i was making mainly about the jazz flute being the most noble instrument a man about town could play. so much so i recently purchased one from a flee market on impulse.

Hilarious Will Ferrell comedy,"The Legend of Ron Burgandy (2004): Anchorman is routinely funny and many a times I laughed out loud. Will Ferrell carries the movie on his broad shoulders, nailing the character perfectly. He becomes Ron: the shallow-but-photogenic anchorman whose back-stage pettiness contradicts his on-screen friendliness. And, even though Ron is a chauvinist, Ferrell brings out his likeability. Christina Applegate is an effective foil. The comedic centerpiece of Anchorman is a no-holds-barred rumble between San Diego's various anchor teams. With cameos by Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson, this is as funny and memorable a scene as any in Anchorman. Anchorman is a very funny motion picture, but it also has a good sense of the time (the 1970s) and how the medium of TV news was changing.

Pretty good (most of the time),"I have a weird relationship with this film. Or at least it occupies a rare space in my brain reserved for a select number of films which I can't work out whether I like or hate. Most people saw it before me and raved about how good it was. So, when I sat down to watch it, I was obviously expecting something absolutely amazing. I ended up not liking it at all. A good few years later I watched it for a second time and it was like watching a film I'd never seen before. I was cracking up at the silly jokes every few seconds and recognised it for the 'classic' that everyone has always said it was. Now, a few years later still, I've watched it again and am left with a mixture of my two previous views.It's about a news team in San Diego during the seventies. Will Ferrell revels in playing the titular character to the extreme and it's full of very low-brow, silly humour and over the top gags. But his time as 'top dog' at the station is threatened by the arrival of a woman who may just be able to read the headlines even better than him.Maybe this film needs time to grow on some people (like me!) as on this third viewing I was actually contemplating turning it off, but it was only the confusion surrounding how much I liked it the second time around that made me stick with it. I don't know whether it's a 'film of two halves,' but I really didn't laugh much for the first forty-five minutes (and it's only a tight ninety minutes runtime all together), but the second half seemed to pick up the pace. I found myself enjoying it more and more and was glad I stuck with it.It's certainly not a 'cerebral' film - the gags, as I say, are the lowest you can get and I think you need to get your mind in the right gear before you can fully get whatever enjoyment you're going to get out of it. I guess I may never see it as the 'classic' that so many do, but it's silly, harmless fun in itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Will Ferrell is making it,"Every time I watched Saturday Night Live (a program I don't watch at the moment), I always thought all the cast was good. They were all funny, and still are. But there were these two guys who were the funniest (in my personal opinion): Norm McDonald and Will Ferrell. Both of them were destined to movies. The first one chose television, and he's still stuck there. The second one, well, has the lead role in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"".This movie is funny, very funny. And the main reason is its cast, with Will Ferrell at his best, as always (he also co-wrote the screenplay). He makes his character believable, although he's always overdoing it. He gives Burgundy the charm and ignorance he needs, and the good heart he shows to have. I laughed a lot watching him.The supporting cast finds the place in this piece. I find in Paul Rudd a gifted actor. I loved him in ""The Shape of Things"", one of my favorite recent films. There, and here also, he does things naturally. Christina Applegate is the important female character, and probably the only one. She seems to be having a good time, overacting most of the scenes, but making them fun (""Take me to Pleasure City"", funny). Steve Carell is fine, but his character seems very familiar to the one he played in ""Bruce Almighty"". And about David Koechner, well, he doesn't have much to do. His Champ could have been a better character.And I have to say the small appearance by Danny Trejo and the cameos of Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black were awesome!About directing and writing, I must say. McKay and Ferrell did the whole thing right. They have worked together in Saturday Night Live and they sure know what they are doing. They know each other, and it seems they had fun writing this stuff. I have no doubt that they'll be doing some other things soon. They love doing this! The rest of the environment is pleasant. There's a constant joy feeling in the set and it's contagious. The film has some scenes that reach stupidity. Maybe what this people were trying to do was that. Make a fool of them, or at least, of the characters they were playing. The scenes I'm talking about are the ones that make you feel like a total fool(""Afternoon Delight"", who responds to love with that?, very funny).I could describe many more things, but I don't want to spoil the ride for you.So I will just put it like this: ""When in Rome...""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Arguably the most quotable film of the 21st Century.,"It really doesn't matter what this film is about, it's a spectacular comedy, made up of wonderful set pieces and brilliant actors who play off each other beautifully.But okay, it's the 70's and San Diego's most trusted source of news and information is Ron Burgundy and his News Team 4. He's a god amongst men, his power at its highest in his small pond. He's also ready to take the leap to the next level and wants to become a national anchor.Then in walks Veronica Corningstone, a female anchor, fighting for attention and airtime in a male dominated world. Despite her dedication to the craft of news, Burgundy's animal magnetism is too strong and they being a torrid, passionate romance. When jealous gets in the way, Ron's world comes crashing down.But none of this is slightly important. What matters most is the jokes. They come thick and fast, and are eminently quotable. 60% of the time, they work every time.It's a brilliant ensemble and can survive endless replays.

One of worse movies ever,"It was disgusting, not funny, and bathroom humor. I found not one laugh line in the whole movie. I cannot imagine why so many people liked this trash. I would have rated it lower than a ""l"" but one was the lowest choice. I do not call words like ""shit"" funny. Anyone with any brains and no talent can write lines like that. I kept waiting and waiting for the funny parts. They never came. I'd have enjoyed myself more by hitting myself on the head with a hammer. It was one of the worse movies ever. If one had a mental IQ under 80 you may have loved this movie. I cannot understand why any actor would associate him or herself with such trash. I don't think Hollywood could write a funny movie like they used to anymore. How about Groudhogs Day, Funny Farm and Overboard? Now they were funny movies. Slapstick comedy is not funny to me. Do not waste your time renting this movie. It was recommended to me by another person. I will never ask their opinion again.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Will Ferrell's funniest film.,"I'm not really a fan of Will Ferrell. I don't think he's that funny. I've hated almost all of his roles. However, I will say that this movie is pretty good. This is probably the funniest Frat Pack film besides Wedding Crashers.The story of a 1970's anchorman who must always be on top is hilarious. He's constantly at battle with other news teams, and he falls in love with an anchorwoman he wants desperately to keep off the air. Some scenes had me cracking up so hard, I had to rewind them six times to see them again. I'm thinking particularly of a scene with an uncredited Jack Black as an angry motorcyclist.Will Ferrell is really at his best here, and this is the only movie I think he really deserves praise for.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Comedy Gold,"Yeah. I give it a 10. It's a comedy and should be rated against other comedies. To that end, it a hilarious movie. One of the best in the genre and remains funny after hundreds of viewing. It's one of those comedies that becomes quoted by the massses.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It was an ok comedy.....,"It is very difficult to take a movie seriously when one gets the feeling the cast isn't taking it seriously. Although I know people who like this movie, for me it's definitely below average and a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting some believability and at least an attempt at a story. I was also expecting a high degree of wit and fun. Instead what I got was a bunch of tired jokes, none very original. There were some positives-the movie wasn't overlong, the direction was good, the story was actually A good one (and would have made an excellent movie if more time had gone into the dialog, and the story had been taken at all Seriously). The best thing in the movie was the outtakes at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the decade's best comedy films,"Its the 1970s. Will Ferrell is Ron Burgundy, a newscaster with a passion for his hair and the jazz flute. He and his news team are shocked when their boss brings in a female newscaster, and immediately try to simultaneously bed her and have her fired. Ron is the main instigator of this, until he finds himself falling in love...Anchorman made me cry with laughter, the gags were all of a crude high quality and the ensemble cast worked together brilliantly. It didn't need to be clever, it wasn't aimed at Woody Allen fans, it was aimed at frat boys and people up for a laugh. The thing that really sells this movie however is that it reaches past it's target audience, my mum and dad love this film, because it is much more intelligent than it needs to be. There is a brilliant joke in every scene and cameos from everyone from Jack Black to Tim Robbins.Will Ferrell is at his best, and his funniest scenes are alongside his news team of David Koechner, Paul Rudd and the sensational Steve Carrell as Brick Tamland. The four of them improvise and create so much comedy that they light up every scene. They are supported brilliantly by Christina Applegate, Vince Vaughan and Fred Willard amongst others. In my opinion this film is as close as I've seen to perfectly cast, I cannot think of any actor that could be replaced.Overall I would describe Anchorman as one of the best movie experiences I have personally had, and it is undoubtedly a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Birth of Bear TV,"7 of 10. While ostensibly mocking the local TV news of the 1970s, part of the parody of which is local TV news has only become more appearance obsessed and vapid since then, it also mocks all of 1970s mainstream TV.It's a world where street gang fights happen out of nowhere with ridiculous rules for ridiculous reasons, dogs are superheroes, grizzly bears can be reasoned with, and the world stops for a smoke after sex and to watch panda bears giving birth at a zoo.It's the sort of film that makes Michael Jackson look like the natural result of an isolated 1970s child star seeing the world through TV. It also makes his videos amusing to watch as unintended satire. Someone popping up singing ""Beat it"" during the news gang scenes would have been a perfect addition to the absurd, over-the-top humor that dominates this film.It's also a film that seems wiser with each passing year. Worth seeing before or after Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013).",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Not quite as ""legendary"" as some would hope, this one-liner bonanza is hit-and-miss, with too many misses","What happens when a bunch of acting buddies take a crazy idea and stretch it to epic proportions? We get Anchorman: Legend of Ron Burgundy. Written by the lead actor Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay, and then improvised to death by the stars throughout the film, this is really a hit-and-miss movie. Unfortunately though, we get plenty of misses amongst the few hits. This technique of improvising the same scenes over and over again is what made movies like Caddyshack and Dumb and Dumber complete classics, and what saved Talladega Nights, but unfortunately wasn't enough to carry this film far enough out of boredom every so often. The plethora of cameos and surprise appearances couldn't quite save the film, despite for the most part being very humorous. Last but not least, there just wasn't enough Steve Carell.Anchorman follows the journeys of a popular San Diego news anchor whose placement at the top seemed to not have an end. Followed by his trusty crew and his news station, he remains on top of the ratings with his charm, ability to capture attention, and maybe even with his hair. Could be the hair, who knows? But, but, a rising anchorwoman was threatening his placement at the top and that thread is named Veronica. As she continues to gain support of the ratings, Ron starts losing respect, friends, and potentially, even his job. One side plot involves the constant rivalry between him and the other news stations, which escalates to epic proportions as the second act rolls around.Will Ferrell has his moments indeed, he can be a very funny man, and he is one of the leaders in one-liners. Yet, underneath the one-liners lie a lot of jokes that just fall flat, including his antics with his dog, his ""guns,"" and his embarrassing way of trying to impress women. Same problem goes with the rest of the cast; they all had their moments in the spotlight, but at other moments were quite boring. McKay also failed to bring out any humorous moments with the lead female, the usually funny Christina Applegate, whose beginnings included her hilarious portrayal as Kelly in ""MarriedWith Children."" This idea wasn't meant to be a motion picture, but instead more like a Saturday Night Live skit, a recurring one at that. One would wonder if all the extra material filmed that didn't end on the final draft could have improved the movie a bit more.The best performance by far was that of Steve Carell. His expressions, his dialogue, his posture, and his comic timing is absolutely brilliant, if only others followed his lead. Steve Carell was an obvious star on the rise, and it was a total shame he wasn't utilized a bit more, because he delivered some of the funnier moments in Anchorman. What kept Anchorman going was actually all the cameos and small roles by famous actors, including Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan, Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, and Fred Armisen. Best part of the movie happens with tons of cameos, as all the crews of the competing news stations join together and.dance.Yet, after that amazingly funny scene, it all slows down almost to a halt. It becomes almost unbearable as the third act rolls around and we see Will Ferrell run out of improvising ideas and the writers running out of material. The climax falls kind of flat as well, with once again Carell helping a bit. The ending pulls in way too fast, and what we have ourselves is a quotable movie, but with nothing really worth watching more than once. Hey, just because you can quote it doesn't make it any good, right?Bottom Line: A reunion, a party, a festival of improvising fiends with a knack of stretching an idea and not being afraid to take risks is what basically makes Anchorman a watchable film at times, but then a bore at other moments. Obviously it was fun filming in an atmosphere where anything goes, but sadly not all the fun is transferred to the screen, to the viewer. We get decent scenes, and then get boring scenes. It was a hit-and-miss film like Talladega Nights and other Frat Pack movies, but unlike Talladega Nights, it gets kind of slow. Will Farrell can do these kinds of movies for only so long before they become repetitive, and its about time to explore other ways to make people laugh. McKay deserves credit for being able to film despite not having much control over the filming, but he should have filled in the gaps in between instances of comedic gold with some material. You can get by on improvisation for only so long.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Hysterical Film!,"Ron Burgundy is San Diego's top rated newsman in the male dominated broadcasting of the 1970's, but that's all about to change when a new female employee, Veronica Corningstone, with ambition to burn arrives in his office.This is an above-average comedy that has clever and corny jokes which is the reason why this film is so funny. The most notable funniest character in the movie is Brick Tamland, played by Steve Carell, of course. The dialog is filled with witty and smart humor rather than physical and toilet humor, which I don't mind.These characters act so serious in the movie that they don't even know they're funny. I mean, even though the movie tries to act serious doesn't mean it is meant to be taken seriously, like the last part of the film.Tons of characters in the movie, including Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate, give funny performances. There are also tons of funny cameos by other actors and actresses.Ig you actually want to laugh out loud and want a great comedy with funny performances, this is the movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Comical mastery!!,"It's been a year of entertainment and some great movies and there has so far been a good standard in comedies. A lot of the comedies have been the usual poor Hollywood tripe but this year we have now probably seen above the average in genuinely funny comedies, far above the average in fact. There has been School Of Rock, Stuck On You, Starsky And Hutch, Scary Movie 3, Shrek 2, Shaun Of The Dead and now Anchorman, all this and I've yet to see Dodgeball that has had a positive response from critics. Anchorman is the years second appearance from Will Ferrell who appeared in a small role in Starsky And Hutch and Ferrell is one of the upcoming stars of the comedy genre. While Eddie Murphy and Steven Martin seem destined to make poor movies made primarily for young kids and are drifting into the land of the unfunny where dinosaurs like Mel Brooks, Rodney Dangerfield play table tennis with Chevy Chase and other former comical masters and box office greats. The current king of comedy Jim Carrey looks set to move away from slapstick, face contorting mugging and into more serious roles because he has the acting ability to do so. So the likes of Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller, Jack Black and of course Ferrell are the new guard coming in to rescue us from boredom and tickle our funny bones.Anchorman is a simple yet excellent premise set during the 70's. Ron Burgendy is a news Anchorman, the best of the best and a mans man and when Veronica comes into the office as firstly a news reporter, Ron and his team of co-horts are suddenly thrown into disarray. Ron initially falls in love with her but after the split he tries to sabotage her and the end up in a bitter feud to become the best anchor. It's all predictable but in truth the story isn't important in a film like this. This is merely a film with a character and situations that allow Ferrell to display his comic genius. Much like School Of Rock was the Jack Black show, this is the Will Ferrell show. It's all about Ferrell, he accounts for the majority of the films entertainment. If Ferrell wasn't as funny as he is the film wouldn't get by on the scripts jokes or the story it's essentially simplistic stuff, almost a blank canvass for Ferrell to work his artistry. Ferrell is unbelievably funny. I like Ferrell but I needed proof he could hold a movie in a lead role, he proves it here. I needed similar proof from Jack Black and he delivered in School Of Rock. Ferrell has excellent support from everybody's favourite former sexy-sitcom daughter, Christina Applegate who is more than adept at comedy. Also some supporting characters by Paul Rudd, Vince Vaughn and a particularly funny role for Steve Carrell as the intellectually challenged weatherman Brick Tamlan.Overall this is a magnificent piece of popcorn fun and Ferrell proves he has the comedy chops for the big time. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This movie started with a bang...I was laughing a lot at the opening; but then it just started to fizzle. So many of its jokes just do not work. The dog was cute, I suppose, but even that part of the story got to be just stupid at the end of the movie. SPOILER...and what the heck was the rumble scene about? The Monty Python-esquire chopping off limb scene didn't work all! What a waste of talent! And speaking of waste of talent...I kept waiting for Fred Willard to have a little screen time...and that's what he got; A LITTLE screen time. Too bad. The TV news industry is SUCH an easy target! There are lots of opportunities for smart and witty dialog. This movie digressed into banal sexual humor fairly early in the film and never dug itself out of that pit.

Not surprisingly, this film was right up my alley. It is a terrific tribute/satire of network news in the 1970's, with Will Farrell as the swinging and somewhat childlike lead anchor chasing after the new female co-anchor Christina Applegate.In this movie, the news crew can be seen randomly bursting into song in the middle of the workday for no apparent reason and getting into massive brawls in the streets of San Diego with other competing news network crews, with hilarious cameos by actors like Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller as the competing anchors.Anybody who enjoys plain old random humor like me will absolutely find this film hilarious.

Him and his 3 more or less retarded friends are the news-team. One day, the hot female reporter Veronica Corningstone is added to the team. The 4 men definitely don't like the idea of sharing their news with a woman, and even worse, she clearly plans on taking Ron's job!There were only a few moments in this movie where I wasn't amused. With this, I mean the annoying dog Baxter and its stupid subtitles. However, the idiocy of Ron Burgundy is good solid comedy.

Too slow and not that well written.,"Anchorman received many good reviews from other critics.  I have no idea why though. The movie lacks the substance that any good movie should have.  As well as a decent plot or strong character development. There are many guest appearances from many big name actors, such as Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black and Luke Wilson, but after one or two scenes they're never seen again.  The main story is it's the 1970's, and Christina Applegate's character becomes the first anchorwoman on television and Will Ferrall and his friends feel threatened by her arrival.  Meanwhile, Will Ferrall develops a romantic relationship with Applegate's character. Anchorman does have its moments, but for the most part it's filled with cheap laughs and antics.  I thought Will Ferrall did a much better job in Zoolander.  Overall I gave the movie 4 out of 10 stars.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Take this test to see if you would enjoy this movie,"To take this test you need to remember The Mary Tyler Moore show from the 1970s, because there are some similarities to this movie.  This movie is set in the 1970s so it is appropos to this examination.Question 1: Would you enjoy a movie starring a news anchorman that is as out of touch with reality as Ted Baxter and is more crude?Question 2: Would you enjoy a movie co-starring a reporter like Mary Tyler Moore but has no common sense?Question 3: Are you cut out for the kind of corny humor, so extreme that it could be compared to having five spoons of sugar in your morning coffee?For me the answer is a resounding NO!  I liked The Mary Tyler Moore show and even though there were some similarities in two of the major cast members, it was the worst movie I have seen in recent memory.  I did not crack a smile.  My wife asked me if I wanted to leave 45 minutes into the movie when it became apparent that it wouldn't get any better, and mercifully it only lasted an hour and a half.  The reason I did not leave the movie early is that I kept looking for Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) to turn things around at that TV station and make it into a legitimate news organization.I say this movie was a total, unmitigated failure.

Ron manages to win this woman over, but it all turns south when he realises she is his competitor after she covers his shift when he doesn't turn up on time.This leads to petty arguments and escalates quite quickly into some truly ridiculous situations.

A classic.,"Judging by some of the reviews on here, you'd think that this movie was some sort of horrible atrocity along the lines of Daddy Day Camp. In reality, it's one of the most hilarious (and most quotable) comedies of the decade.Don't bother looking for a good plot line (if that's what you want, go rent ""There's Something About Mary"" instead); this movie is all about absurd dialogue and situations. For example, when Brick asks Ron Burgundy what diversity is (a concept alien to them in their male-dominated 1970s newsroom), he replies ""I could be wrong, but I believe diversity is an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era"". If you don't think that is funny, then this movie is not for you.Will Ferrell is great as Burgundy, who is a laughably overconfident self-centered dullard (similar in many ways to the character of Ricky Bobby in ""Talladega Nights""). Steve Carell also stands out as the even dimmer Brick Tamland, who provides what are possibly the most ridiculous lines in the movie. Jack Black and Ben Stiller make cameos, as well. Essentially, if you are a fan of smartly-written dumb comedies, you really can't go wrong with Anchorman.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Summer Comedy,"Will Ferrell just has a knack for making people laugh. Throughout his career he has been everything from the cowbell player of the Blue Oyster Cult to an elf to even Robert Goulet. In ""Anchorman,"" Ferrell plays pompous Ron Burgundy, a four-time Emmy winning news host in San Diego. Set in the wonderful 70's (and with a fantastic soundtrack to boot), Ron has to deal with the competition of other networks and if that wasn't enough a new female journalist (Christina Applegate as the sultry Veronica Corningstone).Since there is a large sex barrier in the newsroom it is tough for Veronica to get a decent subject to report on, let alone do anything without being hit on by almost all of the her male counterparts.As funny as Ferrell is as Burgundy, Steve Carell steals the spotlight with his performance of weatherman Brick Tamland, who has an IQ of 48 and refers to South Dakota as the ""Middle East."" The other members of the news team include Champ Kind (David Koechner) as a cowboy sports reporter and Paul Rudd as man on the street Brian Fantana.While the movie's plot is outrageous at times, it has to be expected when you walk in the theater. The comedy more than makes up for the plot lapses and the tension between the rival news teams and the star cameos in the flick just add to the fun.All in all ""Anchorman"" is a great light summer comedy that one just can't help but be entertained by.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The news anchorman version of ""Zoolander""","That is what makes this movie so lovable. It did remind me a lot of ""Zoolander"". I really loved this movie, it had a lot of laughs.

But she was very funny in her role as well. There are some really gross humor jokes in here, that's the only complaint. Otherwise, you kind of get past it. There are some great cameos you will see in this film. I won't say though, you have to see it for yourself. I would always recommend this film for a good laugh.

Best movie to quote EVER!!,"If you are a fan of Will Ferrell than you are in for a treat. Anchorman is Ferrell at his absolute best and absolute funniest.Ferrell is Ron Burgundy; an Anchorman in the 70's who is enjoying his life on top of the pile. In an era plagued with feminism, Ron's manly news team are the celebrities of the news room, leaving other channels traipsing behind. These members of the cast are played by other popular current comedy actors in Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan and Luke Wilson. We are also treated to a Tim Robbins cameo although this feels a tad out of place.Ron's news team are put under threat with the appointment of Veronica Corningstone. A woman, yes a woman, hell bent on becoming the first female anchor. A feat she achieves when Ron is involved in an unfortunate burrito incident with Jack Black.This sets up the tale of love and betrayal although done in a way that only makes fun of itself and the opposing characters. Not one area of this film takes itself seriously and it also pokes fun at the serious issues of chauvinistic work places and feminism of the late 70's.It works because the cast perform brilliantly. Ferrell was made to be Ron Burgundy and he delivers all his lines, and I am sure most were improvised, with perfection. Carell is also ace as a dim witted weather reporter who has one of the lowest IQ's known to man and Paul Rudd plays a sports reporting ladies man who enjoys wearing the smell of panther, much to the dismay of others.This film will have you in stitches. It had me laughing out loud on several occasions although there is a slight lull in the middle where the jokes start to run thin. I cannot blame the writers for struggling they did fit so many brilliant lines into one film. Lines that will have you and your mates imitating and giggling at over a beer down the pub. That though is the problem with this film.This was not the first time I have seen this film. As a matter of fact I have seen it a few times and during the first time I shut it off. I found it stupid and moronic humour. That's where I thank my friends for reciting so many brilliant lines down the boozer. I was intrigued and that's what made it so funny when I finally heard them spoken from the horse's mouth.I am telling you now, give this movie a chance. Watch it then watch it again and repeat the hilarious lines for your own amusement, they never tire. However, do not watch this expecting a good story. If you are a fan of Ferrell it is worth it, if you cannot stand him it is not. You will want to tear your eyes out. I didn't and, if you are like me you will never tire of hearing someone question their own name. I'm Ron Burgundy?",,Anonymous,Comedy
Not quite legendary but worth watching,"""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" represented the directorial debut of Adam McKay, a long-time writer on Saturday Night Live. The film features several SNL cast members, most notably Will Ferrell in the title role.The story focuses on the 'legendary' Ron Burgundy, a San Diego news anchor living it up in the 1970's. When his superiors hire a female reporter he and his male colleagues greet their decision with resistance. However, Burgundy soon falls for this new addition to the news team, although their professional aspirations quickly turn them into rivals.The story is pretty loose and isn't especially strong on plot. However, the writing of McKay & Ferrell consistently creates humorous situations that mostly steer clear of cliché. Some might not appreciate the sometimes absurd humour but I found it frequently amusing and, above all, unpredictable. I expect that the movie benefited from improvisation for a considerable number of its jokes.As for the acting, it's hard to fault a cast that includes Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell, Fred Willard, Christina Applegate and others too numerous to mention. Besides the stars & supporting cast there are also a number of notable cameos, including Tim Robbins, to name just one.Visually, the movie's well done and doesn't show any of the inexperience that you might expect from a first time film director. However, musically is where the film really excels. It's full of nicely chosen period-specific tunes, including a memorable acapella rendition of ""Afternoon Delight"".All in all, ""Anchorman"" delivers the goods comedically but the lack of a strong story means that it isn't quite as good as it could have been. Nevertheless, even as a collection of loosely linked bits of foolishness it manages to keep you entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

What I like about Anchorman,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. Every scene has unexpected lines and unlimited laughs. I have watched this movie well over 25 times and still have not gotten tired of it. One of the best parts about this film is the ""quotability"" of it. Almost every line in the movie can be quoted and be funny. The three reasons I like this film are because of the entertainment aspect, the acting/actors, and the story. Entertainment- this movie is funny the entire way through the movie. Every scene keeps me laughing through the next. There are many unexpected jokes as well that happen throughout. Acting- the acting in the movie is AWESOME! How the directors managed to get any shots without the actors laughing is unbelievable. The actors say things that are completely random and funny. They keep the audience engaged throughout the movie. I remember the first time I watched this movie I was always thinking, ""what are they going to do next?"" Each time I was surprised by what they did and laughed because of it. Storyline- the storyline in this movie was not important the first time I watched it. Every time I watch this movie I understand more of the movie and more of why they do what they do. The story gets a little sidetracked at times, but is for comedic effects and works well.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Some fun to be had,"This picture got a tremendous sort of cult following because of its peculiar dry humor. It's a kind of humor that means to be very virile and ""classy"". The Anchorman is basically the official license for boys to be boys: look sharp, show off, be competitive in the silliest of ways, be all-out macho and consider what they're doing to be the only and best way.So they got the whole gang here: Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Koechner, Vince Vaughn... and quite a few cameos throughout the picture (nothing particularly funny, just wacky cameos)... and pushed big name star power with a clear-but-simple game plan, and along the way a few memorable quotable passages and jokes.None of the characters are particularly remarkable or funny and they easily could've made Carell's character for example funnier, but the point is to play ball and be silly with it, so at that it's some fun to be had. It's not particularly stale after a while but it isn't quite a fascinating watch: they did well enough to hold it all up together while slipping in scenes they apparently had intended to use anyways ('Afternoon Delight', the major brawl with all the cameos, or some of the anchorman in-studio prank stuff).Side-note: the fact this got such a strong cult following if anything is sad, because it really only is just another Hollywood comedy with the usual big name gang with a theme, a plot, and a few jokes to be remembered. But people quote this like it's a major classic, use characters' portraits as avatars or signatures on websites and forums... like the film was some kind of a classic when it's so much more benign really !6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Incredibly silly and brilliant comedy.,"In Anchorman, Will Ferrel stars as Ron Burgundy, San Diego's top TV news reporter. His show is top of the ratings, when a beautiful female broadcaster, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), joins the team and catches Ron's eye. Ron is smitten, but falling in love is only the beginning of his troubles.The ridiculously puerile and downright immature humour on display will either repel you, or hook you completely, as it did me. But then I loved Zoolander and Dodgeball, equally daft movies which also had a healthy dose of the absurd running through their veins.You can tell that the entire cast are having a blast getting paid for being stupid, and the fun is infectious (just try keeping a straight face when Ferrell plays Jazz flute). If you dig this kind of thing (and I pity you if you don't), you'll have a great time watching the film, and an even greater time afterwards quoting your favourite lines.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Juvenile, but has its moments","Some of this works (e.g. Anytime Steve Carrell is on the screen), and some of it doesn't (the loads of juvenile humor). The satire of what women have to go through in the workplace has its moments - does anything say it better than the co-workers making lewd gestures while Christina Applegate is on the air, with Paul Rudd stripping down to his undies? But it's undercut by Applegate's character somehow having feelings for Will Ferrell's, an obnoxious guy with no charm. It's like the film is both laughing at the sexism and somehow admiring it at the same time, which made the story line conflicting. When the plot isn't getting in the way, there are enough funny little bits and cameos to keep it amusing, though most of the humor is in just how damn stupid these guys are.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

You don't have to think..just watch, shake your head and laugh.There are some parts that you should be laughing at and don't -and some parts that aren't that funny but make you laugh.

one of the funniest (albeit stupidest) films of the year,"Anchorman is a film that would hardly merit itself to be taken too seriously, so as a full-on, joke-a-minute spoof, it works a lot better. Ferrell plays the title character of Ron Burgendy, as a man who will read anything on the teleprompter, and is a (in his mind) ladies man to boot. Enter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate, in her best role since her Married with Children days), who is assigned to the local news station - soon as a co-anchor - which throws off what these 70's news people (including a great, dimwit role for Steve Correll) are used to. This leads forth into a pretty general story-line for a comedy of this sort, yet a story is the last thing to think about here.Like the recent Dodgeball, Anchorman is superb at doing one thing above all, which is supplying a joke practically every thirty seconds, if not more. There are many scenes that also go down as near comic gems, some of which I would dare not spoil here. However, the film gets a boost from not only Ferrell- who gets laughs by almost anything (including gibberish and mad screaming in some scenes)- but from totally un-expected and worthy cameos. I wouldn't say Anchorman is for everyone (in general, art-film buffs, Shakespeare geeks, and character study phobes might want to steer clear), but perhaps its finest feat is that it's like one long SNL skit - and a skit that surprisingly works a helluva lot better than could be imagined from the trailer. Oh- if you do see it, stay through the credits (as Ferrell's character on SNL, James Lipton, said ""It's a delight"")!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Steve Carell makes the movie worth it.,"What makes this movie so funny is not, surprisingly, Will Ferrell. Instead, it is Steve Carell playing Brick Tamland. Every single line he gives is great, in context or out.For example: ""I don't know what we're yelling about!!"" Which is followed by some more yelling by the rest of the cast, and then he chimes in again with, ""Loud noises!!!""Mostly, it's the matter-of-fact way he delivers the lines. The character has an IQ of 43 (his own words), so he shouldn't know that what he is saying is all that funny anyway.Nothing is really Oscar material, but it's not really as bad as the previous comment would have you believe.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Pretty damn funny,"Will Farrell is quickly becoming one of my favorite comedians. As much as I liked his work on Saturday Night Live, it is on the big screen where he truly belongs. His work in Old School and Elf prove that he is very much capable of making the leap from television to motion picture projects. I can now add Anchorman to that list. Anchorman is completely stupid and rather predictable, but I couldn't help but laugh out loud several times throughout. Farrell is the man of the hour here, but he is supported by some truly inspired performances, notably Steve Carell. Add in some great celebrity cameos, and you have perhaps the year's funniest movie thus far.

I would agree it is not on par with ""Old School"". And it's certainly not a stand-out role for Christina Applegate, who frankly was better alongside Ben Affleck in ""Surviving Christmas"". And can she star in a movie without being the woman pursued and all-too-easily obtained by the main male character?

"Few good jokes, a lot of not that good, a very average comedy.","The first 30 minutes of the movie were so bad I almost stopped watching, but when Christina Applegate came on the screen I decided to continue (she's still a beauty). The movie got a little better eventually, Steve Carell as the weather reporter is great and the best character of the movie. Will Ferrel on the other hand sometimes acts so over it's just stupid, but most of the times he is OK. Many have complained about Christina's acting and her being boring, but that's just the way she was supposed to do the role, be serious, but Christina Applegate is without a doubt the most talented actor on the movie, everyone is just thinking about her on Married... With Children, but like the character on MWC, her character on Anchorman doesn't really let her show her talent. I really hope she will get some big leading roles after she's done with Sweet Charity on Broadway.

I think a lot of 12 year olds would find their intelligence insulted.Having worked in the broadcasting industry, I thought the premise of a stiff, pompous Southern California anchorman in the pre-cable news 1970s to be an interesting one and expected to watch an interesting story. And it starts off interesting, then unravels into such moronic dribble, that I spent the rest of the film debating whether or not to keep watching or turn it off.The plot is extremely weak - a bunch of 3rd graders could come up a stronger plot - and the plot resolution at the end took little to no brainpower. Most of the characters in the film are unlikable.

The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"I'm sorry to say that I enjoyed the mind-numbingly pointless comedy of Anchorman. The movie was purely based on the comedic presence of Will Ferrell and the actors he worked with. The movie was void of all drama and acting value that a timeless movie is comprised of. Yet the simplistic, idiotic humor appeals to a primal level of the psyche. This arena of the mind, where amusement comes at a cheap price, is present in some level in all viewers and this movie taps into that aspect of one's intellect. Although it doesn't particularly stand out from any other comedy of its kind, the shear volume of idiotic, pointless humor makes this movie shamefully enjoyable. This is in part due to the complete commitment of Will Ferrell to his character's persona. Additionally, this film is by no means a ""great"" film by any valid stretch of the imagination. Yet it accomplishes its goal of making one laugh hysterically for a moment until the realization that the content one is being amused by is completely devoid of all intellectual merit.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Writers Are Too In Love With Their Work,"Will Ferrell is part of a group of comedians that include Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, and Ben Stiller, and each have their own comedy films where they shine. I have yet to see all of Will Ferrell's films, but from the ones I have seen, it is either Anchorman or Blades of Glory where he shines. Though it's his best, it isn't a perfect film.The film is written by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. Anchorman's issues derives from the lack of a great story. The complications of the film doesn't really arise until halfway through the film. So the first half of the film introduces it's characters and the atmosphere of the working environment, which would be fine if the script has funnier lines and much more interesting moments. The film also relies on improvisations from actors, in particular Will Ferrell, and sometimes they just don't land. The film does improve during the second half with segments that are exciting and crazy. I did also enjoy the film's shine on the social balance of the era, with the battle against women and men in the workplace, and the film also gives off a message on the importance of acceptance and respect of diversity in the workplace and community.The film is directed by Adam McKay. This is McKay's first film, and I think he did a decent job for a comedic director. Using the era of the 70s allowed him to create a beautiful design of the era with costumes and production design that has the audience believe that these people are within the decade. Though McKay captures the 70s workplace well, he doesn't seem to have a complete vision of how the screenplay would unfold, with the first half being draggy and tiresome and the second half fueled by immaturity and physical comedy. The second half is miles funnier than the first half, as I have a tendency to appreciate childish humor. There are segments of the film where McKay keeps the camera too long on Ferrell and he just rambles on, giving me the impression that both McKay and Ferrell are too in love with their own work that everything that comes out of them are pure gold. If only the film is consistent and gives a bit more of characters like Brian Fantana and Brick Tamland screen time, then the film would be almost perfect.Thomas E. Ackerman is the film's cinematographer and he does a decent job in capturing the characters doing their funny moments. There isn't really a lot about the Anchorman's photography that makes it stand out but it does capture the image of the 1970's very well with saturated colors that pop off with each shot.Alex Wurman did the musical score for the film and it is quite effective. Wurman's score does make you feel like that Ferrell and Co. are a legit news team, and the score hits the spots it wants to get a reaction from us. The use of Afternoon Delight is amazing, and it became something that is stapled on the film when people reminisce about the film. Though I do wish that there was something more from the score, but that's just me nitpicking.The film is led by Will Ferrell and I think he did a so-so job in the role, though I do enjoy his commitment to the role as you can really tell that he is in character. Ferrell tends to ramble on improvised lines and at most times it gets a bit tiresome and needed more from it to be funny. Ferrell does improve in the second half as he gets placed in situations where he ends up acting petty and childish, which had me cracking up a few times. David Koechner is a bit of a let down, who is given lines that are not hilarious and felt over done. The gems of the film are Paul Rudd as Brian Fantana and Steve Carell as Brick Tamland, as they play characters that are random, inappropriate and at times flamboyant. Christina Applegate was good as Veronica Corningstone but it sometimes feels that Ferrell and McKay didn't write enough great lines and funny scenarios for her. Though she is attractive, it doesn't distract the audience and it has concentrating on her intentions in the film. The film does include a number of cameos that had me laughing and without them, a certain fight scene would not be as effective if it weren't for these appearances.Anchorman does have funny moments and it does have a great view of the workplace of the decade, but the film does take a while to kick in and the writers are to precious of their own work that they find it hard to let go of scenes that just seem unnecessary or at least needs another rewrite. I would still watch this film again though, due to it's extremely funny moments that flows well in the second half.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Anchorman is stupid on so many levels but Adam McKay and the cast makes it work, thus making it entertaining and funny","Before directing films like The Other Guys, The Big Short and Vice. Adam McKay made his directorial debut with Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy which is a satirical comedy film, he also co-wrote the screenplay with Will Ferrell and produced by Judd Apatow. This is a film that have been on my radar for many years and I finally watched it and Anchorman met my expectations as a fantastic comedy with many laugh out moments and quotable.The film is a tongue-in-cheek take on the culture of the 1970s, particularly the new Action News format. It portrays a San Diego television station where Will Ferrell's title character clashes with his new female counterpart. Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, Fred Willard, Chris Parnell and Vince Vaughn along with a lot of others join Will Ferrell in this comedy film that is now regarded as one of the best comedy films of the 2000s and on many film critics top 100 lists of comedy films. I was surprised how funny, well directed, well written and well acted. The actors really got the comedic timing and literally lit up the scene with their impressive improvisation capabilities. Every character is different and hilarious, my favorites being the performances of four main guys. Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, David Koechner and Paul Rudd. Amazing. Honestly, I wish Steve Carell would have had more lines as he's hilarious, the character of Brick might be the best character of the movie.Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a comedy worth watching and coming back to, if you're looking for 90 minutes of comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, this one is for you.

"As Many Misses as Hits, but this Satire of the Seventies Still Proves its Point","Set during a period when men were men and women were ... just there, THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY looks at the lives of a crack local television news team headed by the eponymous hero (Will Ferrell). While spending their lives covering stories of astonishing banality, they believe they are the best at their various jobs: even Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who can barely string two words together without the aid of an autocue. Their lives are thrown into chaos with the arrival of Vanessa Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who proves herself much superior in terms of television technique, while remaining strangely impervious to the team's sexist (and cringingly obvious) attempts to get her into bed. The scenario here is a familiar one, reminiscent of SWITCHING CHANNELS (1988), or more famously HIS GIRL Friday (1941) in which the newsroom becomes the arena for an analysis of sexual politics. Both director Adam McKay and Ferrell (who co-wrote the script) are concerned to show limited the opportunities for women are in professions historically deemed ""male"" (such as the media). But the film never takes itself too seriously, with joke after joke piling on top of one another, both visual and verbal. As Burgundy, Ferrell is both repellent yet attractive; we understand how his personality is determined by his television image - nothing exists underneath. By the end, however, even he has dimly become aware of the importance of changing his world-view so that he and Vanessa can work together harmoniously in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Lots of one liners in the movie, many are pretty good. Then there are other characters and cameos here and there that are pretty cool. Jack Black, Ben stiller, that dude from Shawshank etc. The lovey dovey stuff was lame BUT the fight between them was surprisingly good and funny.Best part of the movie was no doubt the infamous hilariously brutal fight between different news channel teams. MAN that scene alone is worth it to watch the movie, it was just so ridiculous and awesome. (y)Overall, it is a good comedy movie with some quirks here and there.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A little bit clever.,"I don't know why I keep watching comedy movies like this one. I never like them and still I keep going back to them.I have never liked Will Ferrell in anything and anchorman is no exception. Simply I just think he's annoying, I also think David Koechner is mildly infuriating. Steve Carell and Paul Rudd were pretty decent, but still not all that funny.The biggest issue with anchorman is that, in my opinion it, isn't funny. I laughed a few times, mainly at Brick at brick and the absurd commentary on sexism in the workplace. Although I didn't enjoy a lot of this movie I thought the commentary on sexism was both funny and clever.This was a much shorter review than I usually post but I don't have much to say about anchorman, like it's decent I guess. I know a lot of people like this style of comedy movies, but I don't.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A consistently funny oddity,"Will Ferrell is a very funny man. He has the ability to squeeze comedy gold out of the raising of an eyebrow or a silly accent, and usually steals whatever film he appears in, regardless of how long he's in it for. Somehow, his movies tend to be bad, relying on juvenile behaviour and frat-house antics for laughs, which would be fine if any real thought was put into it. Anchorman is a sort of different, mixing childish humour with first-class improvisation from some of the most talented comedy performers working at the moment, and featuring one of Ferrell's most inspired creations. Based on real-life anchorman Harold Greene, who had a talent for sharp suits and a formidable 70's 'tache, Ron Burgundy is an egotistical, chauvinistic and narcissistic ass, but boy can he read the news.In the male-dominated workspace of 70's 'action news', Burgundy and his troupe are the cream of the crop in San Diego. Burgundy delivers the news, Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) is the lecherous field reporter, 'Champ' Kind (David Koechner) is the loud-mouthed sexist sports reporter, and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) is an innocent with an IQ of 48, delivering the weather and being led astray by the groups antics. Everything seems harmonious until the arrival of the beautiful and ambitious Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). Ron falls for her and she for him, until the word 'diversity' is introduced into the newsroom, and Ron finds himself with a new co-anchor.Ron thinks that 'diversity' is an old wooden ship used in the Civil War era, a joke no doubt the product of multiple takes and the actors playing around with their lines. Due to this heavy reliance of improvisation, the film is scattershot and random, and by playing with the rules of random, as many jokes fall flat as they cause you to burst out in fits of laughter. So for every spontaneous accapella version of 'Afternoon Delight' or Burgundy wailing over the loss of his beloved dog Baxter, we have Koecher trying to squeeze laughs out of an unfunny character or an extended joke about Fanatana wearing Sex Panther, a rare and banned after shave which just happens to smell awful.Anchorman's main success comes from, surprisingly, Christina Applegate. It was one of the first modern comedies to really put some thought into its female character, and rather than her playing the role of whiny other half trying to get her man to behave and grow up, she is vital in bringing to life this dark era of male-dominated office spaces, and she accepts Ron for the buffoon that he is. In the ten years since its release, it has garnered a huge cult following, and led to the release of it's sequel, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues earlier this year. Though I don't share the hype surrounding this film, it's still a consistently funny oddity, and most probably Ferrell's best comedy work.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of my favorite Will Ferrell films....,I find this film to be fun. I find the characters quite funny and pretty much everything about this film funny. The big battle was funny as well.

"if you can accept that it's bad, it's good","If you can accept this movie's imperfection, to put it mildly, and let then sunshine of original comedy and Will Ferrell's antics in, you'll find this movie is more clever than most other comedies of late. Without Will Ferrell, this movie is nothing, but with him it's got plenty of hilariousness. The played-out style in comparison with other movies with the same frame like The 40 Year Old Virgin and Wedding Crashers is tiring before it even begins, and the cameo by Vince Vaughn and mediocre part played by Applegate are slightly more offensive than the pointless presence of the retarded weatherman, but there are enough original jokes and siliness to make annoyances like these stay in the background. Will ferrell is the funniest man alive, I wish he could be cast in more substantial roles in better written movies, even it they were comedies. His lines and personal comedy are consistently entertaining in this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Redefines the word ""bad"".","What in the heck did I just watch?I love Will Ferrell, so I have no axe to grind in that regard. But I just got back from watching this debacle in a packed theatre and...I'm dumbfounded. This movie transcended bad. Shrouded in a very thin plot, it was nothing more that a staccato string of inane jokes and the sure sign of a crappy movie, a number of surprise cameos.This stunk of one of those ""alum"" films where a bunch of actors (and I do use that term loosely here) get together, fill out roster spots and ham it up for the camera. Anyone of these roles could have been played by one of the other actors. And the reason that you saw a ""star"" of Christina Applegate's stature in this movie is obviously because no other actress with a shred of dignity would have accepted this script.I laughed out loud one time during this film, and oddly enough, I was the only one. When the announcer is paid off by Ron and he says, ""That was Ron Burgundy and Tits McGee!"" I guffawed out loud only to be stared at by those who sat in stone silence around me. The highlight of this movie was the Milk-Dud fight that broke out between two bored teenagers at the front of the cinema.Save your money folks. It'll be at Blockbuster by noon tomorrow.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Another comedy full of toilet humour and little else.,"Anchorman is yet another comedy, that relies on stupid toilet humour and sexist remarks to try to be funny. Unfortunately, it doesn't work.Anchorman tells the story of Ron Burgandy, an award winning anchorman for a news station in San Diego. When a sexy female gets cast as his co-anchor, Ron tries everything in his power not to lose his job to a female.Sexist remarks, and fart gags won't get a laugh from many people. I don't know how someone can say this is the funniest movie ever. It had absolutely no charm and no wit. I'll stick to the classic comedies, and stay away from the new releases.",,Anonymous,Comedy
the world according to '70s media,"Watching ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"", you get the feeling that much of the dialogue was written just for fun, namely Ron's ""translation"" of San Diego. But the result is actually quite funny. Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is San Diego's top-rated news anchor in the mid-'70s. He and his cadre of misfit reporters are comfortable with their jobs, until the ambitious Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives at the network. She's looking to get to the top, and neither she nor Ron is willing to give up easily. But what can you expect from TV? This is a pretty silly movie, but Will Ferrell has been doing really well ever since he left ""SNL"". A particularly funny scene is when the anchors from all the stations have a free-for-all.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I laughed myself silly,"This was a very funny movie. The majority of the previews seen on TV were in the movie, but there were a few that were not. The whole theater was laughing. You hardly notice it is in the 70's. The cast is top notch...the cameos were hilarious! I was very surprised by them. I would heartily recommend this film, what a great way to spend 2 hours....laughing yourself into an asthma attack! Bring the inhaler..you will need it. Will Ferrell is excellent as always. Christina Applegate is an excellent comedic actress. I would say this movie was an original, not borrowing a premise from another film. the scenes with Ron and his dog are priceless!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Left wanting more,"First off, don't get me wrong, I really like Will Ferrel, but this movie is lacking somewhere. When I heard about this movie I was really excited because the character seems to be one of those that Ferrel shines in. But after the credits rolled, the easter egg at the end had played, I got up from where I was sitting and thought that I'm glad i didn't pay full 7pm ticket prices. During the movie I found myself chuckling more than busting my gut, and when I saw the previews, I had it in my mind that I would be rolling on the floor with hilarity, it was a let down for me. I can link this movie with the that of Jack Black's School Of Rock, where I thought Jack Black was going to ROCK, but then I was taken into a world of intense energy, but not the comedy I had hoped from Black. Anchorman does have some good points, many of the ad-libs that Ferrel do are very very funny, I just wish the whole movie was that funny.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Some of the best one-liners ever,"The funny thing about Israeli theaters is that they're quite problematic when it comes to Will Ferrell. Since most of the population here is Jewish, a Christmas fare like Elf skipped our theaters; our men prefer Soccer over Football so Kicking & Screaming went straight to DVD as well, and we don't have colleges (we have universities instead; which we usually attend after serving 3 years in the army) so you imagine where I saw Old School. Thank god we at least have Blockbuster to help us catch up on that ever so delighting Ferrell flare.Back to topic, this 1970's set film about the intrigue and innuendo set in the chauvinist world of Anchormen is a completer riot every true comedy lover owes himself. I guess I loved it most because it brings up important themes in a humoristic manner, and because it deals with my profession (journalism). But then again, you can't ignore those hilarious one-liners (""I'm Ron Burgundy?""; ""I love carpet""), and the mega-celeb fight scene with Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Luke Wilson and Judd Apattow.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Thank God! A movie that is actually funny!,"I was afraid I'd be getting another Dodgeball here, especially when I saw that the completely talentless Vince Vaughn was on the payroll, but nope. This doesn't pull any punches. It's also the movie that Will Ferrell deserves to star in. He's far too funny to make crap like Old School and Elf. This is his movie and he dominates. His talent with words is unmistakable. He plays arrogant anchorman Ron Burgundy, of course. Christina Applegate wants to take his job away from him and become the first anchorwoman in the United States (the story takes place in the 1970s). Applegate doesn't have too much to do here, although some of her insults are classic. She's mostly the straightman here. Most of the laughs after Ferrell come from his news team, made up of Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Steven Carell. They're all funny, but Carell, as a weatherman with a tiny IQ, gets the most laughs. The movie is successful both when it is playing jokes on Burgundy's arrogance and when it gets entirely surreal. The funniest scene in the film involves a huge rumble between five different news teams. I could hardly breathe during this sequence. And the climactic scene is outrageous! Anchorman also employs two devices that usually betray a sense of desperation, the celebrity cameo and outtakes during the credits. It might be the only time these cameos ever made me laugh, and the outtakes are really funny mostly because they are made up of alternative improvisations. Except for an outtake from Smoky and the Bandit that hilariously sneaks up. I can't imagine that there'll be a funnier movie this year. In fact, as it is easily the most consistently good movie I've seen in 2004, it probably qualifies as my favorite film of the year, at least so far. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not even close to being as bad as some people seem to think it is......,"I just saw Anchorman recently, and was surprised to see how many people seemed to hate it. I kind of had to weigh in here to help make the score for this film reflect in a more realistic way its' actual worth. Comedies are kind of like horror movies in that you have to suspend belief to a certain extent and just go along for the ride. If you want a sound, reality based movie, go watch a serious drama. This movie was simply, pure escapement. Sure, it was dumb fun. But that is not necessarily a bad thing. This time around, I wanted a movie with lots of laughs, and Anchorman, by and large, delivered. I came into the movie not having any experience with any of Will Farrell movies, TV appearances on SNL, or anything. I had no idea what I was going to get. What I got was a pleasant enough farce, though by no means a classic. Will Farrell plays the fool quite well, and parts of the movie was pure genius, though most of the laughs for me were generated by the rest of the cast. I mean, how could you not laugh at the biker drop kicking Ron Burgundy's dog off the bridge, or the (very) mean spirited banter between Ron and Veronica over the end credits of the nightly broadcast following their recent breakup? My only complaint was that on the DVD version, I had never yet to date seen so many good scenes wind up on the cutting room floor. My opinion? 7 out of 10 stars. Very close to being the best comedy of the summer, though ""Harold and Kumar goes to White Castle"" probably edges it out by a hair.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"It's a fun time with a lot of laughs, but it's a little heavy-handed","I don't think I realized how many common quotes in my generation's phrase book came from this movie! Anchorman almost rivals its 2004 contemporary Mean Girls in terms of quotability, and is a very silly little romp from start to finish. I did enjoy it, and I'd watch it again without too much persuasion. The script is great and serves as a parody of rampant workplace sexism in the '70s (and I will say it was with a similar heavy-handedness to McKay's later work, Don't Look Up), and while I wasn't alive in the '70s, the production design seems pretty spot-on. Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy was a very fun love-to-hate type of protagonist, but I did find myself sympathizing way more with Christina Applegate's Vernoica Corningstone-which I believe was the intent, but I can't really be sure.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A silly but funny collection of sketches featuring the character of Burgundy (with a vague narrative in there somewhere)  some miss but most hit,"Before the years of cable, the local news station was the main place people got their news and, because of that, the news anchorman was king. In San Diego, the number one anchorman was Ron Burgundy. Every inch the 70's man, Ron is on the top of his game, partying and getting the ladies with his all-male news team. However things are changing and a woman is brought in to bring diversity to the channel 4 team. Unable to bed her and move on, Ron becomes fascinated with Veronica to the point where he begins to love her. However when Veronica makes it clear that her ambition is to one day be an anchor. Will their competition get in the way of Ron's first ever feeling of love?After enjoying the silly humour of Dodgeball, I decided (along with an audience of 8 others) to give Anchorman a go. Immediately the film sets out its stall with a serious, very seventies narration that puts us right in the world of the Anchorman. After a few scenes out 'plot' is presented to us in the form of Ron initial rebuttal by Veronica; from this point on the film follows the vague flow of their competition and their romance  however to call it a plot is to be rather too kind to it. Instead the film is best viewed as a collection of sketches featuring one character, all strung together with one vague theme. This is because the funniest bits of the film are often the bits that are very imaginative and off the wall where often it is the actual story that creates the misses and the periods where I wasn't laughing a great deal.Of course, many people will know before they see it if they will like it or not, because the cast have done so many films recently it is easy to get a handle on their sense of humour. For my money I like it and I enjoyed the film even if I did feel that it didn't have much of a story and had quite a few segments that just didn't work as well as the majority. The imaginatively silly script is great fun and gave me plenty of good laughs whether in the form of silly entire sequences (the anchor rumble) or just the silly characters all around the place. Of these, some are poorly judged and are silly without being funny (Champ) but mostly they get the mix just right (Brick is spot on). The manic humour mostly hits though  and even spills over into the end credits where a 'Smokey & The Bandit 2' moment had me laughing due to its sheer unexpected nature.The cast is deep and are a major part of the film winning  everyone is pretty much 'on' and covers the fact that the central narrative is nowhere near good enough on its own. Ferrell is as funny as ever, but his character is an one-note deal and, even if he plays it well (which he does) it isn't enough to fill a film. So thank goodness then for a support cast that features inspired lunacy in both the cameos and the main cast. Koechner is a bit boring, while Rudd is simple but still fun in some ways but it is Carell who pretty much gets the biggest laugh every time he does anything. Applegate plays it pretty straight but also gets some laughs  she is always eclipsed by those around her but she did good work anyway. The cameos come thick and fast and, although they could have been distracting but actually they all work pretty well. As ever Vaughn, Stiller and Wilson all show up and are good but the cameos also include good turns from Black, Robbins, Pyle, Trejo and a funny dog.The film contains scenes of rather surprising animal cruelty and also violence to women but, while this may rightly be a major issue for some viewers I was laughing at the time and chose to take it all in the spirit it was intended. Overall the film is very funny in a very manic way but some will not like the misses that mostly come from a poorly developed story. When it is funny it will take you by surprise and make you laugh hard but when it misses it does so in a very obvious manner. Mostly though this is a very funny film  but come prepared for a story so bitty that this could have been called 'Anchorman: The Best of Ron Burgundy'.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Mindless but funny; hilarious ending scene is a classic,"I would never have seen this movie if it had not come on during a cross-country plane flight. The promos seemed absurdly bad and I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan. But I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, there were a few times (particularly the end) in which I laughed so hard my eyes watered.Let me not oversell, though. The plot, like the humor, is sophomoric. And the characters are all caricatures, just there as vehicles for jokes (unlike great comedy movies like Some Like it Hot or Tootsie, in which there is humor AND characters we care about).But for pure laughs, this movie delivers the goods. Ferrell plays his macho seventies guy to the hilt and his leisure suit clad, sexist cohorts are as funny as they are ridiculous (except for the dumb guy, who was just there for gratuitous, not funny gags). And the final scene, which involves the main character's heroic dog and subtitles, is one of the most silly, creative, and utterly hilarious scenes I've ever seen.

The Most Quotable Comedy Ever,"If the mark of a tremendous comedy is the ability to leave the audience quoting its funniest lines long after the end credits roll, than ""Anchorman"" is one of the greatest comedic masterpieces ever produced.For a basic plot summary, ""Anchorman"" is set in the 1970s TV news business, where anchormen rule the roost and women are not given the time of day. As such, legendary anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) feels threatened when female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't back down under his comic machismo.""Anchorman"" is a typical Will Ferrell move through and through. That is, the humor comes from watching Ferrell recite the most hilarious of lines with the straightest of faces. Almost every joke is completely ridiculous, but the fact that everyone plays it so straight is where the real humor arises.Also, Steve Carrell (and to a lesser extent other auxiliary cast members David Koechner & Paul Rudd, among others) nearly steals the show playing the ""sidekick"" role. In one of Carrell's first film roles, he shows that his type of humor (in the same vein of Ferrell) would be around to stay. ""Brick Tamland"" provides easily some of the most side-splitting material ever put to film.Overall, I consider ""Anchorman"" to be one of the funniest comedy films of all-time for one basic reason: it isn't a complete farce. There are no intensely sexual, bodily secretion, or otherwise gross-out jokes in this film. Just well thought-out and well-acted humor for the duration.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

And of course heroine's main weapon is love, skilfully using it she worms her way straight into an anchorman's heart and then his downfall and accordingly her uprising begins.

I want Will Ferrel (Ron Burgundy) to deliver my news anytime!,"Normally I don't watch the news except when it's something huge. However I would watch it everyday if Ron Burgundy delivered it. I personally loved Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Anybody that has watched previous Will Ferrel movies knows Will is hilarious. In this movie, he's kind of the glue that keeps the whole thing together, he plays Ron Burgundy a news anchor. He thinks he's every woman's dream, he's got class, style, great pick-up lines, and very smooth. This movie takes place in the 70s and you can tell that just by looking at the clothes that they wear and everything is groovy. Than Veronica Corningstone enters the picture (Christina Applegate), she's proved that she has what it takes and she comes in to be Ron's co-anchor, although she wants head-anchor badly, and she'll do anything to get it. Will she, or won't she? It's a hilarious movie, lot's of funny lines, Vince Vaughn makes a cameo as a fellow news anchor, so do Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins. Probably the funniest guy in the movie besides Will is Steve Carrel who plays Champ Kind the weather guy. So watch the movie and see for yourself, I gave it 6 out of 10, because, it's not the funniest movie, i've seen, and it could have been better, but it was okay, well...i'd have to say it's good, but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is the best movie Ben Stiller has been in all year.,"I will say this. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is, without even the slightest hint of doubt, and with not a single exception, the greatest movie ever created in the history of all the universe and all parallel universes. It is flawless. It is so great in every single way that not even the mighty Christopher Walken could make it better. If this movie is not held up high as a timeless classic of comedy, if not the absolute epitome of all things right with the world and good in life, for decades upon decades to come, I will personally see to the world's destruction. This I swear to you.This movie is not only hilarious beyond belief (Steve Carell steals every scene he is in), but it actually manages to do something no other comedy has ever done before. Ever. It manages to tell a really good story without the story ever getting in the way of the comedy. There isn't a single scene that isn't funny because it's too busy advancing the plot. Either the jokes enhance the plot, the plot enhances the jokes, or they both enhance each other in some sort of weird plot/joke 69 orgy of greatness.~MechaSlinky... Baxter should win an Oscar.

Will Ferrell was absolutely stunning and hilarious, just what you would expect from him. If you're looking for a good laugh, I recommend Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy all the way. Ferrell plays a San Fransisco news anchor in the 1970's, the time when only men delivered the news. He was named Ron Burgundy, who was loved by all. Thanks to his excellent talent of reading off the telepromtor, he once again made his news channel #1 in the ratings, which leads to conflicts throughout the film. Ron later finds himself having to share the spotlight with his co-anchor Veronica Corningstone, which, as you can also guess, leads to more conflict as the battle of the sexes. Ferrell is teamed up with a colorful cast which brings more to the story. I give this movie a 9/10, but i give Ferrell a perfect 10/10.

"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) - Stay Cool, San Diego!","Known as one of Will Ferrell's funniest movies ever made, there's no wonder that ""Anchorman"" is one of the funniest movies ever made. Taking place in San Diego, 1975, the movie portrays a San Diego TV News station, where Will Ferrell plays the title character of Ron Burgundy, who fights for his title as the ""Anchorman"" against his new female counterpart, portrayed in a hilarious performance by Christina Applegate. Besides Ferrell and Applegate, this hilarious casting ensemble includes Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carell, Fred Willard, and hilarious cameos from Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Seth Rogen, Danny Trejo, Tim Robbins, and Ben Stiller. Joined with co-writer/director Adam McKay, and producer Judd Apatow, ""Anchorman"" is one of the funniest movies ever made. Almost every scene in the entire movie is laugh-out-loud funny. The dialouge is sharp, the characters are likable, the humor is smart, and the jokes are just downright funny. From hilarious cameos to unexpected situations, ""Anchorman"" really knows how to make an audience laugh. The only thing that disappointed me was the ending. Well, I just wished that the ending would have been better. I'm talking about the last few seconds of the movie. It may seem like that I'm overreacting, but I'm not! The rest of this movie was awesome. The movie's well-written, well-casted, hilarious throughout, and you have the funniest Will Ferrell movie ever made. Besides the ""alright"" ending, ""Anchorman"" is still funny, relevant, original, smart, and unique. ""Stay cool, San Diego!"". Wow, we get to end this review with one of the coolest lines in the movie.

Cheap humor that works,"I am a big fan of Will Ferrell who in my opinion was one of the most entertaining members of the Saturday Night Live show. Unfortunately the recent movies starring Ferrell as the leading actor have been quite disappointing (Elf and Old School).This is however a very funny movie, especially considering that most jokes are quite cheap (no sophisticated humor here).The funniest character in the movie is however not Ron Burgundy (played by Ferrell). Instead the role of slightly retarded Brick Tamland is brilliantly performed by the always entertaining Steve Carrell (Late Show with Jon Stewart and Bruce Almighty). He delivers a bunch of one-liners that are tremendous fun.Another thumbs-up goes to the short Ben Stiller appearance as the Spanish anchorman! Highly recommended if you're after some cheap laughs.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"So stupid, it's hilarious","Lord knows there are plenty of movies that are just plain stupid. And then there the movies that elevate stupidity to an artform. In the tradition of ""Dumb and Dumber"" and the ""Bill and Ted"" films, this is a movie that will have you laughing in spite of your I.Q.. Will Farrell is quickly becoming a comedy superstar, but it's Steve Carell's mentally retarded, slightly psychotic weatherman that elicits the most chuckles.

Over-rated lampoon treatment of the 1970s,"While a few aspects of this film were amusing - especially the casting of most of Hollywood's big name comic actors in the role of competing anchormen, the talking dog scenes, etc. This film does not, in my opinion, deliver any worthwhile insights and is not really funny when stripped of it's extremely superficial 1970s paint job.Note that the film's IMDb rating averages around 5 for people who actually lived through the 70s and around 7 for those who did not.The film was probably written for the same crowd that enjoyed ""That 70s Show"", and uses the same absurd and extremely inaccurate symbols, style and politics to create a totally fantasized (and incidentally perverse) ""sense of the times"". Essentially, this is a view of 70s culture through the lens of 70s TV cameras, 00s conservative social and political regressivism, and the knowledgeable sensibilities of comedy writers who were, for the most part, preadolescent during the subject period.The film is about a lot of amazingly stupid people, most of whom are not very likable, who happen to be in the TV news industry. Some of the news broadcast scenes are actually funny. Ron Burgundy - played by Ferrell- is the head idiot. Burgundy is a cross between a 1970s porn star and Ted Baxter of the Mary Tyler Moore Show. His character exhibits just about a much depth as these two stereotypes - though perhaps less than Baxter in Ted Knight's better moments on MTM. His dog, ****__Baxter__****, is the most intelligent character in the film and, IMO, steals the show.Burgundy is struggling to save his career as he is confronted with an only slightly more intelligent stereotype of a 1970s career-woman (complete with the usual inaccurate stereotype female dilemma which people of today's generation seem to believe to be characteristic of the period - she has to decide between an uncontrollable sexual attraction and her certain knowledge that the guy she's attracted to is an imbecile and a cad who wants to ruin her career almost as much as he wants to slither into her undergarments). The plot could have provided a vehicle for comedic analysis of 1970s sexual politics, but - perhaps wisely - the writers avoided any intelligent analysis (only those who lived through the 70s would have gotten it, and most of us would not have gone to see this film anyway).As far as media critique goes - well, there really isn't any. The film simply doesn't carry that much weight and systematically misses every opportunity to accomplish anything besides half-hearted chuckles and giggles.The cinematography is standard for the genre - and very average. the writing is OK, though drastically inhibited by its apparently improvised overall direction and the lack of defined themes and depth. The cast does a good job, considering limitations of the material. Steve Carrell is, as always, very entertaining. And the cameos, though merely exploitive of star-power, are amusing. Baxter, however, steals the show. And I would have been much more entertained by the film had he been a more prominent character. I would enjoy a sequel featuring Baxter as a 1970s canine Zen superhero.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An experiment in comedy,"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a very strange comedy. It feels almost like an experimental comedy: improvisation, talking directly to the camera in places, and some truly strange humor.Nothing much happens in the movie, but this isn't a bad thing. The basic idea is that a chauvinistic news room in the 1970s has to deal with a female with her sights set on becoming an anchor. Ron (played by Will Ferrell) falls in love with the woman (Christina Applegate), the rest (Paul Rudd, Steve Carell & David Koechner) all attempt to bed her but fail, in hilarious ways, naturally. With such a simple plot, it falls on the actors shoulders to make it entertaining.The actors seem to be having a great time. Much of the lines are improvised (stick around after the credits to see different versions of the stuff that made it). They all go over the top, but it doesn't matter. It just adds to the sense of fun that the movie produces. Will Ferrell is perfect for Ron Burgundy. He manages to get away with saying, ""I'm going to punch you in the ovary. Right next to the baby maker"" without seeming offensive. Comedy legend Fred Willard shows up, and there are a lot of cameos (notably Jack Black, Luke Wilson & Ben Stiller) that all add to this feeling a bit like an SNL party. The fact that it is directed by Adam McKay, one of SNL's writers & directors, should illustrate what kind of film it is.Anchorman's main problem is that it takes the audience half an hour to work out what they are doing. Either that, or it doesn't hit its stride until then. There are some extraordinarily funny parts, including the disclaimer at the beginning (""The following is based on actual events. Only the names, locations and events have been changed""), a bizarre animated sequence and a dog that can speak Spanish. However, the jokes are not consistent, and some are far too obvious.Anchorman is a funny movie. If the jokes were only more consistent it would score higher.** 1/2 out of *****",,Anonymous,Comedy
TV winner,"Everywhere I turn just now, I'm confronted by an advertisement for ""Anchorman 2"". Never having seen the original, I took the chance to watch it on TV to try and see what the fuss was about. Well, I'm pleased to say I thoroughly enjoyed it and laughed loud and long throughout its running time.It probably helps that I grew up watching ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", the classic early 70's sit-com set in a TV newsroom, in fact my first thought watching this was that Ted Baxter had made a comeback. Not that there's a lot of the sharp, wry humour tat characterised the ""MTM"" shows, the humour you get here is mostly broad and low, although its undeniably funny.Principally the movie gets its laughs from the antiquated sexism of the 70's with San Diego's number one TV news anchorman, Ron Burgundy and his little gang of co- presenters on the show seeing their male dominance challenged by a new, pretty and ambitious female, played by Christina Applegate. Cue numerous gratuitous sexist remarks, but before long, Applegate and her new band of female co-workers have turned the tables although before the end, there's the obligatory ""Let's make up and be friendly"" resolution occurs in of all things a bear-pit at the zoo.Will Ferrell is good value as the dim but perfectly coiffured Ron and Applegate, who knows a thing or two about crass humour has a ball in her part as his lady-friend / rival, but the whole supporting team have their moments. I liked best the off-the-wall inserts like the accapella version of ""Afternoon Delight"" and the TV news-room teams bloodbath showdown and Ron's boys trying to put Applegate off in her first solo newscast.Throw in those pretty awful 70's fashions and some of the worst songs for the soundtrack and to a child of the times like me, this was a real hoot and maybe just maybe, I'll get along to see that sequel. I'm sure it's on somewhere!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Classic. Will Ferrell's Greatest Character & Film. ******* Hilarious.,"The first hour of this film has some of the best comedy of the 2000's. For the rest of my life I will be quoting this film, as I have been quoting it for almost 20 years now.There is an abrupt point where the comedy lessens and the vibe changes. The writers and film-snobs might claim that the tone shifted to advance and resolve the plot. However, that is a nonsense argument. It's hard to keep the laughs rolling for 90 straight minutes. Many great comedies hit a lull when trying to resolve the love story or tie everything together towards the end. 'Happy Gilmore' (1996) is one of the funniest movies of all time, but the last half of the movie can feel like a hangover. Despite settling down, the ending was strong. This is a timeless comedy, and everyone that watches will find something to laugh about.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:Acting: 1/1;Casting: 1/1;Directing: 1/1;Story: 1/1;Writing/Screenplay: 1/1;Total Base Score = 5Modifiers (+ or -):Standout Performances: +1 (20 years later, Ron Burgundy is considered an iconic character.);Ensemble Cast: +0.5 (Although not all of these actors were considered ""A-List Movie Stars"", 'Anchorman' (2004) contains some of the best comedic actors of the decade, including Steve Carell, Vince Vaughn, and Ben Stiller.);Quotability: +1 (""I don't know if you're aware, but...

His News Is Bigger Than Your News!,"Anchorman: Legend of Ron Burgundy is the perfect retro movie that Starsky and Hutch aimed to be earlier this year. Some of the laughs for me were the sight gags involving the clothes,the hair,and the insane amount of smoking. Will Farrell once again, like him or loathe him and it's easy to fell both in this film,turns in another great comedic performance that solidifies his status as a leading man in Hollywood. Burgundy is the lead anchor at Channel 4 News in San Diego and is terrified when, of all things, a woman(Christina Applegate)named Veronica Corningstone is hired at the station to be a field reporter. Burgundy and his posse, consisting of Brian Fantana(played by Paul Rudd who I found to be absolutely hilarious as it was a nice change of pace from his normal good guy roles), Champ Kind(David Koechner), and Brick Tamland(Steve Carrell who once again steals the scenes as he did in Bruce Almighty) set out to destroy Miss Corningstone. Their plans are thwarted however when Burgundy falls madly in love with her. What ensues next is pure hilarity. Anchorman lets you know from the get-go that it is pure farce and nothing to take seriously. Just 91 minutes of extreme fun and silliness. Nice touch to see fellow ""Frat Pack"" members Vince Vaughn,Ben Stiller,Jack Black,and Luke Wilson as well as Tim Robbins turn up in a Gangs of New York themed street fight between rival stations. But the movie starts and ends with Farrell, who while being the biggest jerk in the movie, actually makes you root for him when he's down on his luck. I give it a 7 out of 10.

Funny! Good Will Ferrell flick,"Anchorman/2004/***Main Stars:Will FerrellChristina ApplegateSteve Carrel Anchorman was a good movie because just seeing Will Ferrell makes me laugh. His other teammates on the Channel 4 News Team were also very funny especially the one that was a little off (played by Steve Carrel). There wasn't really a main point for this movie except for doing the news. But there was one thing the main character, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) wanted to be- a network news anchor. Then the Channel 4 News Team gets a new news anchor- it's a lady named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). She also had a great passion to be a network news anchor. Anyway, all of the Channel 4 News Team were obsessed with ladies accept for of course Veronica but also one other person that was a guy, Brick Tamblin (Steve Carrel). The Channel 4 News Team also had to do a major story- a panda being born at the zoo. They did the story successfully and went on to different jobs after that accept for Veronica and Ron. Veronica and Ron finally became network news anchors at the end. This was another great movie. I count on you to see it. Movie directed by Adam McKay.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This is a stupid, but kind of funny comedy, with a great backup cast including Vince Vaughn as Ron's enemy Wes Mantooth, Jack Black as a mean biker that punts Ron's dog and Ben Stiller as a Spanish news anchor. Veronica puts a dirty thing to say on the teleprompter and Ron says it and gets kicked off the team. Silly dialogue, but very funny too.

I walked out,"Unwatchable and completely unfunny. I just don't understand how any of the professional critics can find anything redeeming about this piece of trash. Will Farrell is normally hilarious just walking onto the screen and he did the best he could with poor writing and tedious sight gags. I would like to see the actual screenplay compared to what made it into the film. Even the brilliance of Will Farrell's improvisation couldn't rescue this colossal waste of time.I had enough after Burgundy's seemingly endless trek to the studio. Every now and then, even a modicum of watching people get knocked senseless can be amusing.

Your life is too short for this bilge,"I don't often walk out of a film, so there's a minor triumph for Anchorman. I've never seen a Will Ferrell movie before, and the great thing is that if he doesn't get a major role in Star Wars Episode 7 I can probably escape a repeat experience for most of the rest of my natural life.This is one of those crappy, pointless comedy movies that seem to be part of a US social welfare program to get ageing Saturday Live comics' straight-to-video careers off the ground. You know the kind, where a studio grinds out a vehicle for Cameron Diaz or some minor blip on the American TV comedy scene that inevitably gets padded with cameos from the much funnier people they knew at acting school or have kids at the same creche.

Its alright but compared to some other great comedy films such as wedding crashers it just doesn't do it for me, in my opinion you should spend the money you would be spending on this film and buy a better film like the wedding crashers or maybe not even on another film, save it that could be an extra £10 spent on holiday getting wrecked. Some of the random jokes that they throw in are brilliant and serve no real purpose at all but they do make you think ""what the hell"" and you do end up laughing quite a lot not in the HAHAHA that was such a good joke there more of a HAHAHA that is so random i just would never have thought that was gonna happen, but now i have seen it my life is that much better lol.

"Anchorman: If Ron Burgundy Says It, Then It's Funny!","Will Ferrell. I have never met a single person, male or female, who has been indifferent to him. Either you love him or you hate him. And, as much as I hate to say it, it is the same situation for this film: either you love it or you hate it. I happen to be the former. This film reeks of funny. From the title, itself a mockery of a film about porn actor Ron Jeremy, to the bloopers that run during the closing credits, this flick doesn't let up.I'm in the entertainment business. And, while not everything I attempt to do is entertaining, I do understand what it takes to entertain, and this film has just that. You see, sometimes the funniest part of life is its absurdity/absurdities. And just about everything in Anchorman is absurd. And hilarious. Will Ferrell is the caricature of at least one person that everyone in the broadcast industry has known at one time or another. Paul Rudd perfectly embodies that sad guy who wants and tries so desperately to be cool that he ultimately just has to latch on to someone who is cool in order to be cool. David Koechner. His character, Champ, has issues. Let's leave it at that. And Brick? Well, it's obvious that Steve Carell is one of the top comedic geniuses of our time. His timing is impeccable, his performance is hysterical. And it's all within the realm and scope of the film's limits. Which are stringent and very loose. Christina Applegate, Fred Willard, and the cast of thousands of un-billed celebrity cameos all added to the fun.And what I've found to be the biggest either selling point or turnoff, depending on whether you loved it or hated it, respectively, is that most of the film is a big inside joke. It's all a dig at broadcasting. The quirks that everyone exhibit (Ron's dependence on the teleprompter and his vocal warm-ups; Brian's over-the-top, I'm-gonna-make-everything-bigger-than-it-really-is attitude; Champ's catch-phrase, ""Whammy!""; Brick's quaint nicknames for areas of the country) are all done in jest toward members of the broadcasting community. If you're a broadcaster, and you saw this film, then you loved it. I'm willing to bet money on it (well, if I had any).Adam McKay, this being his debut, does a good job at being the kind of director that actors love. He's a director that lets you go to the edge of what is possible for a scene, look over that edge, dangle your legs over it, fish off of it, then let you find your way back again. Yet all the while he knows what he wants and is determined to fashion his film out of what he's given by the genius he has working for him. In short: McKay does a good job for his first time out.Outrageous? Yes. Irreverent? You bet. Coy? Most certainly. Funny? You'd better believe it. To borrow a phrase (sort of): If you don't think this is the funniest film ever, then I will fight you.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Anchorman,My reaction to the film was good because it had some funny people in it such as Will Ferrell and David Koechner. One of the major impressions was when he was trying to get the girl everyone was trying to get with. The thing that jumped out was when Veronica Corningstone told Ron Burgundy not to tell anyone about them but he did.The story line was good and had many interesting funny parts in the movie. Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate was the major characters because it was based on him getting the girl and how she made it had for him. The character that made the best performance will be Ron Burgundy. The movie is about a guy who was head of the news show. He finds a girl that he's into but at the end everything went rung.One of the funny parts was when Ron Burgundy put Pj's on his dog when they went to bed. The way the movie come on it got me into it. I think the actors gave a good performances because they mad every part in the movie funny for the people who was watching it. I notice that he was competing against other new T.V stations.The movie had a good beginning as it was coming on and as it was going to the end I got more into it as the funny parts was coming on.

"The trailer may not look funny, but the move was hilarious!!","Probably one of the funniest movies of the summer if not whole year. 10 times better then ""Dodgeball"" and ""Starsky & Hutch"".

(which is hilarious anyway)It has its moments where it goes off on extreme tangents, but they too are equally as funny. The second half of the movie does tend to get a tiny bit too silly. Overall though the movie had literally every person in my theatre laughing from beginning to end. Some parts of it are actually so funny I couldn't breathe for a second or two and that rarely happens anymore with today's Hollywood garbage.I'm surprised it got a PG-13 rating for it's pretty colorful language, but regardless for any open minded adult its hilarious from start to finish.I will recommend this movie to all of my friends and I recommend you go see it as well!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's a predictable fall from grace and rise again story which is made interesting by the delicious left turn it takes.Sample this, there is a sequence where two rival news teams get ready to face-off in a grudge match but the situation is escalated comically by the appearance of more and more teams each wishing to get in on the action.

Anchorman,"Possibly the best comedy of the 21st Century. The film has everything, laughs, great characters, 70s suits and even Paul Rudd fighting a bear (and getting beaten). In the 70s city of San Diego there is one man, and anchorman, who is loved by all and cool beyond believe. Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is Channel 4s main anchorman and the people of San Diego worship him and obey his every word. However, when Miss Veronica Corningstone (played by Christina Applegate, who you may remember plays Rachael's hilarious sister in Friends) joins the team, Ron's world is turned upside down.

Steve Carell's character is so unbelievably funny that he steals every single scene which he appears in. With his stupidity and fantastic one-liners he takes the film by storm.

"Good news, bad news","Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy in ""Anchorman"", the anchor of local news program in San Diego. The movie open with Ron and his colleagues partying in typical 70's manner -- lots of booze, lots of women. Along comes Veronica, played by Christina Applegate, who wants to become a news anchor, but in the male dominated world of news, she has little chance, especially when she goes against the male chauvinist Ron Burgundy.Ferrell was pretty funny, and his cohorts, especially Steve Carrell as Brick the Weatherman, were also pretty funny second bananas. Fred Willard played the befuddled boss/director, and I think he was pretty good trying to balance pleasing his star anchorman and the new woman on the scene.My problem with this film is Christina Applegate. I think Ms. Applegate is a very beautiful and talented comedienne. And she holds her own against Mr. Ferrell's histrionics. However, it appears to me that she had some plastic surgery, and it looked like she was unable to wrinkle her forehead. It was kind of disconcerting. I began paying more attention to her forehead than her performance. When she got angry at Ron, her voice showed it but not her face. Her face looked like a plastic Barbie Doll's face.But there were good laughs in this one, and worth the hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ron Burgundy is the man.,"I'm leaving some things out of this review, because I don't want to spoil the movie for you... There have been some good comedies this decade ranging from American Wedding, Old School, Undercover Brother, Austin Powers 3, Barbershop, School of Rock, Zoolander, Starchy and Hutch, Dodgeball, both Sherk movies and Bruce Almighty. However, none of these comedies have been as funny and as original as ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"". Simply put ""Anchorman"" is the funniest movie of this decade so far.""Anchorman"" is a 90-minute running joke, you could probably laugh throughout the entire movie. Anchorman is about a '70s news anchor named Ron Burgundy (played by Will Ferrell, who also co-wrote the movie) and his news team must adapt to new times as the station they work for bring on a new FEMALE co-anchor named Veronica Cornningstone (played by Christina Applegate, she was Kelly in Married with Children). Back in 1970's, only men where allowed to read the news. ""It's anchorman, not anchor-lady"" was the motto that Burgardy and his news team followed by. Well, the plot kind of stinks, but who cares it's a dumb comedy, nobody cares about the plot when it's entertaining (sort of like porn).Onto the Channel 4 news team, who is the #1 news station in San Diego (and hated by every other news station, most of all by Channel 9 led by Wes Mantooth (played by Vince Vaughn)). The Ch. 4 news team is made up of 5-time Emmy winner anchor Burgundy, Champ Kind and his famous catch-phrase ""WHAMMY!!!"" on sports, Brick Tamland, who is so dumb that he loves lamp, covers weather and Brian ""Da Bri"" Fantana, who owns every type of cologne possible (even ones that are banned in other countries), as lead field reporter. All four of these guys are stupid, horny, argonaut, drunk and sharply dress. Champ (played by Dave Koechner) is a bit over-the-top, however though that's probably because his blood-alcohol level becomes illegal ten minutes right after he wakes up. ""Da Bri"" (played by Paul Rudd) thinks he's a cross between John Homles and Ron Jeremy when it comes to sex. He is so cocky he has a name for his penis and both of his nuts. Brick (played by Steve Carell, Bruce's enemy in Bruce Almighty and he was also on the Daily Show) has an IQ of 48 and likes to eat toasted mayo. Out of these three characters, Brick is by-far the funniest because he is just so dumb.Now, some of you might be wondering ""I hope Applegate doesn't ruin this movie!"" and ""does she get naked?"". No and no. Applegate does come up with some good one-liners to insult Ron and the gang and this is a PG-13 movie, so there isn't any nudity.Also in ""Anchorman"" there were a lot of cameos as well. And if there are a lot of cameos that must mean it's a good movie. I already said that Vince Vaughn was in there and he had a funny part, in fact all cameos were funny, which included Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller. However, the best cameo was by Jack Black. I won't give away too much, however the scene that he is in, shows him p*ssed off and Ron scared with his dog.Ron Burgundy is by-far Will Ferrell's best role and right now he is probably the #1 comedy actor in Hollywood (even though Ben Stiller put up a good fight in Dodgeball). You can put Ron Burgundy on the list ""comedy characters that put an actor to the top"" along with Rodney Dangerfield's and Bill Murray's characters in Caddyshack, Eddie Murphy's role in 48 hours and Jim Carrey in ""the Mask"".I bet some of you have seen the trailer, well about 90% of the trailer is not in the movie (and there were some funny parts in the trailer as well). This was very unusual, especially for a comedy, because usually, all the funniest parts are in the trailer. However, there is a rumor going around that there will be an UN-CUT edition of this movie, which has a chance to beat out ""Caddyshack"" for funniest movie of all-time.Grade: 9.5 out of 10 (the only reason there it doesn't get the 10 was because they did make fun of Pres. Bush in the movie, liberal bastards).GO SEE ANCHORMAN!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"way too Anchored, man","Will Farrell, in his funniest movie since ""Old School"", stars as ego-driven, chauvenistic, Ron Burgundy i this movie that sets itself in the 70's, when news shows were more or less a mens' business. The problem with the movie is the Ron gets emascalated far too quickly and the PG-13 rating hampers the comedy that much more. Not to be misunderstood, I did enjoy the film Steven Carrell as kind of a grown-up Ralph Wiggum, and the Jack Black cameo was one of the funniest things I've seen at the cinema in a while. It's just that so much more could've been done with the scenerio and it wasn't. Ron is seen as too incompetent, and Christina Appelgate's Veronica too good at everything she does. The Bush joke was also groan-worthy, it would've been good if EVERY comedy since 2001 didn't have at least one Bush joke.My Grade: C+",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's Like an Anchor Is Attached to the Figurative Neck of This Film.,"More chaotic comedic dumbness that is sure to please those who go to the movies to give their brains a rest, but for the rest of us ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a very mundane experience that just never does anything noteworthy. In 1970s San Diego, California the titled character (Will Ferrell) and his local team of fellow anchors (Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell and David Koechner) ignore important news in favor of stupid events like pet shows and pregnant panda bears. The quartet is delightfully stupid and take advantage of their fame by having wild fraternity-styled parties. All the fun in their silly world gets turned upside down when a young ambitious female reporter (Christina Applegate) comes to town looking to make it big in the industry. Naturally Applegate has eyes for Ferrell (go figure) and vice versa. But what happens when Applegate becomes the city's newest darling and Ferrell becomes old news? The movie starts off pretty well, but falls hard because there is just not much substance available. As usual we have ""Saturday Night Live"" skit ideas that lack the depth and intelligence to sustain interest within the viewer. Cameos abound by players like Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins (!?) end up being the product's biggest calling card. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Comedy
A modern comic masterpiece.,"This movie ranks up there with Dumb & Dumber as a comedy that after it's release, as time passes by, it cannot stop making people laugh. As the years roll by (a couple already have), we will be talking about this movie. Something just worked in this movie. The writing. The acting. It just all plays out so well. There are so many quotable lines in this film.I cannot say that I cared for Talladega Nights that much, although Ferrell is good in Stranger Than Fiction. He has far more talent than the naysayers will give him credit for. I think with Stranger Than Fiction, he has made something which proves that point. Just as Jim Carrey went through that stage, proving his acting chops in more dramatic roles, Will has done the same. Also Winter Passing is a good drama with Will.I am a highbrow movie snob. A published film critic. An elitist that loves to watch foreign and art-house movies. I chew on deep Kafka-esquire films, where intelligence reigns supreme, and questions are implied, not spelled out. Films with meaning, and subtleties under the surface...... and I LOVE THIS MOVIE. It just clicks. Behold the comic masterpiece 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy'.(raises Scotch) ""To Ron Burgundy.""",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The movie firmly establishes it's silly andoccasionally surreal tone early on, and sticks with it all the way through. For example, the ending of this film has to be one of the dumbest endings of all time, and yet, it works perfectly, as though there's no other way the film could have ended. And the actors are all top-notch, with Ferrell giving his best effort to date, and Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell also kicking ass.

Not even bad enough to see for shock value.,"This is how my wife and I rang in New Years Day 2005. We visited friends, very dear friends, who had decided to rent ""Anchorman"" after being reliably informed that ""Anchorman"" starts off slowly but gets really, really funny as it goes on. By the end we could expect to be so hysterical that we'd be falling out of our seats, rolling around the floor like fish out of water.So we sat there, popped some corn, cracked open sodas and nestled in for what we expected to be nothing special but, hey, have a laugh, enjoy it for what it is -- just a silly little comedy. I didn't expect Shakespeare, Scorsese or Spielberg. I expected to be mildly amused every once in a while. That's all I wanted.About 90 minutes later, I realized two things: One, I had just seen without rival the single worst motion picture I have ever seen. Two, I will never get that 90 minutes back.Some movies are so dreadful they're almost worth seeing to witness how bad a movie could be. ""Anchorman"" does not even fall into that dubious category.***Spoilers*** It's my firm belief that no one who sees more than one movie every five years could possibly have found the rumble scene -- with A-list actors making cameos -- the slightest bit funny. A dog getting kicked off the side of a bridge? Ron Burgundy arguing with the clubowner who's trying to make him eat cat doo-doo? Baxter the little dog talking to the grizzly bear at the zoo? Here's an example, it was shown in subtitles.... Baxter:On my journey I met one of your kind. His name was Katow-jo. We became friends. Bear: Katow-jo is my cousin. From now on, you will be known as Baxter, Friend to Bears. Go in peace. Baxter: I will spread tales of your compassion.It's one big drawn-out improv sketch -- all entirely too long and all completely humor-free. ""Anchorman"" was the comedic version of your local Halloween haunted house. A bunch of people dress in scary outfits, make scary noises and jump out from every corner and yell BOO! We're startled, taken aback for minute, but not really frightened. In ""Anchorman"", a bunch of actors provide the audience with comedy's version of BOO! They shock us with some loud noise or a crude joke or a cat-poop reference, and some really clever dialogue from a dog. It might amuse the feeble-minded for a second, but everyone knows this oinker really isn't the slightest bit funny.I might upgrade it to two only because Christina Applegate was looking mighty fine.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Winning Effort,"`Anchorman' is a pretty darned funny movie and Will Ferrell has a winning release here, for the reasons that it is pretty smart stuff and will be a box office smash to boot.  Cut from the same mold as `The Naked Gun' series and `Airplane' we are reminded of Leslie Nielsen efforts when he was at the top of his game.  But perhaps the casting of Fred Willard more contemporarily ties `Anchorman' to the sarcastic treats `Best Of Show' and `A Mighty Wind', successful parodies which may have influenced Ferrell in lampooning the worst of the 70's.Focusing on a TV news team of the era, Ferrell (as Ron Burgundy, a local anchorman on evening broadcasts) looks, dresses and acts the part of a familiar subject (let's face it, Ted Knight was an original); a no-nothing hedonistically sexist talking head.  His teammates support the theme that TV news people have characters the thickness of a playing card and all the social skills of college frat pledges.Of the supporting cast, standouts include Paul Rudd as supporting newsperson Brian Fontana, Fred Willard as their boss Ed Harken and unbilled cameos by three Hollywood regulars.  Vince Vaughn reveals a wonderful laugh to us and contributes well as the second banana (therefore arch enemy of Ron Burgundy) in San Diego newscaster ratings.  Vaughn also got a chance to appear in two movies very recently where a fairly important, if not the main, character could not articulate a metaphor, was ignorant of common idioms and/or makes up historical references (see also Ben Stiller in Dodgeball).There was one item that became distinctly more noticeable and almost unbearable as the movie went on  this is the worst sound track in memory. As if the 70's weren't unmemorable enough, the tunes  all the vapid hits of that era  were chosen for the movie.   `Afternoon Delight' could be the worst tune of the second part of the 20th century; if you like rock that has an edge, this is not the soundtrack for you.  It might be argued that these were the hits then; well, no one should have to listen to 90 minutes of the following:1) Legendary Anchor Ron Burgundy Welcomes You To His Album ""A Life, A Song"" 2) Ride Captain Ride -  Anchorman Medley 3) Sunshine -  Anchorman Medley 4) Treat Her Like A Lady -  Anchorman Medley 5) Groovy Situation -  Anchorman Medley 6) Carry On My Wayward Son - Anchorman Medley 7) Grazing in the Grass - Anchorman Medley 8) Cherry, Cherry - Anchorman Medley 9) Who's That Lady -Anchorman Medley 10) Shannon 11) Use Me -Anchorman Medley 12) Help Yourself -Anchorman Medley 13) She's Gone -Anchorman Medley 14) Afternoon Delight 15) Ron Burgundy's Sign Off(Source: http://music.ign.com/articles/522/522968p1.html)Christina Applegate (as Veronica Corningstone, a serious challenge to the all-male broadcasting station staff) generated just the right amount of lib-ness to her role and is a perfect choice as Will Ferrell's in-house competition.  She shows us smart, sexy and talented; Fred Willard has no choice but to make her the lead on the occasion of Burgundy's inability to make an appearance for the nightly news and she runs with it.The news team is composed of a sports anchor (Champ Kind, played by David Koechner); Brian Fontana (Paul Rudd) - Rudd has appeared in 200 Cigarettes and The Cider House Rules and is far funnier than any of the other news team members; and Steve Carrel (playing Brick Tamland).  Anyone living in the Seventies knew a Brian Fontana, something of a disco ladies man.So we witness the penetration of the news team by a woman, tension and finally all-out war between the local news stations and a somewhat tepid romantic angle between two unlikely lovers.  There are even two great lines that one can steal in the bargain.  And if you squeak out a few laughs like Vince Vaughn you will have covered the value of your ticket.Rating: Three Stars.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Ridiculous and Hilarious,"Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) leads a wacky top rated local news team in 1970s San Diego. Brash Champ Kind (David Koechner) does the sports. Mentally retarded Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) is the weatherman. Edgy ladies man Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) does the on-field reporting. Then their channel hires the beautiful Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) for diversity sake.I couldn't stop laughing. Everybody is hilarious in this especially the stupidity coming out of Steve Carell. Well let's face, it's all stupidity coming out of everybody. The jokes just never stops coming. Behind the laughter, there is the male chauvinist antics, and a quest for the network news anchor desk. The constant joking does wear thin in the section where Ron Burgundy gets Veronica Corningstone. I wonder if the chase and the conflict is funnier without the catching.PS.

So Terrible I Have To Like It.,"Farrell is an intelligent man, most gifted comedians are. Now, I'm not saying he's Robin Williams, but he is talented. But with one mediocre movie after another, we SNL/Farrell fans were wondering what was going on. How could he be so good on SNL and die on screen so badly?It seems the key was the screenplay. He needs a specific vehicle line in order to demonstrate his talents. Maybe it was the supporting cast. Maybe it was the combination of writing and the casting. I'm not sure exactly what that formula consists of, but Achorman has obviously nailed it.

It succeeds, but I think it alienates people who are used to watching more modern day movies.Some of the writing is fantastically funny.

Ron Burgundy's empire,"This is one of those movies that's hard to write about. It's not a particularly complex movie; but in a way, it is complex on a comedic scale. This movie is genius. I laughed at every scene. There are probably three laughs in every scene. This makes ""Anchorman"" a shimmering success, possessing a comic sense and direction which is undeniable. As you laugh your way through the end credits, you start to think about how good of a movie that really was. How many comedies achieve this many laughs? Very few. I can think of only a few films that come into mind with this many laughs.The plot of ""Anchorman"" follows Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) who's San Diego's top newsman in the 1970's. But that all changes for Ron and his little cronies when an ambitious and insightful female competitor is hired to be alongside Ron.Oftentimes, comedies have lame premises with no promises and shoddy writing, but that's all contradicted in ""Anchorman"". Adam McKay sustains his comedic flair all throughout the picture, and the writing is consistent. This is one of those movies that if it doesn't make you laugh, then I think there's a problem.Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)3½ STARS (OUT OF 4)Directed by Adam McKayWritten by Will Ferrell and Adam McKayStarring Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Steve Carrell and Paul RuddRated PG-1394 minutes.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
No Pretensions; Just A Lot Of Laughs,"In many ways I think the best comparison for this movie is probably ""Gilligan's Island"" - and I mean that in a positive way. What I loved about 1960's comedies such as Gilligan's Island (or Hogan's Heroes or The Beverley Hillbillies) is that they had no pretension about them. They didn't claim to be making any fundamentally important social statement. They were all just about being silly enough to have fun with - and, to me at least - they worked. And that's what ""Anchorman"" is - it's silly enough (stupid enough to be honest) to be able to simply sit down and have fun with. There's nothing serious about this; no important subplots; no significant life lessons. It's just good old fun, and it works wonderfully.Will Ferrell as the legendary anchorman Ron Burgundy and Christina Applegate as his romantic interest and anchor rival Veronica Corningstone play this perfectly. Their straight up serious performances are exactly what the movie needs to make it really funny. I actually thought that they worked so well together that it would be interesting to see what sort of chemistry they might have in a more serious romantic comedy. Also brilliantly funny were Ron's news team, played by Paul Rudd (as Brian Fantana), Steve Carell (as Brick Tamland) and David Koechner (as Champ Kind). These three - and especially Koechner - were hilarious in their roles.There were a couple of problems here, mind you. At times - even for this sort of movie - it went a bit over the top. I remember especially the news team rumble. It was a cute idea, but didn't add a lot to the story and added too many other rival news teams. Where the movie had to that point featured a rivalry between only two news teams (Ron's and Wes Mantooth's, played by Vince Vaughn), all of a sudden we have a third network, public television and Spanish language TV in the picture. Too much - way too much. I also though that there just wasn't enough story here to go much past an hour and a half, but this one went over 1:45. Again, too much - way too much. After a while the jokes started to get a bit old. Probably there was enough to go 1:20 to 1:25 with this.Basically, though, there were a lot of laughs here (and I loved the closing dialogue between Baxter the dog and the kodiak bear - ""fare thee well, Baxter. You shall always be the friend of the bears."") If you just want to have some fun without having to think too hard - and we all need that sometimes - this is a great one to watch. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

a lot better than i thought,"I originally wrote this movie off to be a stupid little Will Ferrell flick that lacked almost any actual kind of humor at all.

As expected, almost the entire cast of Old School was in action but it wasn't a bad thing. One of the funniest parts was the big news team bedlam and the talk they had afterward about what had happened was hilarious. In conclusion, it was really silly but pretty funny too...surprisingly.

More man-hating drek,"I watched this alleged comedy last night (0r as much of it as I could bear) due to its mighty reputation. As a comedy it is poor but there is something more sinister hidden in the subtext that no one is mentioning.Anchorman, along with all other Judd Apatow films I have had the misfortune to see (40 year Old Virgin, Knocked up) buys into the feminist narrative unquestioningly (this is Hollywood AKA Liberaltown after all). All the men are depicted as incompetent morons, while the women are sexy, smart and capable of anything. Now it used to be the case in sex comedies that both sexes were evenly matched, usually equally screwy. This was the case from Grant/Hepburn to Moore/Minelli. Now, since the rise of femo-fascism, even mild criticism of females is forbidden, while caricaturing of males as gross stereotypes has gotten worse. The gulf between the two is not conducive to comedy.The moron men present themselves in front of this successful woman and are one by one, ritually humiliated. Yet, despite being surrounded by these male losers, the 'comedy' needs the smart sexy woman to fall in love with one of them, always unbelievably implausible. Then it falls apart due, naturally, to him being a jerk.The real story here is not 'Anchorman' at all but 'Anchorwoman'. It is a fiction of how a woman must break into a 'man's world', come up against 'sexism' and emerge triumphant. We are told, that there was a time in cable news when only men read the news. This is a fantasy which only exists in Liberals imagination. In reality women were reading the news long before cable TV and cable news broadcasters included women readers from the start.One particularly objectionable scene is when Applegate takes over the anchor for the first time. She is surrounded by a braying pack of men, pulling down their pants, snorting their derision and generally trying to put her off. In what sort of parallel universe would that happen? In reality it is a man's natural instinct to try and help an attractive female.Men, never forget that Hollywood hates you.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Average Comedy,"Anchorman is a good concept that wears a little thin over 90 minutes. Spoliers included.

This was a very funny moment, but unfortunately, the plot got in the way of the comedy.  This often happens with comedy.  The first half hour or so of the movie is great, but then the plot starts to take over, and that plot is usually uninteresting.  The comedy moments get further and further apart, and the movie starts to drag. Old School comes to mind as another example.Will Ferrell gives an excellent performance as Ron Burgundy.  Steve Carell continues to shine.  Paul Rudd is surprising in this type of role.  I think they tried to create a real character with Christina Applegate, and failed. She just wasn't very interesting.  I give Ferrell and Adam McKay credit for trying to create plot and characters, but I think this movie would have been better if it was pure slapstick, with Applegate simply being the butt of all the jokes.The now well known cameos provide few funny moments.  Vince Vaughn is one of my favorites, but his improvization does not work here, and he has one funny line in the whole movie.  Surprisingly, Luke Wilson provides the funniest cameo.",,Anonymous,Comedy
My favorite movie EVER,"This was the funniest movie I have ever seen but it is definitely not for all people. You cant expect up-tight clever humor, but instead, silly humor. Also, if you don't care for Will Ferrell you probably won't enjoy this movie. Don't expect a beautiful plot either. Most of the jokes are plain silly. If you are into that kind of humor you will love this movie, if not, maybe not so much. I would recommend this movie but not to all audiences. This kind of movie is the one you can't really read reviews on to judge but must see it for yourself. Will Ferrell was great in this movie and if you go by my word, I would definitely recommend it",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I found this one of the most hilarious films ever invented!,"I loved this film! I thought Brick's character was fantastic, some of his lines left my sides aching! My family and I laughed the hardest at brick's line 'I hear their periods attract bears'! I loved the little cameo roles played by Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller. 'Afternoon Delight' was another highlight. Some of the ridiculous lines Will Farrel said confused me - which is good because they also nearly made me wet myself! Baxter's head brace was fab - the image of a dog with a head brace on made my little brother stare with his mouth open. I honestly think I could say that this film is a flawless masterpiece! One word to sum it up would be 'perfection'! I could watch this film over and over again and it would still make me cry with laughter. Lilzer22 x 10 stars: **********",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The funniest film this year (so far),"I saw Will Ferrell's new film Ancorman today, and was in stitches from beginning to end. I already knew that he was a comedy genius, but this is his best work ever (sure beats Old School). Unfortunately, when I saw the movie, there were some idiots sitting behind me yacking on there cell phones, but that did not stop me from enjoying it.So the plot of Ancorman is that there's this man named Ron Burgundy, who basically the James Bond of San Deigo Journalisam. He and his news team buddies are the top of the heap in the rating, life is good. Unfortunitly for the boys, A new anchor person from Ashville, NC comes to The city of Saint Deigo, and this particular person (to everyone surprise) is a woman. Now in the 70's, a woman anchor was un-heard of (except of coruse for Barbra Walters who was on the Today show during the 60's and 70's). Anyway, everyone on the news team was pretty peeved about it, but all tried to get a piece of her (If you know what I mean) Veronica (played by Christina Applegate) is a womans woman trapped in a mans world who's trying to make herself respected in a mans world.The whole film will make you laugh so hard, you'll spit the popcorn out of you mouth. I give it 3 1/2 stars and suggest it to anyone over 13 who loves good comedy and music from the 70's. You stay classy IMDb.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
worst movie ever?,"Truly the most awful movie I have ever had to endure!We didn't even manage to stay to the end! The acting is terrible, the cast doesn't offer much talent, the story is pathetic and I really do not have a good word to say about this movie. Definitely found a new player in the contender for worst movie of all time and definitely the worst movie produced in 2004. I'm told that its appealing to older people but REALLY do they have such terrible taste that they can find anything amusing in that film!! If you want a 2004 comedy thats funny take Dogeball any day.

overrated,"Just coming out of this movie, I would have to say it is a little overrated(7.4 as of currently) although I always thought the scales were kind of screwed up on this site. The problem is that a good percentage of the people that vote either choose a 1 or a 10 which should be reserved for very special movies be it good or bad. Apparently 30 percent of the people who voted thought this was right up there with the greatest movies they have ever seen. I see this extreme rating as a lack of interest in the pole and a good deal of 10's and 1's should be thrown out in my opinion. On another note, the movie had a good number of popular faces giving cameos which can always add a lot to a movie(although ben stiller seems to be taking any job offered to him and is running out of personalities to present). Will Ferrell is a respected comedian and I know he has made a lot of fans from his days on SNL and all of his supporting roles in other movies but...For me its hard to see him in a lead role because I quickly become habituated to his humor. Its for this reason that I liked him in short skits, but if you are like me, you are going to have a problem enjoying this movie as much as the rest of the audience in the theater. I would give it a 5.8 in the comedy genre but you have to see it to really know how you will feel",,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny! Satirizing the 'news models' but appreciating the poor dim-wits nonetheless!,"Nice blend of slapstick, subtlety, and wit--- very funny and humorous movie! Moreover, it also has 'heart,' and a genuine story (romance? drama?). Will Ferrell's characters in other movies, such as the magnificent and under-appreciated 'Dick,' (1999-ish) and the solid 'Zoolander,' (2001)have always been unpleasant dorks. His characters have always been the darker, villainous types, always odious. 'Anchorman,' however, avoids the easy path of making his character simply a prat, simply an a**hole. The character is, actually, dim-witted and naive, rather than malevolent or mean. One gets the impression that he just doesn't know any better, that he wouldn't be all that bad of a person to know, even when he does do the arrogant and narcissistic things (typical of many, one assumes, who lust after careers as 'news models').The supporting cast, especially Christina Applegate, are wonderful! Overall, a funny movie with a bit more depth and meaning than might have been in a satire. Well worth seeing!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Greatest Movie Ever !?,"The first time I watched this movie I didn't find it all that great, but after watching it a couple more times I found this movie to be one of my all time favorites. Now I have seen it at least 20 times, I watch it every time it's on HBO. I like the unrated version much more than the theatrical version. The scenes cut out were hilarious. The humor takes a little while to get used to, and I think that is why people rate this movie as poorly as they do. That's why I recommend watching it twice or even three times so that you can pick up on the comedy. Some parts are a little lame but the overall funny/lame ratio is about 80/20.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Excellent, if slightly unoriginal.","When Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy first hit cinema screens, I did not go to see it. It seemed like another predictable, unfunny waste of time; another Sandler-esquire love-in for the comedy frat-pack.The reviews it got in the press did not command viewing either, and so it was not until it came out on DVD that I gave in and rented it out; see what all the (not very much) fuss was about.That evening, I cursed my pomposity those three months before. I should have seen it in the cinema. I laughed throughout, and the lines kept on coming, thick and fast. I decline to write any on this comment, because I couldn't possibly do them any justice. Rest assured, if and when you go see this, you will not regret it, and you will laugh your ass off.The one problem is that Ferrell lifted his Ron Burgundy character from Steve Coogan's eminently superior Alan Partridge, and Americanised him. He does a good job at it, but Coogan is still the master, so get acquainted with Mr. Partridge before you see this movie, just so you know what I'm talking about.In closing, Anchorman is a splendid way to spend 1 1/2 hours, and s thoroughly deserving of the accolade: ""2004's best comedy"".",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Love this movie.,"This movie is absolutely hilarious! However, it's one of those movies to watch when you've had a rough week, and are not wanting any intellectual stimulation...just lots of laughs! If you go into it expecting a deep plot, you're going to be disappointed. Just take it for the hilarity that it brings, and you will be highly satisfied! Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate are a hilarious duo in this movie; playing off of each other perfectly! The cameos are excellent in their simplicity (Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Tim Robbins are in the movie for maybe a total of 5 minutes but add another level of comedy). There are tons of memorable quotes that you will find yourself saying constantly. Overall, this is an excellent movie worth watching over and over again. You find new things to laugh at each time you watch. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Horrifically bad,"I cannot believe people rate this at 6.6 out of ten. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Will Ferrell is totally miscast. I was asking how he got this part about the time his credit rolled in as one of the writers. Why would Christina Applegate fall for a guy with no looks and no personality? I thought this movie had potential due to the subject matter, but it wasn't a spoof, it wasn't a comedy, it was just trash. Most of the scenes appeared to be impromptu ad libs without a script. The characters were not characters outside of Applegate. I did not laugh once, or even crack a smile. Blockbuster owes me five bucks for watching this drivel. Ferrel is the latest in a line of no talent SNL alumni who have no talent, but are nonetheless rich for the schlock they put out. Nothing was funny. This movie was STUPID! As for the box label WARNING LOTS OF SEX, etc., they put that on the BOX so YOU WOULD RENT IT and for no other reason. .5 out of ten",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Anchorman strikes again!,"Anchorman was a very worth going into and purchasing your tickets and getting good seats to sit and watch the movie. In fact, the people I know who have watched this really liked it and thought it was a stupid-funny humor type thing. The only one thing I personally hated from the movie was that it was a little perverted. I mean not in a bad way but he did things that are weird for a grown man should do in a movie. But Wil Farell did a great job at role playing and he made the gross stuff turn into funny stuff. This movie was not one of those movies that could actually be realistic. And when the Christina Applegate and Will Farell were in the bear pit and the dog told the bear to go away. Yeah sure, that would NEVER happen. Well I would reccomend for everyone to go and see it but not children under 13.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Best comedy since Airplane!,"I saw this opening night, at a theater where middle schoolers come to socialize, not watch movies. I braved the crowd hoping for a performance from Will Ferrell as good as in ""Elf."" I was not disappointed.Ferrell is at his comedic pinnacle in ""Anchorman,"" but he is not the only bright spot (we'll get back to him later). Christina Applegate shines in her role as Veronica Corningstone, the sexy newcomer to the San Diego news scene, much to the chagrin of her new co-workers. Paul Rudd is adequate in a smaller role than expected (not to discredit him, he was just surrounded by comic gold). David Koechner also performs well, which could prompt people to think ""That guy was on SNL? When? Did I miss something?""But the show-stopper was Steve Carrell. The Daily Show alum got his first real taste of the big screen in Bruce Almighty, but in Anchorman he displays perfect comedic timing as Brick Tamland, the weatherman who later finds out that he has an IQ of 48 (luckily, we are told this in the first ten minutes so that his role makes sense). Throughout the film, we are reminded of this by countless moments of innocent stupidity, a difficult thing to portray. Carrell pulled it off and added at least 20 great laughs along the way.Now, to the main event: Mr. Ferrell. The ads for this movie misrepresent who Ron Burgundy is. They make him seem shallow, dumb, callous, unkind, and downright annoying. That might be because I saw only a few shots in the movie that were actually in the ads. Ferrell's Burgundy is somewhat self-absorbed, but for that matter so is Veronica. Remember, this was the Me Decade. Ferrell does have moments of his standard comic styling (odd lines, sometimes screamed while in an odd situation), but this character is entirely different than Old School's Frank the Tank or Elf's Buddy. It has the feeling that this man really existed, has horrifying as that may seem.At times, Anchorman goes into fantastical scenarios, but I felt later that they were all done in a way that reminded me very much of a Monty Python skit that was made for a broader audience.Whether or not Anchorman is a great movie or not, one thing is certain. You will laugh. Hard. You might have to watch it twice to get all the things you missed. I know I will.So, for all these reasons and more, I consider it the greatest comedy since Airplane! and it is also on my Top 10 List of All Time, which is, to give you a bearing of my tastes:1. Lord of the Rings (all of em) 2. Pulp Fiction 3. Indiana Jones (3, then 1, then 2) 4. As Good As it Gets 5. Kill Bill 6. The Godfather 7. Snatch 8. Anchorman 9. Reservoir Dogs 10. Big FishThese are not my picks for the greatest ever, just my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
how could i miss this one?,"I didn't like ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"", so the name ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"", which sounded somewhat similarly, kept me from watching this movie, until i finally decided to give it a try....and boy was it hilarious! it definitely became my absolute favorite in the, as it is called here - 'stupid' comedy genre.Will Ferrell is gorgeous as the 'prima donna' anchorman, and his news team is just so lovably stupid (""News team, assemble!"", that was hilarious too) this movie is full of small gems of genuine humor, and the best part is almost every minute is full of itI didn't like Jim Carrey's first 'stupid'-movies, they was just insanely aggressive in trying to make you laugh, but ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" to me is an honest comedy, one that makes you relax, and just enjoy it while still laughing hysterically at timesgive it a try and i think, you won't regret it10/10 for the fun it gives me every time i watch it",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You'll laugh till you're purple over Ron Burgundy,"Will Ferrell does it again! This was without a doubt a great film. This film is perfect for those who have or lack a brain, with the great comedic acting of not only Will Ferrell (Ron Burgundy), but of Steve Carell (Brick Tamland), Paul Rudd (Brian Fantana), David Koechner (Champ Kind), and Christina Applegate (Veronica Corningstone). The best part of the movie is the newscast war in the street that turns into a ""bilingual blood-fest"". The best character was definitely Brick, played by the Daily Show with Jon Stewart's Steve Carell. Carell's mentally retarded weatherman really keeps you laughing the whole way through, even through serious parts. From beginning to end this movie is a laugh riot. You may want to take an oxygen tank, just increase you can't breathe during Will Ferrell's half-nude weightlifting in front of Christina Applegate.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Lighter Side Of Sexual Harassment,"""Anchorman"" is stupid, sexist and sleazy. And it has a lot of other great things going for it, too. Will Ferrell is a comedy genius, but he has never had the chance to realize his true potential on screen before this, a deftly-realized no-holds-barred laughfest that may well be the best thing in cinematic silliness since ""Airplane.""Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, anchorman for a San Diego local news program circa the 1970s, who finds his position and his masculinity challenged when newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) breaks the glass ceiling to become his co-anchor. As sportscaster and Burgundy buddy Champ Kind (David Koechner) complains, ""It's anchorMAN, not anchorLADY, and that's a scientific fact!""Koechner and Applegate are both terrific, part of a stellar supporting cast that includes Fred Willard as the station manager, Paul Rudd as a roving reporter whose idea of wooing females involves a pungent black-market cologne called ""Sex Panther,"" and Steve Carell as a brain-dead weatherman who hangs with the boys without understanding much of anything. He even has to be coached by Corningstone when he tries to make a lewd come-on. ""Would you like to come to the pants party?"" ""Are you trying to tell me there's a party in your pants, and I'm invited?""There's many ruder moments, like Ron's hair-trigger reaction to Veronica's acceptance of his date, which some of us will laugh at more than others. But it's hard to imagine people getting genuinely upset with a film as goofy as this. Nothing happens quite as one expects in a script written by Ferrell and director Adam McKay. Like when Burgundy takes Corningstone to a bar and impresses her by playing jazz flute. Or when, during an intimate moment together, Ron and Veronica are joined by a cartoon panda (bears and pandas are a recurring motif in ""Anchorman,"" for some reason.)The best thing about this movie is Ferrell, who plays Burgundy like a polyester, Scotch-soaked combination of James Lipton and Robert Goulet, clearly channeling the late Ted Knight in his Ted Baxter role. He's a man in love with himself, embarrassingly unaware, yet somehow endearing. When he makes love to a woman, he declares: ""I'm storming your castle on my steed, m'lady."" When he falls out with later on, he asks her to go back to her home on Whore Island. That and throws her into a typewriter when she insults his hair.There's a couple of sequences that don't work, though other people like them. One is when Burgundy and his buddies break into song, specifically ""Afternoon Delight,"" which slows things down and doesn't really add to the '70s ambiance which is otherwise kept subtle and on-target (like with an opening pool party that cleverly quotes from ""Boogie Nights"" without calling attention to itself.)The other is a big brawl featuring several rival news teams, which swiftly escalates into something out of ""Gladiator."" This is a sequence a lot of other people like about this movie, but again for me it goes on too long and is too strained. At least it gets out of the way the obligatory Ferrell-film cameos from Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller.Overall, though, ""Anchorman"" is a comedy that 100 percent of the time works 90 percent of the time. There's a lot of great lines in this film people will throw at each other around the water coolers, but it also holds together from beginning to end, a rare achievement for films like this. Every time I watch it, there's something else I like best. Right now, what's coolest about this movie may be the fact we get to hear real TV newsman Bill Kurtis tell us: ""Ron Burgundy was the balls."" That goes double, or quadruple, for ""Anchorman.""",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
There are some funny moments but its still an average comedy,"Anchorman has some funny moments but their not a lot of them and in the end the film is a disappointment. It's the 70s and Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is the quintessential television anchorman for a San Diego television station, but his world is turned upside down when an ambitious female reporter (Christina Applegate) infiltrates his territory when she tries to become the network's first female anchorperson. Will this be a battle of the sexes turn into all-out war or will love conquer all? The plot sounds really funny and I was really looking forward to watching this film since Will Ferrell is in it. But it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Anchorman feels and looks like an SNL skit that's extended to a feature film. The jokes are either hit or miss but the ones that are funny are usually very funny. I still enjoyed Anchorman since it has some of the funniest lines I have heard in awhile but it was a little disappointing. Will Ferrell did an awesome job and of course he is the best part about Anchorman. I think they should have casted someone else instead of Christina Applegate since she was kind of boring. The supporting cast is great including Fred Willard, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David Koechner. Out of all of them I would say that Steve Carell was the funniest and he makes up for the awful Sleepover. Adam McKay directs and he does a good job. He also writes for SNL so that's probably why the comparisons to SNL and Anchorman are so easy to find. The films running time is only 94 minutes so unless you find the premise really irritating you can easily survive though the film. There's also a lot of cameos and some scenes that are very funny and defiantly worth watching. Rating 6/10 not the funniest movie of the year but its worth checking out now that its out on video.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I love lamp.,"I'm surprised that this movie got such negative reviews. Initially, I had not desire whatsoever to watch ""Anchorman"" in theaters; I thought I might watch it once it hit DVD, but I wasn't sure if I'd even do that much. My friend convinced me to watch it with her (my first time, her second), and even as we were going into the theater people were warning me away from the movie. Needless to say, I was nervous about what was to come.I needn't have been. The first few seconds of the movie did, to be honest, have me nervous and fidgeting--it was neither funny nor remotely enjoyable. My friend wouldn't let me leave, though, and I thank her for that. The rest of the movie was truly hilarious.Granted, it didn't make a whole lot of sense. It was the most unrealistic that I'd seen in ages. I still loved it. I loved it so much that I convinced my sister--who didn't even plan on watching it once it was on DVD--to go with me to see it again. She loved it as well. And you know how the commercials said that you'd be quoting this movie all summer? Well, in the case of my friends and me, they were absolutely right.I think you should give the movie a chance. I did, and I adored it. I give it an 8 out of 10--it was equally funny for me on the second viewing, and that rarely happens.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious Movie that does not require your brain,"""Anchorman"" is definitely one of my favorite comedies to watch over and over again. I know I can watch this without having to really think about the plot or what will happen next, because most of the time, there is something absurd going on that just makes you laugh. It is a movie full of random humor, and I definitely recommend seeing it more than once, just to get a feel for the type of humor being used by the characters. I thought Will Ferrell was hilarious, and he carried this movie, just as Ron Burgundy carries the Channel 4 News Team. Christina Applegate was also very funny, and I liked the choices for the rest of his news team.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one but if you feel as though you must waste your time, wait until it comes out on cable so you don't waste your money on a rental.If you want slapstick, you are better off with the silly but funny Austin powers movies or Airplane.

Really one of the funniest movies in a long time.,"Simple: If you have a sense of humor, then you'll love this movie. If you think Katie Couric is funny, then you'll be confused and bewildered. The only movie of recent memory that was near this funny was Old School, but I would say this movie easily exceeds it in non-stop laughter and totally bizarre humor. I felt all the characters were funny in there own unique way. The previews of this movie don't do it justice, which is rare in comedies. Usually comedies show their 3 or 4 funniest scenes in the preview and this is NOT the case in Anchorman. It has a dozen or more ""belly laugh"" scenes and none of them are in the previews on TV. Truly an odd movie of its own style and comedy. I highly recommend that everyone see this and most people should see it twice.

Hilarious!,"To my mind, comedies are successful one for every 100 produced. And, ""Anchorman"" is one of them! A pretty-much-perfect spoof of both local TV news and the 1970's.You of course have to like the crazy-type humor of films like ""Airplane!"" to like ""Anchorman."" If you like your humor sophisticated, you're out of luck! This is silly stuff, that doesn't mind getting the characters into one goofy situation after another for laughs!Will Ferrell stars and co-writes with his partner Adam McKay. This is definitely their best movie together, although the first half of ""Talladega Nights"" is pretty funny, going down the spoof road again.Comedy is really tough to pull together, especially in a feature film format. You have to pace and sustain the laughs carefully, and it is critical that the characters are entertaining. Having just stock characters telling jokes isn't going to cut it!And so, the film has lots of great characters, especially Steve Carell as the low-intellect Brick, who says the most inappropriate things, well, pretty much all the time!Lots of fun, and one of the best comedies I have ever seen.

A Fine Example of True Comedy in our Time,"Will Ferrell is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most talented comedians in feature film rotation today, and by the stream of movies being developed with him in them, I'm not the only one to believe so. So maybe Elf wasn't the hilarious work we expected from Ferrell, but this movie is just wonderful.I don't know if I'm the only one sick of these ""hilarious"" attempts from previous entertaining comedians. Adam Sandlers recent attempts at comedy were lackluster, and Ben Stiller is single-handedly digging a grave created a parody of himself with the garbage he has been making, seemingly a movie a month. But when this movie hit, it was down right humorous. Maybe it's Ferrell's style that I like, and from observing lots of his SNL tough, he's known to repeat this type of character. Whether or not he will reuse it in the future or not is beyond me, but this film is a delight.Just watching the opening sequence makes me laugh-out-loud, while Ron Burgundy prepares for a broadcast, he's told he's on the air, and simply replies after a awkward pause "" I Don't Believe You. "" It's little things like that, that made this movie a spectacular comedy. It isn't one of 2004's best films, but it's one of the best comedies in the past few years. To even compare it to Dodgeball is ridiculous, this has a light-hearted story you can watch over, nobody wants a underdog overcoming the conglomerate emperor sports movie, where the underdogs overcome their handicaps, and reign supreme in a movie of luck in the finals of the game.No Brainer, when Anchorman comes out on DVD December 28th, 2004, I'll have bought it, and loved it. It'll amuse you, and keep you entertained, even if you hate to laugh.A must have to your DVD collection. *** 1/2 out of *****",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Worst movie I've seen in a long, long time!","While there were mildly humorous moments that made me smile, the humor in this movie is extremely dry and predictable. To be fair, Will Ferrel is not my favorite comedic actor, but even this performance wasn't worthy of him. None of the actors seemed to be at the top of their game, with the possible exception of Christina Applegate who has never had an abundance of acting talent or range. I wasn't expecting a great film, but I was hoping for a few of the actors to pull it from the abyss of sub-mediocrity in which it found itself. I love Steve Carrel (sp?) for his witty antics, but his role in Anchorman seems forced. I felt as if someone had grouped the ""class clowns"" from high school and asked them to star in an improv home-movie.My zero-star rating comes down to this: predictable jokes; uninteresting, pointless plot; horrible (over-)acting; waste of time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I'm kind of a big deal.,"Will Ferrell has done it again. The material is worthy of a cult following, and is easily quotable for years to come. While the story isn't much, the comedy will remain engraved in your brain for days.Steve Carell plays an unforgettable role that starts out slow, but will leave your sides in utter pain. The cameos from Luke Wilson, Jack Black, and Ben Stiller add another scene full of laughter. But even in that scene, it is Steve Carell who gets the last laugh.The characters are memorable, the humor won't get old, and the story is absolutely ludicrous.

Hilariously funny and wonderfully unPC,"San Diego, 1970s. Ron Burgundy is an anchorman at a local TV news station. He is very popular and a local celebrity. His news segment is Number 1 across all demographics and things are going incredibly well. However, his news team is entirely male and resembles a boys club. In the interests of diversity the station brings in a female reporter, Veronica Corningstone. While the remainder of the team are appalled at the decision, Ron is torn between a similar misogynism and his attraction to her. Initially Ron and Veronica do well, and an intimate relationship forms. However, an event splits them apart, resulting in a bitter feud between the two.Hilariously funny, often in a clever and/or over-the-top sort of way. Some fantastic lines and scenes, many of which have the entered the one-liner lexicon and/or meme hall of fame. Wonderfully politically incorrect, and sure to offend the types who choose to find things to be offended by. Joke's on them: these jokes and stereotypes are satirical...Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate are great in the lead roles. Well supported by Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David Koechner. Favourite performance, for me, is from Fred Willard as Ed Harken. Faultless, understated delivery.The lesser supporting roles contain some amazing names, some of whom weren't stars at the time: Chris Parnell, Vince Vaughan, Fred Armisen, Seth Rogen, Danny Trejo, Tim Robbins, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Luke Wilson.A modern comedy classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Anchorman: Best Comedy Ever,"'Anchorman' has to be my favorite comedy OF ALL TIME. If you're in desperate need of a seriously funny movie, I suggest this to you. It's a goofy film, and has a quite enjoyable story-line. You won't be able to stop laughing(just like any other Will Ferrell movie). Make sure to keep an inhaler with you, because you may stop breathing at times.All the characters are personable, and it's pretty difficult to pick which one you liked best. I would give this movie a 10, but of course this movie isn't perfect.I don't suggest this movie to ""younger"" viewers. There is quite a lot of sexual innuendo, and a few uses of the ""f***"" in one scene, but only for humor purposes of course. The violence in this movie isn't bad at all, again, it's only meant for humor. I suggest anyone 14 and up can watch this movie.I hope you enjoy 'Anchorman' as much as I did, but in the meanwhile...You stay classy, San Diego~",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This film was meant to be a comedy?,"Having an evening free I went to see ""Anchorman"" at our local cinema, the choice being based largely on the description and comments left here at the IMDb. Having thoroughly enjoyed ""Bruce Almighty"" I was reassured by the recommendation that ""If I enjoyed [Anchorman] I would also enjoy Bruce Almighty"" and other people's comments about this film being extremely funny.I'm sorry to say that I found the entire film extremely UNfunny. I think during its entire length it managed to get around three smiles out of me: and they were weak ones. :-(A small part of the problem might be the several references to people who I assume are US celebrities (but whom I have never heard of here in the UK) and the use of US slang. Without understanding these a number of the 'jokes' very definitely went over my head.But overall the film just wasn't funny. I also got the distinct impression that it didn't know where it was going: the plot, such as it was, was vague and unclear. It also seemed to keep changing its direction as time passed (I won't say as the film 'progressed': it didn't).I was uncomfortable with the language and situations used at times, which could have been forgiven if humour had genuinely been present. It wasn't. I'm rather surprised it was rated ""12A"" here in the UK (suitable for children of 12 years and over, and under 12's with an adult).The film was ALMOST but not QUITE bad enough for me to walk out on: after all I had bought my ticket and wanted an evening out. However I left at the end deeply unsatisfied and feeling that both the money and time could have been much better spent. (For example by buying a tin of paint to put on a wall, then sit and watch it dry.)",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny!,"Will Ferrell fans will love this movie. It's got many classic Ferrell-esk moments. Be sure to stay until the end. The final credits are really funny (Outtakes etc.). The characters were somewhat original and definitely really funny.All and all its great. Some of the comments here about the movie and how 'bad' it was, or whatever made me more frustrated than an Amish electrician, but everyone has their own options.The random moments in the movie were great for laughs and actually advanced the story. Some potty humor, but in pretty much good taste.The movie was slightly racist and sexist, but I say 'deal with it' because that's how the world was and you can;t change that so :P.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Still staying classy after a decade, a good dumb comedy worth watching","This is the first time I have watched this movie in about five years and I can remember it being pretty funny but after watching it this time, it was laugh out loud hilarious and it reminded me that not every movie needs to be scrutinized in terms of acting, directing, plot holes and more in the way you might analyze a drama. My advice for watching this movie is not to think too hard but to relax and have a fun time. Will Ferrell stars as Ron Burgundy, who is the anchorman for KVWN Channel 4 which is enjoying high rating thanks to him and his crew of misfits, Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd)- the lead field reporter, Champ Kind (David Koechner)- sports reporter and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who is the intellectually disabled weatherman. Set in the 1970's which their news panel featured an all male line up, station director Ed Harken (Fred Willard) tells them in order to move with the times, they've had to hire a female, Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate). It's a dumb comedy, but a great, affable type of dumb comedy and I for one appreciate this type of humor where it can be over the top and still make me laugh so much from their gags. Credit has to go to Will Ferrell who also co-wrote this comedy masterpiece and it clearly has aged too bad. Everyone of the cast played their roles well from a comedy perspective and the cameos from fellow ""Frat Packers"" like Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Jack Black as well as Tim Robbins and Danny Trejo add to the fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

If This Movie Makes A Million I Understand Why.,"This movie was great I couldn't have loved it anymore than I did. Will Ferrell brings laughter to the set and it can show on the screen. I think that Christina Applegate should have done a little better in her effort but I still loved her in the movie.Will put this movie in a projective stage in 2003 and I think it was for the better. So many things going on in 2003 for him and his films. He has at least 6 projects coming up in 2004 and 2005 these years.Will puts every movie and he can mold it into comedy and that is a good thing. I think that this movie called ""Anchorman The Legend Of Ron Burgundy"" is actually a good title and the way that Will made it, it actually makes sense.I am not a big fan of ""Old School"" but then again I did like it I thought that this movie was going to be just like ""Old School"" but it actually wasn't.Will put sense into it I think.I would give this a 10/10 for it's funniness and sense of humor throughout the movie.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Will Ferrel's best role to date,"""Anchorman"" grew on me. Like unwanted back hair, it grew on me. The first time I saw it, I thought it was fairly funny. Then I saw it a second and third time and it went from fairly funny to undoubtedly funny. This movie has several quotable and memorable scenes, plus each one of the characters in Ron Burgundy's broadcast team was amusing in his own way. In fact, the broadcast team was just a perfect bunch. But, without question, Will Ferrel held it down as Ron Burgundy. Will Ferrel has just been ascending in my book as of late, but if there is any role I would say he shined the most in, it would be this one. As I watched ""Anchorman"" again, I was a bit more attentive and I picked up on even more funny little subtleties. And the scene with him bickering back and forth with Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) was just classic. My advice to those who haven't seen it... watch it, and then watch it again. If you didn't like it the first time, you'll warm up to it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Feel good brilliance,"I've not found a film as funny as anchorman in many years. From start to finish it had me laughing my socks off and repeated viewings are equally as funny. Having read the other reviews I find it hard it understand how some people could rate it with 1 star, or even make claims that if a negative rating was available they would choose that. These people are humourless. Indeed, one reviewer said that Dodgeball was a better comedy which, as much as I enjoyed it, was nowhere near as clever or rewarding as Anchorman, and too often relies on people getting hit in sensitive areas with a ball. I know a great number of people who rank Anchorman as among their favourite films and I am inclined to agree. And finally, will people stop calling him Will 'Farrel' or other such variations! p.s.

Immature humour at it's very best,"The Anchorman is without doubt the best of the recent Hollywood comedies. With American Pie which is very much in your face, the Anchorman is far more stupid humour. With brilliant performances from comic legend Will Farrell as Ron Burgendy and then a stunning performance for Steve Carrell it's easy to see why this is good.Ron Burgandy is no doubt the most arrogant kind of guy you'll see, but when he falls in love he appears to be very much at ease, until his one and only love reads his news, the arrogance comes roaring back out of him once more, this making him redundant.A timely cameo performance from Tenacious D's Jack Black, the Anchorman will have you laughing from start to finish, it did for me.

"Rather silly, with few good lines","While I did not particularly enjoy the premise of this film, I did find several promising moments. Unfortunately, there were not enough.Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a television anchorman for ""San Diego's most popular news network."" (apparently Channel 4) Alongside are his on-screen pals Champ Kind (Koechner) Brian Fantana (Rudd) and the rather bland Brick Tamland (Carell). The quartet seem to have happy times, rivaling with fellow anchor Wes Mantooth (Vaughn) and his news crew, until Ch.4 station boss Ed Harken (Willard) announces that the news needs more diversity (much to the dismay of the gentlemen). Along comes Veronica Corningstone (Applegate) who eventually becomes Ron's co-anchor whose promising deliverences and super talent drive Burgundy into unemployment after his Teleprompter misreading.With several cameos (Ben Stiller, Jack Black) and Burgundy's talking dog, it just didn't give me that much needed spark.5/10",,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious! I laughed throughout the entire movie!,"Watching this movie is better than therapy! Will Ferrell is a master of comedy! Not only does Ferrell authentically capture all the cheesiness of the 1970s perfectly-coiffed, mustachioed, male chauvinist, he revels in it. It's so funny watching him react to everything in life while using his ""broadcast voice."" It turned many scenes from being just funny to being hilarious! The supporting cast is just as strong with scene stealing from Steve Carrell and Fred Williard. The real ""star"" of Anchorman is Ron Burgundy's dog, Baxter: what a cutie! There are several cameos that make you go from ""oh my God that's..."" to peeing your pants! I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Will Ferrell's work or who remember just how laughable the 70s were.

Tongue-In-Cheek Satire At Its Best. ♦ 78%,"Ron Burgundy & his team are one part of the frat pack that you can never forget about.Parodying the 70s' flamboyant style of news-making, the film actually creates humor without getting slapstick involved or at least not taking it to the core.

And furthermore, the seriousness with which the characters deliver their punchlines is some serious material.Cast is brilliant and with a performance like that, I am more and more falling in love with them.

Complete Trash!,"This was one of the worst, if not the worst movie ever made! I usually love Will Ferrell (i.e. Old School), but he was just so stupid in this movie. He was not alone in his stupidity, as everyone else followed suit. Nothing was good in this movie: the acting was worse than your average elementary school play and that just ruined everything else. The person who wrote the script for this movie should never work again! I went into this movie thinking i would laugh my head off. I mean, Old School was hilarious (though nothing beats Animal House) and I thought Ferrell would be just as good. However, I could not laugh at any of the jokes, even though I really wanted to. For God's sake, i'm a dumb 16 year old guy, this movie's target audience, and I hated it with an undying passion. Avoid this ""movie"" at all costs in order to keep some intelligence.

This was very visible in a couple of the boss's office scenes and on the bridge scene where his dog gets kicked into the river. Could this have been planned to make the movie seem cheesier or was it just bad editing? Otherwise the movie was pretty entertaining and very funny.

women in media,"Although a hilarious movie, it still represents the effeminate issue. The movie somewhat showed the growth of woman's role in news casting. It wasn't strongly shown, but it was a visible undertone. Women of that era struggled greatly with sexism and moving up, not only, in news casting, but the world in general. The connection with media is in the effeminate issue. Women of that era were always treated as second class citizens and were not seen as serious or competent in the mainstream workforce. Although the purpose of the movie was hilarity, Anchorman: the Legend of Ron Burgundy proves the point of the growth of women in news casting.

Finally A Silly Comedy Worth Paying $10 For!,"I rarely go see comedies in the theaters anymore. If I see any, it will be on DVD or on cable. It's not that comedies lately have sucked. It's just that as I get older I have gotten bored of the same formulas used over and over again. Comedy is such a difficult genre to make, and make well, for long-form cinema. Too often we are treated to one of a few types of comedies which don't do much for me.Lately the formula's have been the Farelly-style gross-out movies, the stupid-but-sincere Adam Sandler flicks, or the one-joke wonders (any SNL sketch turned into a movie, etc.)I honestly expected to be disappointed walking into this movie. I thought this movie basically was going to be a one-joke movie: look how narcissistic Ron Burgandy is, isn't that funny! But I was totally surprised to find myself laughing to the point of tears. Will Ferrell's character is great, but so many other hilarious characters in this movie make it an ensemble tour-de-farce.I also was afraid it was going to be another one of those comedies that is half silly but half serious like so many Adam Sandler flicks that have to have some sort of sincerity, sweet happy ending, or some moral dimension; which formulaic Hollywood execs love for some reason. At one point I thought ""Anchorman"" was heading in that direction, but pleasantly it doesn't go for that: it stays true to itself as a very funny, ridiculous movie.This is a comedy that relies heavily on random, improv-style comedy. It's creative, non- sensical, absurdist and ""silly"" in the British humour sort of way. If you love improv comedy or absurd-random humour you'll absolutely love this movie like I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I'm Ron Burgundy...? Damn right!,"Will Ferrell could easily become the funniest man to hit the big screen ever. Will Ferrell is at the stage of his career where you can just give me a line and he'll make it sound funny. Will Ferrell continues to improve every time he takes on the lead role, and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy was no exception.It's 1976 and you're the #1 network news anchor in San Diego. You flip on the TV to a loveable, proud, and dare I say, perfect anchorman? But off camera, he's a stuck-up, peculiar, jerky man named Ron Burgundy and he's got personality that'll have you laughing hours on end.The station manager, Ed Harkin (Fred Willard) has to be put up with a loudmouth, sexist group of men consisting of sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), a ladies man in Brain Fantana (Paul Rudd), mentally challenged weatherman, Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell) , and of course, the leader of the group, the man himself, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferell). Problems arose when a beautiful woman, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is brought in for diversity and the gang notices she becomes a nuisance at the news station.The plot consists of problems in the life of Ron, but it started off with joy as Ron and Veronica went to pleasure town. With fame, however, come problems. Ron angers a biker which makes the biker harm Ron's `miniature Buddha covered in hair' which results in Burgundy being late for his job. This resulted in Veronica Corningstone filling in for Burgundy which results in a boost in ratings. Ron's life falls apart as he looses his job only to reunite with his fellow workers in the end. With a movie like this, all that matters is the how many laughs the movie can get from the audience, and if there was a meter counting them it would go through the roof!The film is quotable gold. I have never heard so many one-liners in a movie, nor seen so many scenes that consisted of just flat-out goofy humor. The film tries to make sure Will Ferrell gets as much as the jokes in, but Steve Carrell was brilliant with his absurd comments throughout the film. He almost stole the movie, but Will Fearrell just had it going. Will Ferrell really catches the anchorman charm of many of the 1970s celebrities before on TV before cable. Some of the scenes were just idiotic that resulted in a cheap laugh. The news station battle royal with every weapon imaginable that took place in an alley had gold written all over it. The cameos, however, were hit-and-miss.Despite a flawed plot, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy pulls through with it's hilarious, over-the-top humor. Will Ferrell continues to shine as a comedic star and Christina Applegate wasn't as funny as she was in her role in Married With Children, but the rest of the cast made-up for her dull jokes.Story: C- Acting: A Visuals: B+ Cinematography: A Overall: B (Not an average)",,Anonymous,Comedy

There are some HILARIOUS moments, but there's also some ridiculous bits where you're just saying ""why?"". If a bit more thought had gone into the script,plot and editing it could have been a huge hit.The inclusion of Vince Vaughn and a cameo from Ben Stiller (with the same moustache he had in ""Dodgeball"") were two stupid mistakes.To be honest I didn't bother watching the last 20 minutes because I could predict what would happen.

ANCHORMAN Got Funnier with Time,"A former girlfriend once introduced me to ANCHORMAN years ago, swearing it was the funniest movie ever. At the time, I wasn't impressed. It was the usual Will Ferrell routine: over-reactions, loudness, absurdity, and a lead character will an obnoxious level of self- confidence. I must have mentally blocked the movie because, for the longest time, I couldn't remember anything from the movie except ""I love lamp"" because I had friends who'd quote it. With a new ANCHORMAN movie on the horizon and my appreciation for Will Ferrell somehow growing (I actually enjoyed 2012's THE CAMPAIGN and CASA DE MI PADRE), I decided to give this movie another shot and I actually discovered that I wasn't as harsh on it this time around. It took a few more viewings but I'm almost starting to understand why this movie has such a fan base. ANCHORMAN is set in the world of broadcast news in the 1970s. Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the #1 anchorman in San Diego, a beloved celebrity at the top of his game with the support of his Channel 4 news team: Champ Kind (David Koechner), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell). The times are changing and diversity is the new hot topic, so the network decides to hire Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) as part of the team. A woman in the world of network news doesn't sit well with the Channel 4 team and her arrival sends them into a frenzy, except for Burgundy who takes a shine to the new arrival.Without a doubt, ANCHORMAN is stupid. I'm not going to defend it in that regard, but I will argue that it's stupid/funny. It's certainly not the work of comedic genius my girlfriend had preached it to be, but I'd be lying if I didn't get some good laughs from it. In my opinion, Ferrell's best characters are always the same character. As an actor, he's got a little range but he's only really at his best when he is playing a character with an arrogant sense of confidence and a tendency to yell his lines incoherently when he's distraught. Burgundy is all of this at Ferrell's usual extreme. He's a decent character who actually seems to have a little humanity inside as he's the only one who is not only not threatened by Corningstone's initial arrival, he sees a beautiful woman that he has more than a passing interest in. Christina Applegate holds her own pretty well against the unstoppable force of Will Ferrell. Applegate plays Veronica as confident, talented, and passionate about her career; she is determined to break into the ""men-only"" world of network news and she's not going to let a couple mental lightweights stand in her way. But she's also sympathetic and not the usual 'stone-hearted feminist' you might expect to find filling this role in a comedy. But as well as Ferrell and Applegate do in ANCHORMAN, most of the best parts are the result of some excellent supporting cast.Despite Ron Burgundy's name being prominently displayed in the title of the movie, the funniest bits don't come from Burgundy's personal struggles but from the interactions with the entire Channel 4 News Team and more-so when they are face-to-face with their rivals from the other networks. The WEST SIDE STORY gang fight sequence between the different news crews makes the whole movie worth watching and provides the movie with all it's best cameo appearances (that I won't spoil here in case the person reading my comments hasn't seen the movie). David Koechner is sports anchor Champ Kind, who is just an exaggerated version of Koechner's usual characters: loud and obnoxious, usually Southern. He's all right, though he always seems to play the same person. Rudd (who I'd totally forgotten was even in the movie) is man-on-the-street Brian Fantana. Rudd's always great. Even in movie's I can barely stomach, Rudd is generally great. Fantana's the team's sexed-up self-proclaimed ladies' manin his mind anyway. And Steve Carell is weatherman Brick Tamland, a perfect opportunity to showcase Carell's talents for saying completely off-the-wall dialogue with an absolute straight face. Brick is""special""and Carell never fails to elicit laughs. It's no surprise that some of the most funniest bits are from Carell (""Yeah, there were horses and a man on fire. And I killed a guy with a trident.""). I've seen this movie a few times now and I'm enjoying more and more each time. Actually, thinking back on it now is making me want to watch it again. After avoiding the movie for so long, I've come to understand why ANCHORMAN is one of Ferrell's most popular movies. It's so dumb, it's funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fade to a point where it's just sad,"Very few laughs; sparse here and there, nothing substantial that can create any potential euphoric effect where you can just let yourself go. The only time I truly laugh was when Ferrell tries to convince Applegate that he wants to date her ""professionally"", but he has a huge erection at the same time. After that point, the movie is going down the drain and into the sewers.Will Ferrell is soooooo disappointing in this movie. Not that I ever expected much out of him, but after Elf and Old boy, there was some light at the end of the tunnel. He comes back with a pathetic performance in a miserable movie. This is as bad as ""A Night at the Roxbury"". Ferrell is just the new flavor of the day in the comedy business. He seems to be taking advantage of it and wants to cash on it. I guess it is economically defendable. But artistically, thanks for the warning... For Applegate, well, unfortunately, there isn't much to say about her career so far. She is equal to herself in this movie  enough said.It just makes me sad to think about the waste of time and resources put into this type of creation.

"Is it a bird, no, is it a plane, no, It's Will Ferrell coming to a cinema near you","I saw anchorman a day after i had seen dodgeball, which i also rate as being a very decent comedy, but for me anchorman was superior due to one thing, Will Ferrel he was perfect for this role as an up-himself anchorman in the 70's, he is the biggest thing to hit the comedic world for a long time. The outline of the plot is simple set in a 70's America (specifically san diego), it all revolves around sexism in that period. Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy an extremely popular anchorman on channel 4 news, he is accompanied by his crew of fellow anchors played by Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David koechner. But their lives and their jobs are flipped upside down by the arrival of a stunning blonde Veronica corningstone played by Christina Applegate, who dreams of someday becoming an anchor. This angers the news team as they believe that men are far superior to women, one quote for example being 'It's anchorMAN not anchorLADY'. Veronica adds competition to Ron's place as anchor and throughout the film they become competitors for a top anchor place at 'the network'. I felt that this was a very decent comedy and also felt that the cast seemed to seamlessly bounce off each other with great comedic value. This film confirms Ferrell to be one of the TOP comedians in this day and age, and also shows that Applegate is a fine actress and can and i hope will play many leading roles although my only qualm about this film was that i believe the script for Applegate did not display her acting talents to the full as it was not sufficient enough for example it was made out that it was 'her dream' to become an anchor yet it did not show that from the script. But nevertheless this film is great and i deeply recommend it as a insanely funny film full of cameos from talented comedians and actors for example the likes of Vince Vaughn, Ben stiller and Tim Robbins.

I thought it accurately depicted physical feelings while making love. The writing is quite good and I kept marveling at the imagination of the writers. For animal lovers, there are a few animals in this movie, and, yes, they will leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling. The only negative I have of this film was that Christina Applegate's make-up did not completely do her justice. The lipstick was too dark and shiny. Aside from that, the movie was great fun and kept me laughing throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Moose Hole - Review of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"Will Ferrell is boldly going where no Saturday Night Live! performer has gone in years  translated success from the small screen to the big screen! Not since Mike Myers made the move to feature films with Wayne's World has Hollywood seen such a comedic performer such as Will Ferrell. It isn't recent that Ferrell has been making appearances in feature films; in fact he made his feature film debut in the Mike Myers comedy, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997. Since then he has made feature roles and cameos in numerous comedies, none of which have made anything beyond a few million dollars of their production budgets. It wasn't until 2003 when Ferrell appeared in two surprise smash-hits, Old School and Elf, and decided to leave Saturday Night Live! Since then he has become of the most sought after comedic stars in Hollywood, receiving offers both left and right and there appears to be no sign of him slowing down anytime soon.As with most sketch comedy films, the story doesn't matter as much to the audience as the laughs are all that seem to matter but Anchorman at least attempts, unlike so many others, to the plot it starts off with. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy takes movie-goers back to the 1970s when Ron Burgundy was San Diego's top-rated news anchor and only men were allowed to read the news. But the times are changing and when an ambitious female reporter, Veronica Corningstone, comes to the Channel 4 newsroom, Ron's world begins to change and not to his liking. At first, Veronica is given 'female' oriented interest stories, like cat fashion shows, and is kept out the lime-light for the most part. But one day, Ron fails to show up to report the news on time and Veronica takes his place, only to receive her big break and become co-anchor. Things just continue to get worse the more Ron fights the fact that he is no longer San Diego's top anchorman. The story for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy may not be the most accurate representation of the era at the time but it does manage to touch on some issues, as in the rise of feminism, that were of importance in the 1970s, although the film does not take them as seriously as they were in real life. But bottom-line is that film plays for laughs and nothing presented in this film should be taken seriously, except perhaps the representation of news anchors that are often seen on the local news today.The cast of Anchorman consists of mainly of actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live!, whether they be current or former members, as well as several others that are well accustomed to sketch comedy of this nature. Will Ferrell, who proved to Hollywood that he was comedic driving force to be reckoned with thanks to his holiday smash-hit, Elf, owns the show as the title character, Ron Burgundy. This film proves to many that Ferrell is one of the best comedic minds in the business today as he is able to turn even the dumbest material into something funny  it may not be gut-busting but it doesn't come off as stupid as it should, which is all that matters to move the film along. Christina Applegate performs reasonably in the role of Veronica Corningstone, the female newswoman who threatens Ron Burgundy's news world. It wasn't that she doesn't work well in the film; there are severely scenes between her and Will Ferrell that are particularly funny. The problem is that most of the material given to her isn't as funny as it should be. Often she is too dependent on someone like Will Ferrell to help make the scene humorous and when it comes to a scene by herself, it doesn't have the same impact as the rest of the film. David Koechner's Champ Kind, the sports reporting cowboy, is one of the bigger disappointments and becomes a character that should have been entirely cut from the film as his material more trite and annoying then anything else. Steve Carell's Brick Tamland, the mentally retarded weatherman, is one of the biggest highlights of the film and, yes, there is a jab at the Bush administration with his character (what kind of Hollywood production would it be without one of those?) but other then that, he draws some of the biggest laughs of the film. And what would a comedy such as this be without celebrity cameos? Though many of the jokes of Anchorman don't live up to other comedies, this is one area where it probably rises above anything else in the past few years, including the opening segment of Austin Powers in Goldmember. Without giving away anything, pay attention to the street-fight sequence or you may miss someone.Overall, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is dumb, immature, and lacks the consistency and technique of vastly superior comedies of the past such of Austin Powers but in a summer severely lacking in anything remotely humorous, it does the job its meant to do, making us laugh, even if years from now it will be long forgotten. One of the film's main problems is that there isn't anything excessively amusing. There are certain parts of the film that are certainly humorous, most notably the street-fight sequence between the numerous news teams, but they are few and far between. For the most part Anchorman relies on monotonous toilet humor that becomes old and tired the more they use it. It doesn't get to the point where it makes the film intolerable but it gets graze the line a bit. Another problem wasn't what was seen but rather it was the material that wasn't shown in the comedy. Remember the film's trailer? Some of the trailer's more entertaining moments don't make into the film ('Well, I'm getting a divorce and I may never see my kids again'  'Fantastic!') but according to the film's director, he ended up with about four hours worth of material which may all end up on a special edition DVD when its released later this year. The point is, despite those minor complaints, Anchorman is a pure, dumb comedy that doesn't expect to be anything more then entertaining, even if it fails to be all that memorable. In a year that has certainly lacked its share of quality comedies, let alone decent ones, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is one class act and worth the price of admission this summer.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B)",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Oh... My... God...!!!,"(Disclaimer: I have no life, no living relatives and am offering this comment on 12/24/04 with little better to do)With ""Anchorman"" DreamWorks has officially cemented their move from the ""entertainment"" to the ""fertilizer"" industry. All appearances suggest the transition will be smooth and a rousing success.Anchorman offers nothing for your money that could not be bested by alternatively setting the currency on fire in exchange for heat. I recall a dump I took circa 197x that I would long to view rather than be subjected to another screening of Anchorman.Rarely, IMO, has a more promising concept been so disastrously executed.The script is atrocious, many performances seem hackneyed and forced and I'm sure the edit process would be found in violation of the Geneva Convention.Fred Willard is superb as the Station Manager providing the film's few highlights that surpass those of the animal actors.Applegate, while becoming more attractive as she matures, gives her professional all and outperforms her more seasoned cast members. Alas, she falls short of elevating this film to the ""barely viewable"" category.A cameo by Susan Sarandon's husband adds nothing other than the ""recognition"" response. Ben Stiller's adds only to the long list of mediocre films with which he's been affiliated.This project in the hands of Kevin Smith could have been an all-time classic. Instead, it falls far below the lame, seldom amusing Cheerleader skits Ferrell participated in on SNL.If a more obvious ""whore for dollars"" movie has ever been produced I am unaware of its existence. My only consolation is I paid zero dollars to screen this POS and wasted only my time, bandwidth and some space on my HD... which will soon be vacant.The IMDb rating system is limited to positive numbers and therefore it is impossible to rate this in terms of absolute negative... or I would.Any episode of The Simpsons offers more humor between commercials than this film does in its entirety.Don't miss this film... if you can't.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Big stupid fun.,"A sincerely funny movie. Lot's of great lines sure to be quoted from now until the end of history. Similar to the cult status Caddyshack has obtained. Sure for better or worse to be absorbed into lowbrow culture. Don't let that discourage you, this movie is quite funny and surprisingly warm hearted. Bobbing along with a happy-go-lucky feel allowing you to relax and laugh at the cast proceeds to unfurl a relentlessly long line of sight gags and one liners.Will Ferrell going big on every joke misses with a few but for the most part the supporting cast picks up all of the slack most notably Steven Carell. I saw this film in Chicago in a preview and went in expecting zilch and even almost left before it started due to the annoying frat-like crowd but I left thinking I had just viewed one of the most funny films in years. Big, loud, stupid and amazingly fun. This one should definitely go on the shelf with the great comedies of our time.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious and non-stop funny! I laughed until I was hoarse!!,"How rare it is when we get a comedy like this. I actually did not see Anchorman in the theaters, passing it by, thinking it was just one of those stupid crude, anti-women movies that focus all on sexual humor. Well two years later my friend sat me down in front of the TV on a rainy afternoon and we watched Anchorman on HBO. I was immensely surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It's that type of humor you have to understand to like--humor you find in movies such as Nacho Libre and Dumb and Dumber. You have to sit down and watch it with a complete open mind, because if you're expecting some genius great comedy movie, prepare yourself for a huge disappointment. I wasn't expecting a great comedy movie, and the humor is that stupid humor that makes you laugh harder than a solid, real comedy film. The acting is both great and hilarious with a side-splitting hysterical role by Steve Carell and smart, classy roles by Ferrell and Applegate. It even features a hell of a lot of celebrity cameos, including Jack Black and Luke Wilson. And the best part about this movie? It gets FUNNIER AND FUNNIER every time you see it, until the point where you helplessly burst out laughing when you see the DVD on a shelf in Blockbuster. And then there's no turning back. You're officially owned by the Channel 4 News Team now.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If you don't think this is the best movie of all times.... I will fight you.,"This movie is brilliant and goes to show that comedy is alive and well. Will is slowly becoming my favorite actor. Anchorman sets a new standard of silliness with a serious approach. It explores office relationships, love of animals, gender differences and ambitions and even touches tackles the tough subject of mental retardation. I was particularly impressed with Steve Carrel's performance as Brick. His portrayal of a weatherman who was mentally retarded was the perfect addition to an already hilarious news team. Channel 4 would not have been what it was without him. I'm not a movie critic, but I am a man with a large brain and I say this movie will start a cult following. It's science.....",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
great comedic piece,"thought that this was one of the funniest movies i have seen recently. I don't know that its the funniest because that says a lot, but if i was to try to count the times i cracked up so hard i missed the next set of lines, i would be here all day. WIthout a doubt will's best work, and that says a lot because old school is amazing. However, he is not even the funniest character and that is the great part. I mean the retarded weatherman and the scene where he is trying to explain love is ridiculous, and he makes the film in every scene he is in. And the cameos are awesome. Jack Black punting the dog, and Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, vince Vaughn, and Ben stiller as competing newscasters and their west side story style brawl is just great.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the Funniest Movies I've Ever Seen!,"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy.Easily put into my list of top 5 movies, Anchorman is very very funny. If you like movies like Zoolander and Dodgeball, you'll probably love this. The difference between Zoolander and Anchorman is ""smart comedy."" Zoolander is ""smart comedy"" while Anchorman...is not. Zoolander was meant to be a satire on male modeling, and they pulled it off very well. Anchorman, equally, if not more, funny, was meant to make people laugh because...they're so stupid. I love it. anyway, go out and buy this one, and Zoolander, and Dodgeball for that matter, in fact, buy any movie with Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, or Jack Black in it!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious low brow movie- Steve Carell steals the show,"Anchorman seems a lot like a bunch of sketch comedies thrown together, which makes sense because it's written by SNL alumni.  As long as you're willing to forget this things are great.  Will Ferrell and Stever Carell make the movie.  Much of what they do is improv (as you see from the unchosen clips shown at the end of the movie), and they pull it off flawlessly.  In fact, the parts that are clearly improv (the prank calls and the insults) are funnier than the rest of the movie.  This movie is also full of great cameos, such as Jack Black (in a few seconds of footage dog lovers won't forget), Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller, and, believe it or not, Tim Robbins.  I highly reccommend this one.",,Anonymous,Comedy

I don't know how these guys managed to keep a straight face through some of these scenes.A definite see if you want to be put in a good mood.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny but designed to show why sexist attitudes are wrong,Ron Burgundy is a hilarious comedy that features many stupid and/or sexist jokes. Will Ferell is brilliant as a newscaster who refuses to view women as people who are capable of all the same things in the workplace as men. And it is a really funny movie. But this is also what makes it intelligent because it is a movie about how stupid such sexist attitudes are. The dated setting of the 1980s which is so different for our digital age further accentuates the message that these attitudes are not appropriate in modern society. It is out of place that Ron makes sexist jokes while dressing and viewing himself as a gentleman. Putting these types of men in immature or medieval situations drives the point that mature people should not espouse a mindset that women are not capable of the same things as men. The film strives to show us that being divided in the workplace leads to far less success than if we all work together and respect that everyone has the same dreams and aspirations of personal success.,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Save your money...,"I rented this movie and had to turn it off after 30 minutes. Unless you enjoyed watching the news 20+ years ago, then maybe this is a good movie for you. I have seen Elf and Old School and I thought Will Farrell was very funny in both, but this one was not anywhere close to being as funny. This movie sort of reminds me of WKRP in Cincinnati...The movie version. It was very easy to convince my girlfriend to turn the movie off and she is more of a movie nut then myself. If you decide to rent this one and feel the same way as I do, then I would suggest that you tell the movie rental store that you were given this movie in error instead of the movie (""Insert movie title here"") you originally wanted.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
good for teevee nuts,"Although Anchorman is a comedy, the premise is true- the first woman anchor trying to make her mark in a field dominated by men. Ferrell got the idea after hearing the story of Jessica Savitch, a blonde female anchor who went through the same issues (albeit with less humor) in the '70's. For those who have seen clips of Savitch, occasionally Christina Applegate looks almost exactly like her in certain parts of the movie. That's surely intentional. This is fascinating for those who know their history of television news. For those who don't, they could care less. Nevertheless, funny and worth a look, although the best gags have been played over and over in the trailers. A rental absolutely, for teevee nuts worth a theatre visit and a DVD purchase (rumoured several hours of outtakes, when it does happen.) Thank you, and stay classy.",,Anonymous,Comedy
There is NOTHING wrong with this movie.,"I enjoyed this movie OK. I really liked it, because it's so pointless and silly. Those kind of movies are the best. I'm reading a large majority of the comment's and people are negatively critiquing it as if it's supposed to be a real movie. It's not a real movie. It's not a great movie. It's not a thought provoking, groundbreaking masterpiece. It's a comedy people. It's a pointless, meaningless, ridiculously absurd comedy and I love it. It's not as if the director and the cast were actually aiming to win any award when making this film and don't tell me they were. Sure they wanted to make money, but all in all, it was just something that they had a really, really good time doing and you can see it. They are having lots of fun doing this film, and that rubs off on the viewer, making the comedy ten times sweeter. Since when have people became so freaking anal about movie comedy's??? ""But it didn't make me laugh, it was boring, blah blah blah"". OK, these are obviously people that have a very, very, UNBELIEVABLY DULL sense of humor. I actually feel very sorry for you. It must be because you either hate Will Ferrell, or you are old fashioned, and either way very dull and boring yourselves, so watching a comedy like this goes past your head.

Worst movie I have ever seen.,"I saw this movie thinking it was going to be laugh out loud funny. But it was awful. None of the jokes were funny and all of them were sick and nasty. I had to stop the film after 30 minutes because I hated it so much. Watching those male news reporters making fun of the female reporter was just wrong. None of the jokes had any catch or irony to them like Dodgeball. Epic Movie was better then this one, and thats saying something. If all you like is sick and sexual jokes, this is the perfect movie for you. But I don't. These sexual jokes are just wrong and just outright stupid.

you have a problem!,"this movie was hilarious from top to bottom the only time i felt uneasy about any of the scenes were the ones where the baby said something and the little girl said something to him. The cameos were good but no where near the best part of the film. Just because you try to psycho analyze a picture you think you sound smart but movies like this aren't meant to be over analyzed. Hell comedies unless dark or black aren't meant to be analyzed. most comedies especially this kind a slapstick comedy are quick short snappy bits that make you laugh they throw it in your face if its not funny you don't laugh. You said everyone else laughed, so why didn't you, I know why because your a tight a$$. Your probably the kind of person who found White Chicks hilarious. If you think your some kind of expert critic just look at what ebert and ropper gave it let me just say they gave it two thumbs up.

Very Funny,"I didn't like Will Ferrel very much 'till I saw this film. I saw it by accident, since there was nothing else to watch.Since this film I became a great fan of Will Ferrel. He is amazing in this film. In the movie his character is so innocently dumb (much more than in the other movies that he had ever done), which makes his best movie (at least 'till now).But there is another thing that makes the movie funny. Ron's crew. Particularly Brick(played by Steve Carrel). If you think Ron is dumb you should see Brick. I believe that the funniest scenes in the movie are played by Carrel. He is hilarious.I must say that it has not the greatest plot. It is not a movie that will touch you. It is a comedy and will makes you laugh. I mean, will makes laugh your ass off.I have seen it more than 8 times and can't get enough of its jokes!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Well executed comedy,"I feel that the review that's posted on the first page for this film is completely unfounded as the reviewer suddenly perceives to know how and why the strangers around him were laughing (saying it was contrived laughter).I found the film to be a laugh riot. As usual, Ferrell delivers the laughs without holding punches. This is a man who never thinks twice about how ridiculous he might look when delivering the funny.What could have been a boring premise in the hands of another director and cast became a hilarious playing ground for the well seasoned talent in this film. Cameo upon cameo peppers the film with unforgettable performances and no doubt, this film will soon become a cult classic like Office Space before it.This film just shows what we have always known - critics can never agree on what's funny. You can agree about a drama being poorly written or a science fiction film not filling in the plot holes, but comedy is such that not everyone is going to find the same thing funny. No one can truly tell an audience what is or isn't funny because comedy is a personal thing. And this film certainly proved to be funny for me and everyone who I attended the showing with.If Will keeps up this kind of work, he will survive long after those around him have perished.

Feral Ferrel comedy,"Firstly I am no will ferrel fan, but I am seriously getting tired of hearing about this particular movie. I saw this once in the theater (sadly) when it first came out, I don't remember laughing much. But all over the net everyone seems to quote this movie, that and I got the feeling it must be some kinda cult movie thing that only hipsters like. So it was on TV and I decided to watch some it. WOW. its terrible. its not funny. its no different then any other stupid will ferrel comedy, which means its basically ferrel screaming and acting stupid, more screaming, over reacting that wasn't very funny at all in the first place. I couldn't stand him on SNL, and I cant stand him now. he is NOT a ""comedic genius"" in the same way andy kaufmen is not. both were known for being really stupid and there was not even a whiff of intelligence in there comedy. Now, think about some truly great comedic actors, like Bill Murray. That guy is hilarious no matter WHAT he does. Yes, bill was also guilty of acting like an idiot but that was VERY early in his career and even when he WAS acting stupid, he was still 100% more funny and fun to watch then anything will Ferrell has ever done. Bill Murray is great because he can be funny but then be emotional and someone you feel for. He can be funny one minute and serious the next. Scrooged is a perfect example. Ferrell clearly does not have that kind of range as an actor, and if THIS crap is supposed to be for Ferrell what Groundhog day is to bill Murray, then I must concur with the other poster who said this is the Death of Good Comedy. somewhere in the 2000's comedy got painfully unfunny with VERY few exceptions. What's interesting is that I watched the first 2 teenage mutant ninja turtle movies from the 90's with my Girlfriend recently (having never seen them before) and almost busted my ribs laughing at some of the stuff in those movies. yet an actual ""comedy"" like this made me laugh not even once, instead it only made me think ""well THAT was gross"" and ""ew, people really find this crap funny? Have peoples standards gotten this low?"".

Finally - Will Ferrell's potential realized,"Will Ferrell has been building up to this role his entire career, no other film has he had 100% of the spotlight. Here he is backed up by a great group of supporting characters, but it is his character that shines through. Granted Christina Applegate is not the greatest of comedic actresses but she has to work hard to compete with Will Ferrell's ferocious comic timing and delivery. Everyline in this movie will make you laugh, some a bit, most a lot. The fact that another movie (wake up, Ron Burgandy) has been cut together out the additional footage shot shows how many ideas are used here. Granted the storyline itself is about as heavy as a really small feather but this is almost a blessing as the characters make the most of each situation and really blossom when very little is really happening.I love this movie and you should to.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This movie is a pure comedy- it's sole purpose in life is to make people laugh, and the entire theater was near tears with laughter. Critics may do what they do best, and overlook some of the more fantastical scenes, and mock the violence which is used wonderfully to make one of the funniest scenes in the movie, but this is what you would call a must see. There's even little stuff to pick up on, even a West Side Story reference if you can catch it.

Avoid at all costs,"This movie is utterly pathetic. To call it a comedy is an insult comedies.

Every time the audience laughed which wasn't often we would look at each other and wonder why. The 70's outfits and sets were mildly humorous for the first 2 minutes but that's it. The acting was terrible, Christina Applehead's performance is worth of a Razzy award. Had the acting been over-the top (like Ben Stiller in everything lately) the movie could have been funny. I like Will Ferrell too. Elf, and Old School and SNL were really because of him, but this one was just too bad to be saved. And what happened to Tim Robbins? Didn't he win an Acadamy Award? How did he get sucked into this S**t-bomb? I guess that's what happens when you forget you're an actor and start thinking you're a politician.

My 9 Year Old Could Write Better Than This,"I'm sorry if I offend anyone with this review, but your mentality will be offended if you watch it. I like comedy movies as much as the next guy, but the ad hype for this movie is overkill for the quality of the film itself. It is very poorly written with little or no true comedy. I don't even think I smiled while watching this film. The main character Ron Burgundy's makeup must have been done by a member of the hair club for men. The supporting cast includes several look-alikes including a Sonny Bono, J.R. Ewing, and Rainman. The story line was poor with no objectives, and the humour dry and old. The cameo appearances of several other comedians were also written into the film just as poorly as the main theme. Out of a scale of 1 to 10, it doesn't make a 0.5. Don't waste your money on a ticket. It probably won't even make the rental shelves or as a premier on TV.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Anchorman Review,"Anchorman is a film co-written and directed by Adam McKay. This film just happen to come on my radar and I decided just to give it a shot. And at the end, I can say that this film was an enjoyable ride.Plot: The KVWM channel hires a female news reporter much to everyone's dismay.Story and direction: This is mostly a spoof on the news channels during the 70's. Although taking place during that era, mist of it is still applicable in today's world and the case is just not only for news. It is for any field of work. The title of the film is like that of a superhero, considering the films is about news anchors. I remember laughing throughout the entire film with no rest. I liked the way issues like sexual harassment, looking down upon women employees, etc.. were handled with comedy in this film. The film doesn't go below the belt, which is commendable. Also the characters have so much diversity, that you instantly fall in love with them. The 1970's was also beautifully depicted by the production design and costume team. A salute from my side to Will Ferrell and Adam McKay for succesfully introducing us to this world of Anchormen and Anchorwomen. My only issue with this film would be that sometimes the film goes over-the-top and the climax tended to cross the boundaries of reality.Performances: Will Ferrell deserves a standing ovation. He was born to do the role of Ron Burgundy. Christina Applegate was also perfect as a choice for Veronica. Paul Rudd and David Koechner were also excellent in their role. A special mention to Steve Carrell. This man is so talented!!!! Vince Vaughn was also great as the rival channel reporters. It's always a treat to see Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Seth Rogen. Although they had nothing much substantial to do, they were good in what was given to them.Favorite Scene: It would be the fight sequence between all the channels taking place and Burgundy keeping a condition that no harm must be caused to the face and hair (considering how important are those for any person appearing in the entertainment media). I laughed so much during that fight.Verdict: Although over-the-top at times, Anchorman still is quite an entertaining film. I assure you that you won't be bored. If you want to watch something light, you can watch it. It's worth your time.I am going with an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
How can you not love this movie???,"Will Ferrell in my mind is the new face of comedy. With his ""out there"" style and non stop, joke a minute attitude, he can make anyone of any age give a chuckle. This movie is one of the funniest movies ever and should be ranked up there with Dumb and Dumber and Duck Soup.The setting in Sand Diego during the 1970's is perfect for Ferrell so he can flaunt a perfectly trimmed mustache and burgundy suit. He is out there and loving every minute of it.Along with Ferrell is his News Team consisting of Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, and David Koechner. Individually you have funny, but together, the five create comedy that is so funny you just might wet your pants!With Christina Applegate as the rival female reporter/Ron's lover, there is a plot going on, but it is overtaken by the endless lines dished out from this team of jokesters.Of course, where there is Will Ferrell, there are his friends. Cameo's by Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, and even Tim Robbins make up the rivalry news teams.It's hard to miss with a Will Ferrell movie, although I saw this movie opening week, it still brings me to tears when Ron Burgundy warms up for the evening news...",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Legend!,"Undisputably the most worthwhile comedy of the past 10 years. Will Ferrell is in top form and as Ron Burgundy has created a character at whom you can only laugh explosively! The film is full of brilliant one liners and wacky off-the-wall scenes, as the San Diego news team headed by Ron Burgendy fight for the affections of the newest female addition to the station. But the storyline is almost irrelevant, as it is the characters and the creative script that will have you fighting for your breath as the laughs come fast and furious. The film gets better and better every time you watch it. Really hope that a sequel is not in the pipeline, as the film cannot possibly be topped.

Dumb and overrated,"Whereas Will Ferell can be funny at times, he completely misses the point in this absolutely below average comedy. Even the cameo appearances of respected actors like Tim Robbins or Ben Stiller cannot change what this movie really is: a dumb waste of time and a surprising lack of funny moments for a comedy.The idea is that Ron Burgandy (Will Ferell), an ego-maniac who thinks he is a gift to all women, gets competition as the anchorman of a San Diego local news station. The competition is his lover, the charming Christina Applegate. Of course this starts a ""hilarious"" sequence of events.To be honest, I do not even want to write a review for this movie. I cannot understand why some (even expert websites) call this a defining comedy or an instant classic. The only person out of the three cronies that Will Ferell hangs out with, who is even remotely funny is Steve Carell who plays the total, but sweet idiot Brick.This movie is not funny, so dumb that it borders on offensive and just a complete waste of time. I would even recommend watching an action movie instead of this one...which means a lot as I hate action movies...!",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My kind of comedy!,"I like more mature comedies a lot! ""About Schmidt"", ""Punch-Drunk Love"", ""The Player"" etc etc etc But as much as I want to be a 'snob' film viewer but at the end of the day (cliche!) I keep coming back to the Ace Ventura's the Zoolander's and the ANCHORMAN's of the cinema world!And why the hell not!?!?!?! This is just a really funny film to watch. Will Ferrell some how survived the comedy horror performances in ""A Night at the Roxbury"" and poor (admit it) cameos in ""The Ladies Man"" and the Austin Powers movies to a film career that the likes ""Old School"", ""Elf"" and now ""Anchorman"" has seen him become the biggest graduate of Saturday Night Live since Adam Sandler and Mike Myers.The support cast in ""Anchorman"" are great with a good performance by Applegate and Burgundy's team of Rudd, Carell & Koechner are hilarious along with the great Fred Willard (Best in Show, A Mighty Wind)But for me this film was made great because the legendary Tim Robbins & Vince Vaughn turned up along with the equally legendary Ben Stiller and friend of them all Luke Wilson!

This movie made no sense whatsoever, but it's hilarity made up for it easily. I completely lost it during Jack Black's cameo. I don't want to give anything away, but I HIGHLY recommend that everyone see this hilarious comedy. I'm definitely going to watch it many many more times. The icing on the cake was the dumb reporter. I know I personally have a weird sense of humor and that may be why that character cracked me up so much. I mean, he said things that had nothing to do with the dialogue at all.

Ferrell's best to date,"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is the exactly what its title states. It is the legend of Ron Burgundy. Set in 70's San Diego, Ron (Will Ferrell) is the lead anchor of Channel 4's news station. Ron's life is one of fame and enjoyment along with his news team, the oddest people you'll meet. But Ron's life is about to change when a female reporter comes aboard by the name of Vernoica Corningstone (Christina Applegate).She becomes the love of Ron's life until she becomes co-anchor with him and soon they are arch-rivals. Ron's life is turned upside down as the story of his life nears. The story pretty much just follows the meeting and aftermath of Ron and Veronica. Their isn't exactly a plot, but it doesn't need one. It's a comedy!Ferrell fits right in another role where all he has to do is act stupid. However, Ferrell doesn't make you believe he is acting stupid, actually he's probably the smartest of the news team. As for the news team, they make the movie. With up-and-coming comedian Steve Carell as Brick the weatherman, Raul Rudd as the the reporter in the field, and David Koechner as our sportsman who can't keep his hands of a fine woman, how could you go wrong?While Rudd, Ferrell, and Koechner are hilarious, Steve Carell proves again he is one of the best comedians in Hollywood. His role as the retard (please don't take offense to that) weatherman with every scene involving him making no sense and every line, funnier then the last, he just keeps the laughs coming.Christina Applegate's role is not meant to be a fantastic role and isn't meant to bring many laughs but she does set up quite a few. The fight scene between her and Ron is one of the best scenes in the movie. She doesn't try to act scornful even though she comes off as it and Applegate doesn't overact once. Her lines are delivered perfectly and adds a little something to look at.Anchorman is the best comedy of '04 and Ferrell's best. He is finely given a good script of laughs instead of a family oriented, watered down , comedy film. It's crude at times but brings a smile to your face more than once and keeps you laughing the second and third viewing.Anchorman: The Legend of ROn Burgundy. Starring: Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, and David Koechner.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
By far the worst movie I have ever seen,"I tried to watch this movie two times. Once with my girlfriend, and then again when I was all alone (just to see if it was any better when I wasn't being ). This movie is the only movie I have bought that I didn't finish. I could not watch it all. It is the biggest piece of s**t I have ever seen.

"Plenty of fun, but wait for rental","All of you know about this movie. That's right, I went to see a Will Ferrell movie on the big screen. Now I'm never much for seeing comedies in the theaters because usually they're just as good at home on your TV. This one is no different, but I had good company and it was fun to watch. The movie surrounds a news anchorman named Ron Burgundy and he's a typical ""I love myself and you should two"" kinda guy from before the days of sexual harassment suits. What made this movie was not so much Will Ferrell, but his interactions with everyone else. The movie plays like a very long SNL skit, but a somewhat decent one (in other words, kinda like SNL of oh...5 years ago). I laughed frequently and almost died from choking on some Sprite that went down the wrong pipe as they say. So if you're going to see this movie and Jack Black is on the screen, do not take a sip of your soda. Before I give my rating of this movie, let me tell you some of the comedies I feel are better than this movie and what rating I would give them. Monty Python and the Holy Grail - 4 stars, Spaceballs - 4 stars, Young Frankenstein (no this is not a horror film you idiots who do reviews on IMDb) - 3 stars, UHF - 3 stars, Dumb and Dumber - 4 stars, South Park Movie - 3 stars, Animal House - 3 1/2 stars, Zoolander - 3 stars, Austin Powers 1&2 (not 3) - 3 stars. As far as comedies go, I enjoyed all of the above more than Anchorman, but it does beat out anything in the American Pie Trilogy, and upon thinking about it further, I think I liked it more than ""Old School"" and ""Elf."" I'm giving this movie 2 1/2 stars which is a decent review coming from me. My suggestion would be to wait until it's on video and then see it. I bet it'd be a lot funnier with a few drinks in your belly. Perhaps Scotch?",,Anonymous,Comedy
A Comedic Classic...To Some Of Us,"You get it, or you don't, or you do and just don't relate anyway. Whatever the case may be, this sort of random, senseless comedy is a sub genre of comedic films that is just as often praised as it is ridiculed.I find myself praising it more often than not, and particularly so when Will Ferrell is involved. The man is, quite simply, as adept at this style of comedy as anyone ever has been, and his strong and silly performance, alongside a terrific supporting cast, have made Anchorman a classic in my mind. It has provided me and my friends more quotable lines and good times than any other Ferrell flick, and we typically enjoy them all. The upcoming sequel seems to me, at least, to be Ferrell's way of doing justice to what he believes to be his finest film.Just as important to making the film work is the rest of the Channel 5 News Team. Brick, Champ and Brian are pivotal in playing off of each other, taking advantage of somewhat predictable quirks and eccentricities with skill. Paul Rudd quickly became a comedy/dramatic comedy staple at the box office, and his work here, alongside Steve Carrell's slow-but-sweet portrayal of weatherman Brick Tamlan and the underrated Champ Kind (played by the also underrated David Koechner) round out the film, give it an identity with memorable characters and classic scenes.The rest of the cast is stand-up as well, including Alicia Silverstone, who holds up strong as Ferrell's counterpart and vying anchorwoman Veronica Corningstone. It all comes together quite nicely cast-wise, and the writing..well, the writing is the best you're going to find in a quote/unquote ""silly"" comedy, where the story is just a foundation for the ridiculousness to flow off of.Honestly, I can understand the strong disagreement when I say so, but in my mind, Anchorman is without a doubt one of the finest comedic films ever created. It is, much like Mr. Burgundy himself, the balls",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Will Ferrell is brilliant!,This movie shows why Will Ferrell gets the attention he deserves. It was hilarious. Paul Rudd pulls off a funny performance showing his comedic acting well established in Wet Hot American Summer. I loved this movie and will continue to look for more films with Will Ferrell. The list of cameos in here adds to the overall enjoyment level of the film. Vince Vaughn continues to impress me the more I see him in comedies. Some of the scenes are a little hokey like the dream/sex sequence. Steve Carrell is great. Chris Parnell is great in a supporting role. Fred Willard continues to answer the bill in no matter what role he is asked to play. I loved this film and would recommend it to anyone!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't waste your money!!,"God! I must be in the minority over here. I thought the movie was down right awful. All i could do was sit there and shake my head. Wondering why i spent the money to see a piece of crap like that. I guess i must have left my ""funny bone"" at home. I've come to the conclusion that type of movie is not my cup of tea. YUCK! What a waste of money that was. The only good thing that came out of it was we got free popcorn with the ticket. This was no more then a long Sat Night Live skit. I realize that this movie is a spoof on the 70's newsroom, but the characters were so stupid that it made it hard to really have a good laugh. I was so bored that i kept looking at Will Ferrell's bottom teeth which were crooked. Guess i'll have to learn not to go by the critics. It amazes me that this movie got good reviews across the board. That said i really like Will F. Just not in this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Disappointing but not awful -- has its moments but not funny enough for the running time,"Okay, so I thought this was going to be at least good enough to watch, considering how it had lots of good reviews. The trailer meant the movie looked alright to watch due to the mood (I didn't think anything was particularly funny in the trailer, though). However, it was not that good. The characters say lots of phrases and get into lots of situations, but they frequently felt kind of rushed and forced. Most importantly, a lot of those weren't that funny, some due to falling flat, but simply due to not being funny. There WERE occasional, much funnier responses, phrases, or situations, such as when Ron says something is an optical illusion, but that may probably be the only hilarious part of the movie. There are others that were reasonably funny, but there weren't enough of them.The reason I'm not being too harsh on the review is that the movie wasn't awful. It really wasn't. It was just disappointing, and probably not worth watching, except for a few funny scenes. The occasional funny jokes, as well as the characters saved this movie from being any worse, but they didn't make it great.Pros:Some funny jokesGood character developmentSlightly funny for many partsCons:Most of the jokes weren't that funny and felt really forcedThe jokes frequently fell flat, worsening the quality of the jokesOverall, I rate this a 5. This had me grinning a fair amount of the movie but not actually laughing. But some jokes had me laughing. Just some. But not that enjoyable.It has its moments, but for a movie with all these cameos and stars, it should be much funnier. The jokes may be consistent, but I felt they were generally very slightly funny. However, I felt that they weren't funny enough to make the movie worth watching, as they only had me grinning, and I forced myself to laugh most of the time. There were some LOL moments, though (but only 1 or 2).It had its moments, but it was overall disappointing and not worth my time. 4",,Anonymous,Comedy
Stupid comedy doesn't get much better than this,"With Anchorman 2 merely weeks away from hitting our cinema screens it felt apt to revisit the movie that launched directing/actor duo Adam McKay and Will Ferrell into the comedy stratosphere and made there madcap antics of improvisation and lunacy a member of everyday culture. Its good to report then like a good news anchor would that despite being almost ten years since we first meet Ron Burgundy and the channel 4 news team Anchorman has lost none of its original charm.Anchorman's long lasting success falls largely upon the perfect casting of all involved with Will Ferrel still yet to top his creation here whilst Paul Rudd, David Koechner and the ever lovable character of Brick as played to perfection by Steve Carell are all on arguably career best form. These central 4 actors have a chemistry on screen that makes dialogue and situations in the film fire from random sing-alongs (Afffffffffffffternoon delight), meetings with rival news teams (""Where'd you get your clothes, the toilet shop?"") or seriously vicious news team wars (""That escalated quickly""). The 4 actors are ably supported by token female Christina Applegate and a raft of cameos with highlights being Jack Black and Tim Robbins.It's a testament to not only the actors who carry the antics of the movie on their shoulders but that of director McKay who has the unenviable task of editing a film such as this down to 90 minutes where there are no doubt hours upon hours of comic gold recorded that had to be cut out completely. McKay and Ferrell proved also that there comedic genius was not a once off with success realised in there later teaming namely Talladega Nights and The Other Guys.Anchorman is a film that by now has seeped well and truly into pop culture from its dialogue through to its branding. Hopes are high for the sequel and one suspects that if everyone is on as good a form as displayed in this original dose of insanity we are in for a pre-Xmas treat when the news team returns.4 lamps out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Better than Dodgeball!,"Okay, first off this is Will Ferrels greatest movie, and may perhaps stay that way, and the reason is EVERYTHING! From the completely stupid one liners, to the hysterical references that come thick and fast, indeed even the outstanding cameos. Nearly everything about this film is perfect if you're just looking for a title to relax with, maybe share a glass of scotch with... It isn't the most profound movie in the world, and it certainly isn't ""clever"" but let's face it, it's a movie where Will Ferrel is a sex god and anchormen rein supreme - it's not taking itself seriously so why should you? Of course this movie couldn't survive with just Will Ferrel goofing off and not being supported by some quality talent (as is shown by his many other movies, yes i'm looking at you Kicking and Screaming!) This is where his News Team, Brian Fantana, Brick Tamland and Champ Kind come in, and for the most part they do their jobs fantastically, with Brick often being the scene stealer of the movie, and possibly the most quotable man in history. And that's where this films magic really lies, in the way you and your friends can quote it for hours, whether it's one of Ferrels outbursts, or one of Bricks stupid one liners, it can have you rolling in stitches months after you've seen it, this gives the movie serious sticking power and always makes you go back for more, on that note I've just heard the DVD start up again, I'm off, you stay classy IMDb.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Worst movie ever, well almost.","Doesn't even qualify as a bad SNL sketch because you only have to sit through about 5 minutes of a bad sketch. However, in this case, you have to sit through 2 hours of waiting for a punchline or even a funny moment. I'm a big Ferrell fan, but, this is way off the mark and could of spent those 2 hours on a better movie. The character of Ron Burgundy is poorly developed and his rival/love interest of Christina Applegate is played as well as possible given the material she has to work with. Cameos by Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and others can't save this dying movie. I really feel misled by so many of the people who interview the actors for this film and not a one of them confronted any of the actors on the poorly written script.

Short and Quick Review!!!,"Anchorman: Legend of Ron Burgundy was a mildly funny movie. It was stupid, but it had its moments. For example, there was that one scene with the mentally retarded guy at the news station screaming ""I don't know what we are yelling about!"" However, most of the humor is gross and vulgar and has unnecessary reference to body parts.I suppose it's all a matter of tase. Many will find it hilarious. Others will not. I thought it seemed pretty stupid, but that's just me. There are plenty of people who will crack up at it.Yes it is stupid and silly, yet it is also funny at some parts. However, most of the humor seems to be stupid phrases in the scenes. Oh well, it's a cult movie, and certain people will find it funny, while many others won't, just like Army of Darkness and Napoleon Dynamite.3 out of 5Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Nights of Columbus!,"The Legend of Ron Burgandy, Anchorman examines the life of a popular news anchor in 1970's San Diego. He has the bad hair, the cheesy mustache and everything else that makes a man popular, even if he doesn't have a clue about what journalism is. When a beautiful woman (Christina Applegate) who actually has an intellect shows up at the station, Ron is at first intrigued - that is until he finds out that she will be co-anchoring with him. In a society and industry where men rule, there is not enough room for the both of them, and while they are both romantically interested in one another, it is going to be war... Very little can be said in this review to change someone's mind as whether to see Anchorman or not; the first time the previews played, most people decided right then and there. Ferrell has a big following of fans who find him to be one of the funniest men alive, and then there are those that see him as only the next successor of the SNL comedians, who have the tendency to make their mark for a few years and then fade off. Anchorman is a movie for those that enjoy silly humor; anyone who doesn't should probably just stop reading this review right now. Anchorman is funny from beginning to end, mainly thanks to Ferrell's skillful need to be zany at all moments of filming. Ferrell is so good at turning even the worst material into something witty that there is really no point in analyzing the script; the only thing that can be said is that the script obviously gave Ferrell and the rest of the cast free range to work their magic, and also throws in some jabs at the television journalism. For instance, for the entire movie all of the news stations are clambering over the story of a pregnant panda at the zoo, labeling it as ""the story of the decade."" Funny enough, this isn't too far from the truth as local news tends to put a huge emphasis on unimportant animal stories. By the way, Steve Carrell as Brick is also quite hilarious. The movie succeeds by always being goofy and never taking itself seriously; it never stops to take a breath so I loved it! Nathan Cali",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Something strange seems to have happened?,"I am slightly confused! Having seen the score given to Anchorman (a mid 6 is creditable, but not great) and the mixed reviews this film has received, I can only come to one conclusion. Half of the reviewers watched the same 'Anchorman: the legend of Ron Burgundy' as I did, the others must have watched the little known TV movie 'Anchorman: the legend of Roy Bogard' featuring the little known comic talent Wally Farrell. Yes, that is truly the only explanation as to why some of you did not enjoy this movie.Ferrel is magnificent- hilarious in almost every quip and a truly likable, if flawed, character. Christina Applegate does a good job as well, but its Steve Carrel who really puts the icing on the cake. His understated performance as the imbecilic Brick Tamland is genius (eg 'loud noises', 'toilet store, I love carpet, hand grenade moment, trident, etc, etc) The early Pink Panther movies, Naked Gun and some of Sandler's finest moments may challenge this title, but at the moment having just watched 'Anchorman' twice this weekend, I've got to say that presently I'd rate this as the funniest movie ever.Doubters: Check the box before you rent.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

You oughtta laugh,"I've talked to many friends who had very different opinions on this movie: some went expecting ""Frank the Tank"" with different makeup, some expected more sophistication. In a sense they got both, sometimes though not enough to their satisfaction. While I can't be completely objective with this film (I enjoy Will Ferrell's work WAY too much), I can say that it is enjoyable. While Ferrell's character has a bigger vocabulary than some of his previous characters, Burgundy's depth as a person runs about as deep as a mud puddle.The pathetic chauvinism and intellectual inferiority coupled with a completely misplaced sense of importance are a riot! The one thing I did find to be missing in this film was a straight-man/woman/character, and unfortunately it does bring down the comedy. With every character being an over-exaggerated caricature, there is no sense of reality to ground the comedy and make it even funnier. While the ""Old School"" wives (despite their unfortunate fellatio class) were pretty believable as real people, no one in ""Anchorman"" provides that grounding that adds to the comedy. As many great speech and sight gags as there are (particularly from Steve Carell, who arguably is the big star here), you should find plenty to belly-laugh at without losing your self-respect.

"no plot, but some funny scenes","The one big complaint about Anchorman is it had no plot. It was about this big shot tv newsman, Ron Burgandy, and how he has to deal with the introduction of a female reporter, Veronica, who also wants to be a news anchor.  So, we get a lot of sexist jokes since it takes place in the 70s. The movie felt like a bunch of short skits thrown together. Ron dates Veronica and announces it to the office. Very funny. He also with a coworker makes prank phone calls to her. He has his news buddies, which form a funny and unusual group. One guy says things that are off the wall and have nothing to do with the conversation.  It had some funny cameos, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller.  There was one disturbing scene in which the audience actually gasped and that was when Jack Black kicks a dog over a bridge. That was terrible. But, the dog lived and came back to negotiate with a bear. Don't even ask if you haven't seen the film.It had one very funny and uncomfortable scene when Ron is talking to Veronica and gets ""very excited"" at the office.  Ron and his buddies sing Afternoon Delight; it was just funny how they did it.  I along with the people I was with laughed a lot.  And throughout the film, they let us know Ron will read whatever is on the telepromtor, so you know that will lead to a good joke. Veronica writes something which gives this pg-13 film it's one ""f"" word. And it was very funny.  There are many other scenes which made me laugh, I just wish more thought had been put into coming up with a delima for the characters to overcome.FINAL VERDICT: I found it to be funny, so I recommend it. But, it certainly is not a great movie because there is no plot. If you like Will Ferrell, definitely see it.",,Anonymous,Comedy

(Unlike the Adam Sandler crew) Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgandy, the Anchorman o Sanfransico (A Whales Vagina in French) (Maybe) in the erly 70's. After the station that he works in hires there first female reporter, nothing but controvercy and comedy comes from it.So, you stay classy Will Ferrell, Stay Classy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Will Ferrell is a Comic Genius,"ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY solidified for me my long-dormant suspicion that Ferrell is a comic genius who had been so underrated up to this point. I have not laughed so hard at a movie since YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, and like that classic, no matter how many times I watch this movie, I'm laughing out loud. Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a self-absorbed TV news anchorman working at a San Diego TV station in the 1970's who finds his world as king of the 6:00 news rocked by the arrival of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), a woman who longs to be a news anchor; however, in the 1970's, this was pretty much unheard of. The relationship between Ron and Veronica is very entertaining but the lion's share of the laughs in this film come from Ferrell, who I am convinced improvised approximately 60% of this movie, but the stuff that works clearly outweighs the stuff that doesn't. The 1970's are lovingly recreated here with settings, costumes, and some wonderful forgotten and not forgotten music from the 70's (wait until you see this film's cover of the classic ""Afternoon Delight""). This movie is just one comic highlight after another, including the ""trip to Pleasuretown"", Ron's jazz flute solo, and the news anchor rumble in the alley. Ferrell is a riot and Applegate shows a surprising gift for slapstick comedy and there is a scene-stealing performance from Steve Carell as Brick, the weatherman on Ron's news team. One of the funniest movies I have ever seen and every time it comes on, I have to watch and I have to laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Lame jokes, lame film","I'm sure the people in this film had a great time. I mean they could see the funny side of recording for posterity a series of lame jokes in context of the thinnest of plots. If you close eyes and try to imagine the funny bits you will also be sadly disappointed. Fundamentally, Will Ferrell is not a funny person and just about all his films have the same story line jammed pack with banal unfunny script and the same character - himself. When he does interviews he's not funny as he's continues to play the same character. The set scenes, the fight scene, at the zoo etc are turgid and without any comedic imagination let alone wit. The thought that his could be homage to the early days of TV news presenters is just as ludicrous as any other explanation for the film. I strongly recommend Ferrell and Costner make a few movies together ( if they haven't already) - now that would be funny.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Will Ferrell is hilarious!,"Since Elf came out, I've been waiting for Ferrell's new starring movie, and Anchorman is it. And it does not disappoint, comedy fans! With great actors and script, it's one not to miss.The story: Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a newcaster who's mostly concerned with himself and what he wants. Along with him is his newscrew: Brian, a ladies' man with a sense of fashion, Champ Kind, a western-esque man with little politeness, and Brick, a a person with low intelligence (Think Ralph Wiggum from the Simpsons.) Anyway, a new girl comes into the crew, named Veronica Corningstone. Her and Ron fall for each other during a dinner, and things couldn't be better for Ron. Until Veronica is promoted to co-anchorman, which angers the newscrew. So Ron wants her off the newscrew, in anyway.Aside from story, the characters are very funny, especially Brick Tamland, who's played by Steve Carell. Go see the movie yourself, now!Score: *****/*****",,Anonymous,Comedy
best comedy i have seen in years,"Two summers ago, I saw Anchorman and was completely blown away. I am sure I am the minority in thinking it was one of the best films of the year, but when done well a pure comedy can be just as much a show of great film-making as anything else. Anchorman, a spoof of chauvinism and male insecurity, is set in a 1970s newsroom in San Diego where star news anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and his news team become threatened by the arrival of a woman (Christina Applegate) in the newsroom.Anchorman is the best display of improvisational comedy on screen since Christopher Guest (This is Spinal Tap, Best in Show). It's jokes come from the creation of funny characters. The beauty of Anchorman wasn't so much the comic intensity of Will Ferrell, but the fact that every other actor in the movie could keep up with him in creating such zany characters. Paul Rudd, David Koechner and Steve Carrell as Ferrell's team of sidekicks all have breakout roles as his news anchor team and Applegate matches Ferrell line-for-line in their battle-of-the-sexes rivalry. Together, they all provide so much comic energy and mine comic situations to such extremes, that it had me laughing throughout the entire movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Anchorman,"" a new classic","I just saw this movie, and I have never laughed so hard in my life! ""Anchorman"" absolutely fantastic! The actors were hilarious, including Christina Appelgate who gives us a new look at her comical side and the comic master Will Ferrell shows off his best moves. The movie is about a partying, sexist anchorman in the seventies, even dumber than Ted Baxter of the old ""Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" who he resembles in many ways. This movie made me laugh so hard, and I do not believe it is possible to not laugh. There are many special appearances including fellow stars of the movie ""Old School,"" Jack Black, and many more.

Highly entertaining,"This is one of those movies where the writers, actors and director seem to assume that if they make it really dumb, you won't expect much.The writing is dumb. The story is dumb. The acting is dumb. But they love it.There are moments of great creativity.Nevertheless, the movie does not sink to the level of annoying stupidity. It has some semblance of a story line, so it keeps your attention. In other words, it is bearable. If you plan to rent this movie, watch it now, because I doubt it will be on the shelves in a year or two.However, when you get finished watching Anchorman, you feel like your brain is on novocaine. It is a bit like a cinematic lobotomy. If you watch it three times in a row, including extras, I suspect you might suffer permanent brain damage.Watch at your own risk!Addendum:I've watched it five times, and must say that it does seem to get funnier the each time around. Perhaps I have been a bit unfair to this truly brilliant movie.Now where did I misplace my brailn? It must be in there somewwhere?",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pop corn comedy with a stellar cast,"This film is about an anchorman having to deal with his job being done and then taken over by a female colleague.In the first half of the film, the jokes are gross and politically incorrect. Viewers are forced to think that an erection that is easily discerned through the clothing is funny. Viewers are also forced to sit through one whole minute of Will Ferrell shouting for no reason. I became rather disappointed with the film.Fortunately, in the second half of the film, things picked up, and the film becomes much better. The attempts of trying to get Christina Applegate out of the office are funny. The scenes with the bears are funny and cute as well! Steve Carell is the gem in the film. His performance is in my opinion the funniest in the whole of the film. The way he speaks, walks and knows nothing that is going on makes me laugh. In one scene, there are a few arguing, and he joins in and shouts that he does not know what the people are shouting about. In another, he reports weather and names Michigan the Middle East. These little things are light hearted and funny. In contrast, I think Will Ferrell tries too hard and is way over the top in this film.Christina Applegate gives a fine performance in this film too. In the scene where she sees Will Ferrell being pushed into the crowd of protesters, her sorrows and regrets are portrayed effectively.There are cameos by Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black. These celebrities keep coming up and it is so pleasant to be surprised by a sudden cameo appearance.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Old School"" meets ""The Ladies Man!""",Anchorman is a very funny flick with hilarious lines. This is one of Will Ferrell's best films. He had great lines and sometimes I was always thinking how can this channel 4 be one of the most watched networks on TV. It was very funny. The other character Brick was extremely funny. He said like the dumbest lines but it came out to be hilarious! I did love Rob Burgundy but I still didn't think he was better than White Goodman in Dodgeball.

Anchorman=Hilarious,"I think I can some this film up in one word: HILARIOUS! Will Ferrel at his best.

Other actors were also very funny like Brick, who also plays Evan Baxter in Bruce Almighty and Brent in the American version of the office. He plays a slow, very dopey weatherman, he also will leave you crying laughing.

Better than wedding crashers too. outtakes are hilarious but make sure you watch at the end. will Farrell is fairly new to me but gaining in stature as he delivers comedy (in my opinion) much better than the over rated Jim Carey. need more movies like these. good harmless fun type flicks that all the family can enjoy (age limit applies some scenes a bit raunchy)i would love to be a part in one of thee films as they look as though they really do have a great time making them",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilariously Over-the-Top,"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy follows a news anchor called Ron Burgundy (as the title suggests) who is considered something of a celebrity, when a new female anchor shows up and tries to one-up him.The movie is hilariously over-the-top in most every aspect of it. The acting, for starters, is obviously fake but supposed to be. Basically the entire main cast (Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Steve Carell) is completely over-the-top in their performances, but each one is kind of dumb in their own overdone way. It's hilarious and considering everyone is like this it's clear that that's the style the movie is going for, so it isn't distracting.The comedic aspect itself outside of the acting is fantastic. The movie is, again, way over-the-top. But it's a funny kind of over- the-top, where clearly everything is supposed to be taken with a grain of salt, or the characters are simply saying something so out there yet in character that you can't help but laugh.Overall Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is great fun to watch. Is it actually a great movie? Probably not, but I loved it all the same. It's absolutely hilarious, and that's what a comedy is supposed to be, isn't it? In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!!","I'll start by saying, what a terrible movie this was. I was really excited for seeing what I thought would be a laugh-out-loud all-star comedy. I was thoroughly disappointed with this lame, unoriginal movie. Will Ferrel really let me down, and the jokes could have written by high schoolers.Which brings me to to a more important point. If you want a great film about news with comedy and more, stick with ""Network"". Network blows Anchorman away with plot, humor, and more.

A night at the improv,"A comedy that mostly ditches the script and gives the actors their freedom can really only go two ways: it's either going to be really good or really terrible. It just depends on how well the actors play off one another and how long they have to ramble on before a decent punchline comes along. Thankfully, this movie is chock full of fantastic comedians so there was never really much of a risk. If you put Will Ferrell and Steve Carell in a room together you can count on it that they'll have something good in five minutes, and writer/director Adam McKay (without underestimating his input, obviously) lets the magic happen. It also helps that Will Ferrell knows everyone, so there are a lot of amusing cameos in here. They just keep piling on new familiar faces as the movie progresses, without it ever feeling forced. ""Anchorman"" is just about as disjointed and filled with non-sequiturs as a movie can get, but in the final act there's even some room for character development and a genuinely touching ending.

"""I Love Lamp!""","Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy (1) (2004) -Without having watched and enjoyed the film 'Elf' (2003) I wouldn't have even entertained seeing this film, because I'd written Will Ferrell off as childish and unfunny, until 'Elf' showed me that he had some potential in certain situations and roles and I have to say that I was glad that I gave his Anchorman, Ron Burgundy a chance, because I did really enjoy this film.And actually there was a lot of 'Buddy The Elf' in this film with regards to the Naïveté and simple mindedness of Ron.I had to take the whole thing with a pinch of salt though and for what it was, because the offensive behaviour was supposed to show how wrong those beliefs were and to be laughed at for showing up the idiots that think that way, because racists, bigots and sexists are the ones that are the real jokes right? It was daft, but deliberately so and that was what made it good comedy.Steve Carell in the role of Brick Tamland kind of stole the show for me, because his stupidity and child like mentality was sort of adorable, but also ridiculous.I loved Paul Rudd too. He really can do anything as far as I'm concerned and his slimey creep character of Brian Fantana was just as funny as he always has been and so tongue in cheek that his arrogance and high opinion of himself was really quite brilliant.The whole film had some great moments throughout and I really did laugh a lot, but the jazz flute segment was superb and the ""Pleasure Town"" inset was great too.It took a clever mind to come up with this stuff and make it look so unintelligent.I must stop judging films without giving them a chance, because I'm missing out on gems like this one and the opportunity to watch them again and again, which I'm sure I will be doing with Ron's story.777.08/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"There was Rhett Butler, Rick Blaine, Rocky Balboa, Raymond Babbit and now: Ron Burgundy...","Every once in a while, a movie character suddenly pops out and becomes an icon despite the limited chronology of his existence. Maybe not 'Forrest Gump' or 'General Maximus' instant icon but something in the same vein than Otto from ""A Fish Called Wanda"" or Spinal Tap. His name is Ron Burgundy, he's San Diego top-local anchorman, he's tall, nicely built, handsome in a funny way, and wear bright-colored suit that so scream 70's... what do you know, this is when the film is set: good old 70's when TV was the king media.And Will Ferrell is the king of all kings, a man at the pinnacle of his career, charm and self-confidence. And he just doesn't throne over San Diego, where he's religiously followed by all San Dieg whatever you call them, but he's also the Captain of his winning league, the team work including sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner) whose cowboy hat tactfully hides a face-ruining baldness, and makes him look like one of Biff Tannen's sidekicks. There's also Brian Fentana, the news reporter, played by Paul Rudd, the only mustache to compete with Ron's. And there is Steve Carrel as the intellectually challenged Brick, the weatherman.If Brick is here to provide the obligatory 'non sequitur' lines (and by obligatory, I don't mean they don't work), the two other sidekicks are like Burgundy's clones with something lacking. What exactly? Well, since Burgundy doesn't strike as the brightest bulb in the box, let's say he's the most confident over his talent or maybe he's the best prompter reader (which will cause him a few troubles). So we meet Ron when he's at the top, and since he can't get higher than that, we expect a little intrusion in his dream-team. His boss, played by Fred Willard, decides to add some diversity and hires a new reporter, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) which, as her name clearly indicates, is a woman. The blasphemy! The tragedy!That the team is baffled by her entrance is a gag by itself, and a source of great ones, although the film is set in the 70's, it's strange to see it populated by guys who still believe men should drag their women by the hair. You think I'm exaggerating? Just watch the scene where Ron is courting the beautiful Veronica and just think whether a caveman wouldn't have come up with a better rhapsody. Still, it works by making Ron grotesquely touching. ""The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a film that, on the surface, looks very misogynistic and mean-spirited but even the most hardcore feminism can't overlook the fact that the film makes fun of these men's misogyny more than anything, and actually, it is what drives the whole narrative of the film, it's all in the conflict between Veronica and Ron.But the film doesn't go for simplistic and predictable plot devices, the first pleasant surprise is that Burgundy actually puts the Ron in Veronica, they fall in love and she asks him to keep their relationship private. Guess what he does next? He screams it all over the office, and as if it wasn't enough, he shares the secret with his viewers. After all, isn't San Diego's voice of truth entitled to speak the truth? So if Ron says that he loves Veronica and she's got a nice rack, well, within his own wicked and macho sense of humor, it's still true. That's the secret of great comedic characters, they're consistent yet unpredictable, and on that level, Burgundy reminds me of Borat, another great mustached comical character of the 2000's.I also mention Borat because he comes from a mockumentary and you get similar vibes from the film, with all these weird reports on pet contests and other local news items so trivial you wonder why they were taken so seriously. Well, the content might make you laugh, but it is true that these people, as eccentric as they were, existed and they were as passionate and loving their jobs as Burgundy. And Burgundy, through his childish insistence on keeping things under control, is like Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"", the worst director ever, but a great guy who loved his job more than anything, and had fun doing it, and that's the key of Burgundy's likability, and Ferrell's performance.Indeed, when an actor has fun playing a character, it shows on the screen, and you can tell the whole cast had fun, even the guys who played Burgundy's archenemies obviously, those who are below on Nielsen ratings, and perhaps the highest ratios of cameos per minute, one that makes the early 2000's almost as old as the 70's. I must say I cringed a little when the arena fight went over the top, I wasn't sure the film followed the right path, but then it had the perfect punch-line, with the great ""Wow, that escalated quickly"", which became a meme to describe a situation going ridiculously out of control. When a so-so scene ends with the most memorable line, it becomes a great scene.And the movie is full of many many others, and many touching ones, too. It was directed by Adam McKay, who just won an Oscar for his dense and entertaining ""Big Short"" screenplay, a mix of comedy and drama to explain the financial crisis. In ""Burgundy"", retrospectively, you have hints of his promising talent in the way he tackles the reality of journalism world with a comedic tone, for once that the caricature doesn't serve to hide some ugly truth. And when the present is so ugly and scary, news-wise, an outdated weirdo like Ron Burgundy is a pure delight.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Will Be one of those Videos You Watch Repeatedly,"Anchorman has a funny effect on me. I remember laughing out loud through nearly the whole film when I first saw it, and yet I still chuckle, to myself, at the now familiar jokes and setups. Like (the Holy Grail of American comedy) ""Caddyshack"" before it, Anchorman will live on in repeated lines for years to come. I don't pretend it's writing is more brilliant than ""Caddyshack"", it isn't. It's over the top where Caddyshack is underplayed to perfection, but the two stand as staggering cinematic moments in comedy. I've heard the outtakes are as funny as the finished film, and that most of the movie was just the lead actor's riffing, but I have to hand it Adam McKay for directing a mostly ""riffed"" film into a brilliant little piece. Of course, I love Will Ferrel's bluster (especially the outtake clips where he overreacts with so many ""Great - something's something"").Still, the supporting cast is spot on, the performances always over-the-top and yet never over-the-line. Anchorman walks the tightrope and maintains a crazy energy the whole way through. It's also a very democratic film, every character receives a large share of the laughs. I struggle to think of characters on screen who are not being funny or adding to a joke. Accept the film for the big, ridiculous thing that it is and laugh your pants off.Also, the moment Roger Ebert criticized as out-of-sync, the ""Brawl"", is just too funny on its own not to be there. Honestly, the last time you watched ""Caddyshack"", you knew the Yacht Club scene was a little un-subtle, but you still chuckle at the filmmakers disregard for maintaining tone. It's touches like that that keep these frenetic films alive for years to come. In ten years, you'll ask your friends what they could have been thinking shooting this scene, but you'll laugh just as hard knowing that they actually did shoot it and put it out there.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Will Ferrell has always been a very gifted comedic actor, but with this film he has found the perfect role. Christina Applegate provides a very good counter to Ferrell as well.

Frankly- sublime,"One of the funniest movies of the last six years.A winning combination of comedy talent given free reign to develop their (admittedly one dimensional) characters to provide a series of great compliments/contrasts that give the film a degree of depth.At the top of the food chain is Applegate's Corningstone. She fulfills her ironic role of eye-candy-with-a-punch well (although she is perhaps the weakest of the bunch). She shoots down Farrell's Burgundy to great effect (the 'when in Rome' joke is a classic), and their relationship deals neatly with the film's moral message (chavinistic cartels are doomed to failure in the face of liberated women).The plankton at the bottom is Carrell's Brick. Carrell clearly loved his role, and with McKay's assistance has managed the near impossible of making his every line an instant classic ('I ate a big red candle'... 'I love lamp'etc, ad.inf.)His absolute stupidity is cleverly highlighted to great comic effect by the fact even Burgundy can pick him up on his comments (r.e. 'I love lamp'- 'Brick, do you really love the lamp, or are you just saying that because you saw it?' 'I love lamp').Koechner and Rudd are funny as they ham up their characters of oversexed hick and wannabee-Lothario-actually-wet-sap smoothie. Koechner's Champ is probably afforded the least opportunity to develop a real persona (but Koechner's caricature is so grotesque that it really isn't required!). In the UK, to break out the 'Sex Panther' has become a by-word for dressing/scenting up in a manner that dooms you to a score-free night from the get-go. I'm sure that's true in the USA as well.Unsurprisingly didn't win any Oscars. But it was well worth the cinema ticket and the DVD purchase.PS look out for Willard and Vaughn in peerless cameos.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

With no apology - this movie is lame.,"Will Ferrell comes across as a babbling idiot who is absolutely desperate for approval - his jokes varied between funny to odd to just plain crazy.I found the movie to be inconsistent and only marginally funny. The theatre I was in was half-empty so the jokes that didn't go over were met with stone silence. I did hear a few snorts of disdain through the movie.The scene where Paul Rudds character talks about naming his penis and testicles is just plain strange. The character himself isn't horrible and the scene about the men's cologne is pretty funny (reminded me of old Hai Karate commercials for those of you old enough to remember those).David Koechner as the sportscaster was irritating and I don't recall him having a single funny line. His best scene is where he's a ragdoll for a bear - as for the bearpit scene itself I find myself asking who is Ferrell's audience? 10 year old boys who are amused by making farting sounds with their armpits?Christina Applegate - I like her and don't think she gets nearly enough work. This movie is not going to help her career. I had hoped that as this is a movie about gender ""war"" that the main female character would be well written. Will Ferrell is content to leave the Corningstone character 2-dimensional and the character's behaviour is completely unpredictable. Why were there no other female characters of any consequence in this movie? It's about the emergence of the women's liberation movement in the 70's forchrissakes! You'd think they'd find room for women in the script. What we get is Christina Applegate in miniskirts and eminently forgettable lines.The background - the 70's. Great idea - poorly realized. Ben Stillers homage to the 70's in Starsky & Hutch did a much better job. Do you think they could have tossed in a few more baseline references to set the tone - how about trotting out Ronald Reagan (he was Governor of California) - and there were no references to movies of that era - one reference was to Planet of the Apes (but that's a 60's movie).OK - Steve Carell's character got some great lines and his comic timing is superb. He did have me laughing out loud and Ferrell used the character very well. Vince Vaughn was good and should have had more scenes - but his final scene at the bearpit made me squirm it was so badly written (what can an actor do with lines like that??)The ""rumble"" scene was ridiculous, the ""down & out"" routine was silly and the whole thing doesn't deserve more than a 5 out of 10 in my books (and that's due solely to Steve Carrel - otherwise I'd rate it much lower).American cinema needs an ""Alpha"" Comic badly and Will Ferrell isn't it.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprised at the Low Rating,"I thought ""Anchorman"" was hilarious, so I was surprised at the low rating it received here. Well written, well acted, and well directed, this is a very funny adult comedy with some classic scenes and lines. I will not soon forget the ""West Side Story"" rumble between five rival news teams, that includes a man on fire and another man being speared with a trident. Or the verbal abuse Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate throw back and forth at each other while the credits for their news show are rolling (""I'm proud of my pubic mane"" is one of my favorite lines, which Ferrell says in response to Applegate telling him he has too much pubic hair). Ferrell of course is funny, and Applegate makes a good straight man (or woman). Steve Carell and Paul Rudd are also terrific as well. And I had a blast with the impressive list of cameos, my favorite being Tim Robbins as the lead anchor at the local public television station.This movie really satisfies the need for good comedy that you don't have to think very much about, but that still manages to be more clever than usual and doesn't rely on bathroom humour for all of its laughs. Watch and have a great time.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"I've seen this movie so many times, and 60% of the time, it works every time","I remember vividly the first time I watched Anchorman. It was late at night there was nothing on TV and I saw this movie and I had no idea what it was so it was one of those ""If this is boring I'll just switch the channel"" kind of situation. I said it that day after watching the entire movie and I stand by that today: Anchorman is the funniest movie I have ever seen.Of course, after that occasion I have seen the film countless times, and the jokes just never get old. Let's just get something straight before I go on with this review, the plot is crap. The dialogue is dumb and a lot of things make absolutely no sense. But Anchorman is a masterpiece. How? Because it is the most consistent comedy ever created, that's why. Every joke is executed perfectly, the characters are memorable, it has countless one-liners that even if you haven't seen Anchorman you know them because they are a part of our culture by now (""Well, that escalated quickly"")The best part about the movie has to be the news team. Comedy genius delivered by Will Ferrell, Steve Carrell, Paul Rudd and David Koechner.Needless to say I love this movie, yes even if it is dumb, doesn't make sense and the plot is predictable. Anchorman remains the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life and it's one of those movies that I could watch over and over again and I would never get bored. Anchorman puts a big fat smile on my face every single time.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I can't imagine why people liked this movie.,"I'll start by saying that I really enjoy a stupid comedy. The 40 year old virgin was great! So, with a similar cast and some decent reviews (and some bad ones) I thought this movie had a pretty good chance. Nope, sorry, I didn't make it through the first 30 min before I realized that life is too short and I had a closet to paint. I could still hear the movie where I was and I am sure that it didn't get any better.

"Funny premise, not very funny movie","Will Ferrell as a phony, materialistic 70's TV news anchorman? Funny premise, but it's just not funny beyond the previews or the first 5 minutes. Movies can be both stupid and funny, like ""Old School"" but this one is just stupid and very rarely funny. There's not much of a story - it's just a vehicle for Ferrell's anchorman character.Look for one wildly over-the-top scene between dueling news teams and some well-known actors in quick cameo roles (familiar faces from ""Old School"" for example). Beyond that, only comic actor Steve Carell (former regular on ""The Daily Show"") is good for a reliable laugh, and he steals just about every scene he's in, as a dumber-than-dumb weatherman. Ferrell, though, is rarely funny in the leading role.I'm not sure I can recommend this film even as a bargain matinée. It's not that good even as brain-dead comedy.",,Anonymous,Comedy
All the news and fits,"This is one of the silliest, dumbest movies I have ever seen. The plot is paper thin, the characters are drawn in broad unbelievable strokes, the gags are totally crazy.

"Funny, Charming, and Witty... Ingredients For A Sexy Film","""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a devilishly funny film about a local newsman named Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), the sexiest and the most famous man in San Diego. Ron Burgundy has ""it"". The voice, the friends, the charm and spunk, and of course, how can we forget the hair? His world is turned upside down when the beautiful and smart Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) rolls into town. She threatens and intimidates Ron and his news team, Champ Kind (David Koechner), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), but Ron still falls head over heels for her. At first people laugh at her because simply, she is a woman. But they realize Veronica is the dedicated and hardworking journalist possible better than Ron. Then it's war.""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is one of the coolest movies of the past decade. Cleverly written by Will Ferrell and a SNL writer, it is random humor that you wouldn't think would be... well... so hilarious! Many memorable quotes will stick in your mind on a Post-It and you can't go through one day without saying at least one. The roles are so well played by all cast members and is a film that is just so funny for words. You will think, ""Ron Burgundy is the sexiest newsman alive."" It is a film that can actually be taken seriously if you laugh your brain off. Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy so well, you're going to fall in love with him. Christina Applegate resurrects her comedic charm as the intimidating, aspiring journalist Veronica Corningstone. Steve Carrell, Paul Rudd,and David Koechner add to the wicked jokes, and you absolutely cannot forget comic legend Fred Willard attempting to be serious, but is still the same. ""Anchorman"" is one of the most exhilarating future legends of comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Anchorcrap,"I was fairly excited to see this movie due to the fact that several people I encountered thought it was hilarious; however, the movie is actually horrible. You may be thinking that I am one of those people who just cannot enjoy a slapstick-type goofy comedy, but you would be wrong. I love Old School and Road Trip, I even liked Dodgeball (except for the Velveeta ending) so I am open to a movie that was made specifically for laughter without thinking. This movie missed its mark completely. Will Ferrell and the cast try hard to make the audience laugh and succeeded a couple of times, but for the most part the jokes fell flat. There really is not a plot to the story, it revolves around a station of all men anchors not wanting to release power to a new female anchor. All of the guys are creepy, sexist and completely full of themselves. Steve Carell, who was funny in Bruce Almighty, really had nowhere to go with his character. He is a dim bulb who just makes random statements or repeats what another character says. I think the best part of this movie was Vince Vaughan as a rival station anchor. So, my advice with this film is, don't see it at the theater, don't rent it or buy it on pay per view, wait a couple of years until it is on USA or TBS every other Saturday morning.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Please make it end!!!,Wil Ferrell passing as both a writer and a movie star is the only funny thing about this movie. If that man ever had an amusing thought it would die lonely. I love a good spoof movie - you can't beat the original Airplane - because they usually involve a large amount of gags. This movie makes absolutely no effort to be funny. It just assumes that we all think a boring white bread man with bad hair is amusing no matter what he does. Obviously with all the good reviews a lot of people do think he's funny which means this is one of those times in life when I wonder if I'm not living in some parallel universe - the same feeling usually arises around election time. I find it quite depressing that Wil Ferrell is what passes for a filmstar these days. No wonder no-one goes to the movies anymore.,1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
TV-Style Skits Do Not Add Up to a Good Film,"I took the advice of an IMDb user who recommended sitting through the closing credits of ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."" Unfortunately, the outtakes running through the credits were not funny, and neither was this film.I realize that Will Ferrell is a popular television personality and comedian. His best comic impersonation has been a dead-on portrait of James Lipton, the interviewer-host of ""Inside the Actors Studio."" But the ""Anchorman"" film reveals the limitations of Ferrell in both screen writing and in acting. From start to finish, the film was shallow and the comic moments were uninspired.The one breath of fresh air in this lackluster film was the performance of Christina Applegate. Her comic timing was superb and, above all, she was the only performer who was convincing as a TV newscaster. But her character was not well developed in a script that was obviously intended as a star vehicle for Ferrell as Ron Bugundy.Lost in this mess of a film was the important point that in the 1970s there were significant female journalists in the media, such as Jessica Savitch, who paved the way for women news anchors. Ironically, the most competent scene in the film was when the four male newscasters sang a popular love song from the 1970s. Obviously, those four actors were better suited for a barbershop quartet than for a team of television newscasters.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Got the Burgundy Blues,"As much as I tried, I couldn't even make it through the first thirty minutes, and I can't recall that happening in a long, long time, so I don't know if it ever improved during the last hour. I doubt it. I admit that I rarely watch films produced in the twenty first century, and now I understand why. How did this total loser ever get a 7.2 rating from IMDb subscribers? The writing was inane and infantile. So was the pathetic attempt at comic acting. I have seen Steve Carrell in some funny roles, but this just wasn't one of them. This movie didn't make me laugh. It made me very sad. I don't know why I even punished myself by sitting through the first half hour. Shame on me.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I support the Will Ferrell backlash,"As I watched this very pointless, unfunny movie, my mouth was hanging open over how little Ferrell and I agree on what is funny. Ferrell can support a movie and get laughs in someone else's (Zoolander) but he ruins his own with his lazy, one-note shtick. Talladega Nights was stupid... Frank the Tank was stupid... Bewitched was stupid AND a trainwreck... Elf was mawkish Xmas leftovers... I can't even begin to describe how utterly free of laughs I found the previews for Blades of Glory and Semi-Pro. I enjoy a stupid comedy every now and then, but Ferrell's career is just dissembling into nonsense. Being a puerile character can be funny; making puerile movies is not.As Will Ferrell has no other stock to sell, we get his next self-impressed buffoon. There's nothing else in Ferrell's head. The movies big concept is that Anchormen never take off their anchorman jackets and never ease up on the sanctimonious speaking style. Isn't that funny? Shakes the Clown called - He'd like his idea back. When you're stealing fifteen year old concepts from Bob Goldwaithe you're in trouble. Any comedy I like eventually mocks sentimentality. Here and in Adam Sandler movies, sentiment is embraced as a way to provide a handful of utterly conventional plot-points. Get the girl. Win the fight. Do we really need any more carbon copies of that movie with new jokes? And I'm being generous when I describe this movie as having jokes or a plot. There is no reason to watch this for ninety minutes since each scene is just a disconnected, failed stab at being funny and providing lines for the Ferrell cult to parrot. The movie is utter nonsense by the twenty minute mark. After what seems like hours of failed improvised comedy, we get to a remarkable, unfunny Anchorman gangfight where an entire modern crop of unfunny actors have cameos (Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller) cause that's been original for, what, twenty years? What I would give for Vaughan, Stiller, Wilson, Ferrell, Rudd and the last ten years of their shitty, shitty movies to be erased from history. A final act with a sub-titled dog is supposed to be free-wheeling but it's just the most painfully insipid idea that should have been rejected in this mess. God, this movie is crap. It actually made me wince in pain.Ferrell has replaced Ben Stiller as Hollywoods resident 'irritating prick' presumably until the next desperate TV funny-man who's willing to do anything for a buck dethrones him. I feel very confident that the rest of Will Ferrell's career will be at least as stupid as what we've already seen. At this point, I would pay studios nine bucks NOT to watch each of the rest of his movies. I would prefer to have someone beat me with a pillowcase full of batteries for 2 hours, than sit through another miserably unfunny Ferrell vehicle. Kudos to Ferrell for figuring out how to parlay his extraordinarily limited talent into a paycheck, but I'm perfectly willing to sit down with him and discuss the terms of his immediate retirement. Paul Rudd used to be an actor before losing faith in himself and becoming the weakest, least funny member of both the Ferrell & Apatow meathead teams. He's the new Peter Lawford.The lowest form of comedy involves people trying too hard to be funny. Comedies which involve a self-impressed jackass (an anchorman, a nascar drive, a male model, a basketball player, a ping-pong champ, a dodge-ball captain, ad nauseum) taking himself too seriously are now officially DEAD!",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
God Awful.,"I love ridiculous, over-the-top comedy. Super Troopers, Old School, and even Dodgeball all had me laughing uncontrollably. But Anchorman? One of the biggest wastes of my life. I don't even know where to start. Just not funny. I think being ridiculous and random can be a great recipe for comedic success. But just saying line after line of retarded mishmash that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever isn't very funny. In fact, in Anchorman, it wasn't funny at all!

The jokes and gags were pushed too far, until they weren't funny but greatly annoying.You could sum up the entire movie by Ron Burgundy's constant misuse of the phrase ""When in Rome. .

In the same way, Will Farrell's constant misuse of stale gags and unfunny jokes made this movie boring, annoying, and stupid.When your jokes and gags aren't funny or even mildly amusing, your movie isn't a comedy.

Not One of Will Ferrell's Best,"I just saw this film last night and I was pretty disappointed. I love Will Ferrell and I've enjoyed almost everything else he's previously done (off the top of my head); this film was just sorely lacking, in every department, so much so that I almost can't put my finger on it because I don't have that many and I don't feel like using my toes today. I think the story had a lot of promise, but it felt like they stopped writing it after the outline; as if an outline for the movie was presented to the studio, but when it came time to flesh it out with a screenplay, everyone called in sick that day.The shining stars of the production (if there were any), would have to be Christina Applegate and Fred Willard; their acting and dialogue was well done and acceptable, and Fred Willard is great as always, even though he didn't have much of anything to work with. Unfortunately, they just seemed to be flailing about on a high wire with no net, and the end result is simply UGLY.There's just nothing really funny at all about the movie; it bored the crap out of me, but I didn't turn it off because I kept hoping it would get better, and I kept praying that Will Ferrell would have made a better movie than what I was watching ... but then it was over, and it never got any better, and suddenly I was at the place that all moviegoers hate to be at: the place when you realize you've just lost 90 to 120 minutes of your life that you'll never get back, and there's nothing you can do about it.
