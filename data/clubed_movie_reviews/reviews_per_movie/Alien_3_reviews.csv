bad timing (editing problems?),"I saw this movie for the third time now and I hoped that I might enjoy it a little bit more than the first two times. But, though I really did my best to like it, I was disappointed again.But then, there are moments when I thought: hey, this could be very good, but it just doesn't work, it just doesn't touch me at all, so what is wrong with it? Maybe I just don't see it the way it is intended?After all this is I think the truth about this movie: like it is, you can't see it the way it is intended.I just can't believe that someone who directed such a solid and compact movie as Se7en, could make such a horrible mistake: there is no story, there is no center, the whole thing just falls apart in pieces when you watch it.I think this is due to some wrong editing (and maybe this was caused by a not thoroughly thought trough scenario, but that I can't say). There were several moments when I thought: hey, why is this happening now, it should happen minutes ago and moments when I thought: why is this happening right now, it just spoils the enjoyment of suspense, they should show this way later in the movie. And there were scenes I thought: my God, why didn't they cut this piece away, it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.Like the 'running scenes' closing to the end: you just can't make head nor tale of it, they're just running around, while you never get what they're plan actually is and how they would like to make it work. You just wait till they're done and get on with the 'story'. This is just annoying as it is. But I think what the director meant was to create this feeling of being lost in endless tunnels without ever really seeing it from a bird's view, to run and hope you will get somewhere, with only the help of your fear and the intuition it brings with it. Done well, this could prove to be some really exciting and nerve-cracking sequence, a real build-up to the grand finale.There were also moments when I thought the music was kicking in way too early or too late, making it some kind of a mere commentary instead of accompanying and enforcing the action (like it is so well done in Star Wars or The X-files just to name a few).I think a better editing could make this movie a whole new experience, getting things at the right moments and making it one whole again, like it proved possible with ""Blade Runner"". I for one wouldn't mind to see it one more time, but only the way it was probably intended, so I hope they will give the director a chance to remake this movie and to prove that it is a good one after all.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Oh dear, oh dear","What happened here then? It would be impossible to live up to the previous two, so why try? If you throw a coin up in the air and you shoot a perfect hole in the middle, why try it again? You're more than likely to fail. Dark film that tries to be like the first in the saga, but doesn't pull it off like the master Ridley.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
In defense of David Fincher,"I just watched this again. I've seen Alien and Aliens countless time, but have only seen Alien 3 once and that was pretty much enough for the last 15 years.This movie is really just a waste of time, because the few good ideas and interesting things that happen are completely overshadowed by the illogical plot, worthless characters and slasher feel (you could replace the alien with any other movie monster, no problem).I don't think this has anything to do with David Fincher, though.He did not write the story or the script, and those areas are where the major problems lie.Think of all the other movies he has directed since then:Seven, Fight Club, The GameThose are three of my all-time favorite movies, and the ones I didn't list above, like panic room, are still good movies.I just can't believe that it was Fincher causing the problems here, but I can believe that he could be easily pushed around by a studio during his directorial debut (maybe even their fall-guy?). Blame the studio for letting this P.O.S. go into production in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It should've never entered the triology status.,"Alien took my breath away, and was the defining movie that reeled me into Sci-Fi.  Aliens had even more aliens and then came the queen.  Alien 3 didn't need to be told, the story wasn't convincing.  Perhaps the fatal flaw was setting it in a space prison.  It's hard to care for characters who are murderers and rapists.  I wouldn't waist the time to watch this but you should definitely watch the first two.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the first two,"Alien 3 was a letdown of a sort when compared to both Alien and Aliens, classics in their own right. Sigourney Weaver returns as does Lance Hendriksen in two different roles. But even though Weaver is there, the movie just doesn't have the same power as the first two films.Ripley (Weaver) crash lands on a prison planet and is taken in by a doctor (Charles Dance). But the Alien has followed her again in a different way, and goes about destroying the inhabitants of the planet. Once again its up to Ripley to destroy the monster.The acting in this film was pretty good, and the visuals are amazing, but this movie, as directed by David Fincher, is way too dark and depressing when compared to the first and second films. This film leaves us with no real hope for anyone. Yes there are some genuine scares to be found here, and like I said the film has a good look to go with quality acting. Too bad that the director took it down this despairing road with a horrible ending that I never could accept.When compared to the first two movies, this film is second rate. However, it is still much better than Alien Resurrection which followed. That movie, to me, was a waste of time and money.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the others (as if you need telling),"After the brilliant Alien, and the maybe even better Aliens, what was the obvious progression? That's right, Alien Cubed. That's something of an optimistic title though, as this is certainly not Alien to the power of three. Actually, the only real problem with Alien3 is that everyone involved in it, with the exception of David Fincher, Sigourney Weaver, H.R.Giger, and maybe Charles Dance seems to be completely useless. The acting is (with the exception of the above) uniformly awful, truly dreadful. The clunking dialogue is not helpful to their cause.Fincher does a decent job with what he has to work with and his past in music videos doesn't make the film too flashy and disorientating. Particularly impressive is the scene with the alien's point of view while it runs along the ceiling. But the whole film is let down by the disappointing visuals. Where the first two films had darkness and dinginess, or just sheer scale to impress you with, Alien3 just has a rust coloured prison planet that looks like something from Dune. Only worse. This is the downfall of the film - if the visuals had been better, the films other many bad points could probably have been ignored.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A lot like the first one,"I am one of the people who doesn't dislike this film because it is different, but because it wasn't different enough. Oh no, there is an alien behind you. Look out, it is picking you off one by one. I really didn't think it even tried to do something else. I would've preferred Alien 4 to this one if that one wasn't campy. However, if you liked the first Alien the best out of all the movies, you will probably enjoy this film more than I did. I just kinda enjoyed the combat of Aliens more than the thriller movies. However, Alien was one of the first to do this, so it is a testament to the timelessness of it's concept which we younger viewers take for granted.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An unfortunate dissapointment,"The long delayed sequel to James Camerons Aliens turned out to be a mediocore affair. I remember going to the local movie theater in my teens to see this film with my brother and I was so dissapointed. It just seemed like an inferiour rehash of the first film. No characters to feel a true sympathy for (though Charles Dance's character gets more depth in the new special edition release). Watching the documentary that comes along with the new re-releae you can plainly see the rough time the producers and writers, etc. had in coming up with a story for the third film. In the end what we got was a brave effort but a failure in comparison with the first two films. The fourth one in the series was a better return to form for me anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing when compared to the first 2,"Not in the same league as the first 2 Alien films. The special effects were well done, and while the action scenes were excellent, there weren't nearly enough of them. Nothing against director David Fincher, but I would not put him in the same class as Ridley Scott and James Cameron (directors of the first 2 films). This movie did not have a great flow. For the better part of an hour, we're left listening to dull dialogue, before the action picks up. At least with the first Alien film, the suspense kept up the pace of the movie. Also, aside from Lt. Ripley, none of the other characters are the least bit interesting in this film. This movie is enjoyable, and better than a many sci-fi movies out there, but I would not consider this one to be a classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too bad about the script,"Great direction.  David Fincher's first film, and he did quite well considering, but the script was 100% awful, a piece of crap from beginning to end.  It completely ruins its predecessor, ""Aliens,"" and was clearly only made to make a quick buck.Fun to watch, but this movie is not a sequel.  It's like an interesting nightmare Ripley had on her way to... wherever.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weak,"I blame the downfall of the Alien films partly to this movie. It's when the movies went from being masterpieces to pieces of s***e. It's not as bad as Regurgitation but it's leaning that way. More towards that than towards it's predecessor.Weaver is almost unbearable too look at with her shaved head, and Hicks and Newt are dead. That right there is enough to p*** me off. This movie could have been so much better than this. And come on now, a prison setting? Please. Don't waste my time.I usually like David Fincher so I can forgive him for this, but it still stinks. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The weakest of the four films to date,"Alien 3 is not a bad film but it is the weakest of the four that have been made. Its just nowhere near as good as it could have been. If you take the premise that sequels need to introduce something new in order to keep the audience interest and progress the story, then this movie doesn't do a lot. The only new thing I learned about the aliens from this film, is that they can apparently use any creature as a host and that the resulting alien offspring inherit some of the characteristics of the host. And thats all.Alien introduced us to the alien, Aliens gave us the hive structure and the rest of the breeding cycle, this gave us very little more, apart from the fact that most criminals appear to be English.The casual killing off of two of the survivors from Aliens was a really weak way to get them out of the way at the start of the film.This film is basically a rehashing of the first one - a single alien and a bunch of people fighting it with limited resources. Not good, not bad, just average.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien 3: Assembly Cut. Sci-fi for grownups.,"Before Se7en and Fight Club but after Alien and Aliens came visionary director David Fincher's Alien³. The third in the popular franchise, but easily one of the most hated, Alien³ is a grim allegorical tale about life, death, sin and redemption. And it is perhaps because of the weighty themes of this film that many fans of the franchise quickly turned their nose up at it.Directly following the events of Aliens, the film's surviving character's escape pod crash lands on a prison planet filled with Double Y Chromosome convicts who have now found religion. Unfortunately one surviving alien came with the pod and it is not long before it starts feeding off the prison population.A stark contrast to director James Cameron's flashy sci-fi action romp 'Aliens', Alien³ is more of a grim psychological horror where the optimism of the first two films are crushed under a near nihilistic tone persistent in this one. However it is this dramatic departure from Cameron's sequel is what gives Alien³ an edge above its predecessors. In addition to a grim storyline littered with quasi and overt religious references, Alien³ also features all of the hallmarks that make David Fincher one of the most popular movie directors around today. Those low camera angles, stark lighting and filtered colors reminiscent of Se7en, Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, are all present in Alien³, in addition to some very stunning cinematography and a haunting score by Elliot Goldenthal.The performances of the three main leads: Sigourney Weaver, Charles S. Dutton and Charles Dance, are amazing in spite of the weaknesses of the screenplay. It is remarkable that despite all this film had going against it, in its highly publicized development hell (that included a script that went through several extensive rewrites before, during and even after filming had finished), the final product is still a masterpiece, albeit a flawed one.If you watch the 'Assembly Cut' version of Alien³ , which is over 30 minutes longer than the theatrical release, you will quickly understand why it is indeed one of the most underrated, but also one of greatest sci-fi monster flicks ever made, and why it quite suitably completes the trilogy in the most fitting manner. Although many complain about the doom and gloom of this feature, this final installment in the trilogy is also the most uplifting. Looking beyond the downbeat nature of the film, Alien³ is still essentially a story about hope, and the putting aside of differences to selflessly help achieve a common good. In other words, this film is about redemption. Alien³: Assembly Cut is not only one of the best films in the franchise but it is also one of David Fincher's best efforts to date. 9 out 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"High on looks, low on story","Although not quite as bad as most critics thought, this was a pretty bad movie.  It looked great.  All the cool camera angles, and style shots were very good.  However, the story really sucked.  I usually like Weaver.  She is a very good actress.  But, in this one, she just seemed to sleep through the movie.If you want to see a GOOD Alien movie, see the second one, Aliens.  If you want to see a good David Fincher movie, see either Se7en or Fight Club. Both are much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Underrated, pessimistic, thought-provoking and disturbing","Unfairly maligned by fans and critics on its release, ALIEN 3 is a film that has a lot going for it. It's unlucky, really, that it follows up two very different movies involving equally brilliant situations: the small-scale claustrophobic horror of ALIEN and the action-packed, large-scale alien war of ALIENS. Yes, the plot follows the same template as in the first film, with a sole creature bumping off a larger cast, but so do many other sci-fi/horror movies. Playing to type isn't necessarily a bad thing.One thing ALIEN 3 does have going for it is style. Along with SE7EN, this helped define new-look realist cinema, full of grittiness and lived-in grime. It's a harsh, pessimistic world we see on screen, incredibly downbeat in its killing-off of key figures from the series, and although David Fincher may have disowned it, I find it one of his finest films. ALIEN 3 is creepily atmospheric and boasts at least one full-on original horror scene, ironically involving video monitoring once again (although a far cry from the motion tracker sequence in ALIENS). The bit in which Ripley undergoes a body scan is one of the most chilling I can remember seeing in the 1990s.It also helps that an ensemble cast brings to life the rather familiar storyline. Ripley, shaven-headed and scarred, is tougher than ever, and she has to be amid one of the most unsympathetic list of characters ever amassed in a film. Despite this, the likes of Pete Postlethwaite, Charles Dance, Paul McGann, Brian Glover, Ralph Brown, and in particular Charles S. Dutton bring warmth, humour, pathos and indeed charisma to their prisoner roles. Dutton in particular is outstanding, particularly during a stirring speech he gets late on (""Nobody ever gave me nothing!""). Bringing Lance Henriksen back helps tie up the series chronology, and while the CGI-animated alien may have dated slightly (although nowhere near as badly as you might think), Fincher's inventive, frenetic camera-work keeps the action scenes working. Add in an inventive climax (copied by TERMINATOR: SALVATION recently) and you have one heck of an entertaining sequel and the last decent movie in this series.Update: I've recently watched the assembly cut of this movie, which makes it a much better viewing experience The story makes a lot more sense this time around and answers most of the plot holes from the theatrical cut, such as the disappearance of crazed prisoner Golic. The addition of 'trapping the alien' sequence is also a decent one, and I don't really buy the reasons for excising it in the first place; does it make the alien a less credible menace? Not a chance. On the other hand, the running time is now close to 2h20m, which spoils the pacing, and it drags a little in the mid section despite all the action going on. As a huge fan of the series, I think the assembly cut is by far the better version of the film, and I wouldn't go back to the theatrical edition.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Alien saga gets turned into an average monster-movie.,"After two extremely atmospheric, haunting and tense movies, this third Alien movie came as a bitter disappointment. It picks a more monster-horror approach, in which the 'monster' wants to kill everyone. Yes, it's true that in a way ""Alien"" wasn't much different, only difference was that in 1979 this approach was still new and original but not by 1992 standards anymore.Problem is that this movie is fairly standard and mostly predictable. Basically this movie isn't much different from most other genre movies, in which a monster is on the loose and on a killing-spree. In this movie you exactly know who is going to die and when. It also really kills the tension the movie. The only thing that makes the killings still good and interesting is the amount of gore used for it.The more 'monster' like approach of the alien also wasn't a good movie and it differs from the first two alien movies. The alien has a too prominent part in the movie and has way too much screen time. The mystery and horror of the character(s) in the first two movies was they the movie didn't showed them in many scene's, at least not fully. In the first two movies the alien was more presented as an animal, killing for their own survival. Not as a monster who kills for pleasure as in this movie is the case. This can be explained because of the reason that this alien in this movie is different from the aliens in the first two movies but this is not satisfying enough, considering that it is never explained in the movie why the alien acts and looks different.The movie went too various re-writes, even during filming and suffered heavily from the studio's- and producers influences. No wonder that David Fincher doesn't want to have anything to do with this movie. With other movies he definitely showed that he is capable of directing both atmospheric and tense movies (""Se7en"", ""The Game"", ""Panic Room""), so it's definitely not has fault that the movie failed. As a matter of fact, the visual style and atmosphere of the movie still make sure that this movie is a better than average one.There are some nice looking and claustrophobic sets featured in the movie. On the other hand the movie unfortunately felt the need to put in some computer effects and even though they of course look quite good for early '90's standards, it's terribly outdated and fake looking now.The movie is carried once more by Sigourney Weaver's performance. Ripley is such a great and strong female character. It also shows courage and dedication to the movies and character that Sigourney Weaver shaved her head bald for this movie. Too bad that none of the other characters really work out in this movie. They mostly remain flat and uninteresting. The movie does feature some interesting actors such as Charles Dance, Ralph Brown and Pete Postlethwaite but all of their talent is wasted in the script, in which they get very little interesting to do or say. The re-appearance of Bishop also feels more of an obligation than it serves a real purpose, though fans won't complain about it and neither would I really. I love Lance!Not the greatest, most tense, most original genre-piece around, not even on its own.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pales in comparison,""" This is rumor control, and these are the facts.."" Alien 3 pales in comparison to the previous two films. It seems David Fincher wanted to combine the elements of the first two films to create a dark, foreboding action movie.Something just didn't work. For one thing there isn't anyone in the film to truly like, after all, everyone is a double y chromo and prone to things like murder and rape. Not exactly the cast you get all teary-eyed over when they meet the alien. Only Riply (Sigourney Weaver) remains from the other films, and she is acting a tad strange in this one too. For example: Ripley is asked to remain in sick-bay because the men have not even seen a woman in years. Remember too, that these are men that are all lifers, having no qualms about committing horrid acts. So what does Riply do? She goes to the mess hall to have lunch with them. Ripley was a very smart woman in the other two films, what happened? Too long in cryogenic sleep? At one point Riply tells the inmates ""I've never seen one(the alien) move Quite like this one does."" I guess she hasn't seen too many poor cgi effects before. This is the weakest of the alien series. That is, of course, until they made Alien Resurrection.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
gag me with a spoon,"During this movie I found watching the inside of my eyelids much more appealing.  Something was just plain wrong about the whole movie.  The biggest problem was that I didn't care about any of the characters but Ripley.  This film was made in between the use of actual puppets and good computer animation (which is still obvious).  That means that many times the Alien looked very fake.  I thought the monster was more realistic in the original Alien.Nothing was suspenseful of scary about this movie.  The Alien point of view ruins the mystery and suspense of the Alien.  I don't want to see what the Alien is seeing, what's the fun in that?  I don't want to know where its going, I just want to be surprised.Also, Ripley crashing on a planet of double Y chromosome rapists was immediately lame.  Also, the doctor's little sob story made me wanna stop the movie right there.  This movie had all the elements of a cheezy blockbuster, an embarrassment to the series.  Because of this film, I'll probably never rent Alien: Resurrection.  I can't even imagine the far-fetched, pathetic way Ripley comes back.  I heard that Jeunet directed that film without knowing how to speak English to the cast.  As the Godfather and Star Wars series' pointed out, three's a crowd.  This is not an exception.  6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
We have different tastes,"Reactions of people towards Alien 3 have always seemed me complicated and weird. I can't explain this by the word hate, because it is more than hate, much more intense. Even the movies in IMDb bottom 100 have not such a bad reputation and people are much more easy to those. Long time ago, I read that Alien 3 was appreciated in Asian and Europe continents, but American and English audiences hated it. This is also so weird to me. It is said that it is because there were not Newt and Hicks for example. I don't know even who they are, probably one of them is the little girl. Why these two characters are very important? Are they main or key characters? No. In the second movie, Ripley made a friendship (a sort of) with her, so these people had wanted a tearjerker melodrama? Ripley is ugly in this movie, but she looks interesting and appealing to me with her short hair and bloodshot. Alien 3 is the darkest, the most bizarre, the most violent and the hardest sequel in the series. However, despite many people like dark movies such as Dark City or The Dark Knight and many people like also bizarre movies like the ones which Takeshi Miike made for example, they find Alien 3 disgusting, abominable. To me, this is a very stylish and appealing bizarreness. Not disturbing. And probably some of them who find this disgusting love Peter Jackson's Braindead or Saw movies? As for violence, this is not a sadistic or sick violence, it is only for showing us the ravenous alien's savagery. Alien 3 is the darkest one in the series, at the same time, it is the darkest movie ever made to me, I did not find even The Dark City that dark. I should add that this darkness did not disturb me, it was not an unappealing dark. It causes a thrilling, mysterious, frightening and the most important choky atmosphere. Some people complain about weapon matter, as if the previous movies are action-packed movies, even in Cameron's Aliens, there was not any gunfight scene almost. To me, this is a very interesting idea; what would you do, if you had not any weapon against the alien? Despite the visual effects of the alien has some defects in some moments, it still looks impressive. My first favorite scene is the scene that one of the prisoners stands in front of the crawly, big impellers and then, he finds the carcass. The never-to-be-forgotten scenes are the surgical operation scene (Ripley's decision and Fincher's great direction), the alien's attack to the infirmary, the horrible dog scene and the final. However, my favorite part is the beautifully bizarre pursuit scenes at the corridors. Fincher uses odd camera angles, a unique cinematic vertiginous experience. Personally, as a Alien movie and also as a science fiction, I found everything. Entertainment, horror, suspense... Alien 3 is my favorite movie in the series by far, we have different tastes.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thrilling  and claustrophobic third installment in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on an isolated  planet prison,"Ripley continues to be stalked by a savage alien, after her escape pod crashes on a prison planet inhabited by fanatic inmates (a British cast formed by Paul McGann , Brian Glover , Ralph Brown , Danny Webb , Pete Postlethwaite and Charles Dance as a doctor) led by Dillon (Charles S Dutton) , the leader of a religious cult .

It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s and 90s. The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters .The concept by Vincent Ward based on which the movie was green-lighted involved an artificially constructed wooden planetoid and a group of monks who thought they were living in post-apocalyptic dark ages, and had a middle-ages lifestyle ; the group refused all kinds of modern technology, and when Ripley and the Alien crash-land on it, they would blame Ripley for the Alien attacks. Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien and with breathtaking scenes that took various weeks to film . The original budget was $45 million which included Sigourney Weaver's fee of $5.5 million , the budget soon spiraled however, with first Renny Harlin and then Vincent Ward both leaving the project before novice feature film director David Fincher came on board . Sigourney Weaver had a clause in her contract specifying that Walter Hill and David Giler would write the final shooting script. Weaver has said that she considers Ripley a very difficult character to write, and, with the exception of James Cameron, only Giler and Hill have really ever written the character correctly. The picture packs an original music by Elliot Goldenthal , plenty of frightening and moving sounds . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Alex Thomson , this cinematographer replaced Jordan Cronenweth after only two weeks of filming, after he began to suffer the onset of Parkinson's Disease . Sets were toned down in scale and a more claustrophobic shooting approach with a lot of close-ups to characters' faces was taken . On the set at Pinewood Studios, a giant lead foundry took 12 weeks to construct and put the production way behind . In wide shots, most of the refinery is actually made of cardboard . The motion picture was professionally directed by David Fincher and spent over a year in editing . Although this was first-time director David Fincher disowned the film, citing constant studio interference and actually walked out of production before editing began. Because of continuing troubles with the film, Fox halted production in Pinewood Studios in England in late 1991 ; the crew returned to LA, and an initial screening identified the missing parts of the film. A major part yet to be shot included killing of the alien in the lead pool .The gaps between the four Alien films steadily decreased. There was seven years between the release of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), six between Aliens and Alien 3 (1992), and five between Alien³ and Alien resurrection (1997).

Why bother?,"Alien and Aliens are two of the finest films I've ever seen. The first is a twisting thriller with a class act storyline.

Certainly not the mess it is still considered to be by many,"After the overwhelming success of James Cameron's follow-up to Ridley Scott's creature feature classic Alien, the direction in which the franchise could go from there was a mystery. Surprisingly, 20th Century Fox made the risky move of hiring an untried director who had made a name for himself in music videos, but didn't have a feature to his name. That man was David Fincher, and the experience almost turned him off movies for good. Frustrated by studio interference, constant script rewrites and budget issues, Fincher turned his back on the film once it hit the editing room, and has since disowned the film completely. The result was a box-office disappointment which received mostly negative reviews, possibly the result of an unyielding, miserable tone, or the fact that the final product was stitched together from scenes shot during an incredibly problematic production.Even in a series that includes Alien: Resurrection and Prometheus, Alien 3 is still very much the dark horse of the bunch. Fans mostly loathe the film, but there are some who believe the film to be some sort of unrealised masterpiece. After all, this was made by the director who would go on to helm Se7en, Fight Club and Gone Girl, although you would never guess it. I sit somewhere in between. 2003's 'Assembly Line' cut (which Fincher refused to take part in) establishes some much-needed coherency, bulking up the role of Paul McGann's character and introducing more fluidity to the story. The new cut certainly doesn't cover up the movie's main issues, but it is a refreshingly downbeat spectacle, reasserting the alien's genetic superiority and terrifying prowess after Cameron's entry blew a small army of them away in spectacular fashion. There are also some terrific performances by a mainly British cast.Alien 3 didn't do itself any favours by killing off fan favourites Hicks (Michael Biehn) and Newt (Carrie Henn) during the very first scene. After narrowly escaping with their lives following the events of Aliens, an alien egg inexplicably found itself on board their ship, hatching while the crew slept in stasis. An escape pod containing Hicks, Newt, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the mangled android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) is launched when a fire starts on board, eventually landing on 'Fury' 161, a penal colony and lead-smelting works housing sex offenders and murderers of the worst kind. Led by the imposing Dillon (Charles S. Dutton), the inmates have also turned to God. They are all bar-coded and shaven- headed due to a lice infestation, and look like they haven't seen the sun in years. Ripley, the only survivor, confides in prison doctor Clemens (Charles Dance), who is willing to perform an autopsy on the dead to ensure no alien lives inside of them. He also displays a bar-code.Of course, it isn't long until another alien has hatched and is hunting down any poor sap in its way, as it seeks to reproduce and overrun. Writers David Giler, Walter Hill and Larry Ferguson made the correct choice in returning to the series' routes with a lone alien stalking its prey. Cameron went bigger, but you can't really go any bigger than that. Fincher stages some scary set-pieces, particularly one involving a terrified Paul McGann and very close encounter for Ripley. The main issue lies in between these moments, with the film too busy establishing the new setting, introducing an all-new cast of characters, and bridging the gap between the end of the second movie and the beginning of this to gather any real momentum. Fury 161 is also a horrible place to spend over two hours in, especially with the threat of rape and murder at every turn. With the Assembly Cut now the definitive version, Alien 3 is certainly not the complete mess it is still considered to be by many. It's rough and ugly, yes, but this arguably adds more grit and ferocity to the terror. It's hard to think of what could have been had Fox realised the talent they had on their hands.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated masterpiece...,"Everyone thinks this movie is a huge disappointment and one of the worst in the series. Are you kidding me? This film is incredible. Not only does it go back to the horror of the first film, it invents new brilliant ideas. Like the Xeynomorph being impregnated in a dog (or cow, depending on which version you see), and taking features of that creature. The setting is incredible. Isolated and eery. The new additional characters are great. Clemens and Dillan are awesome and complex characters that add to the story. Ripley could not be better. Sigourney gives an emotionally empowering performance. I think it's the best she's ever been. The additional conflict with the company is incredible. People who say that there didn't need to be another movie after Aliens don't realize that the conflict with the company wasn't resolved in that film. This film not only expands upon it, but also concludes it in the best possible way. I absolutely love Alien³. My second Favourite in the series. I don't get why people hate this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a waste...,"The low point of the Alien series.  From the obvious continuity goofs while the opening credits are rolling to the ridiculous ending, this is just pure, stinky cinematic cheese.The xenomorphs deserved better than this pile of crap.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Massively underrated. Silly, silly people.","Make no mistake; Alien 3 has flaws, all of which are right up on the screen for you to see and hear. Noted for having a script which was being written alongside principle photography - it shows: Dialogue swings from great to terrible in a heartbeat, identikit prisoners suddenly start to develop a glimmer of character.....then vanish without a trace. Vincent Ward's original idea sounded brilliant but gutless suits saw fit to butcher it and force out a rushed lovechild of the first two films (one alien/bigger group of humans). The best example of the problematic script comes when Dillon asks Ripley how she got impregnated by the alien and she replies with; ""I don't know, in hypersleep I guess."" For a franchise that had already built an established mythology that simply wasn't good enough. I saw it when I was fifteen (just managed to pass for eighteen) and even then I could tell it had problems.......but I absolutely loved it.All these negative reviews are understandable but have any of you seen the restored version? Probably not. If you still haven't seen this film then ONLY watch that version as the original cut has the biggest plot hole of all time. I feel that with this newer version Alien 3 can be enjoyed for what it is: Dark, viciously nihilistic, visually stunning, atmospheric and a great standalone sci-fi film. No, it doesn't sit very well with Alien and Aliens, and Fincher was obviously up against it the whole time, but a poor film? No. Too much hard work and style is present and correct for that to be true. You people do disappoint me so.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Audience Friendly,"It is not surprising that the fans of the first two films hate this one and the haters of the first two films love this one.It is a dark, brooding, ugly, depressingly good film on its own.

It is the prison planet that orbits in Hell that is the focus of the story and we are the voyeuristic visitors.When the devil arrives everything is destroyed and everyone has to honor their contract with the Prince of Darkness. Although Ripley will be resurrected since she was the sacrificial lamb.This is not an audience friendly film, it is an exercise in Gothic Antichrist behaviorism and grotesques.

"Not in the same class as Alien and Aliens, but better than its reputation","I have heard and seen a lot of negative reviews on this film, and while I can understand the reviewers' disappointments I think Alien 3 is a much better film than it is given credit for. True, the script is not as strong, being not as thought-provoking or as clever, the story does have its illogical parts(I can understand why people are upset at two characters being killed off, it was somewhat contradictory) and the characters aren't as well fleshed out as in the predecessors excepting Ripley and even she was better developed before. However, I do disagree it is one of the worst sequels ever, there are much worse I can think of. Yes it is the weakest of the series, but that's not to say it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The production design is excellent, and the editing is also skilled. David Fincher also does a surprisingly good job directing, by principally developing the maternal themes of Aliens. He has directed better, and he has done better films since, but that is no reason to dismiss his credible directing job on this film. The atmosphere once again is bold, the tone and feel here is more dystopian granted but there are still some good shocks and some unforgettable scenes especially the surgical operating scene and the final showdown, the latter of which is exhilarating. The acting is good enough, Sigourney Weaver is very good, while Lance Henrikssen's brief appearance helps too. Oh, and the tag line is the best of all the Alien movies in my opinion. Overall, Alien 3 is not in the same class as its predecessors, but I personally wouldn't go as far to say it is one of the worst sequels or movies ever. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent mood but lack of storyline.,"First of all, this movie was so hard to shoot because of the back and forth with the Studio. Fincher, the cast and the crew started filming with the third of the script. That's basically the reason why the first hour of the final product is pretty decent.That being said, the second half (not including the ending) looks like a big pile of improvised boring crap. Plus, the CGI is probably the worst work of all the franchise. The green screen réflexion on the monster is so obvious that it looks like it's made by a nerd in his basement.BUT! The mood, the lighting, the framing, the grittiness, the production design and even the actors intensity is sooooo cool.I.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Frustratingly dull, devoid of suspense, and lacks the fleshed out, likable characters of its predecessors.","The premise behind Alien 3 is interesting: Ripley is the only survivor when her ship crash lands on a prison planet full of murderers and rapists while an alien that somehow survived from Ripley's cashed ship starts wreaking havoc on the inmates. The scary thing is that there are no weapons on this planet. It's a throwback to the suspense of the first movie where all they had was a flamethrower, except in Alien 3 they don't even have that. So as you can assume, they're f*cked. Well unfortunately, so is this movie. It's really bad, and it pains me to say it; even the assembly cut. David Fincher disowns this movie because of the constant studio interference, but even then the worst part of the movie is its script. It's horrendous. Apparently they were doing rewrites as they were shooting the movie and you can tell. None of the characters are relatable (sans Ripley of course), and any time they start to build a character, they kill them off soon after. They're all one-dimensional to the point that it's impossible to care when the fifteen nameless bald guys get slaughtered, partially because you can't even tell them apart.It feels haphazardly thrown together. The pacing is terrible - it's slow and never gains any momentum. There's also nothing quotable in this movie. Nothing. The first two movies had countless quotable lines. This movie has exposition and boring conversations to fill in the gaps between the alien attacks. The alien itself looks like ass - they show it running around a couple times and it looks horrifically bad. They also show POV shots of the alien hunting these guys down which sucks away all the suspense. How can I be afraid of something when I know where it is the whole time? The atmosphere itself is drab and dark, which I wouldn't be opposed to if the movie itself wasn't so boring.On a positive note, the acting is quite good. Sigourney Weaver is great as usual, the preacher and the doctor (the two characters they try to flesh out) are very good. Even the nameless dumb bald guys are decent. The problem is when they say words. The dialogue is excruciatingly bad and the plot is a mess. Ripley isn't nearly as badass as she used to be; I don't care about anyone else so everything they say is just a waste of time. Because of this the movie feels like it's three hours long. The ending is okay I guess; I like how Lance Henriksen was used, and there are a couple scenes that showed promise. But as a whole, it's physically draining to watch. It's especially painful watching it after Alien and Aliens - both of which were riveting from beginning to end - and this dull piece of crap comes along and sucks the life right out of you. In short, Alien 3 is exhaustingly bad. I recommend this only to Alien completists, and even then you'd probably want to forget this one ever happened.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a masterpiece, but better than I remembered.","And I didn't remember much as it had been 20 years or so since I last saw Alien 3. It flows nicely from the previous film - Ripley and the surviving crew from ""Aliens"" were homeward bound but tragically crash on a barren planet which is being utilized as a prison for hardcore criminals. What luck! And it is a prison which holds nothing but cheeky white Brits and...Charles S. Dutton. Hilarious. The CGI in this was pretty terrible at times. However, our alien friend generally looks great and is pretty terrifying, and the action is quite a lot of fun. Alien is a masterpiece. This is not, and 7 stars is being quite generous.

Deceiving a lot for all the fans of Alien,"Recently, I bought the Alien Quadrilogy collection (I already saw Alien and Alien: Resurrection on TV by the way) I saw Aliens, and it's an incredibly good movie. However, about Alien³, I found the experience very deceiving, cause there's very less action and horror comparing to the 2 first movies, not to mention that on the planet, there's no weapons or modern technology, which makes the film too obscure and fade for the genre.When Newt and Hicks died in the beginning of the film, I felt sorry for them, but we didn't need a so bad conclusion about all the survivors of the Sulaco. Another thing that deceived me is Lance Henriksen's role as Bishop II, the human inventor of the synthetic Bishop. He told that he was working for the Company, and he wants the Alien queen who's growing inside of Ripley. The synthetic was by the side of Ellen Ripley, and now his creator is against her... This makes nonsense, and the whole experience shocked me a little when watching it.Oh yes, I saw the special edition of Alien³, and it's far beyond worse than the original film. What a waste of time it was this bunch of acid that falls on your face...Also, I had the SNES game years ago, and it was very good: we had many Aliens, a new one (the Mother Alien), the same weapons that we saw in previous films and all the stuff that can please you in an action/sci-fi/horror movie. But Alien³ doesn't have this famous stuff, what makes it a deceiving movie.It's so bad that without this heap crap, Alien: Resurrection wouldn't exist, but now I agree that Alien³ shouldn't exist either. If you want to watch all the Alien movies, ignore this worthless one...Steve Baillargeon",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The only tragedy is that we had to wait so long for the special edition,"Alien 3 is probably the most misunderstood movie of all time. The thing is, I think that most people in life just jump on the bandwagon, if they hear that a movie is getting bad reviews, then that is what they expect to see. The characters in this movie are fantastic, the story is original, the ideas and dialogue are engaging and the script is well thought out by some very clever people. OK, it had a few rewrites and killed off the survivors from the second movie....who cares? These days, foreign movie makers aren't afraid to kill the main character or do something with their movie that doesn't follow what most people want to see. This movie took a risk and tried something different and I'm very glad for it. 'Aliens' is dated. It's OK as far as the Quadrilogy goes, but it's a little bit tame and cheesy by todays standards. Alien & Alien 3 has aged just fine and are generally for the adults. There aren't enough movies like Alien 3 out there or enough movie companies with the balls to do something different. Alien 3...... best out of them all and an absolute joy to watch. Absorbing, tense, frightening, thrilling and thought provoking with many underlying ideas that makes you notice something new each time you watch it.

Assembly Cut version,"The most scathing criticisms of ""Alien³"" (1992) often begin with the phrase, ""Directed by David Fincher..."" This is rather ironic, considering that before this film, Fincher's most notable achievement was directing George Michael's ""Freedom! '90"" music video. This wasn't the David Fincher who would later helm ""Se7en."" In fact, had it not been for ""Alien³,"" Fincher's career might have remained confined to the realm of commercials and music videos, forever denied the opportunity to command substantial budgets.In the 1990s, a golden age of cinema, entrusting a project of this magnitude to a 30-year-old commercial director, amidst a sea of seasoned filmmakers, was a risk we're unlikely to witness in today's industry.The ""Alien Quadrilogy"" was always intended to be four distinct Alien films from four vastly different filmmakers. Each film was conceived as a standalone entity, a sequel in name only. This explains the absence of certain elements from previous films, such as Newt in this installment.The perceived weakness of the Golic character, a pivotal figure in the film, is due to the production company's heavy-handed editing. Additionally, the film attempts to solidify the events within a historical context, a depth not seen in the previous films. The religious references and background details serve this purpose. However, many of these were also cut, leaving us with a minimalist film focused solely on the plot. Fincher himself never complained about any ""excess"" in the film; on the contrary, he was frustrated that it had been reduced to a mere shadow of its former self. Watching the complete version and behind-the-scenes footage in the ""Alien Quadrilogy"" reveals Fincher's true intentions. I, for one, always seek out alternative versions of his films.While the film's departure from the style of previous Alien films doesn't inherently make it a bad film, it's still often viewed negatively (I believe ""Alien Resurrection"" also suffers from undue criticism). Despite being David Fincher's first Hollywood film, it contains all the elements that would become synonymous with his signature style: a claustrophobic, dark atmosphere. Instead of a gore-fest action film, he crafted a suspenseful thriller reminiscent of the first ""Alien,"" and in my opinion, he succeeded. The only downside, in my view, is the film's slow pacing.Ideally, each Alien film should be evaluated on its own merits, as there's no clear, overarching continuity between them. (Even ""Alien Resurrection,"" often considered the weakest of the series, has its own merits.) If this project were presented to David Fincher today, with his current resources and influence, a remake would undoubtedly surpass the original. But what we have is what we have.In the series' most gothic installment, the element I personally find most jarring is the religious references, although they do have a certain narrative consistency within the film.In my view, ""Alien³"" is a misunderstood gem. It's a testament to Fincher's unique vision and his ability to create a sense of dread and unease even within the confines of a troubled production. While it may not be the most beloved entry in the franchise, it's a film that deserves a second look, particularly in its Assembly Cut form.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I feel like Annie Wilkes from Misery...,"I would like to begin by pointing out the most glaring error of this movie--the Queen Alien simply could not have brought eggs on board.  I have watched both Aliens and Alien 3 enough to know.  Either she laid them (which could not have happened since we saw her after she exited the drop-ship, and she probably needed her reproductive apparatus), or she carried them on board (another impossibility, she wasn't holding them, and even if she was and simply tossed them out while the camera wasn't looking, why would the blasted face-huggers wait for the 30 min - 1 hr period it would take for Ripley to shower, change, fix Hicks up, clean poor Bishop up, and enter the cryo-tube before they {or it} jumped out to latch on.  That is assuming they even found their way to a part of the ship close enough to the cryo-tubes.)  Phew!  I feel like Annie Wilkes from Misery when she railed about the chapter plays--that simply isn't what happened. As a friend of mine pointed out, 20th Century Fox needed to know then they didn't need Ripley to continue the series.  The need to include (and bump off) the series' leading lady landed them in that difficult, albeit impossible storytelling position. Alien 3's previews hinted at a possible earth-battle, the epic Alien story we all imagine in the future, but it obviously failed to deliver. The special effects of the alien were sadly lacking in this film--the prequels succeeded far better. The feel of the movie is somewhat unusual, dreamlike, but not what I would call good or bad. I do believe the movie's attempt to provide modernism is a little over the top.  My goodness, Alien and Aliens weren't ""overly Romantic"" because Ripley survived.  Good Lord, virtually everyone died in each film!  To the remainder of the character, Hicks, Newt, and unfortunately Ripley was truly a waste to me.  It totally nullified the second film. It cheaply tried to mimic the first film by providing the suspense of a hopeless group stumbling in the dark against the perfect predator.  All too familiar, right?  The other films at least tried to add to the series with some new idea. I can't totally bash the move though.  It does continue the tradition of providing colourful characters, although they all do perish. My overall thoughts--the movie, apart from the series, could stay afloat as a B class science fiction thriller.But it fails miserably as an attempt to carry on the series called ""The Alien Legacy.""  It attempts to be so much, but achieves so little... My suggestion--watch it and attempt to wade through the pretense.  But watch the other three, too, because... We know Alien can do better!",,Anonymous,Horror
Overhated?,"Note: this is a review of the 2003 ""Assembly Cut"" of the film. David Fincher has publicly disowned ""Alien 3"", so the hope of an actual director's cut is pretty much gone. But that's okay because this version restores much of the cut content from the film based off notes that Fincher left behind.""Alien 3"" is infamous for numerous conflicts between a revolving door of directors and the studio, and multiple rewrites that often ended up with filming being done alongside the script being written. It's a miracle that this movie ended up even being completed and is available as complete as it is. Even with the ""Assembly Cut"", though, it still feels a bit hollow and rushed like there's a lack of soul and vision. Which is a shame because you can tell that this has the potential to be an awesome film with a religious subtext and the idea of life cycles and death and rebirth. What we get is very poorly developed characters. The most well-developed character (aside from Sigourney Weaver's Ripley) doesn't get nearly as much screen time as they should. As for Ripley, Weaver's performance is a little more understated than in the previous film. Not bad here though.The nitpicks people have with this film are a little irksome to me. I feel like killing off Newt, Hicks, and Bishop early on wasn't really a bad decision, this series is mostly centered around Ripley's interaction with the xenomorph above all else. ""Aliens"" also kicked off with a completely new supporting cast, so I don't really see what the issue is here. The change in tone is also a little bit of a questionable criticism considering the fact that both of the previous films were about as far apart from each other in tone as you can get, yet somehow both are equally as awesome as each other.The main thing that bothers me about ""Alien 3"" is that it clearly has the potential for a lot more, and I imagine could have been a very interesting play on something like ""Dante's Inferno"" as a sort of gothic horror sci-fi classic. What we got isn't terrible but it ends up being a generic sort of horror slasher film not unlike a ""Friday the 13th"" movie where the majority of the characters' sole purpose is to end up as xeno lunch. David Fincher would go on to create classics such as ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club""; three great directors in this series making three distinctly feeling films across three different decades makes for a great trilogy. The Ripley/xenomorph saga continues after this, but in my opinion this is where they should have ended it.Probably only for ""Alien"" and David Fincher completionists. It's not a film I'd recommend seeing if you hadn't seen the first two. And it's not nearly as good as the first two either. If you want more Ripley story, you won't think it's terrible. Just lower your expectations a little bit going into it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary. Bold. Triumphant.,"Alien was fantastic. Aliens was amazing. And for David Fincher's first ever film, he did a rather fantastic job. Alien 3 is still one of the scariest, tense, and satisfying film I've seen in quite some time. For a movie fanatic, Alien 3 is one of those films that sticks with you, whether you liked it or you hated it. I of course gobbled this one right up. The ending particularly was somewhat satisfying and heroic.As the third installment to the 'Alien Quadrilogy' (or now 'quintology', now that Prometheus has landed) Ripley survives a brutal crash-landing on a foreign planet that is used to keep in some of the most dangerous convicts off of earth. What she's unaware of, is that an alien egg from the previous film has landed in her ship (most likely from the queen) has impregnated another organism on the planet, and has created a very lethal, hungry, and peeved off son of a *beep*.Sigourney Weaver returns to the role of female protagonist Ellen Ripley, and even has calm affections for the medical doctor, Clemens, played by the wonderful Charles Dance. Ripley strikes me as a god like figure; the entire fact that she descended from the sky, and changed everything about these men, who have seek-ed god in the shaft of their ruin. She tells them to stand and fight back, in the time where a great evil is upon them. At the end, she takes the position of crucified, very much like the human race has pinned her to the cross. So there was a lot of religious references, which made it out to be more of a human apocalyptic movie, rather than a story about motherhood. And of course, the movie is also about the human soul, in terms of Ripley's soul infected by an evil that has grasped her heart.The dialog was great- I particularly liked listening to Dillon's speech, especially towards the final act. Speaking of which, there was a lot of climax, and the tunnel sequence especially was adrenaline rushing, as well as it being the scariest scene in the film. We see more of the alien, as a kind of scary, jack-o-lantern, spindly lethal creature, that could very easily hibernate in your closet wardrobe. I also loved Sigourney's ability to seem powerful in scene with out the Alien- and even show her vulnerability during Clemens' death scene; which was such an iconic ten seconds, and tense, as you were completely clueless as to what would happen next. Aside from the fact that you couldn't tell one bloody prisoner from the other, I really did enjoy this movie more than I can say. Alien Resurrection did make this movie seem better, in a way. It made Alien 3 more climactic, somehow.This film really is a worthy master piece, and should be acknowledged in all great movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The 'special edition' is quite good.,"I've heard nothing but bad things about the notoriously troubled production of 'Alien³ (1992)', as well as the chopped-up product released because of it. However, my take on the piece is significantly kinder. Perhaps it's because the 'special edition' cut (which is the only version I've seen) is more reminiscent of Fincher's initial vision, a slow-burning and often bold horror that attempts to take the franchise back to the 'one alien' style of its first entry. For the most part, it succeeds. It has a dark, near nihilistic tone and a distinctly 'grungy' aesthetic. It also has a bevy if decently developed side characters and a few genuinely suspenseful sequences. Charles Dance is particularly good in the piece, and the film wisely does some relatively ballsy things with his character. It isn't perfect, of course. It's slow and never reaches the heights of its predecessors. Still, it stands on its own as an engaging thriller. Perhaps the initial cut really is as bad as they say, but this version is actually pretty good. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clean slate,"Seems like David Fincher would be able to do something completely different nowadays, than what they allowed him to do back then. Even the Special Edition I watched seems broken up in many ways and I suppose not exactly what he imagined doing. Many influences made this a mixed bag of a lot of things. Some actually work and there is enough suspense here. Not to mention an amazing cast too.But there are also inconsistencies all over the place. Going places and doing some back and forth. But having Ripley back (continues from Aliens, though don't expect others from that movie - for reasons shown in the first minutes during some interesting title sequence) really helps elevate the movie. There are many theories and there are many things made out of the Alien universe.

See the Special Edition - it's great!,"Wow - just watched Alien 3 for the first time since I was about 12 years old. Blew me away how much I enjoyed it! After re-watching Fight Club and Se7en recently, I remembered that there was an Alien movie directed by David Fincher and thought holy cow, I gotta re-watch that one. Alien 3 definitely gets way better when you're older. As a kid, I just remember it being dark, gloomy, slow and boring compared to Aliens. It matures with age. I was riveted from beginning to end, and I was surprised how unpredictable and surprising the kills were! Some bits really surprised and shocked me as people were picked off. Ripley looks so hard and cool with the shaved head look too, you don't see female heroes like that anymore, just women like Angelina Jolie in ""Salt"". It also reminded me of the dark, gritty, gloomy graphic novels I like - it looks like a living breathing graphic novel. I only realised after watching it that I'd seen the Special Edition that restores extra scenes that David Fincher wanted in there - I must recommend the Special Edition, without these scenes ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alien+3+scenes&aq=f ) I can imagine the film would feel shallower and rushed.**spoiler**I also liked the idea that the Alien wouldn't touch Ripley because it knew she was breeding the Queen. It is an extremely dark film though especially how we have to sit through an autopsy of Newt within the first 15 minutes! The way the countdown is happening to the arrivial of the Weylon-Utani ""rescue team"" reminded me of the plot of the recent Sam Rockwell film ""Moon"".**end of spoiler**Wow, all I can say I really enjoyed it a lot, and surprised at the dreadful reviews on IMDb. I think Fincher takes way too much stick for this one. Compared to the Alien movies that followed, this is easily a masterpiece.

"Alien and Aliens is Overrated, and Aliens 3 Underrated.","I've done a simple review about the two first movies, saying they're overrated for a series of reasons. Simply, they're not as perfect as people say.But Aliens 3 ain't that bad as people say neither.In Aliens 3, the black and blue atmosphere is shifted for a black and yellow. This represents better a prison and the best part: YOU CAN SEE WHATS HAPPENING ON THE MOVIE, what was the worse about the first movies (that was not scary, it was confusing).Of course ain't just that what makes me say Aliens 3 is underrated. But its because the first movies aren't that amazing. Aliens 3 had the capability to surprise me, what didn't happened watching its predecessors. It has lots more fun and action, and since Alien and Aliens didn't scared me a s**t, why would I consider the series as a thriller? Alien 3 has some similarities with first and second movie, even though it is a whole different one. By that I mean: alien will keep killing for fun, such as the company trying to protect it. But except that you will almost don't recognize it.In aliens 1 and 2, producers have gave to good actors forgettable characters, and in Alien 3, producers have gave to forgettable actors, pretty good characters. Even though those actors doesn't give us they best performances.As in Alien 3 as in Alien and Aliens, soundtrack doesn't do much beyond follow the film, so, don't expect to much from it.One problem I've had to notice in Alien 3 is the free gore stupid parts, like someone exploding when crashing into a real slow fan. We could pass without this.Since the first movies didn't leave any of those character in my memory i'm pretty sure I'm gonna remember some from Alien 3, because they were different, more original i'd say.Alien 3 has its issues, I must say that, but i can't talk about them without leaving you spoilers, but if people say those extremely boring first movies are so F*****g amazing, why tha hell would Alien 3 be so bad?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Part Three... Still Going Strong?,"Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crashes on a planet populated entirely by prisoners. Her crew is dead, and she must now take up residence among rapists and murderers until a rescue ship arrives. Unfortunately, she is not the only living thing that survived the crash.The question you have to first ask is this: can first-time director David Fincher adequately handle the directing ability after such great films from James Cameron and Ridley Scott? A third film could have easily crashed and burned, but Fincher is a man to be reckoned with and admirably keeps this one afloat. Perhaps not the best in the series, but respectably good by ""part three"" standards.Starting from scratch (the crew is dead and the scenery is new), Fincher is free to create his own little world, and he does. This film is less claustrophobic than the first two, but more dystopian in many ways. Also, perhaps more importantly, it is the transition point in the series from science fiction to horror. (The whole series falls into both, but with the levels of blood and gore exponentially larger here, there's no question of this story's genre).Perhaps the only thing that could have been improved was the utilization of the prisoners. There is one minor ""attack"" scene, but overall the people could have been any sort of breed and the story would not change. What would have aided this film is a full-scale riot or jailbreak. Imagine Batman having to face everyone in Arkham Asylum -- here it would be Ripley against scores of killers while simultaneously trying to stop an alien infestation! Howard Maxford calls the film ""imperfectly scripted"" and Mike Mayo points out his opinion that it ""went through several writers and directors and emerged as a fairly unintelligible mess."" Could it be better? Yes. But I think looking back now, it's not as bad as made out to be.While the theme and feel of the film is not spot-on with the first two, it still is a decent incarnation in the ""Alien"" story, and having Lance Henriksen briefly appear kept the continuity strong. You cannot have an ""Alien"" film without Sigourney Weaver, but the more you invite back, the better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
BIG disappointment,"Well, after you watch this one it really makes Aliens seem a lot less enjoyable to watch since you now know that Nute and Hicks both die at the beginning of the this one.

Alien³ : Assembly Cut,"If you're going to watch Alien³ then you owe it to yourself to watch the Assembly cut.Some of the digital special effects aren't great and do stick out - but given the fact this cut somehow managed to exist and that it corrects so much from the theatrical version, they are a minor burden to bare.It's not a perfect movie by any means, but there is an entertaining and engaging movie with a tragic continuation to Ellen Ripley's story that I think many Alien & Aliens fans can enjoy, provided they are willing to take the troubled production of the movie into consideration.I stress once again, Alien³ -Assembly Cut- is the version you should aim to see first and foremost.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lightness in the dark?,"This is my favourite Alien film. There I said it; a controversial statement among hardened series fans. I have recently made this decision having watched them all in close succession (though I must confess to watching them in reverse order).It sits as the black sheep of the set and the whole piece has been a magnet for negativity from the start. The film had a troubled and fractious production through business and creative conflicts which lead to negative remarks from cast and crew, and then once released, the series' fanboys were quick to condemn it. So if these two expectedly loyal groups offer little enthusiasm towards the film then why is it my favourite this time round?The most noticeable thing about this instalment is that it's dark. But not straight-up black like a Tim Burton film, more an unsettling exchange of brown and grey expressed through the industrial surroundings of a combined prison and lead smelting plant. The living quarters are lifeless grey brick rooms, flatly lit with a bare white light and the smelting plant's ominous rusty brown metal corridors offer a stark contrast with their dank, shadow rich environment. The lack of natural comfort continues beyond the facility's perimeter where, in the brief glimpses offered, we witness a ravaged and sterile planet, wrathfully weather-beaten with the only hint of softness offered from its dual suns, both large and ominous in view but soft in tone; their energy paling in comparison to the planet's atmospheric blockade and their nurture muted. To observe this level of ecological disarray from beneath a duvet is shear bliss.The score (Elliot Goldenthal) is great too, not amazing, just, 'right'. Its subtle composition uses dark orchestral tones trapped amongst an undulating synthesis to add to the unnatural atmosphere. I could imagine it has been filtered throughout to reduce high frequency content and minimise any potential brightness. The resulting soundscapes are well placed against the visuals and create an emotional extension and a sense of foreboding often felt more than heard. Hints of 'melody' and the wonderfully grave yet momentous theme offer more blatant orchestral prowess which really drives home some of the expressive moments. Indeed the climax of the film has one of my favourite (I have lots) thematic cues which is painfully snubbed in the directors cut by an attempt to improve on a slightly questionable ending.The framing and camera angles at times reflect on the director's music video experience, with cool and quirky camera angles that are effective in the confined spaces adding visual engagement to an action film surviving more on violent threat than realisation. A glut of low level shots leaves the viewer looking up at the surroundings feeling unnaturally small; at times this lends the characters a protective appeal as they tower above your vulnerable position in this hostile environment.The characters themselves are a grisly bunch; troubled souls, pushed to the outer fringe of civilisation, which in this futuristic setting is a whole other planet. They're 'scum' in the purest form and there's little to make you care about or like them. But I do, I warm to them and find their 'company' somehow satisfying. Maybe it's because I've seen it several times and am a little more familiar with them, maybe it's because Big Cuddly Clive from brit TV show Casualty is in it, or maybe it's because of those moments, where no matter how mean or evil they have professed to have been in the past, their human warmth and basic need for friendship, affection and simple help strengthens my earnest belief that within every thorny exterior, no matter how trapped it may seem, there is an innate vulnerability that can only be satisfied through the social rewards offered from positive behaviour.And I believe that is why it was my favourite installment this time.Reassurance.Alien 3's conflicting elements of dark and light, twisted and pure & 'good' and 'evil', combine effectively with its undulating levels of fear and security to offer a satisfying emotional engagement, negative on the surface, but with a hidden sanguinity. If you're watching this for Alien action then you may be disappointed, but if you're feeling bleak, alone or just a wee bit sinister then this could certainly be a satisfying watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as scary as the first one,"So, im a person who usually gets scared of every single little thing, in the first movie i had to open a chat nearby to feel a little less scared (getting my mind off the scary stuff) lol the 2nd was a bit less and the 3rd i was able to watch fully without that, not even one jumpscare, no scary moments, nothing, the movie didnt seem to actually have much suspense or anything, quite lame ._.the idea wasnt the worst, but i feel it could have been so much better if they put more time into it...
also the alien looked like *insert curse word here* compared to the first 2 movies where they were soooo awesome and perfect, it was such bad CGI that even that 2000s godzilla movie looks great compared to thatBUT

"Great atmosphere, yet not Alien worthy","For me a good sequel needs to have new things, and it should not be a rehash of it's prequel. That's the problem with Alien3. Alien was a great movie, the Alien is one of the coolest movie monsters ever created (together with Predator). Aliens improved on this by adding a lot of new cool things, most noticeable the Alien Queen. Alien3 doesn't add anything new. Well, there is the queen parasite, and the new alien is a ""dog Alien"" (makes you wonder what the Alien from the space jocks (Alien 1) looks like...), but these are so insignificantly. So we're stuck with a been-there-done-that monster-chasing-victims movie. Still the movie is fun, and it looks absolutely awesome (great atmosphere). Not the crappy movie you might expect, but not a worthy addition to the Alien series too. Go see parts 1,2 and 4 !",,Anonymous,Horror
Needs a Real Fincher Cut,"I like Alien 3 - it is not as suspenseful as Alien and not action packed like Aliens but still it got a good production, cast and the story is solid. I read somewhere that the production company forced many changes on David Fincher, so I would really like to watch a ""real"" director's cut made with or at least with the approval of Mr. Fincher. Anyway, the published version (including the extended cut) are solid and still more entertaining as many other sci-fi movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very mixed but kinda good anyway,"So so much to say about this movie, so hard to say anything without spoiling it. Okay first of watch the assembly cut, all versions of this movie are flawed but the assembly cut is the least. This movie has aged awfully, while the first 2 look almost modern day with realistic aliens that look better than most modern cgi, this movie looks very jarringly fake. The fire looks laughably bad and the aliens look like the hounds from ghostbusters. The horror of this film also isn't great. The first 2 aliens while not exactly being scary have lots of very tense moments you're always constantly on your toes wondering where the alien is and what it will do. This isn't really the case for this movie. Most alien scene in this movie are ridiculously predictable, you almost always know where the alien is and if you don't die to how little of the layout is known it's hard to feel invested on the aliens location as there isn't really direct locations to relate to. This movie is best explained as a more slasher aproach, where alien one is a suspenseful thriller/horror, aliens is a action suspense movie this one is bassically a slasher with little suspense. Finally while this movie has a couple cliffhangers and the intro will most likely turn a lot of people off the movie. The story is very good for the most part. Had this movie had more time worked on and been more suspenseful this would be a really good closure for the trilogy. The story is surprisingly epic, bleak, tragic and somewhat satisfying. I think the story is far from amazing but I think it does a good job of closing the franchise and do enjoy it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I did like it, but there are some things that could have been better","Seeing the movie when it came out, i did already appreciate the different style and setting in the alien series.
The thought of having to fight the alien without weapons, and in an environment where the people could be your enemy too, was very interesting to me.
Very original indeed.Now it sure was a change from Alien and Aliens, but if they had made a movie in the same style as any of those two movies, it would not have been cool i think.What i did not like though was the fact that a lot of the prisoners in the movie were portrayed as quite daft/ dumb.All in all i think it is definitely worth a 7. If they had made a bit more interesting characters in the movie, this could have been an 8 or even a 9 in my opinion.The acting of the main actors was credible for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Production chaos made lacking theatric, redeemed on disc","""Alien 3"" became David Fincher's debut on the big screen, which definitely opened the door for him to direct stellar movies like ""Se7en"" and more. When you take the production with constant changes, delays and conflicts into mind it is not surprising the result becomes uneven. After the masterpieces of the first and second movies one cannot help but look at the theatrical cut as unfinished, thin and something that could have been so much more. (It is redeemed with the later re-releases).I still don't view ""Alien 3"" as a bad film, the plot has a point, the actors do well given the time they are given on screen, Weaver gives a great performance as always and the real enemy is present - the Company. Sadly enough key characters are killed off in a quick, bad manner which makes the remaining ones blur together.Overall the ending makes for a fitting conclusion for the series overall, the circus of the 4th film should be considered stand-alone. Some people described the end as a loss, to me it's a win, the real enemy is defeated (the company rather than the creature) which gives the movie a redeeming factor. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't succeed like its two predecessors,"While ""Alien"" (1979) was the first film of the saga to make me fall in love with the Horror/Sci-Fi genre, people told me about the first sequel ""Aliens"" (1986) and how amazing it was from the action and special effects. Somehow my classmate from middle school had to bring me Alien 3 in which he was too cheap to show me the first outstanding sequel.Grrr, I still hate him! Alien 3 takes place after the event of ""Aliens"" where the remaining survivors crash land on another planet with Ripley being the lone survivor realizing she's at a prison. There are no guns, no axes, no kind of weapons for the guards to defend themselves. Sigourney Weaver plays the lone hero where she thinks that despite being a prisoner, all of her problems are gone where maybe none of the creatures would return...Yet...A face-hugger manages to hijack on the ship where Ripley is sleeping before going after its first victim and later creating the famous monster creature. The alien goes after the prisoners and guards in the detention center where Ripley must find a way for her and the survivors to take on the single beast.Alien 3 doesn't have the same thrills and drama as the first movie nor the horror and action of the first sequel where fans would go back and take a look at these marvelous scenes. There's not even a character to cheer for or admire unlike Aliens where people would say how much they'd admire Hudson, Hicks, Vazquez or any of the supporting characters besides Ripley.What a shame!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not perfect, but misunderstood and underrated","I love all four Alien films. Each are so unique and different from one another. Yes, they are all installments in the same series, but each director managed to bring something new to the series. Newcomer David Fincher had the daunting task of creating a film that was supposed to live up to the brilliant previous efforts of Ridley Scott and James Cameron.Does he succeed? Well, in many respects, he does. This Alien film is much more like the first one than it's action packed sequel, and I'm glad the decision was made not to make an action packed rehash of ""Aliens"".The biggest problem with Alien 3 is it's inability to prompt genuine suspense or fright. The scenes where the Xenomorph attacked the prisoners were mind-numbingly predictable, and the early CG effects were far less effective than the puppetry and stunt-men in costume from the previous films.It's biggest strength is it's human apocalypse angle. This is much more fleshed out in the superior Assembly Cut, my preferred cut of the film. The dark tone and grit is wonderful, and you feel true empathy for the character of Ripley, once again brilliantly portrayed by the incomparable Sigourney Weaver.This film is probably considered worse than it's predecessors because it wasn't what audiences were expecting, especially after the action-fest that was ""Aliens"". They were expecting something along those lines, not the bleak and depressing human journey presented here. But when viewed in it's own light, it stands quite strong, and is a worthy addition to the Alien Legacy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you want to enjoy it, watch the special edition.","Don't know about the theatrical cut, but after reading reviews, I watched the special edition.It's pretty good, considering you expect a dip in quality by the third movie. Granted, there wasn't much of a dip from the second film. It's actually pretty entertaining, the film is more of a slow burn but I gotta say the about extra half hour runtime does help with fleshing everyone out.The story is simple, but that's not a bad thing.The biggest negative about the film is the CGI. In 1992 it was still in its infancy and using it here for the majority of the film for the Alien definitely makes its appearance inferior on screen, especially when compared to the first two which has it looking much better as an animatronic, puppet, human in suit use. Should've stuck with that honestly but I guess they were trying to save money.All in all might just still be better than Alien Covenant lol, at least with logical character choices.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ummmm... It sucked,"Alien was such a good movie... Aliens ALMOST topped it... but this?  What is this movie?  Where is the suspense?  The terror?  The awesome feeling you get from watching Alien for the first time?  It seems to me like this movie was targeted at 14 year olds (or immature adults for that matter) who like to see blood and people getting hacked up.  The beginning alone was awful. Everybody died!Producer: ""Hmm... since nobody wanted to remake a classic and they all hated the script, they refused to be in it... well, lets just MURDER THEM ALL AT THE BEGINNING""Anyways... This is a sad movie... and Alien Resurrection isn't a whole lot better.  The only value that this movie has is if you have a girlfriend who doesnt like blood... maybe she'll get closer to you... eh, but then she would break up with you cause you showed her such a stupid movie... what am I talking about...

Slightly underrated but still somewhat enjoyable,"After crashing on a prison planet, the lone woman there joins forces with the few male prisoners left to battle the voracious alien creature accidentally brought along with her that's them off one-by-one.This wasn't all that bad of an entry and is a surprisingly underrated effort. One of the better efforts here is that it's got some really decent stalking scenes among the prison set, including the fabulous set-ups in the ventilator shaft after finding skin on the ground before being attacked, a pretty tense altercation in the infirmary before an attack and a real rousing sequence where it escapes a trap and starts a massive chain reaction of explosions and fireballs through the facility that takes out most of the group being among the highlights here. Also helped along is a series of good stalking scenes, nicely done from the start through the intimidating, foreboding locations in the prison and the final plan to deal with the creature is great fun, with the corridor chases through the alien viewpoints, great kills and tense confrontations that are highly enjoyable, despite the few flaws present. The CGI for the alien is really embarrassing and makes no sense to be included, the prisoners are made so unknown they're barely worth remembering and their inclusion into the fighting stages in the second half is rather weak. The main weakness, though, comes from the fact that, against the others before it, it's really weak and doesn't really hold up with them. Still, overall, this one isn't bad if it's not measured up against the others.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worthy Addition to the Franchise,"I'm sure by now Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is just sick and tired of aliens... I'm not. She can't escape them no matter where she goes. At least in this episode we have a name for them: xenomorphs.Ripley's escape vessel crashed onto the planet Fiona ""Fury"" 161 that served as a refinery and a prison. She's in this isolated place with 25 double Y chromosome murderers and rapists. Maybe the aliens aren't such a bad alternative.She brought an unwelcome guest with her to Fiona 161 which means before the movie ends there will be a lot of corpses. But there's something different about Ripley; she's carrying a baby xenomorph within her. After all that running and fighting she ended up with one of those horrific creatures inside of her, but she has no plans to let it develop and tear its way out of her.""Alien 3"" was an awesome part three. In fact, had the Alien franchise stopped at three it would easily be one of the top trilogies all time. This part even gave us the iconic shot of the alien staring down Ripley as she faced forward, terror stricken.

As for other positives, I enjoyed the score and the fact that we (seemed to) get way more of the alien itself; which is what I wanted from the first two, personally.The plot isn't the greatest but is very watchable, the ending is pretty good. One criticism I do have is the dialogue, as alluded to at the top of my review. I've nothing against the use of swear words whatsoever, but man does this film overuse the f-word; it feels like every other word across the conclusion.Overall, it's a definite drop down from the two very good predecessors, though I still got the required entertainment from 'Alien³'.

"Fitting conclusion, doesn't deserve antipathy","Confession - I've never seen the theatrical cut of this film, only ever the Assembly Cut and because of that I've never understood the antipathy this film generates in people. It's almost great, and it's mostly really good.In terms of the overall storyline it feels like the most logical conclusion to the series. It's deeply, darkly nihilistic, but this is about the ultimate killing machine so it should be. All the characters from the last film had to be killed off because there is no happy ending as long as the Aliens are alive and Ripley knows it. She starts each film fresh, alone, her against the Alien. In order to stop it once and for all she makes the ultimate sacrifice, the martyrdom that the religious subtext and images are getting at. There's nothing left for her anymore, there never was in any film. This is the happy ending she deserves. She's a woman out of time and place that must make a selfless decision. It's a brilliantly fitting conclusion.Honestly the biggest problems here concern the surrounding setup plot and some of the direction. More explanation behind the Queen Alien laying facehugger (that needed a wiki to explain away). The romantic subplot with the doctor that ends abruptly then Ripley moves on too fast (then again, maybe she's used to it?). Why do all the prisoners look the same?The last half of the movie is paced poorly, with endless corridor chasing and trapping and running. It's clear based on this cut that Fincher was onto something but he wasn't the great director of precision he is now, at least in terms of suspense and thrills. The film is gorgeous to look at and the atmosphere is a bleak oppressive shroud you can wrap yourself up in.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A no-holds barred nightmare,"Alien 3 was originally centred on Aceron; a monastery satetille made of wood, inhabited by monks who had rejected all modern technology.However, in a case of the jitters, 20th Century Fox abandoned the ambitious, left-field vision of
writer/director Vincent Ward during production.The film released in theatres was sadly incoherent and poorly received, having been falsely marketed as a spiritual successor to Aliens.Nearly 30 years later, and with thanks to a restored edition, Alien 3 now has a legion of admirers. It offered a welcome return to the visceral horror of the first film; was innovatively shot, deliciously mean-spirited and beautifully acted throughout.High-octane, Hollywood thrills were replaced with gut-churning, nihilistic horror of the European variety. And the film boldly makes such intent clear very early on.A worthy ending for the character of Lt. Ellen Ripley, for its flaws.

"Very good movie, why all the hate?","I saw the theatrical version a few times before and never had the feeling that there would have been any problems with it. I always considered the third installment as a dark, thrilling Alien movie, absolutely deserving the Alien logo. Now I'm just trough the assembly cut, it was great too (wouldn't pick one).I read a few reviews and people are tearing the movie apart, usually for no obvious reason so I went researching. Reading all the trivia and the horrible conditions of production, I probably could understand that Fincher nearly bailed out (does not go for the original writers, who are now writing bogus as AVP), still, the end-result never left any obvious signs of the mess.Sigourney Weaver totally owns the movie as doing a seamless performance really showing heart and rock-solid professionalism, congratulations for that. The location is ideal for an Alien movie, a dark and remote labyrinth, what do you want more? The whole thing looks beautiful due to the top notch cinematography, which I'd consider as outstanding for '92. The monster effects are great as ever, but the ""new"" special effects are quite gross in certain shots (especially around the final). I think it is rather the blue-screen technology that looks messy, not the basic CGI which is actually okay (concidering '92 it's fine).It is obvious that Alien3 somewhat differs from its predecessors in terms of style. However, I find the new angle a very good and brave choice - Fincher does a dark thriller. An aspect that is usually missing in modern science-fiction/horror flicks.Regarding the characters, the minimal depth of the supporting cast is characteristic for the franchise, I wouldn't go there to mess with that, though I could imagine more interesting fellows then a group of religious space prisoners. Guess that's up to you. Otherwise, I found the character of Clerance very interesting and terrificly played by Charles Dance, actually the whole cast is pretty decent.Now, after the outstanding original - groundbreaking and still unmatched in style - and the epic sequel, I do not break out in euphoria seeing this movie, but it was a very good and fresh one with some great highs and minor lows, just fine for closing the original Alien TRILOGY - as I consider part 4 with genetically engineered superpower Ripley rather as a new generation of the franchise, along with the horrible AVP stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Missing one thing:,"Intrigue. In Alien, the characters don't know what they're getting into and the only reason the audience knows is because 1. The trailers, 2. the Title and 3. by now everyone knows the reputation of the film . . . and it was good. In Aliens the characters know the creature, and declare war neglecting to calculate the possible numbers they face . . . and it was good. In Alien 3 we get a prison. ""But they're not prepared! That's the intrigue,"" you say to which I would answer, ""If they were prepared there *couldn't* be a film. They'd take out the Alien in 10 minutes.""Alien 3 just cannot compete with its predecessors. The film is 'okay' and it's up against two of the most influential sci-fi horror films by Ridley Scott (the director with the slickest style) and James Cameran (one of the best action directors) scores composed by the legendary Goldsmith and Horner. . . Alien 3 has David Fincher and Elliot Goldenthal. Fincher is a good director, but outclassed by Scott & Cameran; Goldenthall has yet to impress me with one of his scores, and has yet to not annoy me with one of his ""sequel"" scores (Batman Forever & Batman & Robin come to mind).The uninteresting premise of the film, the uninteresting setting, uninteresting characters, uninteresting story in the end just kill the film.More effort seemed to go into shaving Weaver's head than making the script good. And, I'm sorry, but the handful of well crafted scenes where Ripley is emotionally torn, or faces a difficult decision--the whole 3 scenes in the film what have a valid 'deeper meaning' does not save the 90% of the film that is boring and stale.Many people found the jump from Aliens to Alien 3, the return to one alien and the fate of the survivors from Aliens unforgivable. I'm somewhat torn--I don't mind such things happening if the new route is good. The route chosen for Alien 3 was mediocre, and so the break from its predecessors did come across more disappointing. Change is not always good; change for the sake of change is typically bad. Alien 3 is a good example of this.In the end, all of the elements of the film are mediocre to good with the exception of the script which did not live up to standards. Hence, the film is overall just ""okay."" But after the caliber of its predecessors, Alien 3 really is a disappointment in terms of quality.",,Anonymous,Horror

A return to the sensibilities of Alien,"Alien3 attempts to undo much of the damage caused by action/special effects-fest Aliens and return the franchise more to its horror roots. The atmosphere is darker, the setting has a far more confined feel than the previous entry, and once again we have a small group trying to fend off a sole xenomorph.Although many have gawked at how this film departed from the previous title (going so far as to kill most of the previous movie's survivors offscreen), at the same time most of them ignore the fact that Aliens was a complete departure from the original film and turned the series into more of a light-hearted action romp than anything else (and although great in its own right, it should never have been called an Alien movie and would have been better off with a new alien species). Not so in the case of Alien3, as it brings the franchise straight back to its roots: A small group overwhelmed by a strange alien creature where they have to team up and improvise a way to overcome it (as opposed to having a well-equipped small army fight off enemy hordes).And while this sequel could be seen as somewhat unambitious, all the same it was well-made, well-acted, and stayed well within the theme of the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The setting of a space jail couldn't have been a better location for this movie. The opening scene with cracking the chest cavity and the alien appearing is great, but the CGI of the alien at times is plagued by 90s CGI. It's too bad because the hospital scene is legendary.

"Been there, done that","* * (2 out of 5)Alien3Directed by : David Fincher, 1992If you liked Aliens, it is probably best you don't see Alien3. It, for some reason, turns the triumph of Aliens and the conclusion herein into a depression deeper than the vastness of a hundred black holes.First off, the characters of Hicks, Newt and Bishop - who went through such a terrible ordeal in Aliens - are mysteriously dead as this one opens and obviously not due to anything terribly story related.Other than that, director Fincher (of former MTV fame) dishes up a stylized alien universe and his camera style  more close-ups and more zoom shots  is easily different from both Ridley Scott (Alien) and James Cameron (Aliens).Where Fincher is an original artiste this also quickly becomes annoying when any real suspense is missing (there is a lone alien running around again), the story is a no-story and when no characters (other than Ripley) are even vaguely interesting. Ellen Ripley is joined by one, big, faceless mob.Alien3 has moments; yet everything ultimately seems like a huge deja-vu. Charles Dance and Sigourney Weaver even share some interesting chemistry (that should have been further built on) - that too fizzles.Weaver co-produced this time, she also shaved her head (literally) and if nothing else Alien3 has a magnificent scene where Ripley - at last - comes face to face with an alien. We are talking inches.Note : The ending was one move that Warner wish they had never done. See Alien : Resurrection.",,Anonymous,Horror

Three times better than any of the later 'sequels'...,"While there's a lot of haters out there I never quite understood why they didn't save their anger for the truly stomach-churningly awful Alien(s) vs Predator movies. Maybe it's because while Alien 3 was watched by fans of the original and the sequel, those AVP movies were mainly aimed at a barely-sober teen audience who couldn't care less for the originals and who think that Paul W Anderson is the new Stanley Kubrick... Anyway, Alien 3 is more than just a stylish exercise for David Fincher (it's certainly better than what Fincher's up to nowadays): it's a tight, very dark and suspenseful sci-fi flick that features a great ensemble cast of character actors. All this can be said about the (superior) original, and it's certainly closer to Alien than to Aliens - which is a good thing, because what happens when you try to top Aliens' action and over-the-top characters can be seen in the later 'sequels'. I also liked the story about Ripley being stranded on a planet with only hardened male criminals; it's not just the same old story all over again. I've always seen this one as a very solid end of a great trilogy and still like to pretend it was the last one. I do believe if it came out today it would be much more appreciated - as the state of sci-fi movies and sequels in general has much deteriorated since Alien 3 originally came to cinemas.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien 3. The Ballad of Ellen Louise Ripley,"I found Alien 3 presented a fresh addition to the science fiction genre. To me, this movie compared as a space drama, and was well needed to quiet things down after putting the audience on the edge watching the outstanding horror 1979 Alien and the excellent thriller 1986 Aliens.
After Alien and Aliens presented great hyper-entertainment, I found Alien 3 needed to be freshly presented in a pianissimo tone. If 20th Century Fox had given us another movie similar to 1 and 2, then 3 would've been just a repeat of great entertainment, like other action movie franchises.
It was an audacious move by the studio. Alien 3 was creative, dark, and should've ended the Alien franchise as a trilogy, before giving us the prequels Prometheus and Covenant.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"More Action, Less Story","""Alien 3"" follows the character Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) into an action again as she falls deeper into the the world of the aliens she has grown so familiar with. She begins to become more militant and less like her old self because of everything she has gone through (see the first two films). Ripley's inner strength is stronger than ever and her determination is more powerful in the third installment of the franchise.""Alien 3"" is a good movie I do like it - yet, for me, the movie franchise has grown more in the direction of action and less in focus on the storyline. It's a great film for action movie lovers but not so great for those of us wanting more mystery added to this story and the entire franchise. *In reference to the first film of the series ""Alien"".7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not for all tastes, but I like brooding meals","Series note: It is strongly recommended that you watch the Alien series in order, beginning with Alien (1979), followed by Aliens (1986), then Alien 3. Each is a direct continuation of the plot of the earlier entry, like chapters in a novel.Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is unintentionally crash-landed on Fury 161, a remote, maximum-security prison planet. The prison, which was also a work camp in the mining industry, has been reduced to a bare-bones inmate population and staff, with the inmates--murderers, rapists and such--consisting primarily of those who have converted to their own brand of religious sect. No one at the prison has seen a woman in years, and they have never seen what Ripley has accidentally brought with her to the facility--a hostile alien, intent on killing them all.This may be the most ""difficult"" film of the Alien franchise. Although it has some stylistic elements from the first two films--everything from claustrophobic pursuits down dark, crypt-like corridors to the feeling (if not accoutrements) of big action blow-outs--director David Fincher has created the Bleak House of the series. In a personification of the films, Alien 3 covers the later adolescent years, when the series has decided to become a nihilist and write doom-laden poetry.And that is the deciding factor regarding whether one is likely to enjoy this film or not. Fincher has abandoned the breakneck pacing of the second, James Cameron-helmed film, and returned to a slow, complex dramatic pacing more akin to Ridley Scott's first Alien. Alien 3 trades traditional horror material (the first film could be seen as an almost Gothic haunted house story), gunfights and explosions for a constant dark, dingy atmosphere, both literally and figuratively in terms of the characters and their relationships. The film is imbued with brown tones, with a bluish-gray for contrast. Everything and everyone is dirty, beat-up, bruised and bloody. There is threatening machinery everywhere you look and infestations of overgrown lice. Imagine Clive Barker supervising the set design of a bloated subway system merging with the inside of an Egyptian pyramid, and you get the idea. (That is a more literal analogy than you may think--the climax could easily be seen as basically a Mummy film set in Egypt due to the environment and the structure of the action.) Alex Thomson's consistently remarkable cinematography is also worth noting in contributing to the delicious, gloomy atmosphere of the film.I love that atmosphere, and the regularly graphic grimness of this film (especially in the director's cut, or ""special edition"", which you should be sure to watch rather than the theatrical release), but it may be difficult for some viewers to take. Add that Fincher has made the film primarily about the intricate relationships of a relatively large cast of prisoners and their trying to deal with the sudden presence of a woman in their midst, and you lose another gaggle of viewers, but again, some of us still love it. Of course, there is alien-fighting stuff here, but we're back down to a single alien, and our heroes have to fight it with whatever is at hand, including weapons like axes and the machinery at the prison. The villain in Alien 3 is just as much ""man against himself"" as it is ""man against monster"".Fincher also wisely continued the plot thread from Aliens about Ripley's daughter, and her motivation towards the end of that film based on the loss of her daughter, in conjunction with the adoption of a functional surrogate. That aspect continues to supply the motivation for her actions in this film, where she undergoes a number of crises, and where in the end, she becomes a much more mythical figure.A lot of people dislike both the ending of this film and the fact that two primary characters are killed off without so much as a peep in the beginning, but it's important to remember that the underlying theme is nihilism, and the remote possibility of overcoming it through sacrifice--for example, with the prisoners finding a highly questionable religion, complete with ""celibacy"", with the hardships experienced by Clemens and his subsequent decisions, and with the final acts of redemption at the climax of the film. In that context, the plot points that tend to be disliked do not only make sense, they're absolutely necessary if we're not to completely ruin the tenor and subtext of the film.It is again worth noting the influences that the Alien series has had on other films. A prominent example is the Matrix series, which took power loaders as weapons of war (used in The Matrix Revolutions (2003)) from Aliens, and much of the atmosphere, production design, costume design and even some character structure from this film and used it in the early scenes aboard the Nebuchadnezzar in The Matrix (1999), as well as parts of Zion (in The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions).While I can easily see how Alien 3 would not be for all tastes, it is as a gourmet meal to me. It is at least recommended viewing if you are interesting in experiencing later films in the series.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something of a (very) mixed bag,"I think I like this a little more than most people, but it's frustrating, because for just about everything it does right, it does something wrong.Acting is strong from some and there are a few good characters, but a lot of the minor characters blend into one another because of how similar they look and act (plus there's at least one actor who you want to be in the movie for longer than they are- will keep it vague for the sake of spoilers).Some of the alien effects look great! Mostly when it's stationary. It has as much of a presence and menace as the alien(s) did in past movies. But then it moves and it just looks so silly and not within the world of the film. I get they wanted to make it super fast and agile in this instalment, but I'm not sure the technology was there in the early 90s to pull this off (or they needed the FX team from Jurassic Park who helped make the velociraptors scary).Set design and cinematography- generally really good! But it also looks pretty repetitive colour-wise, and the production design isn't quite as bold as it was in either Alien or Aliens.I generally like the attempt at a darker tone and bloodier violence, but at the same time it maybe goes a little far in some places. Tonally it means that things feel a bit one-note.I watched the assembly cut on this rewatch, and I think it was a little better than the theatrical version, though 144 minutes was a pretty long sit for a movie of this kind.So overall: it's a bit messy. There are things that work and things that don't, but enough good in the end for me to ultimately like it. Still, it is a significant step down in quality from the first two.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't feck with The Baldies!,"Special Edition.I love it, I really do. OK! So it's basically a monster on the loose piece, but the setting at a sci-fi prison colony - complete with nutty religious shards - makes for a thrillingly atmospheric ride. Of course if this was merely a stand alone film, where there was no Alien and Aliens previously, I feel sure the special edition cut would be thought of differently.A roll call of Brit thesps line up for some tension filled entertainment as director David Fincher and cinematographer Alex Thomson provide a look that is both beautiful and scary. The metallic nightmare of chambers and cold concrete fused together for some hellish stalk and paranoia. Industrial Punk? Steam Punk? Cyber Punk? Fincher Punk? Hey man, we gotta give it a name! And of course there's Siggy Weaver front and centre, the reassuring presence among the murderers, rapists and child molesters.I could live without the attempt at a transcendent finale, but in extended form this has much to light your fires.

The host that allowed Fincher's career to grow into the perfect organism.,"A dark, depressing film that alienated and scarred the potential younger audience that the studio had been pursuing commercially for the series. It follows the pattern of talented directors taking their entry in the franchise in a completely different genre: Scott gave a sci-fi story a heavy horror influence, Cameron made the sequel more action focused and Fincher highlights the psychological thriller aspects.Sigourney Weaver always delivers as Ripley, however the supporting cast/characters are weaker in this compared to the past films.

"WARNING!  This film is like ""alien acid"" on the brain!  ABORT!

A film that still bothers me!!!,"Alien 3 is a sequel that has bothered me for years. I had the pleasure of recently voting it as one of the worst movies of the last 100 years.

Where did the ""face hugger"" come from in the shuttle?? It`s obvious in the first two movies that the ""face huggers"" impregnate their victims and die but in Alien 3 it impregnates Ripley and the dog... Why did it seems to take a week for the Alien to explode from Ripley while in the first movie it took about an hour??? How did Ripley know she had a ""Queen"" Alien in her????I also think the point of the first 2 movies was Ripley was  a survivor.We know she is going to die about 1/3 the way through the movie.

It basically starts off where Aliens ends with them on the ship.

It's kind of like the first movie in that sense but the first movie had way more tension where this movie drops the tension for gore. There are attempts to show the alien but he CGI just doesn't hold up to today's standards and it looks fake.This at least still feels like we are in the same universe as the previous movies but that is about it. I wouldn't recommend this one, stick with the previous movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Such a waste...,"First, let me say I gave Alien 3 a 7/10 rating because in my opinion, it isn't a bad film, but it obviously pales in comparison to the two masterpieces that came before. The reasons for this drop in quality have been well documented, so I won't go into too much detail: in short, the responsability lies on a chaotic pre-production process under the supervision of producers/writers David Giler and Walter Hill, and the invasiveness of the studio during the shooting and editing of this movie. Director David Fincher and the cast aren't to be blamed, they did what they could to salvage a poor script, but their efforts were doomed from the start.
Rewatching James Cameron's Aliens yesterday, I realized how well he had laid the basis for a third instalment. All the writers had to do was to let the story flow naturally from what he had set up.
Remember Bishop's fascination for the facehuggers and his strange behaviour when studying them? Sure, he ended up as a good guy, but still, something seemed terribly off with him in a few scenes, especially the one where he's dissecting one of the creatures and a marine asks him ""Do you need anything else?"" There's an uncomfortably long pause there and he just answers ""No"" in a very cold way.
Also, why did it take him so long to come to Ripley and Newt's rescue when they were about to get killed by the alien queen in the crumbling power plant? Could it be that he was actually trying to recover some alien samples in the meantime, as instructed by Burke?
Besides, the USS Sulaco didn't suffer any major damage so it should have made it back to earth without any trouble. I understand that given the technical means at the time, it would have been extremely difficult to deliver a credible full out humans vs aliens war on the planet, so why not use the huge space station seen at the beginning of Aliens as the main stage for Alien 3, where our heroes (Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop) would have been quarantined.
The plot could have revolved around their desperate efforts to prevent the xenomorphs from reaching the surface of the planet, and perhaps failing to do so, with Bishop showing his true colors at some point.
I'm no writer (obviously!) but this seems to me as a much more logical continuation to the second film, and one the audience would probably have been satisfied with.
Instead, the producers went for this unimaginative ""conclusion"" to Ripley's journey, which led to almost insurmountable storytelling issues when they decided to bring her back in a fourth movie.
As explained above, I still stand by my rating despite all this, but man... what an incredible waste.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

unfortunately underrated,"contrary to what other viewers might say, i actually find this one the best installment of the Alien TRILOGY. (note the ALLCAPS on the TRILOGY. that means THREE MOVIES. not four. THREE.)each of the three movies is great in its own way. Mr Scott's Alien, of course, started it all with its beautiful simplicity. Mr Cameron brought his own twist to it and made a fine yarn indeed. but with Alien3, i think the story of Lt. Ripley finally comes onto its own.unlike most of its detractors, i actually believe the third installment does NOT disregard the second movie. in fact, i believe it used Mr Cameron's Aliens as the perfect set-up for Ripley's final descent and eventual transcendance from the Alien.this installment is definitely more thoughtful, a lot slower and more of a character study than the first two films. the first was about surviving the Alien. the second was about kicking the crap out of a whole swarm of 'em. this one, this little underrated much kicked-about baby over here, this one's all about Ripley, and how she eventually accepts her fate, starcrossed as it is by the presence of the Alien. oh, and it's also about a bunch of hopeless baddy-types, who turn out to be the most upliftingly, almost heart-achingly human of all the characters we see in the TRILOGY.it is most unfortunate that Mr Cameron and even Mr Fincher himself totally abhore this film. though i can understand Mr Fincher's distaste (being involved in it and having the movie ""made for him"" by the dictates of ""The Company"", i can totally understand his opinion, and would probably feel the same way in his shoes), i am totally baffled and outraged by Mr Cameron's opinions. though some may say otherwise, just cause he made the biggest-budgety-looking and most successful of the three films doesn't make the trilogy ""his"".certainly this is a slow trod for an Alien film, but despite the cliches, this movie for me has the most substance of the three films. here, we actually see humans using their wits and grit against what has become an almost omnipotent killing machine. and though this is also the darkest of the three films, it is also, in its own way, the most uplifting.i daresay, it's almost arthouse. certainly the gore is a little gratuitous (the almost sensual ""cruelty"" of the Alien from the first film reduced to a simple cold efficiency in this one---which makes more sense to me), and the effects are pretty obvious, B-movieish in fact, but it in no way detracts from (my personal) movie experience. unlike the blustering Aliens, this is not a big-budget, hollywood special effects movie, though it may have cost a lot in the making due to all the corporate s***e. the specialest effect we see here is in the characterization. the ""acting"" as you will. and the story is cooler than cool, cliches bugs and all (hey, Casablanca was chockful of cliches, and no one ever complains about that little doozy).say what you want, see it for yourself. this is the tightest of the three films IMHO, and though i've only seen the ""unwanted"" cinematic version and not the DVD version, alls i can say is, I LOVE THIS FILM.FYI, my ranking for the films in descending order: Alien3, Alien, Aliens. but i love them all, and wish they would all just live happily together. without THAT other one, of course. now THAT was such a blasphemy, i don't even want to write its name.dreamwell. c",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Alien"" + ""Aliens"" =  A Disjointed Mess","""Alien 3"" combines the major elements of the first two entries in the popular series to make a disjointed mess that feels forced and rushed.  This time Sigourney Weaver crash-lands her space ship from the last installment on a planet of jailed murderers and rapists.  Everyone else on the ship dies and she believes that the alien has hitched a ride with her to this new planet.  Of course it has and soon she, and everyone else on the planet, is trying to kill the alien and save themselves.  ""Alien 3"" has the eerie feel of the first film and the in-your-face action of the second.  These two elements make the film  disjointed.  At some points the audience is bored stiff and at other moments they are confused by the outlandish action sequences.  The direction is never clear and there is no real screenplay here at all.  Weaver tries to carry the film by herself, but she lacks the support that she had for the first two entries.  Lance Henriksen only makes a token appearance.  Charles Dutton is pretty good, but his character lacks the development to really make him interesting.  Everyone else is just present and ultimately the alien proves to be little more than a jack-in-the-box monster that hops out at the most predictable moments.

I had heard a lot of bad critics about it and I guess that's why I was 'surprised' after seeing it. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but it could have been a lot worse.This time the movie starts with Ripley and what is left of her crew in ""Aliens"", trying to escape in a spaceship. But an embryonic alien has infiltrated the ship and when they crash on a desolated prison planet, peopled by a religious cult composed of former murderers and rapists, everything starts all over again. In the meanwhile, the alien has managed to grow into a new and deadly form and starts attacking the weaponless prisoners. But Ripley soon discovers that her battle with the Alien will be more personal that it has ever been before...What I liked about this movie was that the acting was more than OK and that it has plenty of good action to offer. Especially at the end of the movie there isn't any lack of action. But there were also things that bothered me. One of those things is the story. The story on its own isn't very innovative. Of course there is a new environment in which it all happens, but in the end it still looked very much like the previous ones. My next point of criticism is the Alien. It wasn't the same as always anymore. This was the first digitally created monster in the series and I must say that I preferred the older ones. They just looked a lot more slimy and threatening than this one ever did.Even though not everything convinced me, I must say that I still had a good time watching it.

"terrible - it trashes the movie ""Aliens""","Just a horrible movie if you liked ""Aliens"" (Alien 2). This movie starts out by saying all the heroics and sacrifice in Aliens was a waste of time. This movie starts out by killing the surviving space marine and little girl from Aliens.  Why was that necessary? Beyond that there is a big plot hole in that this all is necessary to get an Alien to be used as some kind of weapon. In ""Aliens"" we saw that a platoon of human space Marines could kill off hundreds of the creatures with limited weapons. A simple shotgun was enough to kill one. So why go through all that trouble?  But putting that aside there are still other problems. The action takes place on a prison planet where the convicts were given the choice to leave or stay but this group volunteers to stay due to a new religion. However within minutes of seeing Sigourney Weaver most of the staff turn into rapists. Huh?  If they wanted a woman that bad why did they stay behind?  Sigourney hops into bed with the local doctor which would to her have been about the day after the events in ""Aliens"" took place.  Why was that?

Alien is not an action movie!Sure James Cameron kind of raised the expectations bar a lot higher from Aliens, but this one is quite good. Wayyyy better than the 4th, back when Fox stoped making good movies and only cared about profit.Before whining like a millennium boy, go and watch the Director's Cut, that's the real Alien 3 without Fox people ruining it. Then come back here and rate properly as it should.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scariest Alien movie,"1 and 2 are better films undoubtably but this film is so real and gritty and disgusting and that scares me more than the first two. There is alot less hope in this film as everyone is a prisoner and noone on this vessel has a gun which is terrifying when going up against a killing machine and you really get the feeling noone cares about this ship at all. The ship is quite desolate and run down and you get dead space 1 vibes. This movie has pete postlethwaite, charles dance and ralph brown with the usual weaver and henriksen meaning this has the best cast in the entire franchise (6 films) David fincher is the director and captures claustrophobia and panic really well this ship genuinely feels like hell and the characters are getting decimated left and right.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Love it!,What a under rated movie. This movie is visually stunning. Has a great cast. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. I only wish Hicks wasn't killed off so soon. Seems like there's a growing cult following. I'm in! All hate should be redirect towards Aliens 4 or whatever it's called.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very, very bad special effects","The main reason why this movie sucked were the so called ""special effects"", which are so bad that the movie would be better off without them. Believe me, even without the alien creature this movie would be more believable. But the story's OK. It's dark and depressive but if you liked the first two you should be able to watch this one. When I first saw it I thought it was terrible, but later on I got to appreciate the movie as a whole, without the lame special effects of course, but it's still far from its predecessors.A nice prison movie though.      6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible !,"Just like the summary says, this movie is terrible !The plot, the cast, and the direction all make for a very boring and stale movie. Not to mention the special effects, which are particularly disapointing.This becomes very obvious during the scenes when the alien is chasing the prisoners through the hallways/tunnels. When you see the alien, it is a very obviously computer-generated animation. Also, because of the way the scene was shot, I believe the director (David Fincher ""Se7en"", and ""Fight Club"") tried to cover up these cheezy effects by only giving very brief glimpses of the alien. He also seems to be trying to compensate for the lack of alien content by showing a ""first person"" view of the alien chasing prisoners...with the camera spinning and climbing the walls. It makes what could have been an exciting scene into an annoying and visually confusing scene.Very disapointing performances by Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dutton.""Alien Resurrection"" (prt. 4) is better. This one should not have even been made. It really serves no purpose. I would recommend watching the first two, and if you still have a desire to see more of the 'Alien' movies (as you probably will because the first two are excellent movies), then watch ""Alien Resurrection"" next. You will miss absolutely nothing by skipping this one.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Boldest of the sequels,"After the first sequel which was just a remake of the first movie with more aliens, this moved the story on in an imaginative way.
To put Ripley on a planet full of men and keep the character as a strong lead is pretty much unique amongst sci-fi and most other movie genres.
The storyline had purpose and the ending is sublime, Ripley knew what she had to do and followed through with it.
A masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
the sequel that never should have been,"Alien was nothing short of a true sci-fi masterpiece from the great Ridley Scott.  Then James Cameron comes in and creates one of the greatest sequels of all time.  But Alien 3 is the absolute slap in the face to anyone who loves the series.  This is a cold, heartless, and hopeless film.  When I saw this film, I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters.  My only compassion went to Ripley at seeing all the hardships she had endured throughout the ordeal.  The film had absolutely no memorable or likeable characters so when someone got killed, I really didn't care.  What really bothers me about the film is it's lack of heart.  The film had absolutely no humanity to it.  I felt emotionally cut off by it from the opening credits. The death of Newt and Hicks, to me, was a huge mistake.  I really thought that something could have emerged between Hicks and Ripley.  And Ripley's relationship with Newt was such a wonderful connection that was really the driving force of Aliens.  But now with Hicks and Newt dead, Ripley seems to have lost all her humanity and soul which gives the audience nothing to root for.  All in all, this film can never and will never go up to par with the original two, and I continue to refuse to acknowledge Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection as part of the franchise.  I even hear that there is a possible Alien 5.  My only advice to Fox is that they get either Ridley Scott or James Cameron back in the director's chair.  If you really want to enjoy a good Alien film, then watch Alien and Aliens.  Don't waste your time with any others.",,Anonymous,Horror

a weak entry compared to Cameron's second,"David Finscher has since gone onto bigger things, especially his deeply dark film, Seven, and this being his directorial debut, he is given a little latitude.  Alien 3 is good.  It is not great but it does have some decent chills and it has a great ending that apparently sums up the series.The film is very dark and bleak and what I liked most about it was how Weaver seemed tired and beaten.  She is so tired of facing "" The Bitch "" and she conveys that wonderfully.  And even the alien seems tired of facing her. To really understand what is meant by all of this you have to watch it. It is not nearly as good as the second, but I believe it is better than the fourth.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dark, brooding movie.","I really enjoyed this move; it exemplified everything that an Alien movie should be composed be; fear, confusion and death, with the underlying threat of the bitch itself. The very fact that Newt and Hicks are bumped off at the beginning is the gun-blast to the race; it shows immediately that Fincher isn't afraid to 'take out' characters, unlike most other action/thrill/horror films. This film took the genre back to its roots; Aliens was a gung-ho splash, and strayed too far from the ideology and concept that Alien stands for; being hunted with no sanctuary.Insanity is another medium that Fincher expressed; whether it be the wails of the manic-depressive Golic or Dillion's Christian Fundmanetalist brew, the composition of the characters is rich and diverse. Weaver is excellent as the tired Ripley, who has been pushed so far by the menace she no longer cares for her life.And the prisoners - you actually feel sorry for the (pretty nasty) skinheads when they get picked off, one by one. Esepcially when they dedicate themselves to destroy the Alien. The gradual deterioration from order to brutal anarchy is both subtle and hideous, and can be compared to a futuristic Lord of the Flies. You, the viewer, is fully aware that the system will collapse under the Alien, and can only watch as the inmates suffer blow after deadly blow.And the ending; what an ending! The very fact that Morse is the only survivor shows just how unpredictable this film is; I don't know about you, but I expected '85, Dillion and Ripley to survive. And thats why I love this move; it defies stereotypical hero survival. The very fact the prisoners team up to kill the 'dragon' at the expense of their own lives is symbolic of human courage that exists within everyone, that co-operation is the only thing that can redeem mankind.Overall, this film is dark, brooding and thoroughly fulfilling. The chase scenes in the lead-works are worthy of a mention of themselves; a mix between adrenaline and hysteria as we see the raw fear of the hunted Convicts. People don't like the third installment because they do not appreciate that this film is a dark portrayal of human nature and must be seen with an open-mind rather than bitter comparison to the other movies.Alien 3 is a triumph in all aspects.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Who thinks Scott and Cameron should go back and do the third again.,"Seriously...Cameron made a perfect nuclear family out of odds and ends as it were. Hicks, Newt and Ripley. with todays CGI technology they could get a CGI newt to be at the crash site or in the ship whatever the story could be. and then go forward a couple of years to them all living together....of course its sounds pretty bad but I'm just brainstormiong.I did not mind Alien 3, sure it needed work for it to match anywhere near the previous two in success but I hated the fact that the writer killed off two characters that could have made something new in the trilogy.I think even Cameron complained about that making me think that fox are a money grabbing bunch of ...., i mean why do you think the Simpsons rip on them all the time. I love Finchers work and don't blame him I blame the writer.I think that Scott and Cameron would go back and do something different. like the Alien getting back to earth or something like that...I mean even the stories in the comics seem like a good place to start...even if their plots are paper thin.lol. Maybe its not a good idea and I don't know the ins and outs of Hollywood...but I'm betting if two BIG directors like them got together. Weaver, Beihn and anyone else would definitely be willing to do another...I mean its almost impossible to get as bad as alien resurrection. That would make my life happy if it happened but hey its just a dream.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
worst of the series,"This is by far, the worst of the Alien series.  The idea is kinda neat, but the execution was just really bad.  There is no suspense, no terror, and I really did not care if Ripley made it through this one or not.  The most disapointing thing to me is that they never explored the mutation, if that was what it was of the Alien in the prison, what was different about it. The only reason to see this is so that you can go on to the final installment of the Alien series.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
All praise and no guns blaze,"In the vastness of space. Endless colonies. Humanity is scattered. God is absent. Or is He?The story of this movie is one of human altruism overcoming the cynic world of Alien. The first half of the movie is truly engaging with the characters setting the tone of the movie. True misery on the brink mayhem. The few leaders of the prison keep the order even though the people living there are all murderers and criminals of violent crimes.As Ripley enters the picture, the order is shock and a plethora of character interactions take place. The tension increases.Come the middle of the movie it slows down as the lead characters make plans. Plans to survive an assault they don't have the means to fend off.The ending is simply our strong protagonist choosing the correct path of action despite all the multiple ""gut feelings"" advising against it. It is a true test of humanity and strength. Our protagonist is really perfectly cut for the job and delivers a believable action path all throughout the movie.The sounds scape is amazing. All the scenery looks great. The acting is wonderful (british-ish?) and the lead role is nothing less than imprinted in my brain for all of my life.As a negative, the CGI looks terrible and really pulled me out of immersion. The puppets are great thou. I give this 8/10 as it is really one of the classics in the genre.It is a take on Alien leaning more towards horror but mostly focusing on humanity. I would say this is the movie which explored the actual setting of the universe once the Aliens came into the picture , following the original movie but taking it in a more dystopian direction. Just as I like it.As mentioned, the middle does slow down a bit and I lost focus for a while but it soon picks up again and the end really makes up for all of it. This is one of the classics and will remain so for a long time to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Condescending Ellen Ripley,"One major beef I had with Alien3 was the condescension on Ellen Ripley's part, namely the scene where she is chastising the warden for not having weapons of any sort (it is a prison planet after all, and given its circumstances, hardly not understandable.) Overall, I found the movie bothersome and annoying, an unnecessary sequel that offered little to the mythology or to the moviegoer.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
This one blows chunks...,"I rented Alien³ in an old Albertson's grocery store. I knew that it was by far the least of the series, but how bad could it be? The answer: REALLY bad. There are almost no moments of actual suspense or even horror. The decision to see through the alien's eyes like in ""Predator"" is such a huge mistake; it drains away every bit of interest you could have since you know where the alien is at all times. Sigourney Weaver goes a bit darker and more cynical in this film, and, by golly, it works. Everyone else, even returning veteran Lance Henrikson, is pretty much window dressing. See ""Jaws"", ""Robocop"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"", and save yourself 2 hours of your life.",,Anonymous,Horror
How the Alien saga was nearly ruined...,"David Fincher was clearly overwhelmed by his task as a director (why this music video maker became chief of a doomed non-scripted major film is beyond me) of this overheated, under-written, and overlong entry in the ""Alien"" film franchise, a series of films that clearly showed itself to be walking upon shaky treads as it squirmed ahead. The picture does look great, however, what with the lighting and design work done by Jordan Cronenweth, A.S.C. (who was in ill health throughout the production) and a crack team of visual specialists (mostly British) who worked tirelessly in their attempts to save the picture. But looking at a bald Ripley is unattractive to me, the alien is too little seen here (and in Fincher's ""assembly cut"" there is more footage that nervous executives excised for good reasons really, but it is a more complete version of the film if you like the way that it looks). Outstanding camera-work and powerful visual themes are significantly better (and more dramatic) than this film deserved to be, and really it's not an ""action"" movie in the genuine American sense, but I did enjoy the fact that Biehn's character (and the Newt character) were killed early on because I could see no purpose that they would serve in the movie. Then again, there was no reason for Ripley to come back, or the Alien itself, or... well, you get the idea.Although, this is my least favorite among the trilogy (I do not consider Resurrection a part of the series), I definitely think that the Runner, or Dog Alien, is probably the best alien in all the movies. Unbelievably vicious and just, to quote superintendent Andrews, 'Generally Unpleasant', the beast has a mean streak and often toys with the prisoners, making this the darkest and most violent of the trilogy. The bad parts about the movie are obvious. After seeing the Colonial marines in action, it is tough to see the events of this movie. You will miss the marines. Another very troubling aspect is the deaths of Hicks and Newt, whom Ripley had strives so very hard to rescue in the last movie, only to have their lives sorrowfully taken from them. Seeing Hicks die, as my favorite character from Aliens, was upsetting. The acting isn't exactly top notch, but you will grow to like a few of the prisoners, namely Morse and Dillon. Not the best in the trilogy, but it definitely brings a good closure to the series.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lacking compared to its predecessors,"Coming on the heels of two legitimate masterpieces in Alien and Aliens, Alien 3 had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, Alien 3 is a shell of its former films and lacks the suspense and action the franchise was famous for. The film is notorious for having a very troubled production with conflicts between David Fincher and the studio. I tend to lean more towards Fincher's side given the phenomenal films he has made since this one.

Aliens is one of the finest sci fi or war movies ever made, and Alien did for horror what Star Trek did for sci fi.My advice would be to skip this one unless you, like I, just can't resist finding out what happened in the chapter you were told to avoid all along.

The most underrated and misunderstood film of all time,"I like 'Alien 3.' I really do. I can confidently say that is on my top 5 list for my favorite films.  I think that there is a specific list of reasons why people don't like the film. Since I have a limited word count, I will only explore a few. -Their gripe: the entire film is cold, dark, and depressing...too depressing for most Alien fans. =My response: What were you expecting? Bunny rabbits and candy canes? Please! The universe that this trilogy is a very dark and depressing place. Fincher (the director of Alien 3) perfectly captures it! -Their gripe: There is little action. =My response: I can understand that fans were hungry for another shoot-em-up film like 'Aliens', but the point of a sequel is to explore new ground and give the viewer something fresh and new! Why was 'Resurrection' so bad? Because it tried to combine all of the previous films into one and the result was a giant s*** ball! Alien 3 does play out like a drama, but what the hell is wrong with that? It is, by far, the most bloody and violent of the 4 films. -Their gripe: Character development sucks. =My response: Ok, first watch the new 'assembly cut' that just came out, it should stop some of your bitching. Second, the majority of the characters are convicts, and, as you will find out in the film, they are expendable, so once you know one, you basically know them all. I mean they're convicts for Christ's sakes! They're violent, loud, dirty, and crude (even though they are trying not to be). What more could you possibly want from them? The 'Assembly Cut' does give more insight to their characters, though. I really don't understand why 'Alien 3' is the most bashed film in the series, while 'Resurrection' was accepted as the finale. I know that the reason why 'Alien 3' was hard to accept was the fact that the fans were expecting another gun/marine movie and not something bold, daring, and different, which is exactly what 'Alien 3' is. If you have not seen 'Alien 3' you really should. Don't take other people opinions. Watch it with an open mind, and make your own decision.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
My hatred for this film knows no bounds...,"I remember seeing the trailers for this film the December before it opened. On a sort of high from just seeing the first two movies, I was expecting big things from the second ""Alien"" sequel, and the trailer promised exactly that: ""In space, no one can hear you scream... but on Earth, everyone can!"" was the tagline.So what do we get instead?  A wretched excuse for a sequel to two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.  First of all, the story is beyond simply depressing... it undoes everything from the first two movies, and utterly destroys Ripley's world.  Everything she's fought for is for naught.  We almost want her to die, to end the ceaseless buffet of suffering her life has become.  We must suffer through uninteresting characters that are indistinguishable from each other, dull ""turn around and there's the alien"" shocks, poor camera work during the action sequences (some would call it style, I call it confusing and obnoxious), and finally the ending that gels perfectly with this bottomless abyss of a movie.  Alien Ressurection be damned... this travesty should have been a dream, and David Fincher should have stuck to directing Madonna videos.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Unfortunately this movie is horrible and boring. I'm seroius - just about nothing happens, and the few things that DO happen are various people I just met and don't care about getting killed.

Review of both cuts (Updated take).,"Alien 3 got reshot and rewritten to death where David Fincher disowned the film outright because it got so bloated and unrecognisable from a well-produced movie. And honestly he did the right thing disowning this film; Fincher's thankfully had a MUCH better career since starting off on the wrong foot with this movie. And the Assembly Cut amended the Theatrical Release's many problems.After the first two Alien movies, along comes Alien 3 and shows that long-standing franchises are NOT always home runs of critical and commercial success. I feel like I need to run this meme by Star Wars, Planet of the Apes and Terminator fans: James Franco from 2016's Buster Scruggs: ""First time?"". 'Franchise suicide has long predated FaceBook and Twitter many times before, and still very much a recurring problem for clueless studio executives just throwing money at the proverbial wall and hoping something sticks in the right way eventually. However things STILL change after the facts (ie, alternate cuts of movies that weren't ideal productions at first).Alien 3 takes what the first two Aliens established and throws it all into a wood-chipper and THEN an incinerator. Why make a film this hyped into an unmitigated disaster of clueless direction and a nonsensical story full of coincidences and retcons that feel like drinking fresh piss from a coffee mug? Jesus.Even the good stuff feels like it's been trampled by all the preconceived mandates forced upon the film and the executive worms; Sigourney Weaver is wasted here and Charles Dance is easily the most missed opportunity with the casting on display: he basically plays a strong supporting character who's there to be 'slasher-flicked' in the most implausible and embarrassing way.Alien 3's Theatrical Cut is a sequel done poorly, and though it's NOT the worst thing ever made, it's easily amongst the worst of the Aliens Saga by a long shot. And yes: Prometheus was FAR better than this too, what with that film's issues. That film had clearer vision and purpose regarding Alien, and didn't feel hamstrung by every kind of studio mandate under the sun.Alien 3 Theatrical gets a 3/10 here. 1.5/5 stars.Update section:The Assembly Cut gets 7/10 IMDbs. 3.5/5 stars.While not a perfect sequel to the first two by ANY means, it's still fascinating how two different versions of the same troubled movie inspired alternative cuts that give very different impressions to one another.I don't know if The Assembly is better than Prometheus, but it's a notable improvement over the Theatrical Release by an unusually wide margin.Maybe with time re-evaluations of Alien 3 will stress the Assembly Cut as THE definitive version of an infamously difficult movie to make.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting ""failure""","Watching the 3 hour doc on making it, you first realise the complete absence of one of my favorite directors, David Fincher. He called it ""his first meeting with people who didn't care about his opinions"", and wanted an Alan Smithee credit on it. Now, the Blu-ray contains the 3 hour long, uncut version, which shows just how much was ripped from the final, theatrical. Much maligned, I actually find Alien3 a very good movie. Not on par with the 2 first, but way better than the stinker known as Alien Ressurection. Fincher, fresh from music videoes with NIN, shows allready his big talent with a camera. It got some real interesting subjects, as Ripley now is ""pregnant"" with a xenomorph. Some find the ending stupid as hell, but I actually found it both sad and the final embrace. ""You have been in my life so long..."" What I absolutely didn't like was the removal of Hicks and Newt. Michael Biehn blames Finscher, but regarding that the latter was treated like a kindergarten kid by the execs, I think Biehn barks at the wrong tree. In the end, it's a movie with way, way too many involved. From the absurdly strange concept of the ""wood planet"" inhabited by monks that hated technology (yes, that was a draft), to Fincher showing from day to day getting more and more depressed, since they worked essentialy without a full script. You also quickly get a sense who really enjoyed working with him (Sigourney) and who thought he nagged too much. In the end, Alien3 is a good movie, considered all the interference. Not least the score, which is one of my favorites. Too bad Alien Ressurection came along to destroy what was a perfect ending for Ellen Ripley.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Serial Killer's, Child Rapists...and Sex Starved Fundamentalist's....help Ripley (kinda)","1992, and 20th Century Fox gave the world ALIEN³.For the director's chair, Fox hired silver screen virgin -- David Fincher; who was at the peak of a successful career directing music videos and television commercials, while also having worked at George Lucas' ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) during the 80's.The tale of ALIEN³ takes place on one of the most inhospitable environments (asides from Los Angeles) ever portrayed on film. Human criminals and an Alien scream away at each other in the cinematic equivalent of 'Hillary Clinton Vs. Condaleeza Rice' in a Bangkok backstreet prostitute fight. The location is Fury 161, an evacuated lead mine and prison colony with only a fraction of it's original population wishing to voluntarily remain of they're own accord.There, some of society's most wretched and vile convicts have been isolated; murderers, child rapists, serial killers and loons have formed a sort of monastic order, living in the lead mining facilities. The prisoners (logically) have no weapons, no escape vehicle, no booze, no pornography, no TV, no internet access, no HBO and to make matters even worse, are all inclined to regularly shave their head and body hair, as the planet is infested with ""future"" lice. On this delightful planet arrives Lt. Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), the future equivalent of Typhoid Mary.No sooner has Ripley shaved, deaths immediately begin occurring throughout Fury 161 with a rather suspicious Xenomorphic air about them . Realizing what she may have inadvertently brought Fury's unsuspecting residents from her visit to LV-426, Lt. Ellen Ripley goes about doing what must be done in order to save Fury's quickly dwindling prison population, and perhaps - humanity itself.From this point onwards, the rest of the film is spent franticly running around, strenuously arguing, overly screaming and weeping through the depressing Fury 161 facility, while awaiting Bishop II (played by Lance Henriksen) to arrive to make his (gimmick) guest appearance.On a more serious note, the plot does takes time to advance. The first half of the film is short on action, BIG on character introduction, development, tension and suspense. The thought of having weapons taken away adds even more to the terror as the theme goes into that of vulnerability/helplessness/defenseless. The power structure is reversed and the frustration is evident, and seeing how a group of prisoners, who's crimes are based on those of assumed power, deals with it is a very strong concept. Without the sympathy for Ripley from the previous ALIEN movies and only minor flashes of humanity from the prisoners themselves, the film is without sympathetic characters worthy of redemption. A truly wonderful change from the traditional film status-quo B.S..Asides the undeserving criticism the film received on it's debut, ALIEN³'s superb intermixed UK & US cast, cinematography, excellent production values, beautiful art direction, flawless editing, menacing score, visually stunning set designs and not forgetting of course - skillful directing; make this an underrated masterpiece, that continues to find itself in greater appreciation in a modern day sea of mediocre Hollywood productions.Despite the constant high level daily studio interference throughout the troubled production of ALIEN³ (back in 1991), Finchers directorial (debut) brilliance continues to shine throughout ALIEN³ in the above noted departments. All in all, this movie is a worthy conclusion to the ALIEN trilogy. It's my personal favorite in the series due to the multiple themes and concepts presented. Brilliantly acted and directed, and the prison/Gothic industrial setting is haunting and eerily beautiful.ALIEN³ is akin to a fine wine; it matures with age.An underrated if somewhat misunderstood masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I do not understand all the hate,"While is it obvious that Alien3 is not a blockbuster or epic movie it has a lot of strengths. It feels a lot like the Alien original movie, quite claustrophobic, dark, gritty, not rushed. Maybe people wanted some kind of Aliens 2 action movie with jokes and somewhat happy ending.But no, Alien3 is depressing and that is what it makes it worth for me. It has very violent moments and very good sequences, is suspenseful and you always have that despair feeling. The alien's perspective takes are great, well executed, frantic and hopeless for the characters. Now the characters are not weak for me, the acting is very well executed, and you feel for them.

Nice Poster...,"Sorry, I have tried hard to like this movie but I really don't! The only thing that makes me giving it 3 instead of 1 is that the Directors Cut version I have just seen is an awful lot more cohesive in structure and characterization than the one I saw in the cinema - full credit to Paul McGann. The whole behind the scenes struggle to make the film is very apparent in the final film - characters are introduced and dispatched, and do we care? No The sets are beautiful - but what are they for?! The prisoners / monk set up just isn't credible, Charles Dance is wasted (literally!) for what? There are no answers to any of the questions posed by the first two films, no development to the franchise as we knew the company were no gooders in the first one! The only scenes (apart from the restored Golic ones) that meant anything to me were the ones involving Ripley, Bishop the android and the bodies of Newt & Hicks. They were very poignant after all the trials we had been through with the characters in Aliens. The ending didn't help much at the time I first saw it either, as Ripleys big suicide moment came to the screens too close to Arnies trip to the furnice in T2 to be anything approaching original. But of all the criticism I could heap on this unfortunate film, the biggest one in my eyes is that along with killing Hicks and Newt, the writers dismissed Aliens altogether and turned Alien3 into a dismal rehash of Alien. The more I think of it, the more I am inclined to give it 1 out of 10 after all... But the poster and T shirt were great",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Tragic End.,"Review 3 of 4Looking at Alien 3 as the final film in a trilogy I have to say that it is one of the better final acts in film history, even though it is perhaps not the final act that many would have wanted. If you follow this guideline for a trilogy: Part one sets up the story, Part Two expands on it, taking it in new and interesting places, and Part three brings closure, then Alien 3 works just fine. I think of this film as a tragedy. Ripley loses everyone she ever cared about. Her situation is bleak, the setting is grim. Where Alien was subtle and Aliens was flamboyant, Alien 3 is more thematic. Much is present in the subtext. There is much religious and symbolic imagery to be digested. It is a very layered film that requires several viewings to take it all in. Again, Sigourney weaver gets much praise for her performance in Aliens, but here I believe she does her best work of the series. How does someone react when everything has been taken from them? What has their life amounted to? What was it all for? These are all questions posed by the film and to her character, and it is not an easy thing to play. This film has an elegiac quality that is absolutely unrelenting. The Extended Version of the film is much more layered and provides much more character depth, but there is one thing that really differentiates Alien 3 from its predecessors (especially in the special edition), it is almost solely focused on character to the point of the Alien not being all that dominant in terms of screen time and moments of suspense. The thematic elements of the film are very dominant; life, death, faith, and internal conflict. Many religious allegories are made with the most obvious being ""the last temptation of Ripley"" at the hands of Bishop II. The score in this film is much more dominant than either of the previous films, and there is a greater emphasis on the character's faces rather than set design or technology. Alien 3 seems more personal than the other films, perhaps because it centers entirely on Ripley's character. Several other memorable characters are introduced like Clemens, the soft spoken doctor, and Dillon, the religious leader. Golic is a fascinating character who's entire character arc was cut from the theatrical version but thankfully is in the special edition. Alien 3 is a difficult film for a mass audience because it doesn't have the horror or action aspects of the first and second that an audience can easily latch on to. It is a film about loss and internal conflict, not exactly the stuff one thinks of with popular entertainment, but I've always looked at the Alien Trilogy as more than just movies. Alien 3 has it's flaws, mainly the looming question of where the alien egg at the beginning of the film came from (but then again we never found out where the ship in the first film came from did we?) This film gives such a sense of completion and finality to the series that I wish no more installments had been made after it. It has one of the best endings in film history, but seeing David Fincher's subsequent work with Seven, The Game, and Fight Club, great endings are a trend in his films. This is a very rewarding film, but not an easy one to watch if you are looking for mindless entertainment. There are greater ideas and themes at play in Alien 3. Watching the first three back to back as a trilogy creates an amazing experience much like following a well loved character through a series of novels, sharing in their hardship and triumph as they go along.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as many say it is. Very entertaining but not enough aliens,Sigourney Weaver was great in the movie and was definitely the highlight of the film. The setting was unique and the whole religious cult that was going on with the inmates was interesting. Not as tense as the previous two with almost zero action unlike the previous Aliens.

"Weak, boring and utterly predictable","I actually wasted money seeing this movie on pay-per-view. The movie was soooooooooo boring that my brother decided to fall asleep and told me to wake him up when something exciting happened.After seeing this movie, I read in an issue of US magazine, that Sigourney Weaver was responsible for the way the movie was scripted. She demanded that the script not contain any firearms (hence the boring and dank prison environment which unusually had no weapons-go figure). She really messed this Alien pic up big time!!! Aliens success (in my opinion) was that action provided by the weaponary. Also, Alien 3 was more a sorry excuse to end the Alien saga on a wishy-washy sentimental note. For me, the movie failed miserably.The attack scenes are unbelievably predictable. I felt like like I knew 15 minutes in advance of who was going to get killed by the alien. The alien creature itself is rather dull and unimpressive. The plot is geered more towards a soap opera audience than a sci-fi movie. This movie failed to provide anything exciting or rewarding. I remember the printed advertisements for this movie were saying stuff like: ""3 times the terror"". GIVE ME A BREAK! This movie was more like 3,000 times the disappointment.My advice, stick to Alien and Aliens for true satisfaction and don't even bother to watch Alien 3!",,Anonymous,Horror
Good,A good movie in the Alien franchise series of movies but the third as usual in a movie with sequels not as good as the first two by far,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien 'cubed'? The project never really gets out of the box...,"You can practically see the board of whomsoever meeting around a table, their faces contorted as they strain to come up with an idea on why a second ""Alien"" sequel would happen at all; what it's premise might be; how it might be the case that one of these monsters might have found its way into proceedings given the first sequel, 1986's ""Aliens"", concluded as it did. In the end, the best they can settle for is a brief rewriting of history: something, inexplicably, manages to crawl its way into the escape vessel, and here we all go again.I was always aware there were issues over the production of ""Alien3"", the classic case of the studio facing off against the director in a fashion more akin to the medium of television; that immortal battle, not of aliens versus predator, but of business versus art; of a studio not having any interest in auteuristic integrity but delivering bang-for-buck. I have never quite found the motivation to look up as to the precise details of the rift with which ""Alien3"" was fraught, but I suppose there are bits and pieces of its evidence in the film when you watch it now: its early eagerness to go down the route of a mood piece, the way it eventually bottles that for second unit material, the finale itself, which must have induced a battle of words off-camera not dissimilar to how someone representative of a large organisation tries to talk somebody out of what they're contemplating...But all that comes later. We pick up where the last film left off: Ripley (Weaver), firmly established as the franchise's lead, drifts aimlessly through space with a young girl; an android and a hardened solider, the only four survivors of an expedition which saw a crew of marines frequent an alien infested space community years prior. She crash lands on a planet which basks in a violent storm, where greys and cold blues dominate the colour palette and ugliness the skyline. It is home to that of a prison, which seems as if it is supposed to sport the worst kind of inmates imaginably, but are here in an odd transitional phase; they have found God, rapists are undergoing vows of celibacy; serial killers are more interested in delivering sermons than blunt objects into people.When Ripley awakes, the wardens who run the facility can only take her story with a pinch of salt, but why else would a soldier; an infant; a droid and a technician be banded together in an escape pod? She has, in fact, lost the three survivors from the last film, who did not survive the crash-landing, which is a shame, because the film had two or three fairly interesting characters with whom we had spent enough time to get to know. Not to use them here was a pity, although did demonstrate a gutsy decision on the director's behalf to want to create his own idea, his own universe.We sample what this might have been like via Lance Henriksen's Bishop character, who is briefly brought back via the miracle of technology. She can only find solace thus in the character of Clemens, a medical officer played by Charles Dance with some conviction; someone with an unfortunate past and who walks around with a lot of weight on his shoulders - suddenly, we don't mind at all if the entire piece revolves around the two of them.The film does well with its gamesmanship once the alien does show up and people are found a little worse for wear; we are, after all, on a planet populated by psychopathic criminals and there is a good deal of worth in the exchanges as per who is telling the truth and what exactly is going on. It is only a shame these exchanges do not go on for a little longer. Eventually, the film will switch to its horror setting, and things bed down into a more familiarised groove.The dynamic here as per ""Aliens"" is that, while these criminals are about as tough as the marines, they are the inverse in that they have previously used their violent energy for amoral purposes. It felt as if there might have been some interesting ground to cover as per exploring morality and redemption, forcing the audience into getting behind an unpleasant character-or-two, but it just isn't present. Those the film considers suitable to propel it into its final act are reforming themselves anyway, so why bother?The inmates are, additionally, not armed with the latest in military hardware, but they feel suspiciously less vulnerable than the armed marines. This is because, firstly, the film isn't made as competently and secondly because we don't really know any of them in the first place. The film is therefore not as tense as it should have been. What is also markedly different here is that there is no insider or traitor to the cause like in ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", so there is no dramatic revelation as the film reaches its crescendo as before. Said crescendo is a messy finale, more synthetic than the previous two and down in a maze of corridors whose geography I lost track of.Standing back and taking stock of ""Alien3"", you can see the skeletons of two or so different films - it is almost as if it didn't even need an alien in order to work, and that the presence of such a thing bogs it down. Reimagine it as a film merely relaying a chapter in Ripley's life, with or without Dance's character; stuck on a prison planet where all of the inmates are unpleasant; where Hicks and Newt are alive and walking around and where the 'Organisation' still wants witness to its prize. What we get instead is an experience that is probably despised more than it deserves to be, but still falls well short of its bigger sisters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wish it had never been made.,"Did IQs drop sharply while this film was being made? How did the facehuggers get on to the Sulako? How? Watch the end of Aliens - the Queen is quite clearly NOT carrying any eggs. This is the worst type of sequel, one which undermines previous films in an attempt to eclipse them. The story for Alien3 doesn't consider Alien or Aliens at all. Unforgivably it instead does its best to wipe the slate clean killing Newt and Hicks off in the cheapest most anonymous way possible. This makes the rescue of Newt (the last 20 minutes of the fantastic and infinitely superior Aliens) totally redundant.The sets and music are on the whole good but lack the imagination and variety of the previous two films. The CGI is dreadful, the Aliens size is inconsistent and on several occasions it looks as 2 dimensional as the plot. Also the inter crew tension from the first film and marine banter from the second film is replaced with vulgar insults exchanged between the prisoners. Its a strange coincidence that the sole convict character with any merit is the only one with an American accent. Sigourney Weaver puts in a huge effort but its not enough.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The end of an epic trilogy,"Everything has been said about this movie already, but let's find out why the rating of it is so low. Here are some points of a popular reviewer, who has almost 100 percent support of their readers.1. At some points the audience is bored stiff and at other moments they are confused by the outlandish action sequences.Outlandish action? Was it too alien? And sorry you were bored by the exceptional cinematography, underlined by a pace that was just right not to rush things, which brings me the second point.2. ...a disjointed mess that feels forced and rushed.Story seemed linear to me. And which one is it, boring or rushed?3. The direction is never clear and there is no real screenplay here at all.This is just saying it was bad, without saying anything at all. How is this helpful.4. Charles Dutton is pretty good, but his character lacks the development to really make him interesting. Everyone else is just present...Dutton's character needs no development. What do you want, him finding Jesus again? Dance's backstory is interesting, and we get to know little details about everyone else like for example the IQ of one of the guards who then later unexpectedly gives his life for what he believes in, pretty strong character development for a minor player in a Sci-Fi Thriller. And that is the main problem people have when rating ""Alien³"", they don't know it's not a horror film like ""Alien"" and it's not an action flick like ""Aliens"".5. Overall a disappointment that is not very impressive at all. 2 stars out of 5.More bashing without sound reasoning behind it. This film is clearly underrated, and if the aforementioned reviewer had seen what we have seen in 2017, especially in the Science Fiction genre, he might even agree and change his opinion about how a ""disjointed mess"" looks like.I give 10 not to up the overall score, but because ""Alien³"" ends Ripley's ordeal in a stylish and original way, without insulting the intelligence of the viewer, or rehashing previous plot lines.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Special edition significantly better,"I am a fan of Fincher's work so I watched both versions on the same day, I understand the special edition is closer to what Fincher wanted. My rating is an average rating, I would rate the Theatrical cut as 6 and the extended special version (30 minutes longer) as 8. As with other movies (""Once upon a time in America"" is a good example), cutting a movie short sometimes makes it significantly worst than the version the director wanted. Considering all the problems (no script available when filming started, multiple changes of personnel), the Special Edition is quite ok, Fincher added his style.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A pathetic movie, which I'd never seen all of","Anyone who enjoyed the first 2 films, especially the 2nd film would be disappointed at this one. Set in a prison colony where no one has any guns, why would one make a movie like this? To those who don't want a violent movie, watch a drama... you don't make a storyline with ferocious creatures like that in a movie where no guns are present. The aliens proved to be kickass creatures in the first 2 films, and in this one, they should've been dispatched in the same manner as in the 2nd one.Simply killing off Newt & Hicks was a bad idea too. They fought hard in the 2nd film, and deserve better.I heard about the plot and only saw bits & pieces of this movie. I had no desire to see it at all, after I heard about the no guns. It just wasn't worth it to me.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oh it was disappointing and bad,"Alien³ takes everything from the first two films and obliterates it. They tried way to hard to scare people by putting in all sorts of gore and showing the Alien everywhere. As I have said in my reviews of Halloween, gore does not equal scary and sadly the makers of this movie could not realize this. The story is good but is dragged down plot holes that occur all throughout the film. While there is some good acting, there are no interesting characters except for Riply (the writers saw to that didn't they). This film seriously lacked the horror of the first film and the action of the second. Where was James Cameron when we needed him?",,Anonymous,Horror
Above avarage,"Alien3, directed by D. Fincher, is an intriguing continuation of the Aliens storyline. This shift in dynamics brings a new aspect to the franchise, creating a tense survival story in a harsh, weapon-free environment.I think the tone Fincher set for this film is incredibly effective, providing a gritty and bleak atmosphere that feels right for the narrative. The editing, with its mix of short and long cuts, keeps the pacing tight and engaging.I also loved the cinematography. Fincher's use of close-ups, wide shots, and a variety of camera lenses adds to the sense of confinement and danger. The camera movement, especially the alien's POV shots or moves forward into scenes, is another standout.Visually, Alien3 has excellent color grading and a good use of shadows to enhance the mood. The way the colors and lighting interact to create a harsh, industrial look really works with the prison setting.While the dialogue isn't on the same level as the first two films, I feel that's intentional. These characters come from a different world - a rough, brutal prison - the dialogue reflects their environment.The VFX are great overall, but the decision to use CGI for the alien was a huge letdown for me. It looked awkward and unrealistic. I wish they had stuck with more practical effects, like in the earlier films.However, I didn't find the writing and the slow pacing, which is important to me, as strong as the first two films, probably because the prison setting limited the complexity of the narrative.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Decent Third Installment of the Franchise,"This film essentially picks up where its immediate predecessor left off with ""Ripley"" (Sigourney Weaver) once again inside a hibernation pod as her shuttle craft drifts in outer space. Although there are a couple of other people also inside her ship, she is the only survivor after it crash lands on a former penal colony that has since been transformed into a metal foundry consisting of an entirely male population. Needless to say, the arrival of a female causes quite a stir-especially since most of the men had previously served sentences for sexual crimes. But what nobody realizes at the time is that an alien creature was also aboard the shuttle craft and it has survived the crash as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay film which boasted enough action and special effects to keep things interesting. It did, however, get a little tedious toward the end but all things considered I thought that this was a decent third installment of the franchise and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ok threequel,"I'm watching the entire alien franchise for the first time. The first two movies I thought were incredible. The second one may have been better than the first.

I watched the Directors cut and it was over 2 1/2 hours long. I can see why they cut it down by about 40 minutes. I think had I watch the theatrical release I would have enjoyed it better.I do love the continuity in these movies. They pretty much pick up right after the previous one ended.

One of the most under-rated movies ever...,"If only Fox knew what David Fincher would turn out to be, director of the critically acclaimed Seven and Fight Club. Yet what he churned out under the enormous pressure that was mounted on him, is close to stunning.What i love about Alien 3 is that it's completely different from the previous Alien movies and almost unlike anything in it's genre. It's so moody, downbeat and violent and treats the audience with intelligence and a sense of maturity, say, missing from Resurrection and AVP.The special edition does well to cover up most loose ends and is much closer to Fincher's original vision. Alien 3 is visually stunning, still to this day, one of a few flaws is the awful mo-motion that is incredibly dated, but bar that, the Alien looks really cool.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Trainwreck or not? Not an easy decision, but the answer is: Trainwreck","I never used to flat-out hate Alien 3, but I was never a huge fan of it, either. Of course, both Alien and Aliens are perfect 10s, while Alien 3 deviates from the course of excellence. It had many problems, chief of which was the way it continued and yet did not continue from the previous film. If Hollywood wants to do a continuation, they should do a continuation, instead of making a movie that really stands alone, but has a misplaced reference to continuity between the two movies ungracefully inserted. That's a very inconsistent, half-assed and frankly shitty way to present a movie to devoted audiences.However, I did watch Alien 3 several times up through the last 12 years, and seemed to like it better and better each time. I was starting to convince - I mean fool - myself that it was a wholesome stylistic exercise and experience.Then the Director's Cut came out. A friend of mine characterizes it as ""different, but not better or worse. Just different"". We have a longer and infinitely more well-rounded story, with a completely different opening (Ripley having been flung out of the EEV, and the chest-burster having infected an ox - not a dog), and much, much bigger roles for the inmates at the penal colony. Finally, there is a reason for the story to be set in a prison. And there's much more human drama, and it's quite well-made.But. There's a big ""but"". It is stylistically well done, but it just doesn't work very well. It's not a terribly interesting story. The whole thing reeks of a bad idea that has nothing much to do with sci-fi *or* aliens - or anything else. One doesn't really care about the characters. Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dance both do a good job in their roles, but the story is just not substantial. Where are the overtones and the subtext; the symbolism? What is the movie saying? Not much.All the Director's Cut has accomplished for me is to demonstrate how enormously empty the theatrical version was, and replaced it with something that indeed is not better, just different. One cannot call the Director's Cut worse, because the story is much more coherent and wholesome. It just isn't of much interest.I am sad to say that I have now lost the mild appreciation I used to have for Alien 3. I used to rate it a 6 out of 10, but now, in the realization that it really is quite a bad movie, I have to revise that rating to a 4. *Sigh!*",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bad idea,"It's fun to compare Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher, the directors of Alien, Aliens and Alien^3, respectively. You couldn't find three more different directors.In Alien ^3, Fincher wants you to think he's cool. In Aliens, Cameron wants you to see the movie three times at the theater, tell all your friends how terrific it is, then buy the video the day it comes out. And in Alien, Scott wants you to eat sh*t and die. Cameron and Scott succeed, Fincher fails.Or maybe: Scott is NYC, Cameron is LA, and Fincher is Seattle.How about: Scott is a Lamborghini, Cameron is a Lincoln Navigator, and Fincher is a Prius with a Hummer hidden in the garage at home.Alien^3 just doesn't make it. Its grim penal colony is a boring cliché. The script is lame. Because of it, Sigourney Weaver gives her weakest performance in the Alien series.Alien^3 tries to be pretentious and fails even at that. Skip over this one and move on to Alien Resurrection, which might not be up to the standards of the first two but still towers above Alien^3.",,Anonymous,Horror

Alien v Brits,"Although the curse of the sequel is apparent, it is not as bad as early critics depicted. It has it's own nihilistic atmosphere which sets it apart and the roster of British character actors marooned on a distant prison planet provides an interesting backcloth for the ensuing mayhem. By all accounts it was a troubled shoot with the director disowning the version finally released and certainly it compares poorly with Alien and Aliens. The action and shock sequences, for example, needed a better edit. But it remains markedly superior to the following sequel Alien Resurrection, which was appalling. So if you keep your expectations in check Alien3 is worth a look and best enjoyed on it's own merits outside the wider Alien series.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Peculiar Sequel to the Classic Franchise,"After two quite remarkable films, the ""Alien"" franchise returned with a third movie that fails to match the level of its predecessors but still offers enjoyable entertainment and delight for genre fans.An important point that can't be ignored, and one that I didn't really connect with in the movie, is that it seems like right from the opening scene, even in the title sequence, the film rushes to more or less completely undo everything that happened in the previous movie. It feels as though they thought of the prison plot and forced the story to get there, thereby disregarding almost everything that happened in the previous film as if it wasn't really significant. It's understandable that as a kind of ""horror"" film, there's often a legitimate attempt to shock, but when it comes to a sequel to one of the most important and successful sci-fi movies of all time, dismissing what came before so blatantly is a bit puzzling. What makes this even worse is that the writer of the movie is the same person who wrote the story for the previous film, so there's no denying the movie's place in the series' canon (unlike, for example, ""Resurrection,"" which, of course, whether we like it or not, is part of the canon, but we would really prefer it wasn't).Despite this, it's hard to say that the writing in the movie isn't good, as it might actually be the most humorous film in the series, with a dark humor that over the years became very typical to this film's director. The plot is also quite original, to be honest, although it feels more like a spin-off than a main continuation of the series. Furthermore, it does manage to deepen the motif of the political-economic interest of ""the Company"" that tries at any cost to obtain a Xenomorph to learn how to exploit it ""for the benefit of humanity"" (meaning, for their benefit) that we saw in the 2nd film.Sigourney Weaver is excellent as usual, and it was also very nice to see the legendary Charles Dance (""Game of Thrones,"" ""The Crown"") in his early years in another role that seems like it was written especially for his acting style. As for the other actors... many of them need improvement, and the rest gave decent performances.An interesting point is that, to be honest, when I started the series, I was quite surprised to discover that the most iconic shot from it actually comes from this movie, which isn't ""considered"" one of the best. An interesting tidbit I read about this scene is that the studio initially opposed including it in the movie, and it was a young and unknown director named David Fincher who insisted on including it (almost behind the producers' backs). The rest, of course, is history.While the second movie continued the world-building that the first film started in an exemplary manner, here it seems like they took a step back and made a more limited film that doesn't provide a lot of additions to what we already received in the previous movies in terms of lore. While this isn't inherently a bad thing, it feels a bit like a side story where it's odd to place the central character like this. It's a bit late to think about it now, but in hindsight, perhaps it would have been possible to take Ripley's character in more meaningful directions in the direct continuation of the second film-of course, not in the bizarre retcon that the fourth movie made.Xenomorph action is always fun, and in this movie, they took it in a completely new direction, so we would also recommend this film to fans of the genre. Although it's not a groundbreaking film like the previous two, it's still an enjoyable viewing experience and a nice movie in its own right. Additionally, it marks the debut of someone who would go on to become one of the best and most important directors in the history of cinema-so you could say it's a kind of must-watch film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Can't state this emphatically enough... see the Special Edition,"The producers of Alien3 should be ashamed of themselves and they owe David Fincher a serious apology and compensation. They caused so much hassle and stuck their noses in places they didn't belong that the theatrical release(TR) of Alien3 was watered down compared to the masterpiece David Fincher produced in the Special Edition(SE). The theatrical version deserves the lowish rating it has received, but the Director's cut is outstanding and in my opinion is the best of all the Alien movies in the franchise to date!!! In this day and age of much longer movies, it doesn't make sense to see in hindsight the editorial debauchery David Fincher's Alien3 was witness too. The TR was bad. Large sections of the plot were stripped, they replaced the pivotal alien host, and in general the sections that set the scene were all missing. One Simple and essential must... SEE THE SPECIAL EDITION !!!!The characters are disturbingly great and portray a very credible motley band of backwater planet prisoners. Charles Dance is brilliant but unfortunately isn't on screen for as long as I wished. Maybe that in itself is a testament to the brilliance and another reason why some people scored Alien3 lowly- their sensibilities were hurt with a fantastic character killed quickly!!. Charles Dutton is a mean and believable 'top dog' and the contribution of the reliable Pete Postlethwaite was a treat. The interaction between prisoners, authorities and visitors was always evident and very well handled. Alien3 further highlighted the expendability of human life for corporate greed.The Alien is one nasty critter. Different to the other Alien movies, the camera angles of the alien's sight and movement are well executed. It is clear the creators wished to return to that claustrophobic and technological defunct world of the first Alien movie, and while it is very different, I believe it worked extremely well.Alien3 has an incredibly beautiful and stirring musical score. It is haunting in parts and from all the 'Alien' movies, I believe most people would have this tune in their head. In the scheme of the Alien saga, I believe Alien3 -Special Edition to be the best. Without giving away serious spoilers, the SE reinstates massive sections that transcend Alien3 from a lowly rated movie to a thoroughly deserved masterpiece. It is a pity David Fincher wasn't more experienced and time under his belt to tell and force the producers to 'My way or the highway'.SPECIAL EDITION ONLY TO BE SEEN!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I really wish someone would make a sequel to Aliens.,"This movie definitely wasn't it.  There were plot holes you could fly a starship through, starting with a ridiculous initial premise.  The characters were uninteresting.  I was never sure who just died or why I should care.  I've always believed that there was more potential backstory that could have been mined from the original Alien.  Primarily, some scriptwriter could have given thought to the original alien spacecraft, where it came from, why were they transporting these creatures, what went wrong, etc.  Unfortunately, that would have required intelligent thought and some originality, which is -not- what went into this film.  There are two things I remember about the first time I saw this film.  One was that I caught myself checking my watch a lot (which didn't happen when I saw Aliens the first time).  Second, I remember feeling utterly depressed when it was (finally) over.  Over the years, I've largely been successful in purging this film from my mind, but every now and then something happens to remind me of it and of how much I hated it.  As I said, I wish someone would make a sequel to Aliens, forgetting that this travesty ever existed.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""We're All Gonna' Die. The Only Question Is How You Check Out. Do You Want It On Your Feet, Or On Your F***in' Knees...Begging?""","Riley crashes on a hard labor prison planet. It contains violent male prisoners only, and its refinery is being shut down by inmates who elected to stay.The project went through several hands. Director Vincent Ward, conceived of a Bio sphere that was an artificial construct that had a natural eco system on its surface. The abandoned sphere was then populated by a religious order who disliked technology. This idea became known as the wooden planet and was abandoned. Ward left the project. The monks became prisoners who found religion and David Fincher was hired as Director.Weaver was made a co-producer, and wanted the story to have less reliance on guns. The result was that the prison is run on a trust system, which becomes problematic when an alien turns up. There is little to fight with.The cast is a who's who of British thespians. With their shaven heads it becomes harder to pick them apart, as many are fodder. Some look similar to each other, which doesn't help. The majority have little to do.Lance Henrickson returns as the damaged Bishop, in voice only, and as his human counterpart. Both parts are cameos that move the plot along.Charles Dance as medic, Clement, is probably the best realised character for a short time. The religious element comes from Charles S. Dutton as Dillon. After a while this begins to grate as his monologues become tedious.Brian Glover and Ralph Brown represent prison authority as the Warden and deputy '86'.The Alien is born of a dog and takes on its characteristics, except cocking its leg and peeing acid. Visually it looks very similar to its predecessors. This time there are no hints of cocoon making. We see its visual point of view.The film is a return of sorts to the sole menace in a haunted house. This time the difference is that Riley is carrying a Queen embryo. Her nemesis won't kill her as it is acting as a sentry.A better idea would have been to have a breakout in the prison, with Riley's nemesis bumping off her attackers. The irony would have worked better in a tense standoff against armed rapists.The story is more of the same, with Riley's predicament the only difference. She is in a no win situation and takes the obvious route.The film is worth a watch but it doesn't match its predecessors. It went through too many hands and there was studio interference. New elements are not capitalized on, so it relies on familiar troupes. The cast is too big, and the ending is perhaps where the film should have started.On most retail releases, you have the option of watching the Workprint.

Underrated? Overrated more like!,"I really can't see why some people think this film was underrated. The imagery is offensive to the eye, not suspenseful or ""dark."" The action is mind-numbingly boring, and inexcusably the wonderfully talented Pete Postlethwaite barely gets a look in! The camera effects are impressive, but the computer generated Alien is terrible. It amazes me why Sigourney Weaver ever agreed to star in a sequel to this awful film. So there!",,Anonymous,Horror
Grand not amazing,"A mixed bagWe start the movie with Ripley who has crash landed but the rest of her crew mainly Newt didn't make it. She crash lands into a maximum security prison. After spending some time it becomes apparent that Ripley brought an uninvited guest. Will the inmates form for the greater good or exploit the situation, all is to be seen who survives this movie.Look this isn't as good as its previous BUT it's not a bad movie it does some silly things and one of those would be killing off Newt as it for me completely undid the good of the second movie.There are some great performances, Sigourney of course but I really enjoyed Charles Dance. There is a good story rooted into this movie which I do enjoy but the horror feeling even the action aspect of the second feels lost as the movie tries to do it all.Look it's fine, nothing amazing, 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien³,"This third instalment in the franchise reverts more to the original, more claustrophobic environment as ""Ripley"" (Sigourney Weaver) crash lands onto a penal colony run by ""Andrews"" (Brian Glover) where the inmates are all pretty unsavoury characters. It's not long after she arrives that one of them gets minced by an huge ventilation fan - but, was he? Her suspicions are further confirmed when one of the guard dogs has a very bad attack of gastroenteritis! With the help of the ex-convict doctor ""Clemens"" (Charles Dance), she has to galvanise her sceptical fellow humans to prepare for the impending onslaught whilst also dealing with some rather horrific personal information too! This has much more of a British feel to it, and that doesn't always work. Glover overacts badly, and Paul McGann, Dance and an out of his depth Danny Webb (""Morse"") don't offer Weaver anything like enough support to create the sense of peril from ""Alien"" (1979). That said, though, the tightly shot photography in the interior scenarios and the deft pace from David Fincher do create quite a sense of menace without the need for gore or excessive special effects. It ends rather lamely, I thought, but is still quite a watchable sci-fi horror film that though not in the same class as the first two, is still very watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but not as Impactful,"This story leaves off from it's previous sequel where Ripley escapes with Newt and Hicks in a space shuttle, while in hyper sleep the shuttle crashes severly injuring and killing Hicks and Newt.Ripley realises later she's on a remote planet with a refinery inhabiting all male prison inmates. This is another film where the alien sneaks in and terrorizes again.This makes a descent end to Ripley but not as impactful because it really just copies and paste the tone but they add a new alien. I felt Hicks should of lived long enough to face the new alien at least. It's a worthy watch but doesn't give off the fear it gave in the first two sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

James Cameron stole this franchise from Ridley Scott; David Fincher is stealing it back,"The original film was a well-made, claustrophobic, dark, pessimistic horror film directed by Ridley Scott. It was James Cameron whose 'Aliens' played more like an action film, complete with a happy ending - the nuclear family going on to a bright future at the end. Cameron himself and his fans looked at the opening 10 minutes - killing off the would-be husband and child of Ripley - as a slap in the face. Of course they would - Alien 3 is a claustrophobic, dark, and pessimistic - like a horror film should be. In any case, the franchise never belonged to Cameron.SPOILER ALERT: I like Fincher's directorial point of view in this film - it is amenable to the genre. The performances first-rate as well. Even the concept of a new alien (i.e., born of a four-legged animal) was interesting. It's too bad Fincher was hampered by the producers to salvage a bad situation (as the third director, with sets built for a subsequently rejected concept, without even a complete script). Certainly, it is far better than the attempt at dark comedy in 'Alien Resurrection.' That said, the film does have some serious flaws. The CGI of the alien is a definite weak point. Then there's at least one problem with the script - particularly, why the queen alien takes so much longer to gestate than the alien that threatened the prisoners. And arguably the biggest flaw is that it really does hit many of the same beats that the first film hit.Almost two decades later, Fincher proved to be a far more artistic director, with his own distinct voice, going on to make darker thought-provoking films of his own ('Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'The Social Network'), while Cameron went on to make big, bloated popcorn movies, with really strong special effect and really weak scripts ('Titanic', 'Avatar').",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sad,"I am a huge fan of the Alien series. That is, up to when I saw Alien3. The movie is so tortured by bad graphics, lame acting, and a plot that just isn't up to standards, that it shouldn't even be added into the Alien franchise. So many things are overlooked throughout the movie, that I feel that the director didn't even really try. I mean, come on! You are making an Alien movie. It should carefully be considered and thought through, not just thrown out there like some teen slasher flick. And this is very disappointing. Why wouldn't you spend time on a movie that has such high standards, and should be one of the best movies at the time. But instead, the director decided to just make a very mediocre movie (and that's being nice). I really wish that it could have been better, but it's not. Too bad.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bad taste in the mouth,"While it is normal to often have a happy story go bad, somehow it just seems out of place here in a way you can't explain in words. Some of the happiness achieved at the end of 'Aliens' is taken away in this third film and it takes forever to get going once the new situation is established. There is minimal action and while the first 'Alien' movie was low on action and made up for it by being and high on tension, this film is just stale. Sigourney Weaver does her best this time around and she is quite good but David Fincher, who did well after this with 'Se7en', 'The Game', and 'Fight Club', seems like the wrong guy to direct a movie like this as his vision is full of potential but low on actual execution as he looks confused at times in the story he is trying to complete. Do yourself a favour and take this one with a grain of salt and put up a road block in lumping it in with 1 & 2, and avoid the fourth film at all costs.",,Anonymous,Horror
On the Heels of Romulus,"I'm a fan of the series and there's plenty said inside other reviews that range from 2 to 10. And as with other movies that have top level talent, *Fincher, Weaver etc., that get picked apart, there's finger pointing on who's responsible for what.But let me say this: Romulus is worse that the worst part of A3.At least all involved her tried to give a story that matched our expectations. At least one could sit down and pick out some good ""Alien"" moments and say: Some Alien is better than none and therefore I'm glad I watched this film. But what seems to be happening nowadays is Bonkers, a la SW9.I rewatched A3 on Blu-ray and one of my initial disappointments was corrected and now I was able to see the tunnel chase scenes and could piece together (or at least try) what the actors were doing. Watching the first time I could not, and just the sound was not enough to create a connection to the actor's peril. That and Ripley reviving Ash in that mess of a android post-crash.Now contrast that with the resurrection of Ash in Romulus. Ian Holm died in 2020. I want to puke at the AI version and not just a *nod to the character but full-on plot involvement. In comparison, A3 deserves my 7 rating because it followed two amazing films and at least it wasn't something I will never ever watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good as the first two, but still a scary flick.","I'm a huge fan of the Alien series. Alien was great and Aliens was a master piece. As expected a lot of pressure was put on Alien 3, and sadly it didn't deliver. But then again I didn't expect it to. How many movie series have had three hits in a row? Star Wars pops to mind, but not a whole lot more.So let's talk about what the film did right. For starters Alien 3 succeeds in presenting a very dark and depressing mood. It introduces a new type of alien which looks cool and creative and helps keep the movie feeling fresh. The acting is also top notch.It did do a few things wrong. For starters the majority of characters are forgettable and for the most part not very like able. The CGI effects are awful. The aliens color will change and its movements don't look realistic at all. Luckily you'll mostly get close ups of it so it won't be CGI.In conclusion it's the best in the alien series, but still succeeds in providing a few good scares. I give the theatrical cut a 7/10 and the extended cut a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated,"I will admit that Alien3 has its problems but I love the dark depressing setting and color tones. It just looks amazing. And just as its predecessors, it has an amazing cast, sets and music. It also plays with different aspects of the creature and its host and the psychology of being prey to the most iconic monster of all time.
It always has been a favorite of mine although some creature shots look outdated (bad superimposed non-CGI). Also the script has some issues but somehow I am fine with it. There are two different versions but no true directors cut. It is so sad that David Fincher did not get a chance to make his own vision of what he wanted for Alien3 and there where a lot of problems during production with interference of too many people. There should have been more gore and horror in it, but the suspense is still there, just not as good as I would like it to be. Somehow it is amazing how good it turned out to be.So.... too many people underrate this one and I really think they should re-watch it. I don't believe you should compare it to ALIENS. Alien3 just feels more depressing and serious, less of an action flick and more drama. I will not spoil anything but I can say I like the introduction, contrary to ALIENS fans that hate it.For me, the trilogy stops with Alien3 and if you enjoyed the first two alien movies, i don't see why you would not enjoy Alien3. Just don't compare it to the previous ones, it has a different feel and atmosphere to it which i liked very much.A pity there is no real proper 'double ending' like the previous movies that made them stand out more.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good horror. *Spoilers*,"One of the most thrilling movies of the 80's gets a conclusion, and it's not pretty. In fact it is ugly.It turns out the alien queen left some eggs on board the spaceship and they wreck havoc with the ship's computer killing Hicks, Newt and sending android Bishop to the scrap heap.If matters can't get worse for Ripley she ends up on a prison planet which is filled with a right bunch of ugly bastards, she gets her head shaved,impregnated by Charles Dance, impregnated by the Alien and that pesky alien is back again.The Alien trilogy could have ended in so many different ways yet it goes for the super sad and tragic ending. It's still a good horror. As a the closer for such a pair of classic movies, it's way too depressing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible,"One of the worst movies in the history of movies. I've never seen a movie so blatantly ignore continuity. There were no eggs in the sleep chamber. The hypersleep pods are totally different. The ship design was different. The ""Sulaco"" painted on the ship was white instead of black. The alien was plainly stupid in not cocooning the victims as in previous films. Killing off the main characters was pointless. The prisoners know only one word, the ""F"" word. The gore is excessive and thrust directly in the audience's face unlike the stylish methods in the first two films.This was not an ALIEN movie. It was a copycat clone that screwed up every chance it got. Those who say it was a ""good"" or an ""okay"" film are forgetting that it is a SEQUEL which has certain responsibilites to live up to.Michael Biehn (Hicks) once said, ""They will never top ALIENS.""

A decent entry that takes bold risks despite its flaws,"'Alien 3' is the third instalment of the 'Alien' franchise and its certainly the most controversial and polarizing film of the series with its bleak and depressing tone, disjointed storytelling, nihilist visuals and its overall themes of redemption through suffering which doesn't exactly make this the most entertaining entry of the series. But that's what sets it apart from the others as each film has a very different feel and tone and this sequel is a strong entry in the franchise that's bold and unflinchingly dark and doesn't care about being just another carbon copy entry in the series and instead it does its own thing which has to be applauded.The Plot = Ellen Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) escape pod crash lands on Fiorina 161, a bleak wasteland inhabited by former inmates of the planet's maximum-security prison. Once again Ripley must face the alien life form that has stowed away in her pod as it hunts down and kills the prisoners and guards. But without weapons or modern technology Ripley leads the remaining men into battle against the alien.This entry does tend to get a lot of hate from fans and its not hard to see why but at the same time it's not entirely warranted. The film's overall depressing focus on the meaning and losing the will to live is really powerful within its grimy and brutal execution, but that's what makes it so alienating by making several choices that are questionable at best such as the decision to kill off the other survivors from the last film during the opening credits and for the rest of the story we grapple with Ripley's grief surrounded by violent men who you can't really root for and therefore lacking any humour or glimmers of hope making this a violent and miserable viewing experience.This may be far from being a perfect movie, but there's still a lot here you can appreciate depending on your taste in horror flicks that is, such as the relentlessly foreboding atmosphere which is perfectly captured by its industrial gothic cinematography. The complex and suspenseful action sequences that features plenty of thrills and tension and some of the special effects do look effective especially on the alien creature itself, but they are very inconsistent and hasn't quite held up as well by today's stands. Despite the production problems David Fincher's direction is solid as he does enhance the nihilism and sombre tone of the story with several striking shots and effective camerawork.The performances here are incredibly strong with Sigourney Weaver once again giving a stellar performance as the iconic heroine Ripley and here she really gets to add more layers and depth to her role. Brian Glover gives a strong performance as the prison planet's supervisor. Charles S. Dutton is great as always as Dillon and Charles Dance gives a sympathetic performance as the prison doctor Clemens and shares amazing chemistry with Ripley.Overall 'Alien 3' doesn't quite compare to the greatness of the first 2 'Alien' films, but it's a decent entry that wasn't afraid to take bold risks and try something different even if it didn't entirely pay off.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"How? Why?  What were these writers thinking?  How can you take a movie like ""Aliens"", arguably one of the best movies of all time and in essence ruin everything it stood for!  ""Aliens"" had a great story and developed characters you really learn to care about.  Then, along comes ""Alien 3.""When I first saw that another Alien movie was coming out I was extremely excited, being a huge fan of the previous two.  I could not wait to see the continuation of ""Aliens.""  What happened to the survivors, Hicks, Newt, Bishop, and Ripley.  These characters were awesome!  The developing relationships between Hicks and Ripley, and Newt and Ripley really added to the story.  The characters in ""Aliens""  made the movie special.So what does this piece of garbage ""Alien 3"" do?  It kills off the survivors from ""Aliens"" and replaces them with awful characters within an awful story. I am hoping and praying that Mr. James Cameron comes aboard to direct Alien 5 to stop the bleeding.  He can pick up where ""Aliens"" left off.  Perhaps start it off 20 years later so that he can use the same actors.  Forget that the last two Alien movies even exist.  Just AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Disappointing sequel, watchable but a complete mess",This film is a complete mess. It's watchable but is a huge letdown after the first two films. It casually dispense with the previous storyline as it places Sigourney Weaver on a prison planet with an alien loose. There is little action and the film isn't particularly tense or scary. Sigourney Weaver is good though and elevates the material. Characters appear from out of nowhere and it seems that a lot of tinkering was done with the final product.

"Reviewing the ""Assembly Cut"" special edition","When I saw it originally it was obviously not as good as the first 2 movies and quite frankly, not that good in general. But I just watched the 30 minute longer Director's Cut (Assembly Cut) and it clearly improves it.
It is still not at the level of Alien and Aliens but it is now a good movie on its own. Also as much as Alien was Ridley Scott's platform to set up the whole space horror genre and establish his style of dark sci-fi, and Aliens was James Cameron's rulebook to big action sci-fi blockbusters, Alien 3 Assembly's Cut is clearly the beginning of David Fincher's career in dark, psychological thrillers.

For this movie to score 10/10 you truly need to watch the special edition version!!!,"First up the theatrical release of alien 3 was rather crappy and a disgrace to the alien franchise and I would rate it 1/10!! What killed it was the use of CGI shots of the alien combined with the use of puppet shots and the rushed storyline explanation, when honestly the alien effects used should of been one or the other instead of trying to utilise the really primitive new style of CGI of the 90's trying to impress everyone with 3d technology while it was still in infant stages to prevent it looking quite pathetic!!! That said the theatrical releases storyline had promise but also was filled with holes caused by changing the story differently that the actual novel to cut the movie short and trying to cram it all into a normal feature length production which resulted in a completely flawed and overall hated movie and honestly it was my least favourite of the series!!! Let me say before I continue that the special edition still uses the flawed swap between alien effects but with that aside I will get to my point... when I saw the special edition of alien 3 i was extremely surprised and completely blown away and alien 3 special edition went from my least favourite to favorite instantly!! If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend doing so asap!!! It is a completely different movie with the identical storyline as the novel which alters parts removing a lot of the ridiculous parts and has a heap of new scenes added which competently fills in all the plot holes and answers alot of those questions you are left wondering about, it also extends the movies runtime just over an extra hour, which builds up the film's realisim, it's characters, emotions, quality, appeal and storyline to a truly aspiring masterpiece and a ultimately needed worthy part of the alien franchise!!! I've made a lot of my friends who hated the original alien 3 reluctantly watch the special edition and just like me and they have all loved it and come to the agreement of the same opinion I have of this movie and 90% of them now easily rate alien 3 special edition Thier favourite of the series just like me!! Who knows if you read my review and watch it you could too!!!!

Far from being the worst Alien movie,"It has been a really long time and finally I have the chance to watch and review a film that has most fans of the Alien franchise being dissappointed. Alien 3 (or Alien Cubed) was released in 1992, six years after Aliens. The film was directed by David Fincher and oh boy did this film have all sorts of problems including the story and production. Even David Fincher hates this film! The film sees the return of Sigourney Weaver and even Lance Henriksen. The film was a hit at the box office but it was a critical failure with fans and critics being largely dissappointed and at the time was called the worst Alien movie of all time. Obviously that would change in a few years. But does this film deserve the hate? Is there something worth watching in Alien 3?The film takes place (I assume) shortly after Aliens and we see that an Alien egg is on board the ship with Hicks, Newt, Bishop, and Ripley all of whom are in cyro sleep. The ship crashes and kills Newt, Hicks, and pretty much damages Bishop beyond repair. Ripley is still alive (and without a single scratch). They land on a planet that is a maximum security prison with only men. Oh and they are very religious as well. Ripley finds out that there is an Alien in the prison and that she must destroy this creature with the help of the inmates.Yes, I know, Alien 3 is not nearly as good as Alien and Aliens. That is already a given. But Alien 3 should be appreciated a little more in my opinion. I went into this film knowing that it was going to be not as good as the previous films and what I ended up thinking is that this film is not bad. For a standalone film that is. As a sequel, it sucks. HARD. First of all, killing off the characters in the beginning is a huge slap in the face for me and pretty much everyone who watched Aliens. But then again, this film is taking a huge risk and that is what this whole film is, a huge risk. Personally, I think it would have made for a better film if the characters were not automatically killed off. Sure, they could die later in the film. Ripley here is not as badass as she was in the previous films. Most of the time she is sad and really she does not do a whole lot. It even begs the question, what is Ripley fighting for? In the original, Ripley fought for survival. In Aliens, she fought for humanity. In this film, it is very unclear as to what she is fighting for. But Sigourney Weaver does a good job here in this film. The other characters are basically the same people. Bald, male criminals who we don't care about at all. Sure, Dillion was probably the best of the bunch. The acting is just OK. Now, when you compare the first three Alien movies, the first is a horror film, the second is an action film, and the third one can be labeled as a melodrama. The film is bleak which actually works for this film. It might not have worked with the other films, it works well with this film. Some other major criticisms about this film include very quiet conversations and a very slow beginning. But the last half of the film is fairly entertaining but obviously the other films last halfs are so much better. But it is fairly interesting that the characters think of creative ways to defeat the Alien when they do not have any guns at all. Which is different from the guns a blazing Aliens. The POV shots are fun but not scary. The ending itself works well and I like it for the most part and I see it as a good way to end the series. But of course, a sequel was made about five years after this film. The Alien itself is not as scary and that leads me to say that this film lacks the scares and suspense of the original films. The Alien here is barely seen for a decent amount of time. I suppose it is different from where the Alien comes from but anything that is different and new does not amount to much of anything. Back to the Alien though. The Alien effects are bad. Apparently they did a blue screen effect but it clearly shows and it is not that great. But the practical effects are fairly good.Alien 3 for some strange reason grew on me despite the mostly negative comments I have made. But this is far from being the worst Alien movie. There is some good things that Alien 3 does even if those things are not quite on par with the previous films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been just as good as the first two had it had a better director,"In my comment for ALIEN, I referred to ALIEN 3 as awful. After re-watching the film a second time, I now have come to realize that is not awful like I once thought, it's horrendous beyond belief. It ultimately suffers from a poor choice for director. David Fincher has his fans, but I have never quite warmed up to his style. Like Tim Burton, his style is an acquired taste. His style certainly doesn't fit ALIEN 3. In his feature film debut, Fincher directs as if he was directing one of his music videos, which damages the picture beyond repair. It comes across as if MTV was behind it. There are those who will say I am being unfair to Fincher since he walked off the project before editing even began and the production was an extremely troubled one, but regardless of how much studio interference comes into play, he ultimately was the man behind the camera and its his directing that makes ALIEN 3 the worst in the series. Fox should have put a more experienced director at the helm. As much as I hated the directing, the script is actually okay. In fact, had Walter Hill directed from the script he co-wrote, I have a feeling ALIEN 3 could have been just as good as the first two in the series. There are some good lines, and some intelligent ideas. It's a case where the script is better than the movie itself. 1/10",,Anonymous,Horror
The Assembly Cut brings new life to A:3,"The third installment of the Alien Saga has always been the least liked, from fans and critics alike. But today I watched the Assembly Cut for the first time and it does more justice to the story and to the trilogy. More depth to the characters. Sections removed or replaced. It is quite long at 2,5hours but it is a lot easier to watch than the theatrical cut at 2hours. I would rate the movie higher than 6/10 if it wasn't for one thing alone; the awful green-glowing (obviously) animated xenomorph.

The movie synopsis was interesting, but it wasn't innovative because it was similar to the previous alien movies. Unfortunately, the storyline wasn't well-written, nor well-explained and it was very simple. Also, there were too many characters and it was kinda difficult to remember all of them and they weren't really interesting, so I didn't really care about what was gonna happen to them. Sadly, it was an all male cast movie and their performances were descent. At least, it was an intense movie and there were some action-filled moments, but it wasn't as dark and creepy as the previous movies. Moreover, the alien's design wasn't we'll done and it looked like it was CGI. By the way, the killcount was bloodier than the previous movies, but there were still many off-screen death scenes.

Nearly Thrill-less or: How I Learned That the Alien is Really Just a Dangerous Pet,"I'm hardly the first to mention it, but it should be known by any potential viewer; the title being just is not in any way, shape or form as threatening herein as in the first two(which right there takes a chunk of the appeal, and proceeds to burn it to cinders). There's also really no atmosphere, not one that could unnerve anyone but the most easily intimidated, anyway, which further eliminates reasons we watched the prior entries. So what *do* we have? Well, the Fincher touch(though it should be known that he disowned it, and clearly with good cause) is there, somewhat. We're treated to Giger doing more design work. The score certainly isn't bad. Some of the writing isn't awful(and, not unlike the other sequels, it didn't exactly have a great start-off point, so let's give it at least a little slack... but let's keep to the pocket-knife for the cutting of it for now), if there are lines that... really couldn't work no matter how well they had been delivered. Anyway, I was on the positives of this; Ripley is still consistent, and Henriksen is back(if his performance is... shall we say ""overplayed"", to put it nicely). Some of the effects are the best yet of the series(others... not so much). The plot isn't all that interesting(oh dear, we're back at the criticisms), if it does have an idea or two that give the whole thing some merit(as well as characters and back-stories fit for something done by David). The Special Edition/Assembled Cut(not Director's Cut) adds scenes, some of which of lesser technical quality(but hardly a major bother, if one is up for watching more), which I would suggest for anyone who want to give this another chance(I enjoyed some of the new it brought about). In the end, I'm afraid I just find it more and more difficult and unsatisfying to actually sit down for the one hour and forty five minutes that this lasts before the ending credits start on their usual, anticipated roll(they really ought to jump, maybe do a little dance(...get down tonight), you know, mix it up a little) with each viewing. I recommend this to those who want to watch every movie in this series, and/or all of David Fincher's films. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's in no way the best in the series. But it is my favourite.,"A Tarkovsky tapestry, tones of Bergman, Fincher's religious epic in all of its flawed Kintsugi glory.A pristime image, a perfect arc for Ripley, one of Weaver's best performances, Charles Dance, a tender film that breathes (maybe a tad too much) but is a character study and a logical full circle back to the first Alien.
Fincher shoots everything as if Hell itself is looking up to claim them, as it may have done to his career. But it didn't. And in spite of its flaws, Alien3 is a masterfully written and shot and acted and conceived product that against all odds is amazingly cohesive. And better than any threequel I can care to remember. I was privileged to see in the cinema.Bergman and Tarkovsky just made a ponderous and thoughtful religious epic and they called it Alien3.The Assembly cut is a mess, it's repetitious and unfinished and slow but it's a true epic. The Alien is almost incidental, instead used, as in any good horror, as a presence and catalyst for the rawness and darkness and redemption of the characters to shine through. It's a great ensemble piece with superb, weighty British theatre and character actors and Ripley gets an arc with closure, I mean she even has a bit of sex!The last thing Alien needed after Aliens was Ripley, a lone survivor, trawling the galaxy with a two-hit-wonder Space Marine and a kid that couldn't act or barely speak. Cameron brought his sensibility to a succeeding-against-all-odds sequel and when Fincher took the reins he did the only honourable thing. He borrowed a style reminiscent of the original masters of cinema (just look at that first shot of Charles Dance in the robes on the 'beach'.) And he wiped the slate clean.And yet Newt and Hicks weren't glossed over, they were used to show Ripley's enduring strength, during the harrowing and telling Autopsy scene Ripley is asked whether Newt is her daughter; ""No"" she replies bluntly and we see how much of a survivor she is. If she thought that Newt was, she wouldn't be able to go on.Alien 3 is a pure character study, and the film much more than the others shows Sigourney Weaver's talent as a strong, measured, alert, pensive and smart character that says the right things, doesn't have to shout or prove herself and she has a powerful feminine presence without having to draw on any masculine energy. She is relatable and down to earth, charismatic and enigmatic and this story really manages to give her closure.The Xenomorph, bursting this time from an animal, feeds now and has different hunting mechanics, the effects might have been cutting edge but they were clearly rushed and badly comped but it still makes for some thrilling and still pretty unique action beats in the third act. Most striking in the film though has to be the representation of the Alien as the anti-christ, a pure demonic force, and the sequences of hellfire-like explosions, the gold and amber lighting, the canticle-esque music and the fact that every room echoes acoustically like some kind of church; it creates a visually and thematically memorable piece in the saga.There are some effective moments of dark humour, Fincher's use of low angles, some sumptuous cutting and a plethora of nice little high concept moments like using Bishop to read the Black Box or the fact that after the cooling water hits the metal pale it foreshadows the Alien popping at the end. Bad films don't do this. Fincher shoudl not have disowned this film, because it's definitely and defiantly his style. He took the mess of production that it was and forged to make his own religious epic from it and he succeeded. He made the best with what he had and it's no surprise that one of the most iconic images of the series, bald Ripley with the Alien head up against hers, he's created an Alien horror in the mould of a world cinema epic.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"8 For Assembly Cut, 5 For The Theatrical Release","The theatrical release of this film was horrible, whole character arcs dismantled. It just felt like it made no sense from a dramatic, structural standpoint and when that flaw came on top of the dingy, depressing tone it made for an unrewarding and messy viewing experience.If you watch this in the reconstructed 'Assembly' cut, though, you get to see roughly what the movie would have turned out like if Fincher had had his druthers. Without the studio butchery, it transpires, Alien 3 would have been a good, if still polarising, addition to the franchise.The points I knocked off are for things that Fincher, who directed this as well as a young debut director could have under the circumstances, couldn't have done much about. Firstly, there's the senseless deletion of two beloved characters from the second film, right at the start. I can't believe they couldn't think of ANY way to work Newt and Hicks into a compelling new story. Killing them off felt like senseless nihilism, which I could have forgiven, I suppose, if it hadn't rendered Ripley's struggles in the previous installment something of a waste of time. Then there's the climax where they're goading the alien through tunnels. I won't spoil the end, but this just bored me and went on too long. It wasn't terrible and I know they had no guns but, again, surely there was a better and more dramatically satisfying option...On the positive side, I have to give points for a slate of brilliant performances, a well-realised atmosphere of monolithic dread, an imaginative new direction that was actually an interesting idea, and everything about Golic's relationship with the dragon.Hating Alien 3 has become almost a hobby for cinephiles (and, believe me, I despise the butchered theatrical release) but if you can put aside your pre-conceptions and resentment at certain narrative choices, throw on the Assembly Cut and give it another go, there's more artistry here than first met the eye.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
All the special effects in the world cannot hide a poor script...,"...and Alien 3 has just that: a poor script. Gibson's version of the Alien 3 script, parts of which were incorporated into Alien Resurrection, is by far superior to this literary accident. One glaring factual error mars the script before the Alien even gets any screen time: cholera is not a virus, it is a bacterium. A reference to bubonic plague or ebola would have been far more appropriate, given that we're talking about a dead body in that scene.However, the fundamental problem in Alien 3 is the humans. In the previous two installments of the series, you could have almost called the films ""Human"" and ""Humans"" respectively, because the alien was often incidental to the way the human characters related to one another. The alien seemed to exist only to highlight the dangers of curiosity without caution or cooperation at times. Add to this the fact that both the films feature the best simulations of alien creatures outside of the digital era, and you can soon see where Alien 3 falls down.A special effects company who won't be mentioned here rallied hard for the contract to do the CGI effects for the alien in some shots. Funny that, because when one rallies to be awarded a job, one normally tries to do a good one. The alien in this film was so poorly simulated during CGI shots that it is quite clear which shots are the man in the suit, and which ones aren't. But by far the worst aspect of the film is the manner in which the human characters are conspicuously reduced at one point. It highlights the fact that the characters are not fleshed out enough for anyone to care.Another problem that becomes apparent when watching making-ofs is that the film was rushed into production without even a script to work from. The manner in which cast and crew members defend director David Fincher, highlighting the fact that he had to start shooting without a script, really suggests where the blame should be laid. Of the crew, only Alex Thomson is willing to openly blame the studio, but the fact that he is long since retired makes it clear that Fox particularly has a big problem with the dismal failure of this rush job.I gave Alien 3 a two out of ten. The first thought that came to mind when I saw the third Alien film at the theatre was one of disappointment. The last thought was that at least they couldn't screw the series up any worse. Alien Resurrection didn't prove me wrong as far as entertainment value was concerned. This movie sucks like a Godfrey's showroom.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

A different vibe,"Alien 3 is one of those films that really divides fans of the franchise. After the adrenaline-pumping action of Aliens, this third installment takes a darker, grittier turn, and let's just say it's not everyone's cup of tea. The decision to dump all the beloved characters from the previous film has raised more than a few eyebrows, and it definitely leaves a bittersweet taste. Visually, it has that grimy, industrial feel that fits well with the story, and the atmosphere is tense and claustrophobic in a way that mirrors the first film. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley delivers yet another stellar performance, but the plot can feel a bit disjointed, and the pacing drags in places. That said, I kind of appreciate the risks it takes. It's darker, and it tries to grapple with themes of sacrifice and loss in a way that the others didn't. While it may not be the fan-favorite, Alien 3 definitely carves out its own distinct identity in the series. It's worth a watch, but maybe not if you're looking to relive the thrilling spirit of its predecessors. Just be ready for a very different vibe!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Missed opportunity,"Alien 3 is a missed opportunity. Its premise is decent, its filmmaker is special (although inexperienced), and Sigourney Weaver is back to complete the trilogy. Unfortunately, despite all this, Alien 3 is downright dull. Plot points take too long to develop, characters aren't fleshed out, and motivations are slim. The movie starts with promise, but ultimately doesn't establish any emotional connection, uniqueness, or meaning. Eventually, Alien 3 devolves into a generic Syfy original movie that happens to have recognizable names attached. It isn't necessarily bad, but the film just doesn't compel viewers to feel anything.Meanwhile, the craft behind Alien 3 is mostly average. The visuals lightly use suggestion, wide-angles, and sharp lighting. The editing dramatizes the burial scene (yet later fails to coherently build the action). The sounds of the xenomorph are daunting. The costume and prosthetics of the xenomorph are convincing (though overly substituted for poor CGI). Plus, the production design is the highlight since it sells the dystopian setting. However, these aspects aren't consistent or potent enough to overtake any scenes, leaving the overall experience feeble and stale. Ultimately, Alien 3 just isn't fun, interesting, or significant. Instead, it's forgettable.Writing: 4/10

AS BAD AS A SEQUEL CAN BE,"Stupid! Not fun! Not worthy!  This movie is famous for all the wrong reasons!  The studio stared production before the  screenplay was completed! ( NEVER A GOOD IDEA) The movie suffer because story is very weak! In this Ripley crashes on a planet to a prison colony!  Now Ripley is the ""Alien"". Aliens was released in 1986 then Alien 3 was released in 1992. In six years don't you think the studio could of came up with a better movie?  Yes I know this movie has its fans but I for one am not a fan of long boring movies. There is so maney things wrong with this movie I could go on and on! To save time I will just tell you one of them!  We see a fan blade in the background and so the audience knows someone is going to die in that blade! In 2003 FOX released the original cut on DVD of this movie and its just boring as the movie they released in 1992! Also FOX could of saved itself when ALien 4 came out!  They could of have Ripley waking up from the nightmare and thus Alien 3 was just her dream! That way we could of had  all the survivors form ""ALiens"" in ""Alien 4"". Yes I know that is too ""Dallas"" but Alien 4 wasn't much better than this! Yes David Fincher has gone on to make  ""Fight Club"" ""Seven"" and ""PANIC ROOM"" but I think this was his ""student movie"" and therefore plays like it!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Decent movie but falls short of what could have been a masterpiece Trilogy,"The first two movies created such a hug void for a possible third movie to fill, that it would be next to impossible to do that. This third movie in the franchise could have been a decent or even a good movie on its own, but given how large of a shoes it would have needed to fill, it understandably fell short.To start with the nice parts of the movie, the cinematography at times were very good, the scene at the beginning during the crash of the shuttle, or the fiery scenes at the furnace, or the way people and the aliens run around narrow passages keep you engaged. The story and screenplay is excellent, a planet of brotherhood composed of criminals at a planet that's in the middle of nowhere. A pseudo religion to go with the brotherhood, and the teams that form out of this to take out the solo alien that's been unleashed upon them. The british actors and their accents add a different color to what was an uniquely American sci-fi series.Now coming to the shortcomings, at times the well known dreaded Alien atmosphere seem to be not there, when the Alien first springs out, it just comes out and quietly walks off like a cat.The CGI seems bad at times, especially at end when Ripley makes her dive, the scene looks almost comical with a fake fiery setting.The major issues for me are in the story, like how the Alien came to be when seemingly been eliminated completely in the last movie. It feels like this Alien was placed ""to work"" in a script for this movie particularly, and feels out of place.Overall a decent movie which gives a nice closure to Ripley, but does make you sometimes question if another sequel was warranted in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Should have been the end of a great trilogy,"What do I remember the most about alien 3? The ending (in the theatre) was great! I just rewatched the special edition, and they altered it, to be less dramatic/graphic. Alien 3 is much more like the original than part 2, and that's ok somewhat, but it's a big step backwards for action. It does have more tense moments, but the prisoners just aren't as memorable as the marines or original crew. Then of course, they made a fourth alien movie with Ripley which is silly, but I'll probably rewatch it soon. I actually liked the prequels more than most.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Back to Basics,"Alien 3 cuts back from the larger and more action-driven approach of Aliens in order to show a movie that's more down-to-earth and back-to-roots horror film. The film succeeds in a way but unfortunately loses a bit of its appeal in the process.Visually the film stands out from the rest of the Alien films with its grimy industrial look. The prison setting gives the film a feeling of isolation akin to the first movie. There's only one alien, just as in the first movie, and the humans this time are all but defenseless against it, as in the first movie. However, after being exposed to numerous aliens in the last movie the threat feels underwhelming and the concept a little bit of a rehash.However, Alien 3 has a distinctly reflective feel to it and the acting performances are far more memorable than in the first movie and the film also has a bit more entertainment value. Still, the final confrontation with the creature lacks the impact of the other movies. Thankfully the iconic final scene of the film salvages the rather underwhelming ending to some degree.Alien 3 is definitely on par with the first film of the series but lacks a lot of the entertainment value that would make it surpass the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good movie, bad sequel","As a standalone movie, this film is very effective. It's got some good atmosphere, good acting, and really good special effects. If it were a stand alone film or direct sequel to Alien it would be amazing, but because Aliens exist this movie isn't as effect. It messes up the scaling of the power of the xenomorphs and kills off beloved characters with no reason. The movie itself isn't bad but as part of a series it is not great.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is the third time the charm or not?,"So, how many times can the alien return to terrorize people? No matter, ""Alien3"" is still worth seeing. An interesting difference here from the first two movies is the setting. Whereas in the first two movies, everyone was definitely a good guy, in this case, the people surrounding Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) are almost as nasty as the alien itself - one scene shows this for certain. Having a shaved head gives her an even more bad-ass feel than the second one.And the end? Maybe they wanted to try something different this time. I had no problem with the end, although I will admit that it was a shocker (of course it turned out not to be the living end, given that there was a fourth movie). As for the fourth movie, you'll have to determine for yourself what you think of it. This one is OK to watch if there's nothing else to do. Also starring Charles S.

"An ugly, depressing mess.","Calling this movie a disappoitnment is an understatement. ""Alien 3"" would be a bad movie on its own, but following the masterpieces that were ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" makes it even worse.""Alien 3"" is a relentlessly grim movie. For starters, Newt and Hicks are killed off literally at the beginning. The two people who gave Ripley some much-deserved completion and happiness in her life at the end of ""Aliens"" are instantly killed. It's not a good sign when the audience is depressed before the opening credits are even over. The setting of the movie is really bleak as well. It's set on an abonened prison colony on a hot, lice-infested planer occupied by criminals who have formed some kind of religious cult. Ripley, like all the other occupants of the colony, are trapped on this planet with no way out. And as it turns out, an alien is right down there with them.The hopelessness of the whole scenario and the fact that there are no likeable characters other than Ripley make this movie a real downer. The whole movie is real ugly to look at and badly lit. The inept direction and editing make the whole movie real confusing. The score is decent, but it hardly matches up to the excellent scores of Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner in the first two films.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie as well as the next one in the series, ""Alien Resurrestion.""

Watch the extended version ... it's brilliant!,"Suffice to say, the cinema-version of Alien³ is so heavily flawed that - once you see the full extended version - you understand the amount of gaps and holes in the storyline.
For example, the character Golic, an otherwise downgraded and one-dimensional character proves to be a super-interesting, multi-layered character that proves to contain more narrative than any other prisoner of the doomed planet.I don't know what went wrong when master director David Fincher directed the movie. I can only bend the knee out of respect of what the ultimate, extended version has shown us.
It's a FAR better movie and one even so close to the brilliance of Alien and Aliens that - dare I say it? - this Alien-trilogy is more powerful than the Godfather-trilogy or the Indiana Jones-trilogy (yes, trilogy, coz the story about Indiana Jones faces Mars-aliens is non-existent for me on account of being childishly ridiculous)Are you in any way like me?
An absolute movie buff who's always looking for the next movie that makes you float on cloud 7 in a heavenly beautiful cinematic movie experience with fascinating characters and a riveting storyline?
Then watch Alien³ - there are NO two versions soooooo different than the flawed cinema and near-perfect extended version, making the full version of Alien³ an unappreciated yet visually artful, strong-character-driven film.It's the perfect answer to James Cameron's perfect-action packed sci-fi masterpiece and Ridley Scott's riveting horror-/thriller classic.

Terrible film invalidates the preceding one,"There should be a rule of sequels that one does not invalidate the entire purpose of the one preceding it.Aliens 3 cynically opens with, ""Hey everything you saw in Aliens 2, everything Ripley endured and did meant NOTHING.""Once you strip away that gleam of hope, instill a complete sense of futility, you create in the viewer a, ""What's the purpose, they are all gonna die anyway"" mindset.Sequels these days while complained about do carry with them advantage over say the trilogies of even a decade ago.  Today most films with even a promise of a sequel or a series of sequels carry along with them a story arc.  There is a lot less of the making it up as we go along to the writing of each installment than in the past.Even this is a double edge sword.  Where as you don't have to explain how a person who in the first movement was seen having their head chopped off didn't really die, you loose the creativity of having to write yourself out of what was once a story's deadend.",,Anonymous,Horror
The Alien was a dog!,"I absolutely adored the first two Alien films. Alien creates a dense atmosphere of paranoia, claustrophobia and sheer terror. Aliens was a fantastic continuation of the story, adding a great adrenaline rush as well as an amazing character study. After watching these two masterpieces, I was a bit uneasy about watching Alien3, mainly because of the low scores it had received. I gave it a spin anyway, and was sorely disappointed.The film is much darker than the previous ones, and opens with most of the larger roles of Aliens being killed in a crash. All right, it might still work. Ripley is held on a prison planet where the inmates have found religion. Odd, but all right. An Alien survived the crash and is now loose in the prison. Ah, the plot thickens! In the prison, there are quite a few interesting personalities, such as the insane Golic (Withnail & I actor Paul McGann) and Dillon, the spiritual leader of the inmates. The most interesting one is the doctor of the place, Clemens. We get a glimpse of his story and his life, but he is eaten by what has become a grotesque hybrid between the world's worst killer machine and a vicious chihuahua before his story reaches a conclusion.And this is the problem with the film. The most interesting characters are killed off at the beginning, Ripley just wanders around, trying to stay alive, without any real motive. In Alien, the crew wanted to get home. In Aliens, Ripley wanted to protect Newt. In Alien3, she just doesn't want to die. Sure, the whole Alien Queen thing was interesting, but it wasn't enough for the character, and so I think it ended on a sour note.The inmates are the worst, however. Where Ripley just lacks depth, these attempt to preserve a hard-boiled street style, throwing foul language and punches around meaninglessly. The whole religion-thing just seems tacked on and is largely forgotten by the end of the film (which was, by the way, far from satisfactory).And the Alien itself is just horrible as well. I like the idea of it changing with every film, but here it more resembles a dog than it does the fearsome killer we saw in the previous films. Come on, this is Alien, not Cujo! The terror of the first film is completely forgotten here, and we're supposed to be entertained by an adrenaline rush. I certainly wasn't.Alien: Resurrection wasn't a good film. But at least it had a proper ending, and decent characters. Alien3 was just a misfire, and I don't think of it as canon in the Alien storyline. David Fincher is a fantastic director, and he has created some absolute masterpieces. But Alien3 isn't one of them. It could have been great, there were many interesting elements, but overall, it should never have happened. 6/10 is being extremely generous.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but weakest of the saga,"It's been awhile since I've been reviewing so now here I go again reviewing another Alien movie in the saga. Alien 3 has always been good yet a confusing and melodramatic entry in the series. Some things I felt didn't add up in the series. The directing, acting, and some special effects were pretty good. I think this time it was the script that kinda needed some adjusting I mean its not bad but it wasn't that god plus the plot needed some explaining. The movie opens up with a few shots of the ship SULACO and reveals an alien on aboard causing the ship to catch on fire, last remaining survivors sent in a shuttle and then causing the ship to be destroyed. They crash land on a prison planet filled with nothing but men. Unfortunately Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) ends up only being the only survivor and the rest dead. When Newt is dead she suspects something about her death like an Alien may have killed her but Dr. Clemons (Charles Dance) dosen't think so. However later on a dog ends up being impreganted and Alien emerges and is ready to kill once again. While dealing with her case Ripley is ordered to shave her hair because of a lice problem on the planet and also engages in a relationship with Clemons who is more then willing to help her if he could. However Superintendent Andrews (Brain Glover), wants this woman to be rid of since she's considered a high priority and since the system dosen't really allow women. The prisoners don't really care about it that much Dillion (Charles Dutton) even tolerates the intolerable. But soon enough they realize that the Alien is killing several people and the prisoners begin to question how to kill it since the prison has no weapons of any kind. Alien 3 in my opinion trys to be a really stylish film it comes close to working but fails in retrospect. Like It should have fleshed out the characters, Clemons and Ripley's relationship could have been a developed more as well as the others prisoners it seemed liked the edited the wrong scenes. Oh and how did an Alien get there in the first place was Bishop in on it could be but to me Bishop seemed like an ok android but you never know. Burke could had more aliens but it would seem impossible so that to isn't proven. Plus I mentioned some of the special effects were good the movements of the Alien running around and all that stuff weren't that good they kinda looked fake in some spots but they did whatever they could. Plus the ending was sad I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it but those who have you already understand. I didn't hate Alien 3 I think the actors did a pretty good job (especially Weaver, Dutton and Dance and Henriksen last appearance). The directing was good for David Fincher as a first time director (who will make the successful Seven). Alien 3 is too melodramatic and poorly edited but as it stands on it's own its a good movie to watch none the less. Regular Scale- 3/5: 1-10 Scale- 7/10. NOTE: I think in order for the film to be better they need to reinstate some scenes that were ultimately cut out that further explained the story and fleshed out the characters. I think the Quadrilogy set will have this so in the end Alien 3 could become a classic that never was.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ripley Down Under,"Don't be put off by the title: the third in the franchise still hasn't lightened up, takes itself far too seriously and as usual goes on far too long; but is of a quality to be expected of David Fincher's burgeoning talent as a director and Sigourney Weaver's fastidiousness in her choice of projects.Shot at Pinewood, hence the classy cast of Brits including Charles Dance and Pete Postlethwaite.

As good as the first two Alien movies,"I don't think I ever diverged that much in opinion about a movie with IMDb reviewers or critics. This movie delivered much more than I had expected. It's no surprise that Alien 3 was received better internationally than in USA since this movie has something artistic in it, something not appreciated by American crowd. Furthermore, this movie is a perfect example of how ""fans"" can help to bring a movie down: they're just not capable of appreciating something new and always think It's best to just hark back.Alien 3 can be best be described as a combination of the original Alien and milieu from Twelve Monkeys starring Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis. There are no guns here, no massive shootings, no futuristic technology, no spaceship. It's dark in here, claustrophobic, dirty.What really amazed me is how successful Fincher was in using humor to assuage such a dark world. There are really funny moments very cleverly put so that they make this dark world feel like inhabited and made by humans. Most of the people in here are prisoners who work physically demanding jobs, far away from civilization as we know it. Moreover, humor helps us to keep in mind that there prisoners are still human even when exposed to such harsh circumstances and after doing horrible crimes.Critics are right to point out how editing and cutting makes you feel confused, not knowing what's happening. Well they're right. I think that doesn't have to be necessarily a bad thing. Since there are no weapons here, all protagonists were vividly confused and very scared. These cuts put you in their position. Alien 3 really stands out from other movies from Alien series.I will conclude with recommending this movie to all of you who love dark and dystopian atmosphere even if you're not into Alien series because this is a great and bold movie.- - - -EDIT: I've seen Assembly cut version so everything written above refers to it. It was interesting to watch making of this movie and see what happened behind closed doors and with what problems Fincher had to deal. Maybe overcoming those helped him to become a great director.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Planet of the British!,"Ridely Scott's 'Alien' was an excellently constructed thriller. In the opening, a strong ensemble cast faced a vague sense of menace; over the course of the film, this gradually transformed into a fight to the death between just one of the characters (Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver) and the eponymous beast. The sequel, directed by James Cameron, was also good, but at heart a more conventional Hollywood blockbuster. For the third film, David Fincher was in the director's chair, and I'm a big fan of Fincher's later films, 'The Game' and 'Fight Club'. But 'Alien3' is not his greatest work.Fincher keeps the murky, claustrophobic feel of the earlier films (a mood also apparent in his next film, 'Se7en'). In the original movie, the camera never dwelt on the alien, we only saw it in brief, terrifying glimpses. This was justified by the alien's exceptional speed of movement, but perhaps necessitated by limitations in what the special effects department could do, circa 1979. By 1992, technology had moved on, but Fincher stuck to the formula, and the fact that we never truly comprehend the exact nature of the monster adds to its capacity to scare us. But Fincher also added some broad comedy, a lot of gratuitous swearing, and, with his setting of a prison planet occupied almost entirely by British-accented convicts, a certain resemblance to a vulgarised 'Porridge'. Riply, meanwhile, has transformed into someone almost unimaginably macho; the prisoners are supposedly men with two Y chromosomes, but a desexualised Ripley appears to possess more testosterone than all of them together.The real problem with the film, however, is principally that as the third movie in a franchise, there's not really anywhere new for it to go. The plot is presented to us with little in the way of underlying explanation, but it's basic contours are already defined. The fourth film in the series was called 'Alien Resurrection'; this one might have been called 'Alien Rehash'. It ends with an overlong action sequence devoid of variety (whereas in the first film, every kill was sudden and fresh). And the impact of the ending is muted when you know that in spite of the apparently terminal conclusion, another movie followed in a couple of years. The rest of Fincher's work is all original. But here he is just another hack director, forcing another life out of a great, but exhausted concept. Two films should really have been enough.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fincher made a much better sequel,I think this movie is a much better sequel to the original than ALIENS. It shows us the alien as a creature superior to the human being (like in the first movie). In ALIENS this very important fact had been forgotten. There were hundreds of these creatures just to be killed in seconds. This movie shows the Alien as a silent and very intelligent killer. That´s why I was much more impressed by Alien³ than by ALIENS.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien 3 - directors cut a cut above,"When I first saw this movie, I can remember being really quite disappointed - it seemed to be incoherent, not very scary and definitely not worthy compared to the previous movies. Now I know why - the director was clearly overruled by the money men and his film wasn't the one released in 1992. Oh yes, it was the same actors and he shot the scenes, but someone took an axe into the cutting room. The directors cut doesn't just add a couple of extra scenes, its a completely different movie with real tension, grit and true horror befitting the Alien franchise. This movie has now gone from being the worst of the four to equal second. Thank god for DVD!!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Strongly disagree with others' reviews,"I'd resolved to repay my considerable debt to IMDb by confining myself to reviewing movies that didn't yet have IMDb reviews. However, after reading a dozen or so reviews of Alien 3, I write what follows in protest. Background: I watched the first three Alien films when they were released in regular theaters. I've just finished watching all four on a 1920x1080 resolution computer screen, using Bose headphones. I used the headphones partly because my wife (who also has an unaccountable dislike for the Three Stooges) can't stand horror movies, but mostly because the films' sounds coming from various directions are especially effective using them. I agree with the majority of IMDb's reviewers that Alien was a splendid, groundbreaking movie, and that Aliens was that rarity: an even better sequel. It's important to note that in many ways the style, the atmosphere of Aliens differed greatly from that of Alien.But hereafter I part company with other IMDb reviewers. The style and atmosphere of Alien 3 differ greatly from that of the first two: it's much bleaker emotionally, and that works. At first there's only one really sympathetic character besides Ripley, and Ripley is doomed from the start; these things work, too. Several of the initially unsympathetic characters became more and more interesting to me as the movie progressed. However that may have been because I've had a fair amount of direct and indirect experience working with convicts. Sigourney Weaver was, of course, superb and convincing. The main thing is that Alien 3 is a DIFFERENT movie, but in its way also a great one. Marvelous sets. Gloomy, gloomy, gloomy. Marvelous dry, dead-pan humor in places. Marvelous scenes where you know that something awful is going to happen. Even fine music. I give it 9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror
Highly under-appreciated and misunderstood,"Although it is the weakest of all the ""Alien"" films, Alien 3 is still a worthy member of the franchise, though a highly under-appreciate and misunderstood film.The directorial debut of the now famous David Fincher (""Seven"",""Panic Room""), it is gorgeously shot film, with fine performances from the main cast, who were all respected actors in their own right.The film has a gothic feel, not present in the previous two, making it not so much an action/horror film and more of a long dark suspense thriller, with plenty of blood and gore.It suffers from a poor script, which was constantly re-hashed and re-written during the shoot, and terribly predictable plot-devices, which were a feeble attempt to re-capture the feel of the first film.However,the cinematography, the sets, the sweeping score by Elliot Goldenthal, and the stunningly beautiful and tragic ending make it two hours well spent.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Really That Bad, Just Very Mediocre","Alien 3 is directed by David Fincher and is a direct continuation of Aliens (1986). In this installment, Ripley, Newt, and Hicks have crash landed on Fiorina 161, a planet with nothing but prisoners on it. However, things take a dark twist when they find that an alien was aboard their ship when they landed, and it's now on the planet with them.Most people hate Alien 3, but I actually enjoyed it overall. It had issues, yes, but they weren't completely abundant, and it had a lot of good aspects to it as well. Alien 3 isn't as good as it's previous installments, but it isn't bad either. The script and acting were both really good, and most characters were likable. Even the ones that weren't likable were written that way, so it didn't affect the film negatively.The acting all throughout Alien 3 was actually really good. Sigourney Weaver once again kills it as Ellen Ripley, the awesome alien survivor. Charles S. Dutton was actually really good as Dillon, the preacher with a bad past. His character was very well rounded, and the script portrayed him as a peacekeeper, which Dutton played very nicely. Charles Dance was pretty good as Clemens, the nice guy out of all of the prisoners. He was the only character with a soft side to him, and Dance showed this very well through his acting abilities.The direction, by David Fincher, is good, but also bad in a sense. Although no quick cuts or shaky cam is present, and the overall direction is good, the film is very dark, and depressing, much like most Fincher films. Although Alien 3's direction isn't necessarily bad, the overall tone of the film was more of a David Fincher feel than an Alien feel. At times, I would use the word boring to describe the tone of the movie. The entire planet is dark, and disgusting, and I just wanted out of it.The script is very well written. All of the dialogue was written and performed very nicely, and brought a great aspect to Alien 3. All of the actors performed their lines very well, and no bad acting was to be found. The pacing of Alien 3 is also pretty strong. Although the grimness of the film is slightly boring, once the story picks up, it really picks up. There were moments when I was on the edge of my seat, and was afraid for the characters' lives, which is a great job on the flimmakers' parts. The eerie direction may have taken away from this feel a little bit, but not enough to ruin an overall good film.Now, my main problem with Alien 3 is the special effects. When practical effects are used, it's mostly just up close, and it looks great, just like the prior two Alien films. The grotesque alien faces are well crafted, and look perfectly fine. However, the CGI is awful. Alien 3 honestly contains some of the worst CGI I've ever seen in a movie. Every shot of a CG alien crawling along the walls, or on the ceiling, looks horrible, and almost as if a middle schooler used a cheap camera and editing software to create the effects.Overall, Alien 3 is a pretty good movie. The characters are likable with good actors behind them, and the script is great as well. Gloomy direction and terrible CGI definitely weren't enough to drag this pretty good film down.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Alien Resurrection,"Why so much hate maybe they need to view the forth installment again, alien3 had great Brit actors, great music reminded me of that Sean Connery film The Name Of The Rose that starred Ron Periman pity he didnt star in alien 3 instead of alien resurrection.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
near-brilliant use of tone,"Alien3 has a great many detractors for a great many reasons.  But let me offer just one example of how thoroughly effective this film is in terms of tone and atmosphere: the funeral sequence where the bodies of Newt and Hicks are thrown into the molten steel and the new alien is born from the dog. Look at all the layers Fincher successfully employs in the space of two minutes.  The use of irony (Dutton's eulogy) and contrast (alien ripping its way out of the dog's chest), blending beauty and horror, together with an impending sense of doom (Riply's bloody nose) and loss (the death of loved ones), taking place in a physical environment of bitter cold and scorching heat.  The scene is both cathartic and devastating, visually-stunning and unrelentingly morbid.  To me, it's a near-perfect hybrid of Ridley Scott and James Cameron.  And Fincher deserves a place right next to them.  What other director, apart from the true masters, can evoke so many seamless transitions so efficiently?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favorite ALIEN movie,"I never could understand all the hate that ALIEN 3 received. But then again I never could understand the top ratings for ALIENS and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, two of the most overrated movies ever.ALIEN 3 returns to the roots of the ALIEN franchise: it is not as action packed as ALIENS but it has more atmosphere, is more claustrophobic and darker, which I prefer.David Fincher delivers one of his best films here, next to SEVEN and FIGHT CLUB, I love his style, it's a huge enrichment to the ALIEN franchise. He gives the movie a very Gothic look which adds to the dark and unsettling climax. ALIEN 3 has a very somber and depressing mood with a shocking surprise right at the beginning of the movie. And it doesn't stop there. The ending is incredibly bleak and very untypical for Hollywood.The acting is superb, right on par with the original, but Sigourney Weaver delivers an even better performance here, as her character is tougher, more developed and gets to do more. Another great actor, Charles Dance also gives a superb performance, especially in the scenes he shares with Weaver, the two work well together.The 2003 Extended Cut/Special Edition improves the film even more adding approx. 30 mins of extra footage and is well worth the upgrade.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Highly flawed and boring but does have an effective element of horror.,"When one compares Alien-3 to the likes of Alien Resurrection and a piece of feces called AVP, one would notice that Alien-3 does much more justice to the creature by portraying it very frighteningly. While the movie itself can drag, get very boring, the Alien comes out as a bigger threat than it ever was in the sequels. Having said that, one may have huge expectations after viewing Aliens/Alien-2 and those expectations will certainly not be fulfilled in this movie.Also, Alien-3 is no where as good as the first Alien movie which it tries to be. Even so, it puts the element of fright back into the series just like the first movie did which means that a followup movie on the line of Aliens could have fit the part as a sequel to Alien-3. Unfortunately, Alien Resurrection turned out to be a joke of sorts. While in purely terms of entertainment, Alien resurrection comes out better than Alien-3, it also destroys the value of creature once it concludes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Third time's NOT the charm....,"There is a limit to how many times a story can be told....For the ""Alien"" saga, that number is 3.This third installment of the venerable saga basically plays out like a Greek tragedy where everything is desolate and everyone is in despair, either over personal loss or their own discontent.  Ripley ends up on a prison planet and, of course, one of the aliens from the original has followed her, ensuring an onslaught of epic proportions.UNFORTUNATELY, too much time is given to think about certain plot points. Such as:Why are so many interesting characters introduced (namely Dance), then dropped so arbitrarily?Why does Fincher's direction seem so shaky and unsure (in great contrast to his work in ""Se7en"")?How could the same writers (mainly Hill and Giler) write a story that has little or no emotional impact and next to no development as far as plot, motivation or even (in the alien's instance) shock value?And you'll notice, once you've seen this film, that it hasn't got the same sensibilities the first film had.  There is too much time spent on the downbeat, the morose and the evil that men do that there is little to no time left for the sporadic alien attacks.  Sometimes, it's easy to forget this is science fiction we're watching; it might as well be a prison drama for all this movie cares.I won't give away how this movie ends, but to ask one question: if this was, indeed how the series was supposed to end, what are we to make of Ripley's act?  Was she indeed being ascended to the Christ-like for her actions (as is made all too obvious by the final symbolism) or was she a martyr for the cause of good vs. evil?  Or was it, as is my opinion, misplaced symbolism just for symbolism's sake?Even in the theater I saw this in, many of those around me reacted to this film like they would one of ""Alien""'s many rip-offs.  Lots of exasperated sighs at different points, some non-amused laughter and at least one person commented aloud ""Aw, jeez!"".My feelings, exactly.Three stars for the effort but as far as sequels go, this probably wasn't as ""Alien"" a product as they wanted to get to the audience.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best movie!,"This is the most underestimated movie, unfortunately! Before the set, the idea was to complete the series of Ripley's journey to this rough life and i think David Fincher did this work well, if we will take into account that producer's was not satisfied by Fincher's vision of the story.Some one will say that Ripley is acting a tad strange in this movie, that she was a very smart woman in the other two films and what happened in this one? This question is for those who not seen previous series. She acting like she tired of all this - her daughter is dead, as we know from the Alien's, and Amanda is dead now too. The atmosphere of screenplay show's that everything Ripley does is doomed! In the end she find's the only way to finish with all this by suicide. What else you expected from this? The Happy end? Its the greatest movie i every seen. The screenplay is an extraordinary - you will not find like this one anywhere.

Waste,"What a waste of time and talent is ALIEN 3. Ripley wakes up to find herself on a prison planet. Newt is dead and it is many years later. The prison planet is dark and drab and stark, and so are the characters. For those ALIENS fans hoping for an extension of James Cameron's masterpiece of a sequel, what a huge disappointment ALIEN 3 turned out to be. Death and despair is at every turn, and there is little action to compensate for the gloom that pervades the storyline. Susan ""Sigourney"" Weaver is absolutely wasted as Ripley. If she were a more discerning actress, perhaps she would have turned down a third go at the role. If the movie itself had been better, perhaps the series would have wound up a memorable trilogy. Instead, this turkey led to an even bigger turkey, ALIEN: RESURRECTION. Neither original director Renny Harlin nor his replacement David Fincher should have been allowed within 500 miles of this project. It needed a sure hand like Cameron's. Believe me when I tell you, you may safely skip this one and the one that follows. For that matter, the fifth movie in the series, AvP, isn't much of an improvement, but in its own odd way is slightly more watchable than ALIEN 3 and ALIEN: RESURRECTION. I agree with those fans who felt the series should have ended with ALIENS.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
the complete opposite of Aliens,"Which is a reason why this movie is hated so much. Even though Alien 3 is much closer to the intent of the original movie. Aliens turned Alien into a neat action/sci-fi flick with a bunch of simple characters and moronic catch-phrases, and Alien 3 takes it to the opposite extreme. It's a dark thriller, not an action flick.Unfortunately it suffers from some big drawbacks. The sound mix is awful. For Example when Ripley is whispering you can barely make out what she's saying, so you turn the sound up and that's when a large explosion goes off and blows out your speakers. The effects hold up rather poorly. Also, every time they build up a character they kill them 5 minutes later. Leaving you with a bunch of characters you don't really care about.There are some great moments in this movie, and the cinematography is great, but it could have been so much better. Fincher said it was only 25% of what he wanted, and it shows. Maybe if the studio hadn't screwed around with the script and the editing, trying to dumb down the movie, this could have been great. Unfortunatley it's not, and is just slightly above average.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Not perfect, but watchable.","I never got a chance to see the first 2 Alien movies.I've seen some parts, but that's about it.'Alien 3' takes our hero, Ridley, and puts her on an unknown planet that's really a prison.In the first two movies, she was forced into action by these ugly aliens that had acid for blood.Soon she finds out that an alien may be in the prison, but nobody believes her until somebody is killed by the alien.There are no weapons on the prison and the prisoners and Ridley are surrounded by the alien.What can they possibly do? You'll have to find out for yourselves.In short, 'Alien 3' is violent, gory, and slightly entertaining.It's not 'Alien Vs Predator', but it's still a good movie.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it at least a 6.6.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great beginning, terrible end","It starts off really well, with some great suspense built up, but it soon degenerates into a mindless action flick with some really bad effects. I don't know what happened between Aliens and this, but somehow the visual effects managed to get worse. Every scene of the alien running down the hallway looks terrible fake; somehow, though, the close-ups of the Alien look fine. I'd say this is the darkest of the Alien films - it's quite grim and much more like the first than the second. The first hour is quite good, the last hour is not. Everything just degenerates, from the story to the acting to the direction. I don't know what happened. The ending, while well-intentioned, is terribly executed.

"subpar CGI, inferior action, meh plot, made slightly entertaining thanks to cast and occasional practical effects","A mess of a movie and that's not just from an observational standpoint. It's common knowledge at least to most that production was chaotic and the amazing director that is David Fincher was repeatedly interfered with by the producers. In ways I prefer the director's cut aka the Special Edition more, as it's truer to his vision and I personally favor the alien coming from an ox than a dog, however, other sequences that he changed such as the ending don't sit well with me. Overall the movie has some great acting and characters, namely Sigourney Weaver to no surprise, and Charles Dance, but the action is scarce and scattered, the final sequence a headache to sit through. Some great shots so long as practical effects were used instead of the laughable-even-for-1992 CGI kept this entertaining, but ultimately it's run-of-the-mill at best, and easily my least favorite movie in the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very flawed but the last good Alien movie.,"This is a review for the ""Assembly cut"" version which is the only version you should watch. Technically it's a well engineered movie, you can see they invested in this, it's not CGI filled (except for the Alien which has terrible CGI).However where this movie fails abysmally is the plot. They essentially destroy all the exciting progression of the previous (and great) Alien film. They literally kill all the previous characters and the premise of the film is weak: Ripley vs. An Alien on a prison planet. It's just underwhelming and bad.However, Sigourney Weaver and the cast do a real solid job and I would consider this the final decent Alien movie, and a somewhat fitting conclusion to the Ripley character.It's worth a watch but stop there.What they should really do (and what all fans wanted) was a true sequel to Aliens (1986), but with James Cameron completely abandoning the Aliens franchise and making those terrible Avatar films instead, it's unfortunately probably over.Watch the Assembly cut version of Alien 3 as the finale for Ripley. Sigourney Weaver still does an astounding job in this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Isolated and original but not bad at all,"This movie just never felt right. It had 2 great movies to build on and the biggest blemish for me is that it got started on the wrong foot. And to just wipe out the heroics of Ripley and make everything meaningless, what happened on lv46 is a downer. I truly think there could have been a way to save Newt. As a movie it has still grown on me and it is still a worthy sequel to the alien movies, but not more. I just think the story is too dark and somehow isolated. At least no one survived only to be killed in an eventual sequel... But the ending put forth a much more challenging task for creators of a 4th installment, whereas the the 2 1st movies almost encouraged a sequel this one surely don't. The acting is still on a high level and the story, though dark, pretty good on its own merits. I still would have liked a few more aliens but it was not a necessity. I'll give a weak 7 but it could have been higher if not for the out of place start to me anyways.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wanting to do too much, with an amazing concept","I watched the directors cut.This franchise has been in big hands and it´s interesting to see the different takes they do. After Scott and Camron, Fincher threw his hat in the ring and made, in my opinion a good movie. Holding it up to the predecessors it doesn't look as impressive no doubt, but looking past the obvious complains I see this as a great continuation of Ripleys journey and the themes of the alien franchise.After escaping the last planet overrun by xenomorph. Ripley crash-lands on a prion planet. She´s the only survivor except for a facehugger that is now threatening her life and the people of prison planet.I understand why the reception of this movie isn't the best. I can also see through the lackluster aspects of the movie and really relate to the clean slate this movie delivers in terms of its opening and its ending. It can feel like a lot and like something you don't want but I personally don't mind it. The theme of this movie is confronting older themes heads on and really realize that there is no going back and no happy endings and Fincher captures this perfectly with Ripley losing everything once again. Is it repetitive and cheap? Yup. Dose it fit the theme? I think so.The movie has a lot it wants to do, and this leads to some poor editing choices at times. Especially towards the end where a chase is fragmented between many characters it becomes unengaging what´s going on because of the fast editing. In general, the movie wants to do so many things but it´s never really fully realized to its fullest potential. Ripley having a hard time trusting love from a Wayland employ is not really explored to its full potential, the comradery and characters aren't established that well, a cornerstone from the prior movies, the attempts at humor can feel out of place and the feeling of mystery and chock doesn't really land as the audience knows the answers to the mysteries already or can put 2 and 2 together easily. Again, the movie has so many things it wants to do, all good, but too many to really fully realize itself.I really loved the score I found it fitting for the movie. It leans more into the classic idea of a sci-fi score using a beautiful female singer, but its use of drums are also amazing. It´s a sparingly used score and sometimes it even feels misused and unfitting but a good score, nonetheless.I really loved the setting too. This prison planet sticks with the theme of an unromanticized future where everything looks and acts boring instead of exciting. We are on a prion/mining planet, everything looks sterile or industrial. All tools look on point and in general the set design is very good.I also really loved the xenomorph lore here, both the continues one and the newly established. The idea that the xenomorph takes form from it´s host is interesting and creates a cool design for this movie. It makes you imagen xenomorphs in so many different shapes and sizes. The continued lore of protecting the animalistic killers are also carried over. In the original movie the alien doesn't kill a cat since it sees it as a mutual predator, and here the alien protects a deranged murderer.I most say though, please stick to the practical effects. This movie looks incredible when the sets and props are practical and when the xenomorph is a suit or closeup it looks incredible. Ripley being confronted by the xenomorph in a close up looks absolutely incredible. But they used what looks like rotoscoping or just a 3D figure to make the xenomorph here and it looks really bad. It has this unnatural green hue to it, and it looks and moves in a fake way. It just isn't the same as practical effects and the impact of the xenomorph is lessen.There were also some audio problems during my watch. There was particularly a scene with the cast talking in a heating room where the sound mixing is all over the place. They had this distortion to their voices there went on and off. There were some bad mixing with the music at times. It feels like the sound mixing wasn't the greatest.What makes me like this movie a lot is it continuation of themes from prior movies and also a bit of a repurpose of the themes. Ripley is still having a lot of problems trusting and making her trauma go away and it feels like her trauma is following her no matter where she goes. This movie has a lot of undertones in terms of sexual assault, both very literal and underlaying. The idea of what to do in the aftermath of sexual assault, and the potential consequences that follows are an interesting dilemma the movie handles well in my opinion. The other way of reading the movie is of course in terms of illness that never really goes away. The idea of Ripley removing her hair of course sets of the ideas of cancer and she now has to navigate how to live her life with her trauma and the later choices she has to make. You could call this surface leveled but I see it as affective in terms of the franchise it´s in. This combined with Ripley being around a religious cult lays more undertones of sinning, being forgiven or frozen out and maybe even a bigger political undertone of how religious people look at trauma and rape victims, but this is maybe taking it too far. This leads to an iconic and great ending for me. Poor effects? Sure, but definitely a sentiment to take control of your own life and not letting trauma become you.What I like about this movie is the endless potential I see in it. After acknowledging all the flaws, I still see it as a solid movie that could have been endlessly better. Normally I would pan a movie more for not living up to it´s own expectations, but this is one of the movies where I see it trying more than the movies that don't. It´s a movie where it´s form speaks to me, but where I have to, like everyone else, acknowledge the function isn't the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The atmosphere absolutely oozes with existential melancholy and a feeling of dread pervades each and every frame, yet the story is a muddled mess, mainly thanks to the production nightmare that unfolded due to the studio trying to rush it out in time for its release date, giving the film a rushed, unfinished feel in its second half.An intriguing set-up (a prison planet devoid of weapons) promised so much more. Catch the Assembly Cut of this film if you can, as this version makes much more sense plot-wise, and adds more detail to many of the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien 3 (Special Edition),"The third sequel in the Alien franchise was directed by David Fincher. This is his debut feature film.

"The 2nd was kinda a series ender, but i appreciate the effort to have a 3rd now REALLY final film","Has the Terminator Dark Fate style opening kinda... but unless you are really driven up by naggin Youtubers, it never really bothers you, at least it hadn't me for two decades. It is horror, characters come and go.At least the now passed away likable bunch around Ripley and their legacy is handled with good care, they are being referenced, essentially part of this movie, and at the end of the day, no biggie really, as even our main protagonist is going out with the trilogy.Maybe the prison planet could have been a spicier place, the fact that there are essentially no guards and whatnots make the scenery EXTRA gray.But it is a decent film (even if Charles Dance is brutally underutilized and done away with, in a very very out of nowhere fashion).So, decent, UNTIL the big showdown, where they decide to capture the alien in the corridor labyrinth of the prison. Oh my god that is one hell of a ""We'll cut something together from the shots we recorded"" mess.And after that the movie kinda tries to come back up on the decency scale by the Weyland-Yutani guys arriving, even though i'm getting a strange Terry Gilliam vibe from them... and of course the now infamous dual suicide scene... but they are too late, and too little to make this third entry anything like the level of the first two movies.Alien ended with Aliens, and you can take a look at this one if you are curious, doesn't matter, as i said, Alien ended with Aliens.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Weakest Of The Four,"My Rating: ** out of ****.Alien 3 is a big disappointment. There are many flaws in the film plus one possible plot hole. Many will argue that Alien: Resurrection is worse, but I found many more aspects of that better than Alien 3.The first problem with this movie is the story is basically a rehash of the first Alien. The only difference is that Alien was much more effective. The story is in no way thrilling at all. Also, the tagline for the film ""On Earth everyone can hear you scream"". What the hell? This movie doesn't take place anywhere near earth.Another problem is the characters which are really poor. I know I did complain about some of Alien's characters, but they were ten times more interesting and likable compared to some of these characters. There are basically too many characters, its obvious there just here to get killed. One of the only characters to have a personality is Charles S. Dutton's characters, but when he talks he sounds more like a reverend. We do not need religious people in an Alien film. It doesnt fit at all.The film does contain good visual effects, one of its strengths. The film also has a dark atmosphere thats suitable. It also has some style by director David Fincher, I liked his point of view shots of the Alien. I also liked the ending, it was the perfect way to end a disappointing film. Unfortunately, these are just about the only strengths Alien 3 has.The action scenes werent that suspenseful. The scene where The Alien pins Ripley against the wall was the only part I felt that was suspenseful. The other scenes I just didnt feel anything. Something else I found disappointing was the killing of Newt and Hicks. I cared much about those characters and they just kill them off here. Overall, Alien 3 is worth watching just to see all of the films but other than that its really disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
I thought I was the only one.,"Lots of people at the time of release really didn't like Alien 3 but on going back to this recently and watching the directors cut on blu-ray, I now rate this as second only to Ridley Scott's original.

Personally I think expectation at the time was for an over the top Aliens+ movie, when this didn't arrive people were upset. Give it a go, you might just change your mind.",,Anonymous,Horror
why it gets panned,"ive just watched alien3, and read a lot of the comments here. a lot are very scathing while some very complimentary - mine is one of the latter.originally, when i had first seen this film i was disappointed. i expected a sequel to Aliens more than a sequel to Alien, which is what we got instead, but that was because i was only 13 years old and unable to appreciate a film for what it is. so for all those who wanted aliens2, here is my suggestion: get Fincher to re-shoot the opening scenes to include a big shoot-out so that you feel that you are watching aliens again, then when they crash-land, perhaps some imagery of empty guns being left behind so that we realise that it will be a thoughtful and inventive film rather than a bullet-fest.my personal thoughts on the series is that i disagree with what a few of the comments have said - i believe that this is not really a set of two films, not a trilogy, but a complete set of four that display a progression. we have, in the first, a scared and inexperienced Ripley who sees her colleagues slaughtered and begins to fight back. then we have a more confident Ripley in Aliens, where she learns to fight the aliens with courage.  Alien3 gives us more progression as Ripley is now in control of the alien as it cannot harm her, she knows how to beat it, and she is becoming mother to an alien. in Resurrection, she has been reborn and has alien qualities, while the alien has some of her qualities. as someone said, ripley IS alien and alien IS ripley, something that cannot be more true in Resurrection.there can surely be no fifth, as Ripley would have to be either all alien (gives Sigourney a rest, at least!) or she would have to be in control of the aliens. perhaps to continue this progression, we have to have a similar plot to one of the books, where the aliens species that created the ship on LV426 is even more beligerent than the aliens we know and hate, and we need the Aliens as our only effective weapon against them.who knows. but everyone knows how Hollywood doesn't sniff at the guaranteed income sequels bring",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
There is a trick to getting something out of this film,"Firstly, let me get off my chest that I loved 'Alien' and 'Aliens,' therefore, I was one of the legions of fanboys who eagerly awaited the next instalment of the franchise. And, like so many others, I was left severely disappointed at what I got.Alien 3 continues the story, but just wasn't what the - numerous - fans were after. You can look up online as to the many problems the production went through. To this day the director has still disowned it.I hated it. People were basically expecting 'Aliens Part II' and they got this. They say a sequel should be 'everything good about the original and more.' Aliens is one of the few films where (some) people claim it is actually an improvement on the original. Whether you agree with that or not, it does offer 'the same and more' of its predecessor. Alien 3 didn't just take one step back, but TWO. It's less tense than Alien and not as action-packed with such memorable characters as Aliens.So, it was pretty much despised by all. However, I still watch it from time to time (mainly the extended 2003 edition - you don't want to bother with the original cut) and, begrudgingly, it does have its merits - not many, but a few. The trick to enjoying it is to simply not consider it a part of the Alien franchise. Don't think of it as the sequel to Aliens, but just a horror/sci-fi movie. To me the saga ended with Aliens. I watch this for something different. It is well-directed, with its distinct own look. Plus it succeeds in creating a very bleak atmosphere and vision of the future (in stark contrast to the upbeat ending of Aliens). The sets are nice, too.Overall, it's not the travesty that so many - including me - once made it out to be. It'll never be Alien or Aliens, but let it be what it is - a stand-alone effort which dares to try and explore new territory (albeit with mixed results).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""You've been in my life so long, I can't remember anything else.""","FILM: 6.5
Alien 3 has always left me with mixed feelings. It's not a terrible film, but it's just not a good Alien film. My biggest gripe is how it completely undoes everything James Cameron set up in Aliens. Cameron managed to take Ridley Scott's original and create something fresh while still respecting what came before. Alien 3, though, takes a different approach that feels like it's actively working against the tone and narrative of the previous film. For fans like me, that's a tough pill to swallow.It's clear that the film was plagued by a chaotic production. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where the screenwriter's intentions end and the studio's meddling begins, but from everything I've read, it's pretty obvious that studio interference played a massive role in the film's flaws. David Fincher's first outing as a feature film director was an absolute nightmare for him, with constant script changes and budget cuts causing endless grief. Despite all that, he, Sigourney Weaver, Charles Dance, and Charles S. Dutton still manage to bring some real quality to the screen. They bring a level of intensity and commitment that stops the film from being a total letdown.I do think the Assembly Cut is a much better version than the theatrical release. It gives more depth to the story and characters, making the film more coherent, but even with those improvements, it still pales in comparison to the first two films. There's a sense of what Alien 3 could have been, but it never quite comes together in the way you hope.All in all, it's worth a watch if you're a fan of the series, but it's hard not to feel a bit let down by what could've been a more fitting continuation of the saga.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

the reconstructed version is a vast improvement even without Fincher's personal supervision,"For quite a number of years, between my friends and I was an on-going if minor argument about the favorite Alien movie. Most said the James Cameron sequel, and one or two would pipe in on Ridley Scott's original. Only one would stick up for the 115 minute film of Alien 3 (mostly out of preferences for the characters and the ideas behind having a lack of weapons). Unfortunately, in the theatrical version one can immediately sense the lack of someone really behind the wheels at times, despite the production design still being as top-notch as the previous films (and no wonder; Fincher, on his first studio assignment, practically disowned the theatrical cut after it was taken away from him). Luckily, with the advent of DVD and the 'special edition', a 'reconstructed' version of the film has been put together, including over half an hour of missing footage. While the reports stated this was not a real 'director's cut' (as Fincher didn't supervise the re-edit), according to the producers this comes as close as we're going to get it.And luckily the full version, with its story pumped up with not necessarily back-stories to the supporting cast (all prisoners on a kind of dilapidated mining colony on a remote planet), but just to give more depth to the peril that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is in. The basic outline is this- Ripley, after surviving the hazards of the climax of Aliens, winds up on the planet as an outsider through and through. The colony (including good-to-excellent character actors like Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, Pete Postletwhaite, and Paul McGann) is full of a nasty bunch, some more-so than others, who have no idea what Ripley has brought along with her on the ship. This then sets up what we might expect from the rest of the film; riveting action sequences, tough dialog, and a climax that is surprising and fulfilling.When looking at the theatrical cut, the look of the film is all in-tact and rather mind-blowing; Norman Reynolds production design is loaded with texture and the grittiness of space that is constant through all the films (though still unique); HR Gieger's alien designs (sometimes for some unconventional bits of business, to say the least) rattle the mind as much as in the first film; Alex Thomson's cinematography is a little relentless at times, but suiting so for the film. Unfortunately, what falls apart is the story, and the thin, trite qualities in the supporting cast, and when looked at in relation to the first film and even the second (which is more of a class unto itself), is pedestrian and very much in-line with something Hollywood. You can sense that there is Fincher's presence in the scenes and ideas, but also that what was cut out wasn't necessarily 'extra fat' to the story.In this reconstructed version, however, it feels more epic in scope, and some things have been changed (i.e. the cow now a dog for the Alien 'birth'), and a lot has been added. To go into everything that has been added would take too long, but to make it short not only do we get a better science-fiction style story, in the end it adds to the effectiveness of the chases down tight corridors, fights, etc. Some of it is even a little more disturbing this time around (an 'attempt' at Ripley by some of the prisoners is as frightening as the Alien), an added plus to the mood of the production design and visual effects. The ending is still a little overtly dramatic, but also Weaver's performance is given more clarity; it's not just seeing her with a shaved head that's worth watching the film, she's given some scenes where she out-acts everyone around her, with her strengths of subtlety and patience as an actor.I would even recommend watching this reconstructed version, if you can, even if you've never seen the theatrical cut. And for those who love the original version anyway (there are things about the studio cut that make the film under-rated if still flawed), you get more for your buck, kind of like Apocalypse Now Redux or something. I still wonder what the director now thinks of this footage put back in, if it comes closer to his vision, albeit through the interference and meddling.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A film that starts badly cannot end well. Even so, the film has values worth highlighting.","There is no doubt that the first two films in the ""Alien"" franchise are classics in their own right and figure in a certain pantheon of the best horror and sci-fi films ever made. These are films where everything went very well, and everything came together in such a way as to make great works of cinema. This film cannot match them, and the reason for this has to do with its origins. As we say in Portugal, what is born crooked never straightens out.In fact, this film was born and grew under the sign of chaos and confusion, with almost constant discussions between the studio, the producers, director David Fincher and the team responsible for the script. Right from the start, Ridley Scott refused to direct because he understood that it should be tied to the hypothetical origins of the alien (Scott will be able to carry out this idea in his most recent films, ""Prometheus"" and ""Alien Covenant""). Fincher agreed to replace him, but the studio's constant interference in his work led to intense controversies and a very tense atmosphere. Millions were spent on scenes cut and re-filmed as the script was changed and rewrote, and sets were even built that were never used because the script changed. Let's face it: it was virtually impossible to make a great film in the midst of these conflicts.The film continues the story of Lieutenant Ripley: a mysterious fire forces the ship in which she was traveling to eject the hypersleep capsules. Of the three survivors from the previous film, only she is rescued alive by the inmates of a space penal colony. The place is remote, there are not many inmates, and most have taken refuge in a certain strange spirituality. Ripley will have the help of the resident doctor, who will confirm that there was a live Alien on board the ship where she was, and that the threat is already incubating in that penal colony.The film has its qualities: the cinematography, the sets and the costumes are excellent and completely match what we have seen in previous films; the sense of threat and tension is still very present, and it is quite effective, although there is no surprise about the Xenomorph's murderous capabilities. The soundtrack, sound effects, editing and special effects are still excellent, notoriously expensive and elaborate. The work done by the actors doesn't leave us dissatisfied either: Sigourney Weaver takes her character, defending her and giving her a development and strength whose responsibility lies, totally and entirely, with the actress, and the way she committed herself to this work. Charles Dance still gives him welcome support, with a job well done, but they are almost alone and the rest of the cast is much weaker than they are. A caveat, however, for the brief appearance of Lance Henrikssen, who does a good job even though he contributes little to the film.There are, however, some issues that make the film much weaker, and which are linked to the script. One that came to mind while watching the film is how easily the film discards the surviving characters from the previous film, killing them in their sleep. Another thing I thought about was that Xenomorph, even though it's huge and very effective at killing, it's not acting like any animal would normally act. When we observe the natural world, we see that animals only kill for two essential reasons: food and self-defense. The Xenomorph does not. Although he feeds on the humans he kills, he also seems to kill for pleasure, which may betray a certain type of human-like intelligence. The film never explores this, limiting itself to releasing the beast to kill at random. As a horror element, it works, but it lacks the wit that would make things more interesting. The consequences of this, in light of the religious and spiritual issues so dear to prisoners, are also not addressed: we limit ourselves to seeing them in somewhat apocalyptic prayers. And if they are all vile men, ex-murderers and dangerous people, how is it that the film was not able to make them use this violence and ""criminal experience"" in favor of their own self-defense?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An honest Review,"At the moment it has 6.4 on IMDB and that makes me happy. I spent a lot of time defending Alien 3 as a stellar addition to the franchise. And, honestly, I think a lot of the hate on it is because of the fate of those that we grew to know and love from Aliens.The Dog concept was cool. It gave the alien a great new spin. And David Fincher...seriously, his style fits the franchise so well it's unbelievable. It is bleak and stylistic and it fits great into the world of Alien's future...in a Mad Max kind of way.It was the Alien movie that the 90s deserved, unlike Resurrection.You have a film that is darker than Aliens and a lot more horror. It fits more into the mold of Alien, with a darker theme. It's a nice departure from the over-the-top Aliens mega block buster action film, and brings the franchise back to it's singular alien ground point.It works very well. It just followed Aliens and I believe that people were expecting more action, more xenomorphs, more everything. Alien 3 gave you less in the same way that Alien did, and the pay off is there...so long as you don't walk into it expecting space marines.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A stylish horror video clip lacking substance and meaning,"Alien 3, pretentiously written as Alien ""cubed"", follows Ridley Scott's horror classic Alien (1979) and James Cameron's amazing sequel Aliens (1986). Alien 3 was directed by David Fincher, a guy who made video clips for MTV before he was inexplicably hired to follow in the footsteps of two of the greatest directors Hollywood has ever seen. To get straight to the point, Fincher knows how to handle his camera, he has a distinctive style, but that's about it. His movie is ruined by an awfully unimaginative script that essentially repeats the story of the first movie on a remote planet, but it does so without fleshing out the characters, without giving the movie an underlying meaning except for some vague notions of religion (which were apparently taken over from an abandoned script about a religious cult inhabiting the planet).Weaver returns as Ripley, strangely promoted to the rank of Lieutenant since Aliens (impossible really, since there is no time gap between the second and third movie to allow this to happen). I guess this is one of the many flaws and plot holes in Alien 3, another is the impossible appearance of an alien egg on the Sulaco right at the beginning of the movie, obviously put there by the script writers to trigger off the story. Weaver fails to give her character the depth it had in Aliens, quite likely thanks to the weakness of the script. The other characters are mostly cannon fodder whose only function is to cross the alien's path, scream and die. There is virtually no character development in Alien 3, and thus no suspense.Alien 3 is a cheap, unimaginative Hollywood sequel that should have never been made. It has no respect for the grandiose first two movies and the only reason why it was made was money. Unfortunately Alien 3 didn't tank as badly as could have been expected, and so the producers decided to make a fourth movie and the AVP movies. My recommendation: Consider all these movies nightmares and ignore them. The Alien Series, quality wise, ended with Aliens.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as most people say- decide for yourself.,"Alien 3 was called the best looking bad movie by Roger Ebert and it makes sense. This David Fincher(his debut) film is atmospheric and great looking but there are some missteps. For one- and the reason many hated it upon release is that the filmmaker chose to kill the much liked characters of Newt and corporal Hicks at the very start of the movie. Then the fact that a colony of convicts in a far off colony simply does not seem as appealing as a crew trapped upon a spaceship or marines killing aliens. But today the film's reputation seems to be improving. The problem, perhaps, with Alien 3 is that it is a sequel to two beloved films. On its own standing this isn't as bad a film as its reputation denotes.",,Anonymous,Horror

I mean, it had drama, action, and scary sequences. But then the alien turned into a computer image. Which was real disappointing. Also the killing of certain characters that I will not mention, didn't seem necessary. Over all, it's a good movie. There were just some things that they didn't need.

The bitch is back,"Alien³ often gets a lot of flak from most fans of the first two chapters of Alien franchise & in a way it deserves that. In its very opening moments, this film makes the huge mistake of discarding all the characters we grew to care about in the last film, leaving behind only Ripley and thus taking the whole premise back to square one. Compared to Ridley Scott's Alien & James Cameron's Aliens, Alien³ is an absolute atrocity. As a standalone feature however, it's not too shabby.The film opens with the shot of an escape pod carrying the survivors of the last film crash-landing on a prison-run refinery planet, killing all but Ellen Ripley. However, on investigating about what caused the crash, she finds out that an alien organism was on board with them all the time. As the new- born alien matures & begins its killing spree, Ripley tries to warn the inhabitants about the grave situation they are in and eventually discovers a deeply disturbing secret about herself.Directed by David Fincher, the film marks his feature film debut but was a harrowing experience for him. Troubled production, numerous rewrites, shooting without a finished script, constant interruptions by the studio executives, creative differences & then a complete dismantling of the director's version by the studio by reworking the plot for its theatrical release, it's no wonder why Fincher left the project before production ended and still hates it more than anyone else.Despite having more budget than the previous two chapters combined, Alien³ is still a massive downgrade in every filmmaking department. There is less suspense, less action, no real sense of direction and it is far more predictable than expected. The sets do provide an inhospitable look to the film but there is nothing impressive about it. Camera-work isn't that bad, editing is much more improved in the Assembly Cut, and the background score isn't that impressive either.Coming to the performances, apart from the characters of Ellen Ripley & a couple more planet's inhabitants, the rest are present in the film as death fodders only. And although Sigourney Weaver immerses nicely in her career-defining character, others are found hamming like crazy in their given roles. The alien creature itself is given a new design but it's so poorly rendered that it never really looks like a part of the picture but a highly artificial entity superimposed on the screen.On an overall scale, Alien³ manages to work in bits n pieces and as a standalone feature is slowly gaining a cult following of lately. It is quite entertaining, some sequences are excellently filmed, Weaver manages to impress again but the negatives far outweighs the positives this time as it really makes you wonder where the hell all its budget was spent on considering its poor visual effects, not-so- impressive set pieces & shoddily rendered alien. It's best to approach this film without expecting the level of experience its predecessors delivered or else you're destined to hate it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Weaver goes through the motions and that is the shame because she is the only actor you will recognize here with the exception of Lance. The story, Ripley lands on a space prison, alien tagged along, it starts killing, and the startling revelation why said alien will not kill her. Of course evil people want to use the alien again for weapon purposes. Why? Who knows, but I think it would be obvious by this time that the aliens are simply killing machines, and they are incapable of being trained. The ending is the lone bright spot here, but I was bored out of my mind by the time it rolled around.

Surprisingly very good.,"Most movies that are made into trilogies without being written as such in the first place usually degenerate into crap, no matter how good the idea was to start out with.  Take the Terminator trilogy for instance (though it must be admitted that the second one was pretty cool).  Alien, however, is not one of those trilogies.  The first and the second are different enough that the movies each remain interesting.  And the third one, amazingly enough, does the same thing.  Unlike most of the movie series put out by Hollywood, there is enough to do with the Alien storyline that there can conceivably be more than one movie.  Alien 3 is an often underrated sci-fi film, as it hearkens back to the first one.  However, it also does several things the first two do not in terms of character embellishment and suspense.  In addition, it provides beautiful visual effects (if the word 'beautiful' can be connected to a sci-fi/horror monster).

Enjoyed the Assembly Cut,"Review of the Assembly Cut (Special Edition, Restored Workprint):Alien (1979) is my absolute all-time favorite movie but beyond the first sequel, Aliens (1986), I can't say that I've been too fond of the entire franchise. I first saw Alien 3 in 1992 when it was released to theaters. I was 16 years old at the time and I was so excited to finally see a second sequel and to see it on the big screen. I had been too young to see the first two films in the cinema so this was going to be an experience I had long desired. But like everyone else, I was left with mixed feelings. I had seen some things I liked about the film but it also felt like it was missing something. Despite my feelings, I was always first in line to purchase the various home video releases over the years but opted to skip viewing Alien 3, especially after learning how director David Fincher's original vision was tampered with by the studio.But finally, on its 30th anniversary, I decided to give it another chance. I did this for two reasons. One, David Fincher has easily become my favorite contemporary movie director, with Zodiac being one of my favorite films. Two, I had heard so much about the Assembly Cut (Special Edition) put together by Charles de Lauzirika, that I needed to see it for myself. Apparently, it has the blessing of David Fincher as it was assembled according to Fincher's original workprint.I'm so glad that I gave the film another chance because I thoroughly enjoyed the Assembly Cut of Alien 3. Once I let go of any preconceived notions as well as any ill feelings I had carried in the past 30 years, I was able to enjoy the film for what it is. It's a dark stylish slow-burning thriller that puts a nice cap on the Ripley story. Yes, I know there is another sequel as well as the prequels, but I think Alien 3 fits in nicely with the first two films while also standing on its own. With this cut, it finally feels like a Fincher film.The cinematography and production design are astonishing. The film looks gothic but still futuristic. The other thing that stood out is the lush but subdued music score by Elliot Goldenthal. Special effects-wise, I can't say that I liked the CG effects. However, the practical effects are very well done and I think this Xenomorph design is my second favorite after the original. In terms of acting, everyone is quite good, especially Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dutton.Now, what about the story? This one is tough to analyze. I think what makes the first two films so good is that they have a relatively simple linear plot structure with something engaging that keeps the audience entertained. In the first film, it is mystery and suspense mixed with philosophical overtones. In the second film, it is action mixed with familial themes. But Alien 3 is not so simple and linear and because it doesn't have those hooks that the first two films have, I think people were left disappointed and not so sure how they felt about it. I do think the Assembly Cut does a much better job of keeping the story moving and restoring a better structure to the film. But what about the hook? For me, it's the religious themes of faith and sacrifice that provides the emotional punch and a very powerful conclusion to Ripley's story arc. I think it makes sense.The first film has a young Ripley who must learn to survive by herself. The second film is about Ripley as a mother who must fight back to survive. The third film has a mature Ripley who has been stripped of everything she cares about and must then sacrifice herself to destroy the Xenomorph. This is a fascinating conclusion to the story. Yes, it is dark and depressing, but again it feels like the logical and appropriate ending if we consider it to be a trilogy.In my final analysis, I do think Alien 3 deserves another look, especially the Assembly Cut, which restores David Fincher's original vision in the best possible way.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien 3 managed to break the expectation of seeing the same old things and tried to innovate,"The initial tense and tragic scenes, shown in perforated flashes between the credits, could be mistaken for a nightmare had it not been for the lieutenant's known bad luck - or fate -. It is revealed, in the very first seconds of projection, that the Alien Queen had time to lay two eggs on board the Sulaco military ship and that the birth of the facehuggers created problems in the systems, causing an escape pod, with the three human survivors and Bishop's remains (Lance Henriksen) were ejected. In five minutes all the happy conclusion of the second film is destroyed. Fury 161 is the name of the planet, a maximum security prison for men with 25 inhabitants, religious and celibate, not happy with the visitor.The capsule, upon falling on the planet, kills the girl Newt, the soldier Hicks and destroys (even more) the android Bishop. Only Ripley survives, along with a new type of alien that is born from the nearest unsuspecting dog. The monster then starts to hunt the prison population - which is all male, as it is an establishment for carriers of ""double Y"" chromosomes - and Ripley has to face this threat further, in addition to trying to survive the prisoners themselves and the conditions adverse conditions. The attempt to innovate the script is presented by the suppression of the moments of preparation of the suspense. There is alien alive, loose and ready for another massacre along the lines of the previous features, after all, if there is an adjective that does not serve the franchise it is surprising. Since Alien, the 8th Passenger the scheme is the same: first contact with the alien, death, deaths, one or two saved after races full of adrenaline and end. Don't wait too long.The film ran into problems during production, including filming without a script, with several writers and directors. Fincher, on his feature film debut, was brought in to direct after a proposed version with Vincent Ward as director was canceled during pre-production. The script, written by Walter Hill, David Giler and Larry Ferguson, tries to combine elements from the first and second films, but cannot get close to either one or the other. It is a kind of patchwork of ideas in a result below the desired. In addition to the well-known enemy, in a new version, the protagonist must face sexism in Alien 3. Accused of ""violating harmony and breaking the group's spiritual unity"", the first woman prisoners have seen in years is prohibited from leaving the infirmary, considered a lunatic, sexually attacked and pressured to assume the position of leader when the situation is complete chaos. Nothing, sexual object, mother. These are the roles that fit him, according to men. The exception is the doctor Clemens (Charles Dance), with whom she is able to break the rules, talk and calm the loneliness a little.Alien 3 makes some pretty controversial decisions. Right from the start, we found the girl, the one everyone was rooting for in the previous movie, dead. That is, frustration arises at the beginning. After killing a child, the one who brutally dies next is a dog - parallel to the cat, who, too, is in great danger, but manages to reach the end of Alien: The Eighth Passenger safe and sound. The impression we have is of a statement: ""look, we know what happened before, but now everything will be different and anything can happen"". Well, in fact, anything happens. Even the unthinkable! And that seems to be his biggest sin, as no safe haven is preserved.Debuting in the direction of feature films, David Fincher fills the film with religious subtexts that are not always complete in meaning, certainly hampered by the legendary imbroglio between the director and the studio. Hired shortly before filming, without a script ready, after Vincent Ward's sudden departure, Fincher demonstrates that he is looking for the construction of a style, here marked by the abuse of detail plans and the adoption of alternate montage in sequences that involve great suspense, something extremely irritating. Seeking to emulate the atmosphere of the original work, once again, we have the enclosed environment, a single predator hunting for its victims and a desperate struggle by humans against imminent death. Instead of a spaceship, however, we find ourselves in the maximum security prison on Planet Fury 161. The intention of making history more dynamic, intense and violent is quite clear. And Fincher's vision, if it is not complete, at least is present in the apocalyptic look and in the frameworks that take the alien's point of view, as in the final pursuits. The problem is that there were a lot of bets, when what was expected was just more of the same. And it was these breaches of expectations that generated such a negative assessment, at least at the time of its launch.Fincher presents us with beautiful sequences full of symbolism, such as the autopsy and later the funeral of these same characters who did not survive, contrasting with the birth of the alien incubated in a dog. As well as the famous chase sequence through the alien's point of view using a subjunctive camera and the scene in which the creature advances on Ripley and retreats when feeling that it is ""contaminated""; also highlighting the photograph of veteran Alex Thomson, who died in 2007, making the film almost unison with its grainy and brown reed, a gloomy, sweaty, sultry and dirty climate. Furthermore, in Fincher's debut, we can notice in the narrative his signature and influences when using large scenarios and camera positioning from the bottom up, enhancing that atmosphere of a grandly decadent place.This is the most violent film in the franchise. Combined with the filthy aspect of a prison. It goes in the opposite direction of the technological and even dirty look, but compensatory for the first two films. Fincher here wanted to go further. The Alien is the monster that human filth deserves. And the empirical conflict with this beast is through cleverness. There is no armament. A return to previous possibilities of existence. There is no escape. The hope of escaping from it all is put to the test through free will, rational thought and faith, given by God. In other words, here humans encounter a challenge at an older level. Primordial. Aliens 3 works well, however, it requires an exaggerated degree of so-called suspension of disbelief, that is, that necessary tool for viewers to effectively enter the story being told, however fanciful it may be. Here, we find several absurdities. The writers, in Alien 3, ask us to believe that the Alien Queen had time to lay eggs in Sulaco, that facehuggers were born out of these eggs, one being a super facehugger (whose offspring is another queen), that the animals caused a fire on the ship thanks to its acidic blood to cause it to eject the escape pod, that facehuggers go into the escape pod (smart, right?), which, in the vast outer space, the spacecraft is coincidentally passing through a planet at the time of the problem, that the escape pod kills everyone but Ripley and that it falls close to where other humans are, so that it can be rescued. There is more, but I think you can already understand how the script doesn't even try to create a narrative with a minimum of coherence.But, having overcome - or not - the question of the script, Fincher manages to impress a depressing and desperate atmosphere in his work, with muted colors or with a sepia filter, in addition to sets that try to emulate the interior of the Nostromo (in a way, the created atmosphere would be repeated, with due proportions, in Seven, his next film). It is not easy to digest, but, as it was his goal, it achieves it easily. Incidentally, the heavy finalist tone of Alien 3 will certainly drive away those who are not fans of the series and leave fans with a strange taste in their mouths.The franchise is renewed with each film: a suspense thriller, an explosive action blockbusters and, here, a pessimistic and dense existential drama. Alien 3 is the one that most understands the drama that Ripley carries to its dramatic end. As in the previous ones, Ripley is a fish out of water. The boredom with the aliens and the constant misery of his stolen life are reflected in his erased, mortified mood. Losing his purpose for living a second time, there is not much else for which Ripley has to embark on another fight against the xenomorphs. Her motivation is selfless and seeks redemption for the guilt of the death of his friends. An end also for his eternal wandering through space. Here she is a ghost from the past. Sigourney Weaver maintains the level of previous films, but it leaves a lot of bitterness to the protagonist. Perhaps your best scene is the autopsy on Newt's body. Charles S. Dutton gives a real show as the religious leader of the prison inmates, and the scenes he antagonizes against Lieutenant Ripley are sensational. Charles Dance, as the doctor who piques the interest of the main character, is also very well on the scene.Alien 3 managed to break the expectation of seeing the same old things and tried to innovate. A pity that at the time and also because of his cinema cut, he won very little from the critics and the public. Not only because of this, I undoubtedly affirm that it is a work ahead of its time - perhaps, even nowadays since it is constantly a film cowardly attacked even by fans who never dared to watch it facing it as fundamental piece of anthology and as the hitherto end to Ripley's arc. This third episode captures the spirit of the films with great respect. His originality, whether in the text, in the great direction or on the fantastic musical score, shows that, somehow, David Fincher managed to win the system.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Train Wreck Of A Film,"First point i'd like to make is that I am a BIG ""Alien"" fan and love the Sci-Fi Horror genre. I mean the first film Alien and James Cameron's Aliens are among my top films of all time and I love them. Recently I just watched the third Alien film and opinion: absolutely awful. I mean the film literally throws out everything that made the other two films great: Horror thats actually decent, suspense, setting, good alien design, STORY, acting, soundtrack, giving the audience what it wants etc. and replaces it with a David Fincher concoction thats a total mockery. I have no good points to make about the film so I'll just get on with what gave the film a despicable 1 out of 10 in my opinion.Firstly why and I MEAN WHY kill off the two characters we had hopes that they had LIVED through the nightmare in the previous film. I mean James Cameron does a fantastic job of characterising Corporal Hicks and Rebecca(Newt) and it leaves the audience with relief that they survived and fully we believe or should believe they fully deserve it. Then here comes along David Fincher and chooses to kill them off in a crash that is literally seconds after the opening credits like we had no emotional connection to them whatsoever what were you thinking...D**K!. Another point about the actual Alien is how come they can breed inside buffalo? when breeding inside humans was a major aspect of the story. The actual design of the alien is also poor hardly horrifying at all in fact instead of moving like a serpent with heavy movement and a lent over posture it prances along like a cat, not even half as good. Next after a bit of tender loving care Ripley is found to be O.K and Fincher seems to be characterising the Medical Officer that does most of the looking after so logically we should be thinking he is the important one and the one that survives right? or at least has a very dramatic death at the end. But once again little bit of emotional scene between him and Ripley alien comes up behind him middle of the film I might add and dead, just as quickly as he kills off the two surviving characters earlier on. Then few seconds later Commanding Officer is killed but he hasn't been characterised, we don't know him, maybe dislike him a bit so who cares. And this process is repeated slavishly through the rest of the film over and over and over again until only one man apart from Ripley remains. Oh and I forgot to mention for some stupid unexplained reason Ripley happens to have an alien queen inside of her so she has to kill herself then end of film. A few hints if Fincher can read this on how to have improved YOUR film: Firstly characterise characters you actually want to survive it is very confusing for the audience to portray someone as good and great then kill them with no one left characterised to hope to survive the ordeal. Secondly stick to the aliens breeding inside humans I mean it IS an aspect of the story that they breed inside humans so changing it is just pure stupidity. Thirdly improve the setting by a mile or scrap it all together i mean its supposed to be a Sci-Fi horror for most of the film I thought they were battling the alien in a hospital on earth, space is infinite if your going to call the planet Fiorina 161 at least have an imagination. I also have one important question for Fincher himself why? why kill off the best characters from the previous film within the first five minutes for no reason whatsoever?, why use a script that is utterly poor and the most basic of storys?, why does David Fincher expect sympathies or an emotive reaction from characters he didn't even characterise? and why did he have to ruin a franchise that had so much potential left? so through an awful plot, awful story badly trying to repeat aspects from the first film, awful characters and making a total mess of the film overall avoid watching this at all costs you WILL be very disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
This films is so great even Fincher can't see his greatness.,"I'm sorry but in my opinion anyone knocking on this film negatively needs mental checkup.

I won't waste words on numbskulls to dumb to appreciate it but a) it's not to be compared to the other films but on its own and b) it's the only movie I may have memorized and watched 1,000 times (the special edition Assembly Cut is the ONLY definitive version of this film to be watched.

"Giving it a solid 9! This is why... its horror, sad and dark. Better of as a stand alone.",I read all the reviews here and yes i agree its less perfect compared to the 1&2. But it still has a serious horror ( and still one of the best sci-fi) feelings of all films. Despite the damages due to director and budget issues.. this is still a very very good film. I love the simple brownish decay feeling its gives. I did care for some of the characters. Esp charles dance. I understand people are dissapointed if they expected a topping on James camerons Aliens. But try to see it without comparisations. And it will score mich higher. Also the film after this one one is very cool on itself. Please be more kind to these kind of films. Its very rare nowadays!! Sci-fi is not drowning in class acts. But this is actually one of the exeptions. Go see it also /or ecspecially if you didnt see the 1and 2nd film. Enjoy this dark claustrofobic sad movie! It will get its rates eventually. Xx,,Anonymous,Horror
Nowhere as bad as everyone claims but falls short of the first two entries in the series,"David Fincher's debut film is atmospheric and great looking but there are some missteps. For one- and the reason many hated it upon release is that the filmmaker chose to kill the much liked characters of Newt and corporal Hicks at the very start of the movie. Then the fact that a colony of convicts in a far off colony simply does not seem as appealing as a crew trapped upon a spaceship or marines killing aliens. But today the film's reputation seems to be improving. The problem, perhaps, with Alien 3 is that it is a sequel to two beloved films. On its own standing this isn't as bad a film as its reputation denotes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Normal Movie,"The thing about Alien 3 is that it's OK. Is it outstanding? no. Is it bad? Not really. The reason this movie got such bad reviews is that we were expecting more, but we didn't get it. I loved the first two movies. Alien had a great sense of panic and uncertainty built around it. Of course, after you know everything you can't really repeat it, which is why Aliens, probably my favorite of the series, was so great. It took what we already knew from the first movie and expanded on it. It didn't try to create uncertainty around something we already knew about. It took what we knew and built upon it, resulting in a great movie. Alien 3 however just tried to repeat the uncertainty from the first one, which is hard to do when you've already had that aspect played out. We already know all about the alien. It didn't bring anything new resulting in an average movie. It's not as bad as some say, but it's not as good as the other alien movies, although it is far better than alien resurrection.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great sequel, but, couldn't follow the footsteps of the first two.","""Alien 3,"" David Fincher's directorial debut, had its moments.  It had its ups and downs, its good and its bad, the usual, but David Fincher's camera work helped it from being a failure.  The movie isn't what I would call excellent (""Alien,"" ""Aliens,"" and ""Alien: Resurrection"" were good), but it was good.  Sigourney Weaver's performance was extraordinary.  Once again, she fights an alien, but, this time, it's at a prison that's for men.  There were strong violence and lots of language.  I consider ""Alien 3"" to be David Fincher's failure, but, his next 4 films (""Se7en,"" ""The Game,"" ""Fight Club,"" and ""Panic Room"") will help bring him to fame and stardom.  I'll recommend it if you enjoyed the ""Alien"" series.B **** (out of ****** stars) 9/13",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Alien³ — Gritty, down and dirty fight to the finish","Alien³ is, to me, the unloved child of the Alien series. If not as good as the other two preceding it, David Fincher's attempt was a successful one nonetheless. It came full circle by going back to ""weaponless"" confrontation with the beast. I think that, combined with a revolting dirty low-tech environment, rebuffed most watchers.The good. Imaginative environment. Tight scenario with many chills and thrills. Captivating story. Great photography. Excellent costume and dialogs. Simple and touching relation between Ripley and the doctor. Very interesting characters. Excellent cast.The actors. Sigourney Weaver outdid herself with this evolution of her heroic persona, a truly great performance. Charles Dance seems to be the true complement to our female lead and played it to perfection. The whole lot of convicts and jailers was astonishingly good, I'll just give special mentions to Paul McGann, Christopher Fairbank, and Charles S. Dutton.The bad. Unfortunately, the alien's CG effects are starting to show their age, and it can be distracting at time.The ugly. The intro. It's not logical. There can be no eggs there. The queen had lost her egg producing sac. That's probably what turned off most hardcore Alien fans. It did me. It took me a while to go past that and see the quality of this film. Since this blatant mistake was the basis of the whole scenario, it left very few advocators.The result. A great sci-fi thriller. Should be seen with an open mind if you like the first two installments of the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great action and suspense, but poor script and acting","To see this film, its likely you've seen the previous 2 films, which were very good. Horror fans wouldn't be disappointed with this film, but the acting and script lets it down. Alien 3 has never lived up to its previous films to some people, including me. The director of Alien 3 - David Fincher, unfortunately tries to make the film more modern than its predecessors. This is were the film goes wrong. We are used to the excellent directing delivered to us in the previous films, but the only good piece of directing in this film are the camera angles, which shows us the aliens nicely and some great 'running away' scenes which we see when the characters try to trap an alien, cleverly in one small area. The best of use of cameras in this film is the quiet scene in which Ripley finds the mother alien sneaking up on her.The film is set on a distant planet that holds some insane characters in a prison. Ripley, in her escape pod from the previous film, lands onto the planet. Here, we meet many strange and different characters of all types. We have our typical American psychopath who keeps on shouting out ""F**k you man!"". Its a shame really, the first film done well without guys like this. I'm not saying actors shouldn't swear - what do you expect with an alien hunting you down, but I get the impression they are saying it for the hell of it. Then we get some dumb geezers who apparently haven't seen a woman in years - believable, but if you class Ripley as a woman by the end of this film, you belong with these guys! Our other characters thankfully try to act and remain calm...most of the time.After an alien is swallowed by the riggers dog, he (spoiler) gets frisky and gives birth to an alien, but because the dog ate the egg, we see an alien mutated into a dog. A clever idea from our novice director, and a realistic scene when we see the dogs stomach explode. The other special effects aren't too bad either. We see CGI (computer generated images) of aliens, running around the corridors that maybe perhaps could have done with more effort.It is Ripleys change in personality that sets this film away from the previous 2. Its harsh , but (spoiler) when Ripley gets her hair shaved off to avoid lice, she does become very mannish. It is the truth, but its shows the development in Ripleys character. She is no longer the woman with plenty of femininity, but now a more woman who's ready to kick some ass.The good thing about this film is the amount of action we are treated to! There's plenty of 'run away' scenes and aliens, and the realism is great - most scenes use puppets of aliens, and the use of the early CGI is minimal, so don't worry about that too much.If your looking for a realistic action film, than try Alien 3. it has its flaws - bad script, lack of outer space, and constant arguments between the characters that gets tedious. But this film has been designed for action, and director David Fincher does a good job of that, and the puppet realism as well. But avoid this if you don't like lots of blood, aliens, or the flaws listed above.Overall, an experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fincher let down by tiresome script and action predictability,"Ripley (Weaver) and her remaining crew crash land on a prison planet. As the only survivor Ripley must lead the inmates into finding an Alien that was onboard her ship.Six years after the remarkably brilliant Aliens and new director David Fincher was assigned the huge responsibility to maintain the scientific brilliance of the Alien series and sadly (and never has the word been more appropriate) he failed. Apart from a wonderful upside down chase in the final stages, there is no experimentation, no vintage scene stealing camera sweeps and no fast flowing consistency, which would become so powerful in his future releases (Fight Club, Panic Room) Fincher is let down by the script. Vincent Ward's story is amazingly flat and obvious, a contrast to the previous two releases. Ward takes a tried and tested format of having the creature hovering around in the background with the characters on the edge of their seats. Unlike Alien and Predator where this technique worked so magnificently, there is no urgency, no scare factor and most significantly no surprise. The alien in fact doesn't even feel scary when it is on screen. It appears as a matter of fact. There is no surprise to the creation whereas in Alien we didn't know what it was and in Aliens we couldn't count how many were out there or where they were. Plus this is a complete CGI creation and an obvious one at that whereas previously it felt like the Alien was right there in front of you. Effects flew out of the window and you were there sitting on the edge waiting for the creature to steal the lives of its prey. Here there is predictability about it; this along with the Star Wars prequels is the saddest moment in Sci-Fi history.However the film doesn't start off all too badly. The action is rolling in the credits and we glimpse some Alien activity on board Ripley's ship, leaving questions open as she crash lands. The ending, as in true Alien franchise fashion, is a sad depressing and highly dramatic turn of events. Personally I love films which don't have happy ending as they are too clichéd, there is realism to be had, which the series isn't afraid to justify.Despite the lack of originality and the predictability, Sigourney Weaver still maintains that opinionated persona of Ripley and is one of two bright points about this third part.Alien³ was the definitive turn in the series, the time when the Alien was no longer scary and original horror and suspense was thrown out for action convention and special effects.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
3 times the swearing...,"""Alien 3"" is considered to be the darkest out of all 4 films. It picks up where ""Aliens"" left off and focuses on Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) troubles with her best friend, the xenomorph, who she has a special connection with this time around. After the assault against the aliens on LV-426, Ripley, the little girl Newt, Corporal Hicks and Bishop the Android are on their way home, but an egg has been planted on the Sulaco (presumably by the Queen before her death) and the facehugger that emerges from it starts a fire. Ripley and her companions get ejected into an EEV, which crash lands on Fiorina 161, a barren planet inhabited by murderers and rapists who now turn to God. Hicks, Newt and Bishop die, which leaves Ripley all alone waiting to be rescued. When some inmates start disappearing, Ripley fears an alien has landed on the planet with her and she was right. With limited weapons, she teams up with the convicts to kill it. She also has to make a life or death decision because of her very special connection to the alien species as well. This film was a HUGE turn around from the previous film, it is dark and slow moving, the survivors are killed in the first 5 minutes and Ripley has a shaved head. The convicts were annoying and they must have spewed the F-word at least 100 times throughout the whole movie. The alien was also different from the others, it ran on all 4 legs and it protected Ripley. This is a good entry in the series, but it is my least favorite.",,Anonymous,Horror
Made sure to watch the directors and still has issues,This movie does have issues and does struggle to live up to reputation of the first two films. Its not as chilling as the first film and not as action packed as the second. It takes the middle ground between them and while not bad in theory it's not executed all that well. At times this movie is unclear and messy. I didn't dislike the character both found some of them alittle samey. The plot isn't as tight as previous iterations although there are horror elements which are good. The CGI is very terriable and at times even the original alien film hold up better today than this.

the New Testament in Space,"The third instalment of the Alien 'Trilogy' sees Ripley survive and land on a prison ship where all the inmates, who have been previously convicted of murder and rape and suchlike, have turned to religion. If this sounds unlikely, then the flat characterisations, the continuos obscenities and the pummelling repetitions of people telling each other to shut up won't help.The biblical comparisons are made almost too obvious, and the lack of a referral to the Alien as an Alien, but simply as a beast or a monster, give it devilish credentials, but there is almost too much in common with the gospels that it watches like The New Testament in Space.The only characters that deserve any serious consideration are Ripley and Clarence, yet there interaction is completely uninspiring.Sadly, the ending is by far the best part of the film, but the build up to the ending lacks any feel of intensity and slightly confused me.All in all, the film is poor, and as an act to follow the two previous films, certainly can't stand the heat.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Like a good wine, gets better as it ages....","It's interesting in that when I first went to see Alien3 at the cinema on the year of its release I couldn't help fill disappointed after seeing the film. There was so much weight to carry after the horror action combo of the first two films, that this was always going to be a hard act to follow.However, as time has passed and re-watching the film without the expectations that were first placed upon it, its makes for interesting viewing. Indeed, the somber story and brown-green visuals that pervades the films will never endear it to a large audience. Yet there is much to admire about the film. It's wonderfully stylish, has some really key performances from some of the leads, and is very brave with its story.Watching it makes me yearn to see the Directors Cut (at least another 40 minutes of character driven footage was excised from the film just prior to its release by the studio). Alas, only time will tell if Fincher and Fox will put their differences behind them, and let us enjoy the original vision of a young and talented director who was so obviously working under constraint at the time.And for those of you who haven't seen the film - or dismissed it - I implore you to watch again with fresh eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch the 2003 Directors Cut,"Honestly, the directors cut is a far superior version than the rushed theatrical cut. I've always defended Alien 3 as an underrated film, watching the dvd directors cut justifies this.Each of the characters are better developed with underlying sub plots that just aren't there in the original. Significant amounts of extra scenes and dialogue give the film a depth that simply wasn't there in the original.The twist of the story explains so much and gives the film purpose and reason for some of the decisions the characters make.OK, the early 90's CGI alien isn't going to blow you away.

As a teenager of that time, I can tell you it was seminal to our appreciation of horror AND sci-fi! ""Aliens"" was sheer genius and one of the most FUN movies to just roller-coaster through! One of the best sci-fi action pictures ever (that's 2 feathers in the cap of this franchise).""Aliens3"" brought the sleek bullet-train of the franchise smashing at 130 mph right into a mountain. Never in the history of motion pictures has a deus ex machina so flagrantly betrayed a fanbase. Let's see, you the viewer sat through 4+ hours of gripping excitement and chills...only to have the utter bad-ass heroes, including at CHILD who was one of the coolest young characters ever written for the screen simply wasted OFF SCREEN?????? Oh, but we're being ARTSY here so it's OK. Never mind that the Queen had NO EGGSAC left to make anymore eggs (and clearly wasn't carrying any on her body). Never mind that Burke never had a chance to bring any eggs to the second drop ship, him being busy with dying and all.The BEST I could come up with was Bishop having had secret(possibly even to himself) programming to stash a few eggs on the second dropship when he piloted it down. Of course...where did he GET them? The medical bay only had the two facehuggers. Again, DEUS EX MACHINA. Oz, The Great and Terrible!!! Or in simpler terms LAMENESS beyond anything I've seen on the screen.As if all that wasn't insult enough, the followup to all this heroism is a world of villains and freaks you actually WANTED to see die off anyway? Real good cinematic triumph there Fincher. Again, lame and horrid. Just a sad attempt to make money at the cost of art.As far as I'm concerned, the school of thought that says ""Aliens 3"" and ""Alien: Ressurrection"" were simply hypersleep nightmares had by the survivors (most likely Ripley) is the ONLY explanation for this TRAVESTY.End of Line.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Director's Cut is actually watchable,"The director's cut is substantially better than the theater release, but still lacks the ""umph"" of the previous two or the fourth. Scott and Cameron's directorial presence are both sorely missed, but the story does have it's merits (albiet limited). I think that Alien Resurrection makes Alien3 more watchable since Ripley's story doesn't actually end with this chapter.I have to wonder what 20th Century was thinking by allowing a first-time to direct this installment?Overall, I think 3 does add to the overall story, but only just.Thank you Joss Whedon for scripting 4 and saving the series!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A harshly treated, honest sequel.","Alien's success led to three sequels; Aliens, Alien3 and Alien Resurrection. Of course, the only one that ever came close to moving out from under the original's shadow was Cameron's Aliens, the most hate still seems to remain directed at Alien3 followed closely by Alien Resurrection. James Cameron's sequel is truly one of the best sequels ever made to a film, it upped the ante with an entire colony of the aliens as opposed to just one, a queen alien, a child, soldiers, guns and explosions. James Cameron was able to make a sequel that drew comparison with the original but ultimately devalued the aliens' terrifying image by including hundreds and making them far easier to kill by including weapons.I see Fincher's Alien 3 as an attempt to reconnect with something that was lost in ""Aliens."" I love watching each film because there's a watermark left from each director's style: Alien has Ridley Scott's pacing, tension and flawless direction. Aliens had James Cameron's funny satire of American soldiers and it's own brand of humor, before it was diluted into something far less enjoyable with Avatar. It also has his a happy (yet not artificially sweet) ending that makes the film-goer leave the cinema satisfied.Alien 3 has Fincher's bleak outlook. The opening sequence is still one of the best opening sequences that I've seen, it captures the mood of the whole film. It is a dark, allegorical tale for an adult taste about redemption in the sh*thole of the universe. A group of convicts are able to group together valiantly to destroy the most horrifying creature in existence. Gone is the optimism of Aliens, enter the nihilism of David Fincher. The deaths of Newt, Bishop and Hicks were necessary to Fincher's vision by removing the optimism of Cameron's sequel. The alien itself has also changed, to a dog-like sprinter.Fincher's film was plagued by rewrites, development hell and critical failure. This is the prelude to Fight Club and Se7en, it was an exercise for Fincher to distinguish his own style. The film retains little of the other films, while remaining more true to the bleak outlook of the original than Aliens. It's a polarizing film that will divide fans of the first two entirely but is a must-see. But it's rarely seen for what it truly is. It also has the best motivational line for a certainty-of-death situation: ""You're all gonna die. The only question is how you check out. Do you want it on your feet? Or on your f*ckin' knees... begging? I ain't much for begging! Nobody ever gave me nothing!""",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Third in the series,"The least successful film in this series was directed by style master (and content-underachiever) David Fincher. Ripley, the only survivor of her past mission, awakens on a prison planet in the far corners of the solar system. As she tries to recover, she realizes that not only has an alien gotten loose on the planet, the alien has implanted one of its own within her. As she battles the prison authorities (and is aided by the prisoners) in trying to kill the alien, she must also cope with a distinctly shortened lifespan that awaits her. But the striking imagery makes for muddled action and the script confuses it further. The ending looks startling but it takes a long time--and a not particularly satisfying journey--to get there.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien 3 : Assembly Cut Review,"Alien 3: Assembly Cut Review
-----------------------------------------------
No spoilers.This cut adds 30 minutes of footage that was initially removed due to studio interference. While Fincher wasn't involved in the re-edit, the changes create a completely different experience. I still remember the shock of watching it-it felt like a brand new film.Despite the production challenges, Fincher's vision shines through in the cinematography, editing, and emotional depth. The storytelling is on another level.""The real fear grips hardest in the moments when the Alien isn't even on screen.""This cut highlights how modern films often rely too much on spectacle. Alien 3 proves that subtlety, atmosphere, and character depth can create a more profound sense of terror. The pacing, dialogue, and even the silent moments between characters build an oppressive tension that sticks with you long after.If you're expecting wall-to-wall Alien action, this might not be your film. But if you're into smart, atmospheric horror, Alien 3: Assembly Cut is essential viewing. The Alien design here is also quite different from the previous films, yet iconic in its own right.I'll dive deeper into the theatrical cut in a future post, but for now, I'll say this: you simply can't discuss Alien 3 without seeing the Assembly Cut.Assembly cut Rating: 8.5/10

Stop comparing with Aliens!,"I cant stand all you ppl out there who immediately start cursing this film, by saying he spoiled it all by killing off Hicks & Newt. So what, does it not make Ripley (when she mourns Newts death) more human on a planet of killers?So its not sentimental, not all sugar coated happy ending, isn't nearly every movie like that? At least the the director had the balls to make that decision. I realise this is not the film that he wanted to end up with, but this film does deserve better than its got.Its got gritty realism, the atmosphere reeks of death, and the thing is as soon as everyone realises what they up against they also know that they are going to their deaths, but somehow we sympathise with killers and rapists.Weaver gives her finest performance in the Alien series, tough and uncomprimising, yet her feelings (love/distress) show much more than in previous films.What did u all want, another blast them up, sugar coated ending? Variety is the spice of life, and i think anyone who dislikes this film does not really understand the concpt of the fear that the Alien brings, did anyone feel tense or slightly jumpy in Aliens? Stop comparing and take them as individual films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
maybe the worst in the alien saga,"this is maybe the worst movie of the alien saga, but is still a good movie to watch. it's not the that is bad, is the others (alien movies) that are better. sigourney weaver continues her great performance as ripley in one more alien movie, i can't even imagine other actress for the job. charles dutton was a surprise for me in this movie, for is good performance. if u are an alien fan go see it. if u like bold women go see it. if not, don't see it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as some think,"As most know, this isn't exactly the best the Alien series has to offer. But it's not as bad as some say.  Personally, I like it, and I like it for a lot of reasons. Now, as for me, Aliens is my all-time favorite movie and there is rarely a film out there that even comes close to touching it's glory, so why even begin to compare?  Alien 3 is a movie all in it's own.  Yes, it's a bit slow, not as action packed, and there is a little too much swearing (but hey, they're convicts) but it's also a very tense and realistic story.  Like the first two, the plot and story line are sound and believable.  Unlike the first two, it's not an action movie and I think that's where it lost some people.  Yes, it does have action in it, but that's not it's main focus.  I think this installation to the series needs to be viewed for it's powerful grip and sense of realism.  It's so real, the viewer almost feels as if they're really there (which would suck big time).  Unlike it's piece of junk sibling (Resurrection) it really is a good movie and well worth a watch if you're not comparing it to it's two older and more powerful brothers.  Plus the musical score is excellent. And after reading the alternate scenes, I wish they'd release that to the public!  I know I'd buy it in a second.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than people give it credit for even if it strays a little too much toward the original.,"I suppose with the benefit of hindsight, I can see exactly what director David Fincher was trying here. We all know him for his Se7en's, Fight Club's and his Zodiac's but this really does work as an early piece of bleak cinematography and eerie suspense from the man. There is a lot of hate for Alien³, partly because it resembles the first Alien so much and probably partly also because it does not resemble the second Alien film enough. But to dislike it due to its lack of covering new ground is more of a compliment to Alien and its original, brilliant approach than it is a criticism of Alien³ because whilst this isn't better than '1', it is better than '2'.I did not enjoy Cameron's fast, action packed shoot 'em up attempt at an Alien film the first time I saw it and with subsequent viewings, it slips even further down the ladder of quality. There was just no heart and no attempt at trying to scare us  it was merely a bunch of uninteresting, annoying marines shooting monsters. But Alien³ tones things down; it calms the viewer and allows us dialogue to listen to; situations to arrive and be dealt with whilst allowing certain characters to die either tragically or unexpectedly. In Aliens, there would be a gunfight; a death and some silly one-liners afterwards  this would be repeated for the film's duration. Alien³ does not allow us dumb action rightly so until the film's finale and even then, the action is not dumbed down; it is a sequence where the prisoners must use their logic in trapping the beast so that they may succeed  the idea to ban all guns from the film is a bold and brilliant one and one that is said so early on in the office as a sort of way that allows Fincher to announce his ideas: ""this will not be like the previous film: there are no guns on this particular planet.""But then again, Fincher cannot direct action too well anyway. His subsequent films include little to no action but they get across a feeling that you have just seen something rather stunning anyway. The finale in Se7en is not an action set piece but a twist that makes you feel you've just seen something incredible; the twist in Fight Club hits you in a way that again forces you to come to terms with the revelation whilst making you feel you've just seen an amazing action set piece. But Alien³ is a Fincher film that has a few death scenes sprinkled in it throughout without ever feeling like it will suffice as guilty entertainment - Fincher knows suspense and gets the balance right. There are some scenes early on involving a suspicion Ripley (Weaver) has; the subsequent autopsy and nearer the end when nobody knows where the Alien is in the tunnels. To me, these scenes suffice and act as more entertaining and more interesting viewing than out and out gunfire action.With this in mind, whenever death scenes do occur they do so in a sudden and disorientating manner which is a neat idea for a film to do but when it is handled by someone like Fincher who is more of a suspense director, it can fall flat. Consequently, a scene in which a couple of explosions go off for some reasons and people go flying all over the place, it seems a little heavy handled and sloppy, but it only ever happens once until the finale which like I said is more logic and camera than one-liners and gunfire. Directors such as Spielberg in Jaws, Saving Private Ryan and Munich as well as Scott in the first Alien can get the balance right between suspense and action and here, Fincher gives it a good go.There is also that reoccurring idea to do with gender and sexuality. Ripley and the last few members of the crew from Aliens have crashed onto a planet inhabited by male prisoners. There is a scene which challenges what these prisoners want, sexually, with how much they want it. The lead warden (rather foolishly?) announces a woman is in the establishment but the woman is Ripley who of course embodies very masculine traits; this is further emphasised when she shaves her head, shedding any femininity that remains  this challenges the male prisoners, some of whom have been established as rapists: do they still want the woman if the woman is not 'like' a woman? These ideas also pay reference to the character of Vasquez in the previous Alien film.There may be the notion that Alien³ is very much like Alien what with its idea behind there only being one beast to contend with and a crew in an confined space without any weapons. There is also a hard bodied, strongly willed black character who is clearly (in a positive ethnic representation) the only one who wants to fight, echoing the character of Parker in Alien. But the film is not bad; the sets and cinematography are good and whilst the deaths, action and the surprising amount of British prisoners is iffy, Clemens' relationship with Ripley acts as a sweet distraction and the film does its job overall. The only thing that had me truly puzzled was why we saw the world from the Alien's POV in this film  I do not recall that having been done previously and cannot work out the theory (if any) behind this.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated IMO.......,"I Find that the fact that this Film takes Place on a Prison Planet with no way for Ripley to Defend herself, and along with being a Prison Planet the people on that planet are well.... Prisoners that means they aren't exactually Friendly or wants to Help her at first Especially after when they find out that Ripley was unknowingly reasonable for the situation that they where in. And to top it all off they see her as not only threat to their new life but also in some ways a sort of Temptation. Which is fitting considering that the Prisoners on that Planet have Taken up Religion, and I guess the Alien Xenomorph on the Planet could be Considered a Demon or even the Devil. So anyways I'm getting carried away a little, to add to the challenge of the film Unlike Aliens the Second Film they don't have Space Marines with a lot of High-Tech Weapons to help with the Aliens. Or even like the Original Alien Film where they have a Weapon at there Disposal according to the Special Edition of the film. Along with the Flamethrowers, in this film at best they have Makeshift Weapons that aren't that Effect against this particular Xenomorph Alien In My Opinion. I fact not even in the Special Edition of this film I don't even think that they even used much Makeshift Weapons or even any Weapons at all, unless you include that one pair of Sessors. And to top it off these Prisoners aren't Trained Space Soldiers or Soldiers at all. And with that Note I find that Odd Humor that some of these guys had was Great. It fits the type of Humor that guys like these would have.That goes the same for how these guys would act, is it accurate? I'm don't know but I do know is that it fits for the Movie Criminals in Prison. And speaking of Humors one of my Favorites is from the Special Edition, which is a perfect way for me to Segway in to Editions, this is the only Alien film out of the first Four Alien Films that I think that alone non of the Editions are perfect but if you some how Combine the Two Editions then it would be perfect for me at least but I guess that is kind of a minor Nip Pick. And the Only Other Negative that I could say about it is that the Planet itself feels empty it doesn't feel like there are other Prisoners on that Planet or even on Prison Complex, aside from the ones that are in the movie, and also while I'm at it the Planet doesn't feel like it could have animals Earth Animals, that doesn't really compute with me. But whatever it is what it is. But as for my final thoughts it's also nice to have a Comic that Retcons the events of this Film and Resurrection, titled Earth War, for those that aren't exactually a fan of this film and the Resurrection Film unlike myself.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just couldn't have been any worse,"*************This review may contain spoilers************** There is a rule with sequels and that is generally that they are never as good as the original. However, every once in a while a sequel comes along that is every bit as good as the original, hell, some even blow the original out of the water. This is what we got with Aliens. So, when you're making a sequel to a sequel, nay, one of the best ever sequels, it is a fairly good idea to try and keep in tone with the first two, to respect what they did.This is where Alien 3 puts its first step wrong. Aliens gave us several lovable, well developed characters who had chances of a real future in the Alien universe, particularly the protagonists surrogate daughter Newt. Now instead of continuing their story, as seems logical, Alien 3 simply kills all these lovable characters, with the exception of Ellen Ripley, within the first five minutes. This is a real kick in the teeth for any audience so to get them back on the movies ground the film is going to have to give us some really amazing characters with TOP acting. Only it doesn't. What we get is a lot of British convicts whose excuse for depth is that they have 'found God'. Now I am all for religious undertones but these are so forced down your throat that they do not feel at all natural, they are just there as an attempt at depth to these frankly unlikeable characters. On top of this, there are just too many people. What Alien and Aliens managed was to give us just enough characters so that we are able to remember who everybody is. ALien 3 gives us far too many people and this just adds to their lack of likability meaning that by the end, as a huge chase involving just one alien begins we just do not know who is still alive and, frankly, nobody cares. Even Sigourney Weaver, normally a very accomplished actress, struggles to bring Ripley, previously a likable protagonist, any sympathetic elements. She is just not the same character any more, and this is not a good thing. There are far too many petty attempts to give her character an arc that fail miserably in the face of everything that has come before. There is nothing here which touches the audience in the way the mother daughter relationship with Newt did in the last film. There are many attempts to throw in new things by the director but this is very much a case of throwing everything at the screen and seeing what sticks and, honestly, that doesn't work this time around. If I were to give this film any points I will say this. The score fits the scenes it has been designed for very well and is up to par with the previous scores in the series, perhaps even superior. The scenery also fits the tone of the film rather well. It's bleak, drab and depressing and, whilst this is one of the films main failing points, the scenery does at least fit the films overall feel. However these are minor good points in what is otherwise an awful film with poor, poor acting, too many characters and an unsympathetic protagonist. Watch the first two films for fine examples of what real, quality sci-fi can be like but ignore this turgid drag. 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A dark masterpiece,"Alien 3 does what all good final installments should do: it keeps us guessing while building upon the franchise. One could argue that Alien 3 DIDN'T build upon the franchise, in which I would argue that in a reductive way it certainly builds upon Aliens. It takes us to the next level, connecting in tone with the original, yet taking us even further down into the depths of darkness. It was very fitting for an Alien film, complete with surprises, grimness, acid and blood. The Alien franchise didn't begin upbeat, so why should it end upbeat?Directed with the same uncomfortable close-ups, fast-edits and colour-tints Fincher-fans would be familiar with from Fight Club, Alien 3 is packed full of interesting characters, symbolism and highly engaging sets. The atmosphere of the shaved convicts preaching faith while chasing the 'dragon' with fire is so fitting yet unpredictable for this franchise, that I encourage people to watch it with an open mind. Forget Fincher's qualms with this film, forget your emotional attachment to Aliens and watch Alien 3 for what it is: a film with balls. More films should be like this, and unless we want nothing but predictable sequels for the rest of our days, I suggest you rate this movie highly so we can get the score UP and writers into their next project with the encouragement to get creative.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
missed opportunity,"The movie wasn't terrible in and of itself...I think if it hadn't followed the fantastic Alien and then Aliens it wouldn't be judged quite so harshly. I saw it as a kind of return to the first movie, with the largely defenseless alien-fodder floundering about in fear, getting picked off one by one by a frightening alien creature which is obviously superior in both strength and speed.  The movie looked very good I thought, the acting was good, the story was not bad either, yet I was disappointed in a way I wouldn't have been if I hadn't first seen the other two because after watching the first two installations unfold, I was looking for the third (traditionally the last installation in a series unless you're looking to make 'Alien 4 - This Time It's Personal'...which unfortunately they actually did, thus tipping the series into foolishness) to build on the other two and send it out of the park - I thought for sure the third installation would be the horrible thing we've been threatened with in the first two movies - that the 'Company' finally got its wish and brought the Aliens back to Earth for bioweapons research, where they escaped into the populace and...ah well. It wasn't bad as it is...but if you're looking for a movie to bring the franchise home and raise the bar yet again, you'd be sorely disappointed - this is a serviceable sci-fi horror that reads a lot like the first, minus the originality.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Inferior, but its still good","In my opinion Alien 3 is not getting the respect it deserves. That being said there are obvious flaws that detract from the otherwise high quality of the film. Nevertheless, Alien 3 remains a good film and a worthy third film in a series that should have ended while they were still ahead.First and foremost I will focus on the positive sides of the film in my review as I believe they outweigh the negative sides very heavily. It is pretty clear that the third film was an attempt to go back to the basics from the first film. There is only one alien that is very different from all that we have seen before. The fact that the alien is so different gives it back its mystique and adds to the tension as you never know when it is going to show up. This brings me on to another thing I found worked very well in the film. The atmosphere. The film is nearly as atmospheric as the first film but the atmosphere is very different. The first film felt darker as the color palette was very different. Different isn't necessarily bad, however, and even with the slightly brighter colors this film are still very atmospheric and tense. The atmosphere is also achieved through brilliant set work. The sets can be both quite awe inspiring and also quite claustrophobic and it all works from where I'm standing. In fact all the sets and props work beautifully. This is largely due to the fact that David Fincher was a music video director before moving into film and this makes him very visually oriented. I felt that his new interpretation of the Alien mythology was a small breath of fresh air.The actors are mainly very good. Even though Sigourney Weaver's performance is weaker than in the previous two films she is still believable and can still portray the emotional state of her character very clearly. Especially the despair of the character. In conclusion her performance is a bit tired (I don't understand why she returned in the fourth film) but still passable. The best performance in the film belongs to Charles S. Dutton. He is perfect as the semi-reformed convict leader who is ultimately a hero. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty good. Of these especially Charles Dance and Pete Postlethwaite do very good jobs.The design of the alien is very, very good. It works brilliantly in the close-up shots but in the wider shots where you actually see it moving it seems pretty obvious that it is a puppet and that is a shame because it lessens the credibility of the film. Still its nice to see a different kind of alien that retains the frightening features of the original alien but is new as well. I was very happy that H.R Giger returned to design the alien in the third film because even though the aliens in the second film were nice they lacked something design wise and H.R Giger certainly gives that something extra to the alien design here in the third film.Where the film comes out a little short is in the actual story. The overall story is decent if a bit like the first film but with a twist. Instead of having somewhat ordinary people confront the alien we have convicts this time around and that is both a good and a bad thing. I found it to be an interesting approach that was very different from what we've seen before but the fact that they are thieves, murderers and rapists somehow makes it harder to feel for them. This of course does that its harder to feel exhilarated when the alien chases one of them. Also the fact that the film never really had fully completed screenplay did that there are a few annoying plot holes. However, the fact that there never was a fully completed screenplay also increases my respect for the director who still made this film into a highly watchable piece of cinema history.All in all the third part of the Alien series is not without its flaws but it is still a highly watchable and recommendable film to horror fanatics.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as abominable as mentioned, it's watchable but fairly mediocre","If this would really be an awful film I would not have chosen to watch it again. If you want to see awful go see the Alien vs Predator flicks. Those deserve 1/10 ratings and are simply B-movies, made without talent.But this film has interesting characters in a setting we haven't seen in the Alien films before, with more depth than any of the other films. While it's true that it doesn't help to have a leading character that is going to die for sure combined with lowlife thugs, you may not care about them. I did care about the Charles S Dutton guy and the doctor who died way too soon. They made a mistake there. Finally Ripley is a bit sexier and has a relationship with an interesting man but he's one of the first to go. And yes there are more mistakes. It does not make sense that Ripley stays alive for so long before the chest burster comes out and that she didn't drown long before that. Beyond that others have pointed out plenty of other plot holes. One thing I don't get and remains unexplained is how exactly this alien is different...yes it's smaller and has a different color...but why??? The movie lacks much of the suspense and shock moments that the first Alien had. Also, graphically, it's rather monotonous in color. David Fincher has made better films and this one is no where near as gripping as Seven.But of all the films it probably has the best acting. Weaver is brilliant in each film which is why they kept asking her, as the popular heroine Ripley she's guaranteed to generate plenty of cash for the box office and she sets an example how to portray a real strong and heroic, but still fragile and feminine character of flesh and blood (not a single actress has come even close to her performances i.m.o.). Dutton and Charles Dance are very good too.That and addiction to the Alien series with Weaver makes the film worth watching. I consider the 4th installment to be the worst, because it had too much caricatures, in this film, the people are more real and you really get the sense there is a community they live in, no matter how humble and grim.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien3 is worthy enough to be in this series,"During the production of Alien3, they ran into a lot of problems ex. filming with hardly any script, the film being too long etc.The Original Alien3 can be a huge let down but if you see the Special edition of Alien3 from the Alien set, you will see a very different cut of the film. Including a different Alien Chestburster which comes out of the ox and a new alternate ending.With the special edition version of Alien3, there is about almost 40 minutes of footage added. It shows David Fincher's true vision of Alien3 before it went into editing problems and deleted almost half of the movie.Alien3 is also a human apocalyptic tale, it is more about the humans and less about the monster, which is bad for some viewers who only like to watch the Aliens kill the humans. As well with the visuals on the computerized Alien, looks a bit too fake.Alien3 does bring out great character moments through emotions, which we have not seen in other Alien movies. This is what I believe which makes Alien3 great and unique.Even though Alien3 is no where near Aliens, it follows up more closely to the original Alien, having some scenes that might make you jump. But after seeing Aliens and then watch Alien3, You can say ""What the Hell happened?"" But if you look past the image of Aliens, you will see that Alien3 is a worthy film. Not the best in the series but worthy enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Actually incredibly good,"In 1979 Ridley Scott gave us one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made, the horrific masterpiece that was Alien. In 1986 James Cameron dished out a sequel that went a completely different direction from the first one, but was amazingly just as phenomenal, when he made Aliens. And then in 1992 David Fincher, in his very first feature film, gave us Alien 3. Poorly received, initially, this third installment in the saga continues the story of Ripley when her escape pod that her, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop escaped in at the end of Aliens crash lands on an all male prison planet. Ripley is the only survivor of the crash...or so she thinks. Soon enough the horrible xenomorph shows its face again and Ripley once again has to fight for her live while protecting those less experienced in fighting these horrible creatures.Now, a quick disclaimer. The version of Alien 3 I watched was the aptly named Assembly Cut of the film. Alien 3 was stuck in development hell for a very long time, going through a plethora of rewrites and directors. David Fincher signed on and construction began on sets before the script was even finished. Then the script changed drastically and the tons of things had to be reworked and the film was constantly changing. When everything was finally laid out Fincher put together his first cut of the film, which was two and a half hours long, and turned it into 20th Century Fox. The studio was not pleased with it and changed the film significantly. The final product that the studio released was about a half hour shorter with a totally different beginning and end. Fincher despised the reworking of his film and has since disowned this film entirely. But in 2003 when the Alien Quadirlogy box set was released on DVD Fincher's preferred Assembly Cut was included. This is the version I watched.The reason I went into so much detail is because the theatrical release of the film was very poorly received. However, the Assembly Cut that I watched was awesome. It's a truly excellent film and an awesome addition to the series. It hearkens back more to the first film, only featuring one xenomorph and focusing more on claustrophobic terror than the guns blazing action film that was Aliens. Not that Aliens didn't work unbelievably well, but I loved that Alien 3 shifted back to the suspense/horror roots of the series. Of course, this film is not as good as either of its predecessors, but still a fantastic film in its own rights.Alien 3 flows wonderfully, the characters are a lot of fun and they are very fresh archetypes in the series. The setting of the film, again, hearkens back to the setting of the first film, but now with some new and very interesting elements that you have to experience for yourself. Alien 3 is riveting and enthralling from start to finish, with Sigourney Weaver giving it her all as Ripley once again. It has its small flaws here and there, but they are far from fatal. There are some minor plot holes, the script isn't the best in the world, and the CGI is actually pretty bad at times, somewhat removing you from the experience.But, as a whole, this really is an invigorating film where you never know what will happen next. It's a film that just keeps on giving and keeps on impressing in the goriest and most exciting ways possible. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't watch Alien 3. It's not nearly as good as Alien or Aliens, but that is only because those two films are masterpieces.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"to coin a phrase, ""underrated""","Yeah I know it's starting to become as cliché to defend this movie as it is to trash it, but for what it's worth I do enjoy watching this film from time to time and it always offers something new.Mainly the nice thing here is the atmosphere - nothing like a dark and miserable labyrinth of abandoned tunnels, foundries, and prison cells alone on a miserable inhospitable planet to really set the stage for a dystopian slaughterfest, is there? Add to that an impressive cast of unsung British character actors such as Charles Dance (GOOD MORNING BABYLON), the unspellable Pete Postlethwaite, Paul McGann, and Philip Davis (THE BOUNTY)... with the added bonus that they're all bald and dirty prisoners on a bleak prison planet. Throw in an alien to kill them all and what's not to love? Directorially, Fincher threw in a lot of good surprises along the way with lots of surprisingly well-handled action sequences with an appropriate mixture of suspense and gore. I particularly enjoyed seeing a few ""squished frame"" shots and some strange staging where you don't quite know what to make of what you're looking at. There's some nice ambiguity thrown into many scenes, but never to the point where things get confusing.However, this film makes a lot of messy turns in its narrative. First off, there are just too many red herring scenes such as Newt's dissection and the bit with Ripley scouting around in the basement. They seem only to exist to pad out the running time. Secondly, it fails to really distinguish the prisoners or even solidly identify the fates of any of them during the chaotic action scenes. For instance, does anyone know what actually happens to the big guy with the meat cleaver? I've seen both versions and unfortunately they both suffer from a lot of the same problems. Overall I like the extended version as it provides a lot more insight into the life and society of the convicts, but then again the Oxen subplot is absolutely pointless.That ""pointless"" word could actually apply to the movie itself, but taken for what it is and just enjoyed for a bleak outer space horror film, ALIEN 3 actually *can* be quite enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beggars Can't Be Choosers,"Alien 3 gets put down a lot of the fans of the Alien series. I think this is mainly due to the depressing opening and sad ending. I myself love Alien 3 for that reason.To simply put: beggars can't be choosers. Whenever I watch a movie, I watch it with an open mind as to what the atmosphere will resemble and how the movie will play out. I don't go in expecting a movie to be one particular way, which may be why I like so many movies.Alien 3 takes place after Aliens left off. The surviving members of the squad in the previous film (while asleep) crash into a distant planet. No one survives except for Riply. The planet turns out to be one big prison for serial murderers and rapist, which may be another reason why the film is so reviled. You can count the number of likable characters on one hand.Sigourny Weaver (who helped quite a bit in the production of the film) plays Riply better than any other film in the entire series. She is developed as a strong character surrounded by men who would like to do nothing but rape and kill her... that is until she earns their respect.Of course, an Alien was what caused the ships crash landing. Therefore, an Alien is loose on the prison planet. The Alien in Alien 3 looks absolutely terrible. While some of it is done with excellent puppet work, there are multiple shots of the Alien done with some poorly done CGI. This not only took me out of the movie; It was downright distracting. It was obvious they were aware of this behind the scenes, as the movie is filled with more alien POV shots than you can shake a stick at. The action scenes themselves aren't that spectacular either, although there are still quite a few suspenseful scenes.The movie also relies heavily on the gross-out factor. This is a good thing and a bad thing. I know that the movie wouldn't be as enjoyable if it had less gore than what it had, but just the fact that it needed it wasn't a good thing either.To simply put: I can understand the hatred that revolves around this movie, but it's still not the worst in the series. The movie is also very good as a stand alone movie. Great performances all around.The movie falls flat when it comes to being uplifting and creating likable characters, but it still gets a recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Absolutely, totally horrid idea for a movie","After the first and second films in this series, I was amazed at Alien 3, a film with a plot so totally banal that one is just left without speech. Here we have a monster loose on a prison colony killing off a bunch of murderers and rapidsts condemned to life imprisonment. Who is the audience supposed to root for, the killers or the monster, and which is the monster, the alien or the murderers it is killing off? And why would anybody care? As good as Aliens was, this is just as completely horrid. Not the worst movie ever made, but it is a waste of time to watch. Instead of sitting through this dreadful bomb, go watch the original or Aliens again.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't give it a pass,"Sure, it's the lowest rated in the franchise but there's still a lot to really like about it.

Worst sequel ever made?,"""Alien"" was a relentlessly bleak, beautifully atmospheric masterpiece of horror and dread, one of the few truly adult examples of the science fiction genre. Its sequel, ""Aliens,"" was far less disturbing, aiming more for visceral, action-movie thrills; nonetheless, it was still a powerhouse of a movie, especially in its wonderful ""special edition"" laserdisc incarnation. The notorious ""Alien 3,"" on the other hand, is an utterly miserable failure, certainly the most insultingly juvenile follow-up to a good movie since the equally terrible ""Return of the Jedi."" From its hopelessly rushed, sloppily edited opening title sequence, to its endless, murky ""alien-cam"" chase finale, ""Alien 3"" consists of nothing more than a shocking series of miscalculations on the part of the filmmakers, who manage to create not even one moment of suspense, horror or thrills in nearly two hours of MTV-styled tedium. Particularly frustrating (and embarrassing) for the viewer is watching Sigourney Weaver and Lance Henriksen, two great performers, struggle to create anything interesting with their underwritten characters; both fail horribly. Even ""Alien 4"" looks great in comparison to this, possibly the worst sequel ever made.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A huge waste of celluloid,"I'm surprised that a lot of comments about this film were positive. I almost envy the people who liked Alien 3. I really wish I could have enjoyed this movie, but instead it ticked me off like no other film. Here are the reasons why I hated it:1) Hicks and Newt were killed off in the very beginning!why couldn't Fincher further develop their relationship with Ripley? They could've AT LEAST have been killed at the end.2) The Alien looks really fake and has too much screen time. It was a rod puppet blue-screened into the action, but it resembles jerky stop-motion.3) Where's the weapons? Unlike the first two there's no flame- throwers or machine guns to kick butt.4) I didn't care about the other chrome-domed characters. They might as well have been those expendable red-shirted ensigns on Star Trek. All in all, it left me cold.",,Anonymous,Horror
Eh,"Alien Cubed is probably the weakest of the original Alien series (I'm treating Prometheus and Alien: Convenant as something separate). The prison setting was new but didn't add much to the story as it just becomes another claustrophobic slasher. The action and tension are good, just not new.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fincher attempts to re-introduce the claustrophobia of Ridley Scott's masterful original,"If James Cameron's Aliens (1986) had not gone before Alien 3 then David Fincher's take on Alien (1979) would be quite a good movie as he attempts to re-introduce the claustrophobia of Ridley Scott's masterful original by setting it on a distant, run down, maximum security prison with a colony full of dangerous criminals and reprobates which Ripley crash lands into after escaping the aliens from the first sequel.However despite having a talented visual director on board, Sigourney Weaver co-producing, a good supporting cast and gory physical effects it fails to fully engage. We don't care about the characters as much as we should do and the script doesn't delve deep enough into the prison scenario and the captives we find there where Ripley has crash landed. It has been well documented that the production went through many script changes with millions being spent on unused sets and with much studio interference.The biggest problem however is how audience expectations are immediately deflated when we see much of James Cameron's work being dismantled before our very eyes. The tone and feel of Cameron's sequel is gone and we're left feeling empty and disappointed before things even get started.This underlying problem plagues the film because there's plenty of visual creativity, good acting and alien creatures on display, it just somehow misses the mark. Maybe it's because of chaos behind the scenes that hampered proceedings as there are many stories of Fincher trying to get the job done under extreme pressure from nervous studio execs who threatened to fire Fincher several times, demand re-shoots and reject his cut of the film, something no one would think of doing nowadays as he is a well respected and established filmmaker who has proved himself with modern masterpieces like Seven and Fight Club, but at this stage he was just a music video director that couldn't be trusted by the head honchos at 20th Century Fox.Lance Henriksen is woefully underused as Bishop, one of the few characters that remain from Aliens, but once you get past it's shortcomings and realise this is never going to be on par with Cameron's blockbuster it's still an enjoyable and worthy sequel even if it lacks the tension and shock value of the original that Fincher was trying to recreate against the odds.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where the story should've ended.,"Alien's third outing was handed over to David Fincher after the disappointing stewardship of James Cameron. He's got to do better, surely? Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) really does have some terrible luck. If you ever find yourself on a spaceship with her, get out immediately. This time she crash lands on an oil refining planetary prison camp, where a young and moody looking Clemens (Charles Dance) finds her washed up on the desolate gloomy beach. Water, breathable air, once again not that spacey. She's the only survivor, both Hicks and Newt perish, but that's probably best... Newt has had a face-hugger for company. The small shaven headed prison colony is a religious cult like group, with some genuinely interesting characters. Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) is darkly calm and spiritual, Andrews (Brian Glover) the superintendent, more authoritative. Clemens, the doctor with a past, is the nice one. They live harmoniously, prisoners and staff, until Ripley arrives. Well her and the inevitable Alien. Honestly, terrible luck. The look and feel is much more dystopian. The shaved heads help and Weaver pulls it off well. Shaving her head was seen as a big deal at the time, how times have changed. She's the only woman on the planet and creates a bit of a stir, but that's quickly forgotten once the deaths begin. Ripley knows what's starting again, but is cagey to share until she's sure. Where Aliens dove straight in with the gung-ho macho rubbish. This is much more patient. It's not shy on the gore when we get to it, but some proper care has been taken to set the scene. As a rebooted Bishop (Lance Henriksen) is filling Ripley in on what happened to her in hyper-sleep, her suspicions are confirmed. Just as psychotic inmate Golic (Paul McCann), is being blamed for the rising bodycount. On Ripleys first encounter with her nemesis here, it's clear... something is different. They've no weapons to fight the Alien, nothing really works in their world of clanging metal, it's back to basics with fire and baited traps. For all its simplicity though, the characters keep it ticking. As some die, others pick up the narrative, although Pete Postlethwaite as David is criminally underused. Ripley faces a fight from within, as the inmates face moral dilemmas to test their faith. It still doesn't match the pure sci-fi horror of Alien, but as an action thriller, to its credit it leans heavier on the latter. The camera work is lovely. The Alien perspective shots, although a bit 90s, are very effective. Weaver once again carries it, but Dutton is great too, as are the supporting cast with only a few exceptions. After Aliens dropped the ball, this feels like a more worthy conclusion and it's probably where the story should've stopped.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fitting end to the trilogy,"Alot of people have a problem with this entry especially coming off it's Superior predecessor. But instead of trying to top that film it creates a new experience more in the spirit of the original. The unfortunate Ellen Ripley crash lands on a desolate prison planet, the only survivor after the last films events. There are only a handful of prisoners there with a warden, medical officer and a preacher of sorts. Upon arriving she begins to search for the reason why he crashed and discovers the horrible truth the infamous xenomorph was responsible and has followed her to her location. Once there monstrous extraterrestrial bonds with an ox and than a canine taking a slightly different form. Once again she has to face it down and save as many people as possible. I appreciate the theatrical cut but the extended is where it's all at. For some odd reason they decided to cut all the action out of the film and it makes a huge difference pace wise. The performances from Sigourney Weaver and Charles Dutton are award worthy. To say that powerful is a definite understatement. The story really rounds itself out perfectly. Bringing a respectable end to Ripley's saga. The practical effects are impressive but the cgi doesn't hold up. All in all the movie is a criminally underrated piece of cinema. Directed stylishly by a young David Fincher it's ambitious in its scope and inspired in its execution.Budget: $50m

Fincher singlehandedly destroys what could have been a great series,"It is very rare that I rate a movie as low as I rate Aliens3 (one star out of ten).  There are lots of bad sequels in the history of film making, so that in itself is not unusual.  Yet it wasn't enough for David Fincher to make a mound of garbage such as this, in the process he felt it necessary to completely obliterate the Alien movies by totally disregarding everything that had come before his film.  I'm not saying he had to make the same kind of movie as the previous two films, but to kill two main characters in the first five minutes of a sequel, two characters that we had invested so much time in in Aliens, and to do it without blinking an eye is not only inexcusable, but makes Alien 3 so downbeat from the start, it's hard to care one iota about what comes afterward.  The closest thing I can compare it to would be if George Lucas had killed Princess Leia And Han Solo in the opening scroll of The Empire Strikes Back.As if all this wasn't bad enough, there is not one character in this movie that we care about or gives us any reason to care about them.  They are just there to supply food fodder for the Aliens when they decide to pop out and move the plot along.  Then again, we see so little of any of the characters as Fincher decided not only to make a ""dark film"" but to film it in the dark as well.  I guess this is what one calls atmosphere.  I call it covering up your big boo boo.Poor Sigourney Weaver.  She does try.  Yet we know so far in advance what is going to happen to Ripley, that we are not shocked or saddened by it.  We only know that after the hell she went through in the first two films, she sure deserved a lot better than this mess.When you singlehandedly destroy a great series, you get a one rating, and you get that one because I can't give you a zero.

Not very good.,"**Sorry for some spelling-misstakes** (Please read my reviews of ''Alien'' and ''Aliens'' too) This is the worst Alien-movie. Fincher tries to mix the dark feeling in the first movie with the 100 % action of ''Aliens''. I'm sorry Dave, it's simply doesn't work. OK, OK. I can admit it. It is entertaining at some points, but it is just because ''Alien 3'' is more of a copy of the other movies. Now, whats wrong with that picture? Everything is stolen from the other movies and you don't feel as amused of anything any more. The actors was really, really good but that can't save the bad script and the direction. I ( as a pure movielover ) will forever be gratefull for Fincher's job with ''Se7en''. This is though not one of his better movies.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Okay, but not Great","His firm hand of creative direction is not there as the actors visibly struggle. Sigourney Weaver is okay but doesn't mesh well with a cast that just doesn't cradle her character; they have no idea what she has been through in the first two films and how tough she is. For some reason too she is very cryptic about her past, and reveals little information about the alien situation. Why wouldn't she just tell them the truth?The relationships she does form with the cast are shaky and forced. Almost every character ends up dead, but it doesn't matter because we didn't know them anyway.As Fincher's first major feature film, the style of Alien 3 bears the least resemblance to his other films. It is his most inexpertly made film. AKA, his worst film, technically anyway. I still prefer Aliens 3 to The Social Network any day, but after investigating the production of this film I came to realize that Fincher was not totally responsible for the lackluster film that made it to theatres.When David Fincher was brought into direct Alien 3, it was after another director had already begun production, and was fired. There was not even a finished script. As one contributor wrote in the IMDb Alien 3 FAQs about, Fincher ""was forced to effectively write, shoot, and edit the film, all at the same time. There were millions of dollars worth of sets built and many takes and scenes had already been shot. Twentieth Century Fox insisted Fincher incorporate these into his production to save money.The shadows of the masterminds behind the first two Alien films, Ridley Scott and James Cameron, must have been looming over the production, because as Fincher completed a rough cut of film, Twentieth Century Fox panicked. They began started dictating that certain things were going to have to be re-shot in certain ways, essentially stripping Fincher of all creative control. He would eventually walk away from the film. The version that was released in theatres was his rough draft, completed by a new crew in LA.In 2003 editor David Crowther took up the task of assembling what was of the original draft, and re-edited it in a way he though was most likely the way the Fincher version would have turned out. This release was called the Assembly Cut (I have yet to see it).All that drama of the film's production aside, the story had real potential. Even following Cameron's greatness on Aliens (1986), enough time has past that Cameron's production was no longer fresh, and this third installment could have made a significant contribution to the series. The idea of a pod crashing on a giant prison planet bringing with it an alien that threatens to wipe out all life there, and possibly even all mankind is a cool idea, right? What would have become of this rough draft had studio execs not meddled? All we'll ever have is the Assembly Cut.The most modern incarnation of the Alien series lives on in the amazing contemporary film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, and on November 27th, 2015 the second installment of the Prometheus series is set be released with both Ridely Scott and Jack Pagen, the man who wrote Prometheus 1 involved.

It is inevitable that making a 2nd sequel that the originality will suffer, and Alien 3 is no exception. Still entertaining, but carried by the presence of Signourney Weaver.

Meh... aliens vs prisoner cell block H,"In a vain and desperate attempt to further extend the ""Aliens"" cinematic universe, this third film feels a little rushed and under developed. In a true reflection of the 90's it's a lot of style over substance which unfortunately counts against the film, when held up against its excellent predecessors.Crash landing on planet Fiorina 161, Ripley is once again the sole survivor to escape from an Alien encounter - nee the last film. She finds that this planet is a male penitentiary/ mining colonized world so instantly she doesn't fit in, the lack of a penis being one of the main issues. While being held and supervised within the colony until a rescue ship is sent to collect her, strange things start to happen, mysterious deaths and random faults. It seems that an alien managed to get on-board the escape vessels that brought Ripley to the planet that Alien is slowly gaining size and strength as it works its way through the colony. Being part penitentiary there are no weapons on the planet yet survival is the aim at Ripley and the colony do their best to hold out until rescuers arrive.So why does this film not rate as highly as the first two films? That's a strange conundrum. The acting in the film is great, with so many gritty (and British) actors on display the only person that occasionally comes across as cheesy is at time Sigourney Weaver herself - but that's not because it's a bad performance, its more just a case that she stands out at an occasionally witty and upbeat American surrounded by so many hard faced and gritty male performances. The visuals likewise don't bring the film down, there are still moments of shock and horror, there are definitely scares, and nothing really looks out of place anywhere. Maybe the thing that brings the film down is actually the grittiness; it feels like a bleakness is been forced onto the audience. If the first two films gave the excitement of a chase with the potential to survive, this film tells you that there is nowhere to run and not a great deal you can do - almost like you have lost before you have started, and the only thing you can do is to prepare for the eventual doom. The pace and flow of the film also made enjoyment difficult - with director duties given to David Fincher this film relies on dialogue, but it seems that in attempt to deliver good dialogue action is sacrificed - which was a solidifying factor for the first two films. It's probably fair to say, if it wasn't for the first two films, this film as a stand-alone film would probably be received better - as it was though the expectation that was created after the first two films was let down in this film. Some bad decisions and bad ideas made the film a little sloppy - killing off fellow survivor at the very start of the film, the editing choices which cut up action when it needs to be explored further, a soundtrack that troughs and peaks at wrong times. Having enjoyed other Fincher films I find it difficult to put the blame onto him, he was working with a script and concept that wasn't his, you can see his input with the way the film feels bleak and gritty. Unfortunately you can also see the studio influence in the way that certain things need to be formulaically copied in order for audiences to like this, and that makes it feel like it isn't entirely an auteur driven ship - which could be part of the reason why it's choppy, editing isn't on tee, and the feel of the situation varies more than it should.I'd still give this a 6, but it is a massive drop in the franchise of Alien films and rather than add something to the cannon, it seems to weaken it's magnitude a little bit.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as people say,"Look; it doesn't hold a candle to the previous two instalments. That is clear. Alien is arguably the greatest sci fi horror ever made and Aliens is one of the best sequels ever. Alien 3 was always going to be tough.I have always quite liked it though.I saw an interview with Sigourney Weaver back when Alien 3 was released where she described aliens and a rollercoaster ride and Alien 3 like being trapped in a closet with the xenomorph. I like that analogy.Obviously this movie was beset with production issues and ended up not really being the movie David Fincher wanted but still, I don't think it's all that bad.I like the setting, I like the third act, all that running through the tunnels is pretty stressful. I like it a lot.Things not to like include just doing away with newt and hicks in the opening credits. How did an egg get on board? Why are there two 'birth' scenes; one with a dog and one with an ox? And there's a line from Ripley ""you've been in my life so long I can't remember anything else"" which makes little sense.

The neglected Alien isn't as awful as you think.,"In truth newbie director (at the time) David Fincher's Alien 3 is a far more faithful sequel to the original film than Aliens was, which was essentially an especially brilliant space creature shoot 'em up when you think about it. Alien 3 shares many similar elements with the original, many hapless outmatched victims in a confined space being hunted down by a single-minded killing machine, and despite the undeniable similarities with the first film I think Fincher brings enough new elements and flourishes to the table to make Alien 3 worthwhile, and in snippets compelling viewing – even though when you think about it all the Alien films are basically space monster films.Taking place immediately, only decades after the events of Aliens – but decades in hypersleep – the escape pod harbouring Lt Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Newt, Hicks and Bishop crash-land on Fury 161, a remote prison planet with a staff/inmate population of about 25ish. After all the sh*t they went through in Aliens only Ripley survives, which if you think about it means she would have been infinitely better off declining that mission in the first place as she wisely did initially.Ripley comes to to find that as well as being the only survivor of the last mission, she is now surrounded by various rapists, murderers and plain old nasty types. The fact that the planet is also infested with lice and that all inhabitants must routinely shave their heads bald just seems unfair.The early stages find Ripley coming to terms with her situation and taking steps to discover is there were *other* stowaways on board the escape pod, including a graphic-without-being-graphic autopsy of young deceased Newt, carried out by Fury 161's Doc Clemens (Charles Dance), who Ripley swiftly decides to be one of the only sane and non-dangerous members of her new community, leading to the first scene involving nudie hijinks in an Alien film, even though there is no on screen shenanigans.The remainder of the inmates have not so much as seen a fully functional woman in decades, and some harbour nefarious thoughts toward her – even when Weaver is mannish to begin with and bald to boot! Sensing this the Head of the facility Andrews immediately requests an evac of Ripley off the planet, and is astonished to find that his request is not only acknowledged but fast tracked.So with the impending pick up looming all that is left is for Ripley to stay put and keep out of the way of those that might do her harm.But that's before the inmates start to go missing.In desperation Ripley consults the remaining half of Bishop who was unceremoniously dumped on a scrap heap, using him to hack into the escape pod's onboard black box to ascertain if they were truly alone. Now if you don't think the fact that the film is called ""Alien 3"" is a clue to the answer then stop reading this and go and bang your head against the wall for a couple hours.Back to the action; in any case the new lone Alien grows and develops quickly. Very quickly. It soon learns that it is there for one reason only, that being to chew through each and every inhabitant on the prison planet. Hey you gotta stick with what you know I guess.Once Ripley realizes that they are not alone she starts delivering warnings left and right. As is always the case with these films the warnings are taken as they usually are until the Alien starts a'chomping.The rest of the film has Ripley and the various riff-raff of staff and inmates standing around wondering who is to be picked off next and saying ""F*CK"" a lot. In fact that word is uttered so frequently and so forcefully in this film that I can't help but wonder if the crew had a competition to see who could deliver the line with the most conviction – and spittle.Alien 3 is not particularly gory or violent, with a couple of notable exceptions in the latter stages of the film, but even in the early going David Fincher knew that a trickle of blood can go a long way and provoke as many squirms as any graphic on screen violence. There are a great many speeches in this film, with various characters getting their shot at standing up and delivering impassioned demands with impressive musical accompaniment – often just before they are chomped on. Ripley is a little less 'hands on' in this film, what with only one Alien to face, and a special little secret of her own to deal with.I was impressed with the dinginess and depressing elements of Alien 3, there was none of the flashiness, snappy dialogue or hooky elements of Aliens – which by no means results in this film being better, just different – I liked the adherence to tone and the willingness of the actors to get down and dirty, and again the acting is quite solid for a space monster movie.This might be the worst of the first three Alien movies (it slaughters Alien: Resurrection), but it is not the lame duck that the critics and punters have made it out to be over the years.Final Rating – 8 / 10. A return to the thematic and plot elements of the first Alien means a change of tempo and style, but when considered on its own merits Alien 3 is still a fine – albeit familiar – film for fans of the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Worst Ever Alien Film Without James Cameron That Refrained Me From Watchin Alien Resurrection,"I am going straight to the point. This movie is pure garbage. It plunges deep down into the ravine full of rotten tomatoes and maggot-filled pies. It is that bad.I have been a true fan of the Alien franchise after being exposed to Aliens 1 & 2 many years ago when I was still a kid in high school. Just lately, I got the Aliens trilogy(1, 2 & 3) and didn't consider Alien Resurrection(4) as I read Sigourney Weaver was not in it and the quality of the movie sucks. I am relieved that I didn't get the 4th instalment after watching the 3rd one just yesterday night.Without James Cameron, the movie seriously lacks quality and depth. The storyline was poor and the acting was terrible. I don't know why the director of this movie chose to focus on the bandits in the prison this time but the vulgarity used in the movie pretty much killed the entire film.

A Very Underrated Sequel (This is a review for the Assembly cut.),"Alien 3 is one of the most controversial sequels of all times. A lot of people hate this film for reasons I don't agree with. Alien 3 is a really well done Sci-Fi horror film. It makes the first 3 films come full circle and is a great ending. I will admit, I still like Alien: Resurrection but, I prefer this one. I think if people just watched it for what it was instead of complaining about the dark tone, dead characters, Ripley making love to the doctor or other silly things like that. The cinematography is fantastic, the storyline is very interesting and brave and I found the cast to be very good. I really, REALLY like this movie and it is in my list of my top 100 favorite films of all time. Which is saying something because I have seen a LOT of films.Overall: 3.5 / 4 StarsExplantation of the Ratings: 4/4 = Masterpice, One of the best films ever made. 3.5/4 = Great, A very well done movie. 3/4 = Good, An enjoyable, solid effort. 2.5/4 = OK, it has its moments. 2/4 = Average, nothing special but, not terrible. 1.5/4 = Bad, a large amount of problems, not enjoyable. 1/4 = Awful, a poorly made, bad experience. 0.5/4 = Abysmal, a train wreck. 0/4 = Horrendous, one of the worst films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dog Alien?,"I thought both Alien and Aliens were very good films. I had heard many reviewers state that Alien 3 is by far the worst of the entire Alien series and a terrible film. For the most part those reviewers were correct.Basically Ripley winds up a planet that is a prison for criminals. During the ship landing while she was asleep, Newt and Hicks both died. An alien managed to sneak aboard the ship and infects a dog and creates a new dog alien that starts to cause problems for everyone on this planet.First off, I have to say that the story and acting were particularly bad. Why on Earth did this prison planet have NO FREAKING WEOPONS ON IT! It made the conflict somewhat more interesting but that idea is super dumb. Also none of the supporting characters were really that interesting. I did not like how they killed off Hicks and Newt right off the bat. There is no doubt that they just killed them off because they could not get the actors that played them to appear in this film.Sigourney Weaver is pretty good as Ripley in this film, but she always is good. Still, this is her worst performance I think and I blame more of it on a bad director and script then I do on her. It is like Simon Cowell once said to a bad contestant on American Idol, ""Coaching you would be like coaching a one legged person to a gold medal in the one hundred meter dash."" If the script and plot is bad, the acting will often suffer as a result.The Alien is OK. It is kind of cool how it emerged from a different animal, this time a dog. It gets in some good action, but since the rest of the film was so bad, it really was not worth the wait at all. Also the whole alien point of view shots were kind of stupid because it made the alien seem to move much slower than they appear to in the film.So, bad plot and bad characters. Sigourney Weaver is OK and so is the alien, but I do not recommend this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
the worst in the series,"Its not Weaver's fault. This movie has its moments but the alien effects were computerized which sucked since its 1st 2 movies didn't use computer generating. There wasn't much action in this one. D. Fincher really flopped on this one as this is his worst movie yet. C. Dutton has a good role & L. Henriksen returns as Bishop. The ending was sad & also fake, i hate when u can easily tell a fake scene when u see one. Sudden Death had some & so did Body Snatchers. well its worth a look but its quite dissapointing.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Expected Awful, Ended Up With Meh","This film clearly gets a lot of hate. I expected a dumpster fire. Surprisingly ended up finding some good kernels of a film hidden under quite a bit of blandness. Rewatchability is pretty low, in my opinion, unlike others of the series. But I give a solid 6.5",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Resurrection at least,"OK, don't hate me for this, but I enjoyed Alien 3 more than Alien Resurrection. There's something I about this one that makes me enjoy it more over Alien 4, but I don't even know what it is. Either way, Alien 3 was still a disappointment, but at least it HAD an alien in it. Alien 4's ""aliens"" weren't aliens, they were cloned monsters. That's not what the franchise was made for. Alien 3 showed the ""what if"" alien, as in, what if the Xenos came out of a different animal instead of a human being. I thought it was a smart change. This new Xenos had a more ""killer instinct"" then the ones from Aliens. However, Alien and Aliens will always be on the top of the board. 1) Aliens. 2) Alien. 3) Alien 3. 4) Alien Resurrection. That's how I see it. This one is still bad, but I would rather watch this over Resurrection.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A classic, despite the Hell it went trough.","Alien 3 is probably one of the most interesting topics in cinema, since it went through so many changes and the final product is still to this day of questionable quality. Some people say it ruined the franchise forever, others (like me) see it for what it truly is - a thrilling story and an authentic Alien experience.First of all, the soundtrack is amazing yet underrated. Sigourney Weaver is as always a magnificent actress, despite the major story changes, which are up for a very long debate, she manages to make Ripley even more of a badass woman then she already is. She is the star of this movie, while other characters vary from likeable to ""who was that again?"". The script is good, even though some of the plot holes may raise some questions about how well Alien 3 manages to keep up with continuity. To put it straight, the story isn't as well written as it's predecessors, but it still manages to make you fall in love even more with the xenomorph mythology, and of course give you some scares.Yes, it could never reach the greatness of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", but it didn't kill the franchise. Even the fourth movie didn't kill it, but this is a topic for another conversation. David Fincher did his best to put this movie together, and many people will agree, that he successfully did just that. The Assembly Cut of the movie is the version you should be looking out for, since that is the closest thing we have of his original vision of the movie.The movie deserves criticism, but it really isn't the disaster many people say it is. Definitely give it a chance.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The weakest one thus far but still good enough.,"My wife and I decided to rewatch all the Alien movies but this time in chronological order and not by release date. So this third Alien movie is actually the second last of the entire franchise. Not the best one but still good enough for an evening of easy entertainment. No Ridley Scott or James Cameron this time but David Fincher as the director. Another director with some good movies in his résumé. The reason I thought this one was the weakest one thus far is that the typical biomechanical and futuristic scenes were lesser present, and as a fan of H. R. Giger, the Swiss artist responsible for the Alien artwork, I was just hoping for more of that kind of sceneries. Add to that that the story wasn't really in space and not as good as the other movies. Some special effects were also of lesser quality, which shouldn't be as it's 1992 and technology improved compared to the first movies. But it's still a movie worth watching, certainly if you're a fan of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Torn from its director like a chest burster in a bad mood...,"'Alien³' had so much potential, yet so much to live up to.  The first film in the series helped define a whole new way to give a mass audience science fiction on a grand scale, while the second film managed to provide even more thrills and spills than a sequel had ever done.  How on earth was a third movie, all those years later, supposed to live upto its predeccessors?It appears this movie was cursed from day one.  The script was written, rewritten and rewritten time and time again, and the director, who has since gone on to prove his incredible talent with the likes of 'Fight Club' and 'Se7en', was effectively fired from the project and not allowed the reshoots he needed from a studio that attempted to control his every shot.What was originally released in 1992 was a confused mess.  It showed obvious potential, but lacked any sense of direction and purpose.  Sub plots started and were abandoned, and entire scenes appeared disjointed.As it stands, the theatrical version is by far not the worst film I've ever seen, and I enjoyed it from time to time, but on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd have given it no more than a 5 - a sort of mindless popcorn fodder to pass two hours every few years.The new 'special edition', released in the 'Alien Quadrilogy' boxed set, and now on dvd, restores a great number of scenes, finishes off some of the abandoned effects shots, and fleshes out a previously hollow film.  The movie now has purpose - its religious and moral message a lot more understandable, characters make more sense, and while nothing can be done to improve on the lack of any real action, part of the need for that is simply because the previous film in the series was an all out frag-fest.A lot of people are put off by the film because its dialogue-heavy, there's no guns or big weapons to splatter aliens with... indeed there's only one alien as opposed to a planet of them... and most of the cast are British. The trick is that if you're going to compare it to any of the series, compare it to 'Alien', while 'Alien Ressurection' is the real sequel to 'Aliens'.  Don't go into it expecting another action fest, and approach it with an open mind(preferably a British one - I guess we 'get it' easier), and there is much to enjoy.  The cast are all excellent - some of England's finest actors are on show here, and Sigourney Weaver is excellent as ever. Her final scene, notably different in this version of the film [though arguably this is the one change that isn't needed!], is surprisingly poignant, and the film still manages to pack a fair punch for a [then] 13 year old saga.Do yourself a favour - get hold of a copy of the special edition, and look at it with an open mind - you just may find yourself loving this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A shadow of the first two.,"Ripley crash lands in a male prison, and has brought an unwelcome guest along with her.Whether you're someone who favours the original, or the follow up, one thing is clear, this third one isn't a patch on either.I seemed to remember this one being alright, but after forcing myself to stick with it last night, I came away feeling somewhat irritated, you can see that production of this film was troubled, it's so muddled, does it want to be a thriller, a horror or an action movie, it's just a a bit Jumbled.I've always felt that this film lacks any sort of tension, at times it's painfully dull, then when you finally get some action, the characters are so bland, so hard to like, that you just don't really care, I found myself losing interest.The only highlight for me, Charles Dance, who does at least try and add a little bit of credibility to this absolute clunker of a film, he deserved better.The biggest failing, that hideous CGI alien, which of course looks diabolical now, but didn't look much better at the time, somehow the earlier films look more advanced.Tough to get through.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
pretty good,"Alien 3 was okay, but it lacked the suspense and thrills of the two before it. They tried the use of computer effects with not much great skill, so some special effects seem a little cheesy. Sigourney Weaver gives a great performance as Ripley. The ending is very good because it shows the sacrifice she must make in order to wipe out this species.Alien 3 gives a very different scenario, but everything is very confusing. The director didn't know what he was doing. The acting is good, but it didn't have as much action that made the other two so great. However, it's a good installment of the series, letting you feel the pain and emotion of Ripley as she loses everything she ever cared for.I recommend Alien 3, but I can't guarantee or think you'll like it better than Alien and Aliens.Rating: 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A different take on the same beast..,I saw this at the cinema upon release going into the cinema with no expectations.. Coming from David Fincher who I'd not known of at the time I didn't know what to expect.. It has a very mixed cast with the best of British including the amazing Charles Dance and Pete Postlethwaite and Ralph Brown and Paul McGann.. With Lance Henriksen and Charles S Dutton from the States. Personally I loved this movie it has everything you could possibly want from an Alien movie. The films tension is always first and foremost and keeps you on your toes. I mean you know what to expect but this movie does it all on its own and stands out from the Alien franchise. The script is very good and the fact that it's pretty much lead by an English cast makes it that much better. For me it has everything you could want from an Alien movie and I'd like to point out that the films soundtrack is amazing by Elliot Goldenthal and it was his first mainstream score and it really stands out. I think that the franchise should of finished with this movie but unfortunately we have Alien Resurrection to follow this..To finish I have very fond memories of this movie and always watch it when it's on. I used to have the whole film on tape cassette which I listened to over and over as a teenager. Probably why I know the film word for word.. Absolutely love it..,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ripley's Believe It or Not!,"""Alien 3"" is the third of four films based on the alien theme starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This one was filmed in the UK and was directed by David Fincher.At the close of ""Aliens"" (1986) Ripley escapes the alien attacks along with the little girl ""Newt"" and Cpl. Hicks and what's left of the android Bishop. ""Alien 3"" opens as the shuttle carrying them separates from the mother ship and lands on, of all places, a penal colony. Only Ripley survives and Bishop is relegated to the garbage.Ripley discovers that she is the only female on the colony. She is befriended and ultimately bedded by the colony doctor, Clemens (Charles Dance). She begins to suspect that there may have been a stowaway aboard her shuttle. She hooks up the remains of Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and learns that indeed one of the alien creatures had been aboard. Then the carnage starts. One by one the convicts begin to disappear. The rest organize under Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) and with Ripley set about to destroy the creature. And as luck would have it, there are no weapons in the colony.Blood and guts literally abound in this movie. Rather than build the suspense as the two previous films had done, this one is wall to wall violence. It's sort of a Friday the 13th in outer space. Mind you it is well done if you like gratuitous violence. Director Fincher does save a couple of surprises for us at the end.It's another of Ripley's Believe It or Not adventures.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing,"Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is the sole survivor when the ship ejects the pods onto Fiorina ""Fury"" 161. Hicks and Newt both died. Bishop is unrepairable. It's a prison planet for male prisoners with some having taken vows of celibacy. They have no weapons. The company still has an agenda.This grumpy movie has a steamy moody atmosphere. It starts bad and ends bad. It's a real disappointment to have Newt and Hicks killed off so perfunctory. I understand the difficulty of find a Newt clone but was Michael Biehn busy? Even if these actors are unavailable, the characters could be saved by having them survive in a coma. One never know if they could be used in the next sequel. I think disappointing is the most apt description of this movie.The kills aren't as exciting. Neither is the premise. The fact is there isn't any rooting interest in any of the characters other than Ripley. Charles S. Dutton is the only other actor I like. They might as well be all Paul Reisers. The chase through the tunnels aren't tense. The layout isn't explained. About the only thing interesting is the moody atmosphere. It's trying to be a sexual psychological thriller. Fincher was only a music video director at the time. It does show his potential and visual certainty.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
An under-appreciated sequel,"I started my IMDb account to review this film, and to through some positive air into the mix.Alien 3 is not the action-packed sequel that was ""Aliens"". It's a return to the thriller/horror genre that was the first film.I can't understand why people don't like this film. The acting is excellent, the sets are perfect to a T, the rod puppetry that brigs the Alien to life is superb. Even the plot, which could be better, is interesting.Besides, while it isn't as good as the first two films, it is better than all following installments in the franchise (Alien Resurrection, Alien vs Predator 1+2.) This movie is given a lot less credit than it deserves, and is a fitting ending to the Alien series. (This is the ending. Resurretion was a hallucination had by fans of the series.)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't tell me about production problems,"The essence of a good review is not to give people a lecture on the making of a movie. It is to tell people if the movie is good or bad. The sordid production history of this POS should not influence in any way your opinion about its quality. We should always look at the end result, and in the case of Alien3 it is one of the worst sequels ever made. The script is incredibly dull with lots of plot holes and drag, the actors' performances are poor, Weaver is really really bad, the effects are atrocious even for a movie from 1992 (compared to brilliant contemporary movies such as Terminator 2 or Jurassic Park), and there is not a single moment of suspense in the entire movie. A shoddy piece of horror fiction that should have never been released, but the greedy studio couldn't keep their hands of this great Sci-Fi Duology.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
my favorite of the four,"I have to agree with a lot of the comments already made. If this film was not connected to the first two it would be considered a classic. I read that it was more popular in Europe than in America, which would make sense to me. Everyone I know loves Aliens and thinks I'm crazy to like A3, but I find the characters in Aliens to be comical caricatures. Newt was such a horrid idea on top of that.That said, Alien 3 is my favorite of the series. I love the setting, both as a plot idea and for how great the cinematography is. This really is more of a drama with action. I much prefer dramas to action films, which while sometimes entertaining, too often trade off good writing and character development for eye candy/mind gum.A3 is the way it should be: dark and primitive, man faced with a seemingly inconquerable enemy, armed only with his wits and his courage. I find that much more entertaining than watching a handful of ""Marines"" wildly spraying gunfire.",,Anonymous,Horror
Ripley strikes again!,"Alien³ is very good movie, Ripley is again involved with the Alien, but this time the Alien is inside her, oh no!

Alien vs Studio,"I've read some heavy criticism of this movie before I had seen it. When I did see it, I was not particularly impressed. I had Alien and Aliens on videotape and somehow they got stolen.So when the Quadology became available reduced from £70 to £15 with the Theatrical Releases as well as the Directors cut versions and all the making of documentaries I thought what a bargain.I feel sorry for the first time director on this movie as the whole plot of the third movie sounded ridiculous in the first place and sounded more a like a comic-book short story.The studio constantly wanting and making changes to the script on a daily basis and interfering with the shoot itself, would and could not let Mr Fincher direct the film the way he wanted to.After repeated watching, the final version of the film if it were not a sequel would, I feel not stand up as film on it's own. It's too dark and slow moving and the other ""monsters"", i.e. the prisoners you really only just start to know them when they start dying.Give it whirl though. You might enjoy it like Marmite or Vegamite, I say yuk, you may say yummy.Men in Suits eh?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Disappointing Outcome, Even More So After Such a Blast That I Had With the Previous One!","Alien 3, directed by David Fincher is a cumbersome mixture of Action and Horror that doesn't land well nor the underwhelming storyline impresses much. A monotonous tonality of the writing just diminishes its hidden potential.After having consecutive sessions of the two previous films of the series, I jumped right into it.
As per my expectations, I was slightly disappointed in the end as I had a blast watching the second part i.e. ""Aliens"" by James Cameron; Finishing that, I was longing for more.The story follows Ripley to a New Planet named ""Fiorina 161"" that is supposedly a maximum security prison for criminals. An abandoned and deserted facility that no one from the agency back at the earth cares for.
Now when the Creature tagged along with Ripley arrives there, the whole situation changes for the Men out there and the facility itself.To be honest, the premise looked solid. Something afresh and uniquely thought about but the execution overall disappointed heavily because of poor writing and some downgraded CGI. Looks like the makers were trying to blend two different outtakes from the previous two installments but duly failed in the process. Not just because of their over ambitious efforts but the technicalities themselves weren't much high scaled. That VFX part really baffled me as the previous film in the 86' made better projections of the same monsters; In here their designs, movements and the characteristics they have as a creature seemed sluggish and poorly crafted.
Action pieces felt good and gave enough cheerful moments but nothing extraordinary or out of the scale.Performances are nice, might be the highlight of the entire runtime. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley shined again, although her badass nature slightly toned down for the sake of giving others some chances to stand out, nonetheless she carries this film on her shoulders. Some other characters were memorable and well worked too such as Morse, Dillon, Clemence, Andrews etc. Glad to see some interesting inclusions apart from Ripley as well.Sound Design is where I got unexpected underwhelming experience. Sound plays a huge part in any movie, let alone A Sci-fi flick. And they just ruptured the whole vibe by using generic tones without them having any sort of exciting elements. Could have been a much better experience as a whole!In the end, I must Clarify; I have seen the 'Special Assembly Cut'. So my experience and judgement might be a whole lot different from yours. So please kindly remember that.
I just wanna say, I enjoyed the film to a certain extent and that too because of Ripley Aka Ms. Sigourney Weaver. Without her; it could have been just another Action flick minus the substance.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch the Assembly Cut,"The rating for this movie is for the theatrical version of the film. Studio interference always ruins everything. This movie is my favorite in the franchise. As the title suggests: watch the assembly cut.
The story takes place on a male prison colony, which already creates a glorious tension when the strong and independent Ripley arrives on the scene. A prison colony also gives way to an array of fascinating characters. The characters in this film are the most exciting in the franchise. They're well developed and exceptionally acted.
The soundtrack is also truly fantastic.
There are a couple of inconsistencies in the story. I will give the bad ratings some credit there. However, ultimately, this movie is a good time. People need to relax. It's a movie not a lifestyle. It's gory, exciting, well acted, good soundtrack, and good pacing. What more do you need?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Piotr St. says: Pink Floyd - ""Animals""","On March 24, 1973, Pink Floyd blew the roof off the dump with their greatest album to date, ""The Dark Side Of The Moon"", one of the most inspiring, powerful and classic albums of the whole rock history. On September 15, 1975, they did something no one expected: they came with an album, being almost exact continuation of Dark Side..., but with a few changes in style (long, constructed compositions as opposed to short songs from TDSOTM) ""Wish You Were Here"", also considered as classical. However, nothing happens twice, and their successor, ""Animals"", presented to the audience on January 23, 1977, was a good, solid album, but didn't stand comparison to its precedessors.OK, but what about Alien?It's almost the same story. In 1979, ""Alien"" blasted everybody right into Space: incredibly challenging meteor, still standing incredibly fresh even now. In 1986, a continuation appeared, James Cameron's ""Aliens"". Once again, this was not a direct continuation (it couldn't be! NOW we all knew how Alien exactly look like, so the suspense of the first one was gone; now there were the only unknown thing - when, where and how aliens attack; and we had dozens of monsters instead of one and a bunch of marines instead of simply workers), but was also good as f**k.But you can't have three masterpieces in a row, and Alien 3 simply couldn't outclass its precedessors, or even be equal to them. This might be caused by rather large changes the producers made to the original film (and mediocre level of ""Animals"" might be considered as a result of Roger Waters' autocratic domination on the Floyds). However, it stands pretty well, with its grimy, claustrophobic atmosphere and industrial settings. I have to admit I like this one, despite its faults (major bullshit: persons of YY chromosomes! An explanation: These are two types of human chromosomes, X and Y. Women have an XX combination, while men have XY. However, X chromosome is the only one that carries all features; Y doesn't carry anything, so the person having an YY couldn't exist because ovarium would ALWAYS give an X chromosome; and if even, by some very rare and strange mutation, such combination would appear, it would die immediately after conception).7/10 (The Floyd-Alien similarities end here; the next Floydian slip, ""The Wall"", was a masterpiece; the next movie doesn't.)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Warning! This film is a travesty,"I went into Alien 3 hoping for a continuation of the story line. Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop, with courage and daring, had triumphed in Aliens, and ended up in frozen sleep and returning to civilization.  But, holding courage in disdain, the writers decide to immediately kill of 3 of the 4 survivors of the previous film. As outrageous as this was, they also decide to have the alien ""rape"" Ripley in her cryo-sleep, thereby negating every victory won with such blood, sacrifice and difficulty in the previous film. From there on, it gets worse. Dark and depressing, this film should never have been written, let alone made. Do yourself a favor and end this series with #2.

The action is, in a way, original. Though the special effects are so-so. The characters are okay but they don't get to develop much. Although it's not received well, you have to understand that when Fincher arrived on the project, he had no script but he had to shoot and he was under pressure AND it was his first movie to direct.

"""Is that all you got? is that all you can fight for sucker?""","That one line alone, uttered by Dillon near the climax of the film blows ALIEN RESURRECTION out of the water.Greatly underestimated and misunderstood film (even by me intitally). The problem with ALIEN 3 is that it IS so different from the first two movies, not worse....just different!  Dark, sombre, even gothic. It places Ripley in a prison colony on an isolated planet at the ass-end of the universe, her ship having crash-landed following its long journey at the conclusion of ALIENS.Audiences were understandably ill at ease from the outset, having Corporal Hicks, the Bishop Droid and little Newt killed off before the film even got going, but Ripley's performance is the key to the movie here. She is an awesome figure of resolve and stoic bravery.The plethora of English accents didn't help either (it WAS a British production, backed by Murdoch's NEWS Limited corporation). Extremely good script, just talky and with few action sequences. Problem was that following Cameron's huge adrenalin-rush with ALIENS, audiences were expecting more of the same and it wasn't to be. Many were disappointed also that there was only one alien, as in the original.Charles Dance as the colony's doctor and Charles Dutton as the prisoner's leader and unofficial spokesman (""You're all gonna die, the question is - do you want it on your knees or on your bellies?"") are superb. Many top characterizations littered throughout the movie. Picks up the pace towards the end and the ""herding"" of the alien into the leadworks is excellent.Few movies have ended with such poignancy, emotional resolve and beautifully choreographed deliberation. Absolutely great musical score here too. If you WERE one of those bitterly disappointed by ALIEN 3, give it another go. With a different mind-set you may see it differently, after all, ALIENS was totally left field of the original. The three are a great trilogy. ALIEN RESURRECTION was simply an aberration....forget it, don't even THINK about watching it! It doesn't BELONG!I once gave Alien 3 a rating of 5/10. I was wrong, it is a 7.5!",,Anonymous,Horror
You must see the extended Assembly Cut before rendering an opinion,"Shocked. Surprised. Not exactly elated though. Nonetheless, the Assembly Cut, which puts back in 33 minutes of critical filming done by David Fincher (regardless of whether he sanctioned the Assembly Cut), radically transforms the commercial release into a much more coherent and much less annoying outing. This film hearkens back to the first Alien movie in tonality, though with a resolute grimness. It's not exactly pleasant or fun. Additionally, you have the many problematic plot issues assuming that Alien 3 is supposed to follow Aliens... And the killing off of key characters doesn't make any sense unless somehow they refused to participate in the sequel. Actually, the entire setup for this sequel doesn't make any sense... Who the heck sanctioned such obvious plot violations? Still, I'm giving this a 6/10 because the movie shows a believable and unique consistent vision, however dour, and there's much fine acting to be had.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Step Down,"After 2 incredible prequels its no great surprise that the 3rd Alien would struggle to live up to the lofty standard.

"""This is a maximum security prison, and you have no weapons of any kind?""","ALIEN 3 is difficult to explain, but I feel I should put in a good word for it.  Being a highly visual person, I tend to veer towards pretty movies, instead of movies with character depth.  Some might see this as shallow, but it's just the way I am.  Not to say I don't care for Ripley or Newt or Hicks - they are GREAT characters.  I consider ALIENS to be perfectly done (10/10).When I was young, I used to watch this movie all the time, and it was the first of the ALIEN series that I viewed.  Since I've grown to undertand movies on a little bit of a deeper level now, it seems like ALIEN 3 still holds up.I consider ALIEN 3 to have the COOLEST OPENING CREDITS OF ALL TIME.  So stylistic, so gothic, so sad.  But COOL.  The rest of the movie is pretty intense and will have you seeing orange the entire last half.  I really don't think David Fincher could have done any better with this storyline. ALIEN 3 reminds us that even the greatest triumphs (Newt's rescue and the destruction of the Queen) always turn into the endless sadness that the universe is basically made of.  Plus, it really does bring closure to the story by Ripley making the ultimate sacrifice in order to save thousands.7 / 10 for sure!  A very decent effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finchers worst.,"OK. If this movie was directed by some ""bad"" director, I would not be so disappointed. But this is fincher. Guy who had directed a true masterpiece. I hope you all understand what movie I'm talking about-Fight club. But this one..... is way too bad.. for fincher of course.It's very moody and gloomy and depressive... of course fincher has tendency to direct such type of movies... I mean fight club and seven are quite depressive and moody too... but we are talking about alien right? this must be an action movie.. sci-fi action, it must not be a movie you should think about. it must be like two previous movies. just entertaining. but this one is not. The only excuse for fincher is that this is his first movie and I'm glad that he compensated this failure by such masterpieces as seven and fight club.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Maybe i need more of a life,"In fact, i KNOW i need more of a life, but i seriously enjoyed this installment of the bug-bashing saga.To be honest, it is near impossible for ANYTHING to surpass the gung-ho action of Aliens, or the groundbreaking creepiness of Alien, but i cannot see anything truly bad about this movie, or anything that warrants it being labelled as ""bad"".Biased Aliens fan that i am, i can honestly rate this as good. Not many films get to Number 3 and still remain as enjoyable as this. I cant help feeling a lot of critics bashed this solely on the basis of it being ""yet another sequel"" Very worthy IMO.",,Anonymous,Horror
"""Alien 3"" (1992) - A Dark and Polarizing Installment","""Alien 3,"" directed by David Fincher in his feature debut, is a film that divided fans and critics alike. Following the action-packed ""Aliens,"" this installment returns to a more somber and claustrophobic tone, reminiscent of the original. However, it is marred by a troubled production history, resulting in a film that feels disjointed and incomplete.The film begins with the shocking and controversial decision to kill off beloved characters from ""Aliens,"" setting the tone for a bleak and nihilistic story. Ripley finds herself on a prison planet, where she must once again face the terror of the xenomorph. Sigourney Weaver gives a strong performance, shaving her head for the role and embracing the darkness of the film's themes. However, even her efforts can't fully redeem the film's shortcomings.""Alien 3"" struggles with its pacing and tone. The supporting cast, while capable, doesn't leave a lasting impression, and the film's visual effects, particularly the early CGI, are inconsistent. The creature design is less effective than in previous films, with the xenomorph often appearing less menacing due to the rushed production.Despite its flaws, ""Alien 3"" does attempt to explore deeper themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the consequences of corporate greed. However, the film's bleakness and lack of a satisfying narrative arc leave it feeling like a missed opportunity in the franchise.Overall, ""Alien 3"" is a divisive entry that has its moments but ultimately fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent stand-alone effort, but should not be in league with the 1st two.","My Take: Despite the anti-climatic opening, it's somewhat effective, especially under the wing of Weaver's tormented Ripley.I am completely unbiased with ALIEN 3, the third chapter of one of the most ambitious of science-fiction sagas. I loved ALIEN enough to call it a classic. ALIENS *is* a classic, no doubt about it. Being a big fan of this series, I know I should hate ALIEN 3, arguably the weakest link of this series, and then again why shouldn't I? The film totally ruined the entire second movie with one brief opening sequence that totally betrays the ending of the first movie. The movie hasn't even started and already did it have an anti-climax. I hated this opening sequence (save Elliot Goldenthal's fine score), which is too bad, because everything that follows is rather good, that is, viewing it as a stand-alone feature. ALIEN 3 is no good compared to its superior predecessors, but even with its hated existence, the movie is not as bad as reported.In this chapter, picking up the last events from ""Aliens"", Ripley crash lands in Fiorina 161, a high-complex correctional facility, maximum security and home to the universe's toughest crime-lords and rapists. Ripley wasn't the only thing surprising to the prisoners, there's a faster and more terrifying alien, built and ready to kill. But Ripley also discovers a terrifying realization, which she must stop herself.The film leaves some things unexplained. Like where did the alien egg come from, and how many are the eggs on the ship (if there's only one, what was the one attached on one of the passenger's face.). Worse still is how it's anti-climatic prologue gets into our nerves. But still, you have to admire the film's superiority and creativity. The suspense also builds up to terrifying and action-packed climax. The chase through those dark corridors are well shot and swiftly edited.Anyway, it's a decent underrated effort considering the fact that it's a sequel, but it still would totally sink if compared to the first two films. I think that if they could have bought a more decent writer (who won't kill the really good characters), it could have been better.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien not so good.,"The story and the plot are ok ,but this movie fails to recreate the atmosphere of the previous ones ,it has a lot of terrible scenes and a bad decisions anyways this is an ok close to alien trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gets better over time,"Superb ANIMATRONICS (NOT CGI) like some have mentioned, watched this in the Cinema when it came out, just as good as the previous 2 movies, the 4th now that was a mess,Well worth a watch, the special cut version is a must watch.The atmosphere and music is pretty much spot on especially near the end, had that creepy suspense that the original 1979 version had, so ignore the the bad reviews, just because it had no Space Marines with big guns, people didn't like I am guessing. But a sequel that just does the same thing is just lazy.Charles Dance and Brian Glover played their parts well, at the end of the day if you are watching a movie and forget it's a movie, then it works!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Plllease,"Ridley Scott, where are you? The Alien series has sadly declined since its initial entry. The first was absolutely awe-inspiring. Alien3...don't waste your time!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
criminally under-rated,"By a narrow margin, this is actually my favorite entry in the Alien series. Maybe it's because I recognize all the British actors from ""Withnail & I"" and ""Doctor Who,"" and I get nostalgic...but I think there's more to it than that.I prefer the notion of one all-powerful Alien creature to the hordes of mindless drones that appeared in ""Aliens.""  I also quite like the strange cast of characters on display here - the soft-spoken doctor played so well by Charles Dance, the hapless ""85,"" and Charles S. Dutton's bad-a** preacher man.  They're so much more distinctive than big bunches of marines, and even the Nostromo crew members in the first ""Alien"" film.  So I care more, here, when people die.Granted, the special effects are a bit lacking - there's none of the action spectacle of ""Aliens"" in this film, and the creature itself looks obviously animated in far shots.  But the sets are truly stunning, and the level of violence is balanced pretty well - it's more frightening than gross.The longer special edition, available now on DVD, actually hurts the movie a bit - I prefer the leaner, meaner original.  And I don't particularly care that the director has disowned the film in all its versions - since he went on to direct rubbish like ""The Game"" and the forceful but too-grotesque ""Fight Club,"" I think we can dismiss his opinion and just enjoy ""Alien 3"" ourselves...",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
