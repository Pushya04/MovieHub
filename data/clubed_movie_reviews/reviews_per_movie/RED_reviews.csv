Ridiculous...Entertaining...Delightful...RED is all this.!,"When Bruce Willis plays his indestructible yet on the surface everyday guy he is right where the audience loves him. In RED, ""Retired Extremely Dangerous"", he has a close to perfect vehicle. And, so RED delivers in spite of a fairly ridiculous scenario of a group of ex-CIA operatives,or which Willis is one, being singled out for execution on the eve of the vice-president announcing his candidacy for president.We get the message from the first that Willis is somewhat lonely and bored with retirement and is searching for a companion to make his new life matter. He isn't aching to get back to fast track, but is venerable and is fixated on a kind and cheery voice on the other end of the phone line when he complains about not getting his pension checks (he tears them up just to talk to his ""handler""). He arranges a meeting with the sweet sounding gal just prior to everything falling apart because the CIA sends in a ""wet"" team to erase him. As suspected the CIA, as well as most all the resources of the government, are not up to the task.Willis reassembles his old team, all in his age bracket or older, in order to survive. That team, if not on the surface a formidable threat, is pure cinematic gold as it consists of excellent performances by Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren. It is almost impossible not to like this film because of the wonderfully entertaining supporting cast. In fact Malkovich steals the show providing the correct dosage of crazed comic relief. This leads to impossible feats making for deliciously served up entertainment; all with a ""nod-and-a-wink"" that cuts through the unbelievable. Great action with comedy! Richard Dreyfus turns in a solid performance as a spoiled smart-ass (uber-wealthy and powerful) arms dealer who pulls strings behind the scenes. And, Ernest Borgnine has a cameo role which is memorable.It's a character driven action comedy that truly is RED (ridiculous, entertaining, delightful). This movie gets a 7.5 and, as such, is hard to fault in spite of being pure light-weight fluff. See it and smile.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
What The Expendables was supposed to be,"When I first saw the trailer for The Expendables, I was already thinking of the interesting and funny relationship between the characters played by those action icons. After a zillion trailers and a movie, I was sourly disappointed. Now, I don't know who's fault it is, but relative to The Expandables, I almost haven't heard of Red before its release. However, it was exactly what I was looking for.You have a great team of actors. They are not even action heroes, maybe that did it, but they do a great job. just look at that cast: Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, Hellen Mirren, Richard Dreyfuss, even Ernest Borgnine! As the young(er) crew, Karl Urban and Mary-Louise Parker are in it and they both play well. But more than that, each character actually has a role. They don't just come in, say a few inconsequential things, then die or are completely forgotten *cough* James Remar *cough*.So it had the ridiculously packed action and at times it looked and sounded like Ocean's Eleven, who cares? The rest was great! Even the fight scenes... not even the bad guys go out in full view firing wildly then getting shot. People actually took cover, helped each other and synchronized their moves. The lines were funny and somewhat complex and all the people on the set were clearly having fun doing what they loved.Bottom line: I don't know, maybe because the director is unseasoned in the ways of Hollywood the movie turned out to be so good. Or maybe it was the cast. Or maybe it was the fun of it. The movie turned out great, with a few screw-ups that I am ready to ignore. The mash-up is Jason Bourne meets The Expendables via, luckily for us, just a pinch of Ocean's Eleven.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
What's a senior to do? Get a bigger gun of course,"You're wrinkly, have health issues and your age is higher than the calibre of your gun. So what's a senior to do? Why get a bigger gun of course. That is certainly one of many philosophies in the action comedy RED (That would be Retired Extremely Dangerous for those still living in fear of Communism. Hey, it is the right age bracket) which collects a who's who of Oscar-grade talent and has them blow stuff up real good. This is but the fourth men-on-a-mission film so far this year after The Expendables, The A-Team and The Losers, heck even Inception could fall into that group. The good news is with the exception of the latter it is the best of the bunch and by far the most fun you're bound to have this fall season.Now onto the CIA. I don't know what they're dipping their dirty little fingers into Stateside but in addition to being at the center of some ticked off senior's attention in RED, they have been the villains in aforementioned The Losers and The A-Team as well as Salt and Knight & Day. Talk about your need for homeland security, they had better keep one of those high-tech satellites over Hollywood. At the receiving end of the Central Intelligence Agency's scope are a band of former operatives including the ""kid"" of the group, Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), the ailing Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), the brain-fried eccentric, Marvin Boggs (John Malcovich) and the sultry heartbreaker, Victoria (Helen Mirren). Brian Cox also shows up as a Ruskie who may or may not have been previously shot by one of the former. Though not having seen action in a good decade, they have been deemed ""RED"" by an unknown force, which means curtains for this rag-tag bunch of geriatrics.The cast truly is great in RED, and I don't simply mean the actors in general; they simply all give full-on great, funny performances. The subtle (but hilarious) underlying lament of these characters is they all reminisce over their past lives as hardened assassins and pine just to kill one more little ol' person. More at the forefront of course is the bang-on wry humour and delicious action sequences. This is old fashion stunt work at play here (fittingly perhaps) and I'll take it over a green screen any day. These bursts of adrenaline are dumb to be sure, but not totally ludicrous; think of a cross between Die Hard and Enemy of the State. What they are not is anything short of exciting and kinetic, and are interspersed with laughs in such a way as to not drift to one focus too long. RED also gleefully embraces its comic book origins, using playful transitions as the globe-trotting commences. Yet again, director Robert Schwentke never revels in one gimmick for too long and the film goes down smooth and easy as a result.The younger cast is more than worth mentioning as well, with the highest accolades going to Mary-Louis Parker from TV's Weeds. There is a joke in RED which I am not sure was intentioned, when after being injected with a knockout-drug, Parker's Sarah exclaims ""I'm so high"". She steals most scenes when given the chance but her character (a love interest of Frank who unintentionally gets caught up in the fracas) is utilized far more towards the beginning of the film. Karl Urban is also solid as a CIA operative tasked in finding the RED's but becomes suspicious at his orders which grow increasingly corrupt. I always wonder in the movie world how they would explain attack helicopters shredding an airport to the general public. The government must have some amazing PR agents on staff. Richard Dreyfus (in his second cameo of the year after Piranha) is also well used as an oily arms dealer who comes across the team's path.Summit Entertainment is pulling out all the marketing stops for this film, and I am happy to report the results seem to be worth the glamour. While venturing through my theatres ticket checkpoint they stamped my stub ""confidential"" instead of ripping it, and a squad of agents clad in sunglasses and suits patrolled the lobby. The showing seemed to be a generous mix of old and new patrons and that really comes as no surprise. Even though the majority of the cast has long breached 60, these are actors generations of all ages still admire. Even if they are not the draws they once were (some of them never were) this is a great example of people showing up to see actors, performers, and not special effects. RED may be imperfect, it may not even be particularly fresh, but it exudes something movies lack far too often: fun.playeraffinity.com",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"John McClane, Cyrus the Virus, God and The Queen team up and kill people for laughs","A retired CIA operative, hunted by his own people, reunites his old team for one last mission. It's certainly not an original story, mashing together ideas that we've seen before in the Bourne series, The Expendibles and The Losers. 'RED' (which stands for 'Retired, Extremely Dangerous') is the 4th film this year to be adapted from a graphic novel. It is also the 4th to feature men going on a mission, and the 5th with a plot involving the CIA. I couldn't help but feel skeptical. But then I noticed the cast list and realised that this is meant to be a comedy. At this point I saw the project in a different light. 'RED' is a film in which John McClane, God, Cyrus the Virus and The Queen join forces and kill people for laughs. Clearly this was going to be a film where story and sense came second to cast and chemistry.From 'Die Hard' to 'Sin City', Bruce Willis' good-guy-having-a-bad-day routine has evolved little, but it does not need to be fixed. His performance in 'RED' is familiar, but he is never less than entertaining. This time he brings with him an air of self-parody. Throughout the film he maintains a carefree poker-face, as though he's done this so many times over the years that he can afford to be relaxed. There are valid attempts at making Willis seem more normal, and these can be quite amusing. The first 10 minutes, which show him adjusting to retirement and aimlessly wandering around the house in his dressing gown, are reminiscent of Carl Fredricksen's first appearance as an old man in 'Up'. Deeper characterisation, however, only serves to show how abnormal he really is, and it is a delight to see him in action.With the exception of Willis, the cast is made up of actors who have no business waving guns around. Helen Mirren was an inspired choice, as if making up for the predictability of Willis' casting. Flower-arranging OAP on the outside and bad-ass hit-woman on the inside, Mirren is strangely suited to action. There is something about the juxtaposition of her gran-like demeanour with exaggerated violence that makes her very funny and extremely watchable.John Malkovich is particularly entertaining in his performance as a mentally questionable conspiracy theorist who refuses to retire peacefully. After the numerous roles he has played with an undercurrent of insanity, it is hilarious to see him go full-on howling mad. It is not often that Malkovich gets to flex his comedy muscles, but he steals every scene in which he appears.Morgan Freeman is unfortunately the weakest part of this alternative A-Team, not because of his performance but because he is under-utilised. He has little action time and even less characterisation. There is a glimpse at pervy-old-man behaviour (which could have been funny) and a mention of health problems (which could have been touching) but these are quickly forgotten. It is as though the writers were distracted, trying too hard to develop a secondary storyline involving Willis' romance with a pension office clerk. This subplot adds little and distracts from the main picture. It is a pity, because the wasted effort could have been more effectively put into making the story tighter, or on giving Morgan Freeman more screen time.Overall, this is a good laugh, even if you won't remember it afterwards. Taking things less seriously and trying less hard to be cool means that 'RED' is more fun than 'The Expendibles', and less embarrassing too. Stallone can mumble all he wants about ""shooting real action"" - I'd rather see the Queen fire machine guns.",,Anonymous,Crime
Helen Mirren with a machine gun,"Silly is the operative word but also very entertaining. What did it for me was the cast. Helen Mirren lifts whatever she is in and the endearing thing about her is that she's not ""precious"" She goes for it and her fun becomes our fun. Hurrah for that! To go into the plot seems an exercise in futility because that's not what we will enjoy particularly but Mirren holding a machine gun with relish, the wonderful Mary Louise Parker tied to a bed or Brian Cox with a Russian accent and a mischievous spark in his eye. John Malkovich, I hope he soon plays a woman, he would be marvelous as Edna in ""The Edna May Oliver Story"" He is such fun to watch. Bruce Willis can do this kind of film in his sleep and he kind of does and Morgan Freeman? Well, he's always worth the trouble. The film has already vanished from my brain but the cast is glorious.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Red completely justified to its Slogan ""Retired-Extreme-Dangerous"". Thumbs Up!","RED – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Red completely justified to its Slogan ""Retired-Extreme-Dangerous"". The whole movie plays out really cool, funny and clever. In recent times Bruce Willis's movies becomes very cocky and senseless despite of lots of heavy Action, Drama and even comedy. RED is funny from the beginning and opening phone chat sequence between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker gives out lots of dept and characterization. After that it's a non-stop roller coaster ride and we get to meet so many interesting characters one by one. Now let's talk about the great actors who actually made the movie work like no one has expected. Bruce Willis is at his best in RED, I think after Die Hard action franchise finally Bruce Willis got another action franchise which can be preceded further. Bruce's amazing wit, Sharp action moves made it really thrilling experience. Trust Me! Watching Bruce Willis coming out of the heavy speed moving car was just outlandish. You have to watch that scene to believe it! Mary-Louise Parker is adorable, after watching her racy/funny side on ""WEEDS"" from almost 4, 5 years; it's so fun to see her in Big Star studded movie with her crazy witness and attitude. She is really fun to watch, the chemistry between Bruce Willis & Mary-Louise Parker is wonderful. John Malkovich is Hilarious; I never knew this man can be so funny, his moves, dialogues thus every thing was great, and he pretty much steals the scene when he is on screen. Morgan Freeman was the slowest among all of them in humor I guess, though he did pretty decent job in his small role. Last but not the Least we are introduced to Dame Helen Mirren, who just simply stole the show, seriously watching her moving that machine gun like a fire cracker is unbelievable. She brought the utmost charisma to the team of RED. The youngest cast member of the movie was promising actor Karl urban, his tux made him move like 007 & he gave an utmost completion to the RED team, the best thing about Karl urban was that he brought freshness to the movie. Brian Cox, Julian McMohan and Richard Dreyfuss were good. Overall it's a fun ride which no one should miss on any chance. Watch it in first moment!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I don't agree with the critics on this one.,"Red manages to balance the line between action thriller, and light comedy, and does it quite well.Frank Moses(Bruce Willis) a former C.I.A. agent is now retired, and living a simply, and at times boring life. His only joy of the day when he calls Sarah(Mary Louise Parker) a customer service agent, who he likes, Frank pretends not to get a monthly check, just an excuse to talk to her. But Franks simply life is interrupted, when he learns that somebody has put hit on his life, he goes on the run, after escaping an attempt on his life. He takes Sarah along too, much to her dismay. And gets his old team back together(Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich) in hopes to uncover who is behind the hits, but will they before it's too late?I really don't agree with the critics on this one. Red was entertaining. It's funny without trying to get overly silly. Action scenes where good. Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, and Morgan Freeman. But it's John Malkovich who steals the show, with his funny one liners.

Willis plays Frank, retired CIA, whom finds himself on a hit list. He goes to save this girl, Sarah, whom he's befriended, then it's off to track down other retirees. He gets Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirran to solve the mystery. It has something to do with a mission in Guatamale from 1981. And they learn CIA is trying to kill them and it goes all the way to the top: the Vice President.This is a suspend reality type of movie. It's got some funny moments and was entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you are looking for a popcorn flick, then this is a good choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not as good as it could have been, but still enjoyable fun.","I haven't been to the cinema much recently as for me there hasn't really be many films out that have caught my attention. The last film I saw at the pictures was the impressive The Town directed by Ben Affleck that I saw in late September. Red I saw in a trailer prior to that and it looked like terrific fun and was a film I was very much looking forward to. The 7.7 IMDb rating on this film in my opinion is a little extravagant and isn't really justified. It's for me hard to avoid the conclusion that the director Robert Schwentke just placed all the fun moments in the trailer for the sake of drawing the audience to the cinema in a way, but it isn't entirely true.The basic story starts off with ex-CIA agent Frank Mose's chats on the phone to Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) whom have a thing for each other when Frank is attacked by CIA operatives who attempt to kill him. He hooks up with Sarah and other retired CIA agents along the way, which include Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), Victoria (Helen Mirren), Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) and Ivan Simonov (Brian Cox) to try and find out why their own government wants to kill them. Whilst the CIA appoint operative William Cooper (Karl Urban) to apprehend Frank.The story is quite basic and the screenplay is functional at best, whilst there are some funny moments, the script isn't witty or sharp enough and that's where the film loses it's edge. There were moments particularly in the first forty minutes where the movie threatens to be dragged down by it's slow pace and mediocre script, but the film does pick up and get better later even if things get a little silly. In terms of the acting, Willis gives an okay performance, but I was a bit disappointed to be honest. He tries to sparkle but he just couldn't and it felt very run of the mill, whilst Malkovich has a few decent comic moments, but Freeman and Mirren hold themselves much better with more spark in their eyes and wittiness in the projection of the dialogue they speak. They sounded like they were enjoying themselves. Karl Urban does solidly well for his more serious supporting role, but the best person in this was Mary Parker as Sarah. She was terrific as a woman living a normal life but coming to grips that the man she like is a CIA agent and becomes immersed in his world. The action was great and smoothly handled and the music was very good. The style as well was handled nicely as to some extent trying to be cool.Red has been compared to the terrible The Expendables, which is similar in terms of story retired soldiers coming against their own government, but that is where the similarities end. As Red is much better than that trash. Maybe this wasn't as good as it could have been, but it's entertaining enough and is worth seeing. I wouldn't say no to seeing it again, but I would only rent it out on DVD, not see at the pictures or buy it. Saying that it's an enjoyable enough ride and should satisfy anyone's need for harmless entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Red is brilliant!!!,"I never thought much of this film prior to viewing it, as many others might not have either, but if you have even the slightest inclination to view this, you must! The story is typical, nothing special about the basic plot synopsis, but the delivery and the interesting plot twists keeps it fresh and interesting. The humour is hilarious, mostly a subtle humour that is apparent throughout the entire film, in nearly every scene.Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, and Karl Urban all excel, as would be expected. It is refreshing watching Bruce Willis star in another action film, alongside Mary-Louise Parker (the gorgeous mother in Weeds) no less. John Malkovich plays the paranoid role quite astonishingly and Helen Mirren firing large weapons, including a gatling gun, is amazing! Every name above plays an equal part in the film, which is amazing. I never had so many characters in a single movie that I highly enjoyed equally. Remarkably done with talent seeping through the actors and vividly portrayed on the screen.Don't expect this film to change the history of all films, but expect it to exceed in entertainment. If you give it a chance, you won't be disappointed. It's definitely a Friday night flick, something that is easily enjoyed.Brilliance!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Red Card for RED,"¨He got old. Then some thumb-sucker came along and tagged him RED: Retired, Extremely Dangerous.¨ Robert Schwentke (The Time Traveler's Wife, and Flightplan) had the privilege of directing a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, Karl Urban, and Richard Dreyfuss. A lot of big names for the latest adaptation of the DC Comic graphic novel written by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner. One would expect nothing could go wrong with a movie with such great star power, but I was disappointed with this lightly entertaining comedy slash action flick. Red suffers from a poorly adapted screenplay written by Jon and Erich Hoeber (the guys who brought us one of the worst films of 2009: Whiteout). The plot is really bad, and the actors do the best they can in order to save the film. There are some funny moments (but far too few) thanks to the talent from the entire cast that save the movie from falling into horrible territory. John Malkovich gives a very comedic and surprising performance, but unfortunately he doesn't get enough screen time to save the movie. The rest of the cast give good performances, but they are far from memorable. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker (Weeds) is pretty decent, although nothing we haven't seen before. I really expected this movie would have a lot more funnier moments, but the screenplay failed to help out the great cast. Red could have been much better if the producers would have taken more time in finding better screenwriters. I just felt this movie was like an All-Star team without a good coach to help them win the championship. With a better plot, Red would have been a great and memorable movie.Bruce Willis is Frank Moses, a former CIA agent who is now retired and having a difficult time making the transition. The only thing that seems to keep him going is when he gets to speak over the phone with his government pension representative, Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). Her life doesn't seem all that exciting either, and she spends her days working and reading sexy spy novels. Sarah and Frank spend a lot of time on the phone discussing their boring and lonely lives without having ever met, but they seem to enjoy each other. Their daily routines will change all of a sudden when someone puts a hit on Frank and tries killing him. Frank might be old, but he's still got game. He manages to elude the dozen of assassins that are sent to his home and decides to give Sarah a visit in Kansas City guessing she might be in danger as well. Frank will need some help in order to discover who is after him so he decides to get his old CIA team back together: Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), Victoria (Helen Mirren), and Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman). They are all more than happy to get back in action since they all seem to have difficulties adapting to their retiree lives. Together they begin delving into the past in search for clues, while at the same time they have to face the young CIA agent who is after them: William Cooper (Karl Urban). Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, and Julian McMahon also have smaller roles in the film.I really wished this movie would have been funnier considering the talented cast. Malkovich is by far the funniest one in the film; I've seen Willis in better roles; Freeman doesn't add anything to the story; Urban being one of the younger actors proved he has what it takes to stand next to these A-list actors; Louise-Parker was pretty funny in this movie, but she is way better in Weeds; and Helen Mirren always brings her A game to the table. I didn't have a problem with the performances, but I just wished they would have done a better job with the plot and the screenplay. This is one of those movies that looks hilarious in the trailers, but then you discover it isn't actually that funny when sitting through the 100 minute film. Red is not terrible. I actually had a decent time watching it, but it is just light entertainment I wouldn't consider recommending it or watching it over again. The movie did give me a nostalgic feeling seeing how so many of these actors are actually close to their retirement, but they still have the talent if given the right script to work with. I am a huge Bruce Willis fan, but I have to admit John Malkovich stole each scene he was in. Richard Dreyfuss and Brian Cox both have small parts in this movie, but they are really funny in it as well. Seeing these brilliant actors working together is the highlight of the film, but they should have brought in some talented screenwriters as well.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

A quality all-rounder. Entertainment at it's best.,"RED has a great cast, a reasonably straight-forward, but unpredictable and interesting storyline and a sufficient amount of action.It has all the right ingredients with regard to classic/quality movie-making... and is a perfect example of when the seemingly harmless but humble and wise elderly show the young guns of the new skool how it's done and what happens when they really decide to show or display their definitions of crazy.To me Bruce Willlis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman are synonymous with action, insanity, mature English (with class) and wisdom, respectively. (And you can just think of each of them as an all-loving and harmless parent being nice to thier children all their lives... until one day when they drop a bomb and flip and show the child just how extremely knowledgable and really experienced they are)It's such a pity that I saw Equalizer 2 before this movie.If you loved 'Last Vegas', even if it is a comedy with no action, etc., then you'll also love this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

an all star cast has a silly blast,"Despite being somewhat neutered by the ever present annoyance of the PG-13 rating, Red is some of the most fun you can have with in the glib assassin subgenre of action comedy. Bold, hilarious and just a little bit demented, it jumps right off the pages of the graphic novel it was based on for just under two hours of wiseass popcorn movie nirvana, hosted by a cast that's almost too good to be true. 'RED' stands for 'Retired Extremely Dangerous', a moniker given to aging ex contract killers who have laid down the guns, but are still closely watched by the CIA. Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is one such person, languishing in the doldrums of forced retirement, bored out of his mind and chatting endlessly with a cutey call center girl (Mary Louise Parker). Things get freaky when deranged former associate Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) pays him a visit, belting out wild theories about the CIA sending operatives to terminate him. Before he knows it, Frank is swept up in espionage and intrigue once again, pursued by a slick, ruthless agency man (a deadly Karl Urban doing the anti-007 shtick nicely), with Parker in tow, whose terrified reactions to the escalating violence and deadpan sociopaths around her get funnier and funnier as the film progresses. Helen Mirren is regal gold as a well spoken ex MI6 spook who dissolves corpses in bathtubs full of acid, right before afternoon tea, I presume. Watching this dainty waif rock a Barrett 50 caliber and make red mist out of her enemies is one of the many mental pleasures one can get from this flick. Morgan Freeman takes it easy as another former buddy of theirs from the older, and I imagine, more agile days. As for the supporting cast, hell, take your pick. Richard Dreyfuss is a slimy Trump-esque politician lowlife, an underused James Remar shows up for a very brief cameo, as does that old toad Ernest Borgnine, Julian McMahon once again shows that no one wears a suit like Julian McMahan, and that lovable imp Brian Cox almost walks away with the film as a sly devil of a Russian agent who woos Mirren with the silver tongued virility of a fox. What works so well the dynamic between the three leads; Malkovich is mad as as hatter, Willis plays exasperated babysitter and Parker looks on in horror that starts to turn into amusement with every outlandish scenario. Action comedies are tricky recipes, and it's easy to let too much of one ingredient slip into the pot.

"It's not at all the type of film I normally watch, but I liked it.","I some ways, I am not the best person to watch this film. While I have reviewed over 12500 movies so far, practically none of them were action films. It's one of my least favorite genres and to me, a lot of them look the same. I don't particularly care about explosions, machismo and the like. So why did I watch it? My uncle was in town and he wanted to see the film again...and I went on to be a good sport. Well, although the film didn't completely win me over to the genre, it was enjoyable and the sort of film a non-fan could enjoy.The film begins in a rather mundane way. Bruce Willis is living in his suburban home--talking on the phone to a customer service lady. It seems they talk a lot and you can tell he really likes her--and he tells her he's coming to her town soon. However, it occurs MUCH sooner than either expected--as men in black attack Willis' home and try to kill him! He dispatches them quickly--leading you to believe it ain't just an ordinary guy!!

See the film for yourself.""Red"" works because the plot has some clever twists but more importantly because of some of the supporting characters--in particular the crazy guy played by John Malkovich. The film never takes itself all that seriously and has some clever moments--but, unfortunately, like too many films in the genre, a few too many explosions and gunfire exchanges (and practically NO ONE seems to die when 28408234012319 shots are fired).

Sooo much fun!!! See it in theatres with an audience!!!,"You will leave this film laughing. The action scenes are really good but it's the characters and actors that makes this film worth seeing. The casting in this film was perfect! Great all around supporting cast. Morgan Freeman is always a nice touch to any film. Helen Miran firing a Rambo sized gun is worth the admission alone. If you miss the classic Bruce Willis Action Comedies this one makes up for all the bad ones in recent years. But what really makes this film worth seeing in theatres with an audience is John Malkovich! John Malkovich steals the show with maybe the performance of his career. If Johnny Depp can get nominated for ""Pirates"" and Robert Downey Jr. can get nominated for ""Tropic Thunder"", then Malkovich should get nominated for this, seriously. Every time he came on screen the whole theatre would be dying with laughter.Movies are expensive now and not all of them are worth seeing in theatre but this one is. It's not the best film ever made, the story could have been a little tighter, but I can promise you'll have a lot of fun and you will be laughing your ass off through most of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Entertaining,"Red was a great action-comedy film, which I would recommend for anyone who likes the genre. To start it has a star-studded cast, Bruce Willis (Die Hard, Pulp Fiction), Morgan Freeman (The Shawshank Redemption, Se7en), John Malkovich (Dangerous Liaisons, Burn After Reading), Helen Mirren (The Queen, Excalibur) and Karl Urban (Star Trek, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers). All of these actors played their characters perfectly. The film got into the action almost from the very start, and I was thinking that it would be more of an action film, than an action- comedy, but I waited about 20-30 minutes, and i discovered how wrong I was. The movie continued to be perfect in every way, besides the plot did't make total sense to me. Red was a film that I had originally not thought so greatly off. I saw the trailer and thought, ""that could be pretty good, but I'll wait until it comes out on DVD"". Now I regret thinking that. Red had me on the edge of my seat the entire way through, while also making me crack up laughing. If you thought about this film but then decided no, I would definitely Re-consider watching this film. Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Hehe, this is good stuff !","OK, let's make a really bad B-movie with a ridiculous plot, but let's make it the right way ! We take Bruce Willis and have him play Bruce Willis and surround him with a team of great actors. I'm thinking Morgan Freeman as a kind of mentor figure, John Malkowich as a paranoid crazy killer, Brian Cox with a Russian accent and Helen Mirren as a sniper. Sounds OK to you, Guys ? I thought so ! Let's throw in Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine in bit parts and now we're rolling. Plot ? Who cares ? This movie is gonna make itself !! And it does.

A bit of a letdown but still entertaining......,"When I saw the trailer for this, I actually thought this was quite an interesting idea. I mean, how many movies will you see old actors shooting and kicking ass? And since when was the last time you saw Helen Mirren looking elegant and deadly in one movie? This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is why it can be enjoyed as a light comedy. The story is simply - ex CIA agents are being targeted by the CIA in place now, and an old bunch of retirees now have to come out of retirement to work together to take down the bad guys.It's a pretty simple plot and is just an excuse to have action scenes showing the ability of the old to kick ass - but it is enjoyable. I did think some of the scenes almost felt a bit cartoonish, and this is what I picked up on. If it is trying to be a satirical comedy, it excels on some levels and fails in others.The love interest of Sarah (Louise Marie Parker) and Bruce Willis character I felt was really boring and her character was a bit unbelievable. I mean, she is this really ordinary person in the beginning then gets thrown into this world of crime, guns and explosions and is suddenly all for it like that. Her character was almost an annoyance, and was simply there as an added subplot.I thought John Malkovich was pretty good as his character who is the ultimate paranoid retiree thinking everything is out to get him (and has reason to). But what was the joy for me was seeing Helen Mirren with a gun - she would have been one of the last actresses I would have thought would star in action films, but here she proves a delight and charm in her own right. Talk about elegance and deadliness all in one.It is entertaining and maybe I was expecting a little more, so I am disappointed. This is a no brainer essentially, but it is good to see a film celebrating its older actors in a film that is usually associated with young punks killing each other and running away from the cops.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mildly amusing in one or two places,"I guess the people who found this film 'hilarious' and 'amazing' must be really easily pleased. I found it overly long, badly scripted, predictable and poorly acted. Malkovitch put some effort into his part as Marvin the paranoid android, err, sorry, ex-CIA agent but all of the other big names seem to have decided that what this 'comedy' needed was for them to ham it up. And Brian Cox was the hammiest of the porcine bunch.What's most disappointing about this film, however, is that the writers seem to think that because what they're writing is an 'action comedy' they don't have to bother trying to make anything about it the slightest bit believable. It's as if they think the word 'comedy' is code for 'will only be watched by gullible fools'. Thanks for the insult, guys. Now, can I have that two hours of my life back, please?",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

Messy but fun,"RED has a great premise. A retired CIA operative who was at the top of his field is the subject of a hit, and as he attempts to figure out who is behind it, various retired friends and colleagues come to his aid to uncover the conspiracy. There's lots of fun to be had with this concept, and RED does a good job of squeezing out this fun, mostly through the character quirks and the interactions between them.I think its safe to say though that this film is rather messy. I couldn't help feeling when watching it that the pacing was off slightly, some of the dialogue was clunky, and at times they were trying too hard to inject humour where it just wasn't working. The plot was fun and had a good couple of twists and surprises, but there were still a few beats that were off.The cast were slightly disappointing for me too. You'd think a film with Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Brian Cox et al would demonstrate the crème de la crème of acting, but none of them brought their A-game. To be expected I suppose, the script and overall vibe didn't necessarily lend itself to Oscar worthy performances. Karl Urban was probably the standout for me, I thought he put in a great performance.The action in RED is thoroughly entertaining. It very OTT and all the better for it. There are lots of entertaining scenes, particularly one brutal hand to hand fight between Bruce Willis and I won't say who, which was really well choreographed.RED is a fun film and definitely worth watching if cheesy tongue in cheek action films are your thing. If they aren't, probably best to steer clear from this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Retired Extremely Dangerous – A Highly Entertaining Film,"In Christmas, the retired middle-aged suburban Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) has a boring routine life. Frank has a crush on the pension department attendant Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), who is a lonely woman that has disappointing dates, and he tears his checks to talk to her. When a team of heavily armed killers break in Frank's house, he escapes and travels to Sarah's house. When Frank meets Sarah, he explains that he is a former CIA agent tagged RED – Retired Extremely Dangerous - and her life is in danger since they have had many phone conversations. Sarah does not believe in his words, and Frank abducts her and he crosses the country with Sarah to meet his loyal friends and gets information. He meets and teams up with Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) that lives in a nursing home; the paranoid Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) that lives hidden in the woods in Florida; the retired Russian spy Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox); and the British assassin Victoria (Helen Mirren). Their investigation shows a huge conspiracy, where the Vice-President Robert Stanton (Julian McMahon) and the gangster and former CIA agent Alexander Dunning (Richard Dreyfuss) are involved. Meanwhile, the efficient CIA agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) is assigned by his boss Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) to chase Frank.""Red"" is a highly entertaining and hilarious action movie. The non-stop action entwined with very funny situations make this film one of the best of the genre that I have recently seen. My family and I laughed a lot with the group of retired extremely dangerous agents, but John Malkovich steals the film with his paranoid character that sees conspiracy everywhere and most of the time is right. Mary-Louise Parker and Helen Mirren are great surprises since this is not their usual genre. If you a seeking a movie simply to entertain and shutdown the brain, ""Red"" is certainly the right one. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Red – Aposentados e Perigosos"" (""Red – Retired and Dangerous"")",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Badass Red Army!,"Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Redrum! Redrum! Redrum! OK, how did that transform itself into a critical warning to a creepy ""murder spelled backwards"" fixation? I just wanted to provide this review an initial ""Shining"" moment. OK, enough. I am here to review the action-comedy ""Red"". So ""rede"" or not, here I come. At first, I was a little puzzled upon seeing that ""Red"" was nominated for a Best Motion Picture (Comedy/Musical) Golden Globe nomination last year. But I must admit now that ""Red"" was a viable nominee. I had much fun watching this movie about retired black-ops agents who reassemble their team when retired ops leader Frank Moses is targeted by a group of assailants who might very well have government connections. ""Red"" stands for retired and extremely dangerous, which fits the bill these days of Regis Philbin, George Bush (both of them), and Joan Rivers (is she retired?). Director Robert Schwentke excels in keeping the ""Red"" action unpredictable with a nice touch of sarcastic comedy, due much to the on- target screenplay of Jon & Erich Hoeber. The geriatric and non-geriatric cast of ""Red"" was stellar, even though that is ""old news"" since this movie was released last year. Bruce Willis was vintage Bruce with his wily performance as Frank Moses. Malkovich! Malkovich! Malkovich! Sorry, I got a bit excited that the actor human being John Malkovich was in this movie, and delivered yet another scene-stealing performance as retired ops Marvin Boggs. Morgan Freeman as retired ops Joe Matheson did not have to do much acting, but his presence is always welcome in any movie even when his narration is not required. Damn was Dame Helen Mirren good as the badass retired ops Victoria, and they give her a machine gun in this one! Yea Baby! Other great supporting turns came in the way of Brian Cox playing Russian inside man Ivan Simanov, Karl Urban as CIA Agent William Cooper, and the lovely Mary-Louise Parker as Moses' romantic interest Sarah Ross.

when actors retire,"When actors who played spies in action movies get older they have an option. They can start playing roles of retired spies in action movies. At least the best and the luckiest of them. Same is true for westerns or for science-fiction movies, BTW.Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman are all among the good and lucky one. Some of them may have not even crossed the legal age of retirement in these times when the governments push the pensions limit higher for reasons I would not detail here. What counts is that all the members of this 'carre of aces' are in good shape and have fun making us have fun in this story where the renegade and rogue agents are the active ones the the institution one should trust less than any other around is the government. Conspiracy is not a theory, it's a fact of life whose credibility is not placed under question for one second in the script of the film directed by Robert Schwentke. who film after film builds to himself a name of one of the best action film directors in Hollywood and I expect him being trusted with one of more of the never-ending James Bond series entries sometimes in the future.Did I forget somebody? Oh, yes - I should mention Richard Dreyfuss, one of the actors I mostly admired about three decades ago and who seemed to get lost into politics, to the point that I almost did not recognize him here in the retired villain role (sure, villains also retire). One could comment that only Willis is within his usual casting limits, while actors like Malkovich, Mirren, Freeman, or Dreyfuss could do more interesting things and certainly no Oscar was waiting for them behind the corner for the roles in RED, but, hey, this is entertainment, this is an action comedy, one of the genres Hollywood knows how to do well, the guys and the gal are having fun doing it, so get your popcorn and have some fun yourselves watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

RED! IT MAKES DIE HARD SEEM LIKE Shakespeare,"I must have missed the point, because I thought this was the daftest film I have seen for some time. I want more for my money than good actors slumming their way through a farcical plot.The ludicrous tone is set right at the start. Our hero Frank Moses (Willis) is living in a very ordinary suburban house in a very ordinary suburban street. The CIA send a hit squad to kill him in the middle of the night but, being Bruce Willis, he disposes of them without turning a hair (he hasn't got any hair, actually). Seeing that things aren't going very well, the spooks send in twenty or so heavily armed men who advance on the house, pouring thousands of rounds of sub-machine gun rounds into it. This utterly destroys the house, which appears to be made of plywood, but of course Brucie is well away by that time.The joke is that all this mayhem occurs without ANY of the neighbours so much as looking out of the window, let alone running around in panic. Just another night in the burbs, presumably.Later on there is a scene in which Frank Moses empties an automatic pistol into a car, causing its driver no little concern. This happens in a busy street, but again nobody takes any notice.The CIA man out to get Frank is an odd character, too. He is a cold-blooded killer (the first time we see him he gets what he wants from a captive with a rope around his neck, then he kicks the stool away and watches him die: charming feller). However,he goes home at night to his lovely wife and adorable children. Had a good day at the office, dear? I seem to recall that Arnold Schwarzeneggar, in True Lies, was also a family man. That was a daft film as well.The other characters are pretty much unbelievable. Morgan Freeman is OK but under-used, and John Malkovich and Helen Mirren are over-used. Malkovich seems to be trying to play Donald Sutherland's character Oddball from Kelly's Heroes, but comes over as unhinged rather than wry and canny. Mirren is part-Mother Superior and part-Xena, Warrior Princess, and she has the enviable ability to take a bullet through the guts and show no ill-effects afterwards.All in all a disappointing outing. I could have stayed at home and cut my toenails.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

RED is fully equipped with light action set pieces that shows the youth of today how it's done.,"Retired. Extremely. Dangerous. Three words that sums up my career of playing 'Mario Kart' at tournament ""pro"" level. But enough about my personal and secretive endeavours, let's dive head first into the world of elderly agents exposing very important people for the charlatans that they are. As silly as this DC comic book adaptation sounds, and it does venture into the stupid very frequently, it's just damn good fun and so watchable that you'll be eternally smiling as Willis devours a hearty breakfast by himself. The CIA are tasked in wiping out Frank Moses, a retired analyst who was part of a special operation years ago, to which he must find out the truth before everyone involved is killed.Mixing action and light-hearted comedy often produces tepid results. The gags being more broken than Malkovich's mind. Fortunately this adaptation knows exactly what it is and never tries to be anything else. It's straight up fun, entertaining and swift. Agents literally explode into smithereens. I mean, literally. Boom! An exquisitely dressed Mirren unleashes a barrage of bullets from a gun that is three times the size of her. Willis actually smiles. And I'm absolutely fine with Parker getting kidnapped and handcuffed to a bed against her will. Perhaps the only time I'll allow that, ever.Sure, the plot descends into a blah-fest that no one cares about, mostly due to the environment changing every eight seconds (to which a postcard is shoved in my face). And the climax is so anti-climactic that Willis essentially sneezes on the villain and the world is saved. Yet the cast packed tonnes of charisma into their performances, that they outdo the script given to them. The older cast members delivered the goods, but so did Urban who channelled his inner badass in preparation for 'Dredd'. Despite the generic forgettable plot of RED that not even the fantastic cast cared about and Willis munching on Parker's face at the end (ew...), it's the buoyant action and humour that elevated this adaptation into be classified as ""good"".",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Familiar faces help ""RED"" beat formula","No genre has defined 2010 like the group-centric comedy-infused action flick that pits betrayed special agents/soldiers against ""the man."" So the only chance ""RED"" had at standing out was to rise above the formula at the hands of an acting core whose mean age would qualify for a senior discount to see said film. In honesty, it doesn't succeed at being more special, but what ""RED"" achieves that many of its kin this year did not is pull it off with a definitive sense of class.Although hardly as hysterical as it ought to have been, ""RED"" combines likable faces and smart direction well enough so that the recycled premise doesn't nag at you for too long. Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan,"" ""The Time Traveler's Wife"") takes the style of the film in various directions from goofy action comedy to more serious revenge thriller, but the key is that he never crosses the line into eye-rolling territory; no one walks away from an explosion his film.Bruce Willis stars as retired CIA operative Frank Moses, whose existence has been reduced to phone conversations with the woman that sends him his government check (Mary-Louise Parker). That changes quickly when Frank's home is reduced to Swiss cheese by the very agency he worked for. Realizing he and this ""woman"" are in jeopardy, he kidnaps her and while on the run, finds his old friends (other retired agents) to piece together what's going on. The gist is that Frank's been deemed ""Retired, Extremely Dangerous"" because he's still got some juice left in the tank and the government — as per usual these days — has some dirty laundry to which Frank is connected.The mess leads Frank to attempt to break into Langley and eventually try and kill the vice president of the United States — which should give you a sense that much of the film is ""old(er) guys kicking ass."" Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren all join the fray as retired-but-deadly compadres when Frank enlists their help.They're a likable group; even for those with a smaller Malkovich threshold will enjoy him playing the insane, paranoid character and Freeman and Mirren flaunt their usual charms. At the same time, with Malkovich as the exception, the group is more lovable than hysterical — as much as you expect them to play against type, they don't really, though Mirren with a machine gun is refreshing. It's part of the dual nature of ""RED;"" sometimes its focused on comedy and amusing action and other times more serious action coupled with dramatic performance.As for the ""young-uns,"" Parker, famous for her starring role on Showtime's ""Weeds,"" manages to bring a unique flavor to the role of ""clueless female lead stuck in the vortex of bullets and explosions against her will initially but not later in the film."" Karl Urban (""Star Trek"") plays the usually not-so-distinguished role of CIA agent hunting the REDs down, except he actually has a multi-dimensional story line. Jon and Erich Hoeber's script was a good find for Urban, whose star will continue to rise.""RED"" also has a wealth of cameos from beloved older actors that much like the rest of the film, aren't hysterical, but make the film ultimately more enjoyable. Whereas many films based on comics are aiming now for lesser-known talents and conventional thought says that packing a film with a ridiculous amount of stars is overkill, ""RED"" comes out and proves once again that there's great comfort in a familiar face, especially seasoned veterans. We enjoy seeing them have fun with less sophisticated roles, even if their performances don't rate with the anticipation of them crossing a genre line. Without a doubt, however, it makes today's most used and abused Hollywood action formula much more tolerable.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Some of them are trained killers; others are probably sociopaths. They do have a nice commitment to each other as representatives of a group generally ignored. Nevertheless, like Lancaster in Atlantic City, they work their magic and move quickly and skillfully, doing the job they set out to do. Nothing great. Just an entertaining movie.

Reclining Extremely Disappointed,"""Red"" is bland. Jilting its vibrant namesake, director Robert Schwentke's pallid comic book movie is about as exciting as a grayscale rainbow. It's a self-celebratory slog and one of the longest hour and fifty minutes I've spent at the movies this year. In my defense, its trailer was a calculated work of CIA-level deception—each moment is expertly chosen to give false impression that the whole is mindless fun. But mindless fun is only half right.There's next to nothing to say about a film this unremittingly boring. I'd stop just short of calling it a failure, but the most incredible thing about ""Red"" is that such a lackluster script attracted such high-profile talent.The cast, including Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Mary Louis-Parker, along with Karl Urban, Brian Cox and Richard Dreyfuss, speaks for itself. That's part of the problem. ""Red"" relies too heavily on big names to make the material pop rather than directly addressing the many problems with its confusing, amorphous screenplay. Surely it seemed like a pretty safe conclusion—I'm as surprised as anyone that a film this stacked could be so completely devoid of personality.Then there's the not-so-insignificant fact that our leading man is the most uninteresting person in the entire film. Black ops superhero Frank Moses never lives up to his reputation— pity Willis doesn't supply his own. His character is meant to be a ""romantic"" at heart, but his relationship with dopey civilian Sarah Ross is just as unconvincing. Moses isn't a compelling protagonist—and he's shown up repeatedly. First by Malkovich as an LSD-warped CIA retiree, but also by Freeman, who is in the film for maybe a combined ten minutes.I'm not gunning for Bruce, though. ""Red"" is an amalgam of creative failures in which his is the very least offensive. It was never going to be a great film given the inept writing of Jon and Erich Hoeber, though under Schwentke's direction it isn't even passable. He attempts to pawn ""Red"" off as disposable entertainment, but reneges on the 'entertainment' part. It's the type of movie that squeaks by on a slow weekend, but would have been justly ignored had it been released three months ago.Even its music is egregious. Not since Soderbergh's ""The Informant!"" has a film been so tonally altered through soundtrack and score. Composer Christophe Beck imbues each languid scene with a false sense of energy—be it bouncy, comedic accompaniment or nondescript action orchestral—but he fails to make a case for them. In fact, his music underscores the dichotomy between sound and sight; he makes us acutely aware of what we should be feeling, but aren't.Collectively, ""Red"" is one massive miscalculation: criminally overlong and underwhelming given the caliber of talent on hand. There's no reason why this shouldn't have offered the same breezy fun as ""The Losers"" and ""Knight and Day"" did earlier this year, flawed though they were. Schwentke attempts to mend a Humpty Dumpty script by infusing it with style and enunciating its humor, but the former comes off as gimmicky and the latter is a series of embarrassing air balls. Joke upon joke was met with stifling silence from the crowd.""Red"" is one of the most colorless films in recent memory. In it, the acronym 'R-E-D' stands for ""Retired; Extremely Dangerous,"" but I've come up with an abbreviation that far better describes the experience: ""Reclining; Extremely Disappointed.""",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

I loved John Malkovich as the, almost paranoid, member of the team; he added some great comic moments. Helen Mirren was great (as ever), as was Richard Dreyfuss as the bad guy and Brian Cox. Also a mention fro Karl Urban who played his role with great aplomb; he'll go far I'm sure.

Cute action comedy,"How much fun would it be to see Helen Mirren, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ernest Borgnine all together in an action movie? If you think it would be fun, go out and rent the cute comedy RED. They're all retired CIA agents, and they know some very important state secrets, so before long, they find themselves fighting to keep their peaceful retirement, and indeed, fighting for their lives. Bruce Willis's love interest is Mary-Louise Parker, and while I found her annoying in her younger days, she's quite likable in her middle age. She and Bruce have an adorable rapport together, and it's a sweet and darling romance. She works at a government pension office, and Bruce continually pretends he's lost or has a problem with his check, just so he can call and talk to her on the phone. How cute!""Old timers still got it"" movies are very good, when done well and given a respectful script, so if you like that genre as much as I do, check out this action comedy.

Black Ops Comedy,"Like Michael Corleone, Bruce Willis is out and they drag him back in, but this isn't business. Someone has got a black ops operation on some retired black ops operators. Enough to make anyone see Red.It's quite a reunion Willis has as he starts looking around and sees that a lot of former colleagues are meeting sudden demises. He gets to a few of them like Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich and he even gets a Russian consultant in former KGB agent Brian Cox. When they're not reminiscing about old times, Cox does help point them in the right direction.Red must have taken some inspiration from the two Over The Hill gang movies from the Sixties. Without the western setting and those colorful western character actors, Red gets quite a few laughs in mostly from John Malkovich. He's easily the best performance in Red, playing a paranoid survivalist who has learned to be paranoid, it does keep the group alive or most of them in this film.Willis has perfected a nice dead pan comic style in his performance. Although I really can't see what Mary Louise Parker, the young woman working at Social Security who gets involved with Willis and then enmeshed in their counter ops operation.What's this all about, let's just say that it's coming from the highest or nearly the highest level possible. Someone doesn't want a lot of people around to tell tales. And at the end of the film I'd love to know how the government covers up what happens in the climax.93 year old Ernest Borgnine is trying to surpass John Gielgud's record of still acting when he was 97 has a small, but important role as the record keeper in the underground vault of the Central Intelligence Agency.

It could have been more.,"Bruce Willis is in his classic form in Red, plays it cool as a former ""agent"". The ensemble cast is enjoyable at moments and really plays together nicely, but I feel like there were just too many convenient characters/scenarios.Why in movies like this is there ALWAYS an answer, they always knew a ""person"" who can help them? I understand they did a good job tying every character together, but it almost seemed like there was NO scenario they couldn't get out of. Which, I also understand, is part of the enjoyment of the film, but after so many aha moments, it sort of becomes a cliche.I ultimately enjoyed the movie but felt like there needed to be more stressful scenarios.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ridiculous piece of rubbish,"After hearing some pretty good things about this movie, I was horribly disappointed. Bruce Willis I can understand....Richard Dreyfuss, yes. And John Malkovich I can somewhat comprehend since he was playing his usual whacked-out role.But Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman? What on earth possessed these fine actors to appear in a film that was nothing more than over-the-top, shoot-it-up, totally contrived and uninteresting material? I have to laugh at the memory of the glamorous Ms Mirren draped in an elegant floor-length evening gown, wielding an enormous machine gun and donning combat boots. Get the picture? Actually, you'd be better off not getting the picture. When the movie opened, the first 20 minutes had me captivated as it looked as though it would turn out to be a well-made film with a different type of angle.Then I thought it must be developing into a spoof (""Airplane"" style, perhaps) ... then I sank into the realization that it was really just trying too hard to impress and that the film-makers were quite impressed by themselves with the mediocre script, ridiculous antics and very expensive production.Once John Malkovich makes an appearance, it's time to head for the door.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A Very Good, Wild Ride","A sometimes exciting escapist film about retired CIA agents who are being targeted for a mission they were involved in in 1981 in Guatemala, this film stars Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, seemingly a quiet guy living in suburban Cleveland. He strikes up a phone friendship with Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) and he finds out he is a target. Eventually they go to New Orleans where they see Joe (Morgan Freeman, somewhat underused but still solid) and the slightly deranged Marvin (the always great John Malkovich). Essentially, they are hunting down the people who are trying to kill them. No need to go into any further detail except to mention Helen Mirren's also small but pivotal role, this film is a lot of fun. It has violence of course, but it held my interest throughout. I'm giving it a nine because of its entertainment value. It should have been a bigger hit.",,Anonymous,Crime
"A good movie, but nothing memorable.","REDI had seen this before when it first came out, but I didn't remember too much about it. Now I have watched it again I can see what it was forgetful. Don't misunderstand me, I liked it. For me it was just nothing too special.The movie is about 4 retired assassins who find themselves on the hit list so they come out of retirement to save themselves.This is a comedy thriller. Not usually two categories that you get together, but it went well. There was a lot of action which I liked and the relationship the characters had was very good. The characters all liked each other but at some stage of their lives had all tried to kill each other too so there is a lack of trust between them at first. That made for amusing comedy. There was not too much to laugh about in this film though. It was not really laugh out loud funny.The action was great. I loved the fighting scenes and the gun fights. All of it was very well done.The casting was also very good for this. The only doubt I had was with Bruce Willis. Yes, Bruce is getting on a bit, but he still looks quite young so I struggled to see him as someone who would have retired because he was too old. It just didn't seem right to me. Bruce still did a good job though. He is still the action legend that I grew up watching. Other cast members were Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman﻿, Karl Urban & Mary- Louise Parker. Every one of these actors did a great job and really worked well together. The star of the movie for me though has to have been John Malkovich. His character really was a little crazy and John played it perfectly. He was by far the funniest character in the movie and I enjoyed watching him the most.The only down side to this movie really, as I said at the beginning of this review, is that it is forgetful. There is nothing in this movie that I have not seen before. Yes this is well done and a lot of fun to watch, but there is nothing new in here. The twists were very predictable and there was only one moment in the movie that I did not see coming. Everything else just seemed very safe and straight forward. But it is still good to see for a night in with your friends and you want to watch an action filled movie that you don't really need to concentrate on.I will give this film 6 out of 10.""Frank, I never thought I'd say this again.

The best action packed DC Comic book movie!,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an action packed comedy movie filled with humor than ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Red (2010) is a great action packed comedy movie with humor in it. It is one of my favorite movies with Bruce Willis! This was the second movie that was based on DC comics I see of the duelogy. I always thought that Red 2 was better than this but I was wrong. This movie entertained me back and than, and I have enjoyed very much. This is one of the best movies you will ever see. It is way better than it's sequel Red 2. The cast is great, along with the plot. Very funny in parts and very serious in others. It's on both ends of the genre spectrum. If you buy this movie, I am 98% sure you will be extremely impressed. Some movies are works of art, but some movies are just fun to watch. RED is a fun movie. It taps into the baby boomer generation and may not be as much fun to the younger set, but I recommend this movie to anyone.I have enjoyed this movie so mu8ch. So many gifted actors willing to make light of their growing older. How could you not enjoy the interaction between Mirren, Freeman, Malkovich and Willis? Karl Urban (Star Trek, Bourne Supremacy) continues to show such versatility as an actor. No, there's not deep-seated truths about life here, simply a fun escape from reality. Definitely worth the viewing. There was a lot of action, comedy and great performances by the actors. The acting in this movie was believable and awesome. Karl Urban as William Cooper did an outstanding job! This is one of those that didn't really interest me at all when it came out in theaters. But after watching it twice in the row I was very impressed! The pacing felt draggy and the off-beat sense of humor felt too quirky for me. I was kind of bored and totally expected this. All of a sudden, BANG! The action erupts in the house and Bruce Willis is kicking their ass with his brawn and brains. The story really started to come alive and that''s only the beginning. The movie got better and funnier as it went along. The action sequences were surprisingly intense and bad-ass, there were some hilarious scenes that caught me off guard and the whole cast was terrific.From Bruce Willis' leading hero to Helen Miriam feisty female fettle that she plays so well to Morgan Freedman''s great typecast role to John Malkovich''s paranoid, trigger-happy C.I.A retiree that steals the show more than once to Karl Urban''s bad-ass wild card agent all the way to Richard Dreyfuss' cool mobster a-hole, they all deliver convincing, if sly, performances; they know what kind of movie they are doing and go with it. Not all of this is realistic and given level of limited plausibility and ridiculousness of the plot, this could have gone either way. But in all my surprise, this was a fun action-comedy with enough laughs and action to kill some good time over a weekend.Frank (Bruce Willis), Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) used to be the CIA's top agents - but the secrets they know just made them the Agency's top targets. Now framed for assassination, they must use all of their collective cunning, experience and teamwork to stay one step ahead of their deadly pursuers and stay alive. To stop the operation, the team embarks on an impossible, cross-country mission to break into the top-secret CIA headquarters, where they will uncover one of the biggest conspiracies and cover-ups in government history.That is the main basic plot it has CIA agents in it and lots of actions, lot's of guns are used in here and the gun powder are great. I love this movie and it is a 10 for me.Red is the 2010 action comedy loosely based on the Wildstorm limited comic book series of the same name. Bruce Willis stars as Frank, a former CIA operative who has been designated by the agency as RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous). When he discovers that he's been targeted for assassination, Frank then recruits some of his former colleagues to find out who is behind the conspiracy.

"A Comeback for Willis, and Another Fine Film from Freeman and Malkovich","Right before Bruce Willis walked right up to the precipice of irrelevant garbage films and jumped off, RED is probably one of the most fun films from Willis, and one of the best action films from 2010.Everyone gives a good performance, and seems to have fun in their respective roles. Willis is as charismatic and likable as ever, and he resurrects what made people fall in love with him. Morgan Freeman is awesome, of course, as is John Malkovich, who was an interesting choice for a co-star in an action movie. The ever under appreciated Karl Urban was great too. Mary-Louise Parker was fine, if a little annoying at times, and she was funny enough. Helen Mirren was also cool, and the combined charisma of all the aging stars brought a level of class to the movie, which it really needed.The action is good, and it's pretty hard for a PG-13. The house fight, car scene, docks shootout, and office fight were all great, along with some other scenes, and a drawn-out climax. The fight between Willis and Urban was brutal and entertaining, and they really gave it 100%.It's worth a watch just to see the leads onscreen together, but it's also a solid action movie. It's definitely one of the best non-Expendables group action movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fun, fun, fun!","I can't believe that there are people who actually take this film seriously - it's obvious from the off that it's a parody of all the action flicks ever made, and such tremendous fun it is to watch, too. I love it when you can see the actors actually having a hard time keeping a straight face - they obviously enjoyed filming it as much as the audience enjoyed watching it. My one complaint is that Morgan Freeman was woefully underused, but John Malkovich totally stole the show - he tends to play crazy characters anyway, but Marvin was marvellous! And it was great to see Ernest Borgnine in a role - it was like a who's who of the Hollywood bible! I recommend Red for anyone who is in the mood for a laugh, coupled with some great, OTT action sequences.",,Anonymous,Crime
Bruce Willis a comedic actor,"I saw this with my family when they came to visit and it was a surprise hit for us. The best part of this movie was the cast chemistry, a huge surprise. And Willis has made a huge and not to mention, successful career shift as he has taken a comedic turn in his roles, also seen in Cop Out. Willis has a subte nature to his comedy, but it's convincing and likable. Willis forces you to watch him with his subtle quips that he makes look so daringly easy and fun.The cast of Willis, Morgan Freeman, Hellen Mirren, John Malcovich and more collaborate to engage some of the most timely and organic comedic action sequences that I never expected to come about.If they make a sequel I will be sure to check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A playful action blockbuster with a top-shelf cast.,"I didn't watch Red until after I watched Red 2 (2013) in a theater. It didn't seem interesting to me at first. I watched Red 2 in an auditorium full of adults and was pleasantly surprised. I only watched it to waste some time but Red 2 turned out to be a very funny and enjoyable film. I watched it in the evening and it made my day. So, naturally, the next day I watched Red. I consider it to be just as enjoyable as its sequel. It may be funnier too. Bruce Willis is 59 now but he still manages to shine in the action roles that he picks. He isn't picking anything meaningful, but Live Free Or Die Hard (2007) was one fine action film. The comedy that he shares with Mary-Louise Parker in Red boosts the action at the beginning. However, the film becomes even more enjoyable once John Malkovich jumps out of the bushes. His antics as the wild-eyed paranoid assassin Marvin Boggs just have to be seen. Morgan Freeman, who seems to be in many films these days, plays the canny and loose Joe Matheson. He does well with the clever comedy too. All the main players seem to be having a blast with the weaponry. Helen Mirren more so than others perhaps. She looks elegant in the expensive clothes, even when she's firing a machine gun. The cast is definitely the best feature about Red. Karl Urban acts just as well as the main players, with confidence and style. With Red director Robert Schwentke managed to make what is easily his best film to date. The energetic action scenes that he filmed with cinematographer Florian Ballhaus are stylish and coherent. The downside to Schwentke's direction is the film's awkward pacing, which makes it seem longer than it actually is. This prevents Red from being a truly satisfying action comedy. Still, it's not a big problem. The film looks great, the laughs come often, and the action is exciting. The biggest draw though is certainly the cast of famous actors. This unconventional yet exciting concept gets a high recommendation from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cool and campy spy mystery thriller,"Red is a pretty cool flick that combines love, hate, politics, mystery, thrills, and surprises. It is the ability to combine all these feelings into a cohesive piece of art that makes this a winning film.Bruce Willis is terrific as the ex-CIA guy who starts having a phone relationship with a normal woman. Then the action starts and the bad guys move in. Someone is coming for Willis, so he seeks help from his old friends. Like Morgan Freeman said, looks like it's time to get the band back together.And what a band. What an oddball group, headlined by the incredible acting of John Malkovich. He's a lunatic assassin with too many LSD trips. Morgan Freeman, the never defeated cool customer. Helen Mirren delivers a brilliant performance as an expert assassin who wants to be normal and reaches out with compassion to Willis's new girlfriend.Brian Cox also delivers as a Russian contact who apparently has an past with Mirren, and their chemistry is pretty cool to watch too. Richard Dreyfus is a businessman involved in shady deals. He's fun to watch in this different role. And the co-star of it all is a younger Karl Urban (Star Trek, The Boys) who plays an ambitious young CIA agent charged with tracking down Willis and his group. His chemistry with Willis is so fun to watch.There's a lot of back and forth humor. Old stories about old times, and that plays a key role in the theme. Eventually, the good guys piece together the truth, which leads to a bang-up finale that leaves you satisfied and hoping for more.They did make a sequel and I'm putting it on my list. But Red, this one, is going to be hard to top. It has action, thrills, campy spy humor, and most of all, terrific acting and super casting.Red is a terrific spy film that will satisfy most everyone.

I remember the Secret Service being tougher.,"RED (Retired: Extremely Dangerous) is directed by Robert Schwentke and loosely based around the three-issue comic book limited series of the same name created by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner. It stars Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox & Ernest Borgnine. The screenplay is by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber.Frank, (Willis), Joe (Freeman), Marvin (Malkovich) and Victoria (Mirren) are ex CIA agents forced out of retirement when it becomes clear someone is out to kill them. Seems they hold the key to a dark secret that could rock America from its political foundations.A fun action packed romp featuring a cast of mature thespians enjoying themselves. What RED lacks in originality of plot it more than makes up for in its willingness to entertain and not to take itself seriously. Apparently lighter in tone than the comics it's based on (not familiar with them myself), it appears to be a good decision by the makers to make it more airy. For this is the sort of cinema fare that most in the family can enjoy: well certainly from the teenagers upwards. The explosions and kills etc are well put together and keep the action fans happy, while the comedy theme of age (these lot certainly aren't too old for this crap), as Bruce and co kick butt, is sure to keep the smile on Mam & Dad's face.A super charismatic cast (some nice cameos too) deliver a movie, which given its familiar plot and aged thematics, is a surprisingly refreshing option at the multiplex. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the few DC Comic book films that is intentionally funny,"Like any human being, we all get old at some point. As our body age, we don't always have the same capability to perform the usual tasks we take on during the day. However when it comes to action related films, that concept doesn't exist as much. Characters have much more freedom to be highly skilled in their older age and still manage to be quite agile. The tone that is used in these films are more serious than comedic. Rarely is the subject of age conveyed in a more comic relief tone. Considering that in the year 2010, DC and Warner Brothers had only found success in making dark, serious comic book movies, it didn't seem likely that a movie of a lighter inflection would be made. Mind you this was also before the failed introduction of Hal Jordan in Green Lantern (2011), changing the formula seemed risky. Yet, as obscure as the comic book was, RED (2010) was a surprise hit after viewers saw it. Other than the campy Batman films directed by Joel Schumacher, there were few other DC comic book films of similar tone until this one.The title to this action comedy is actually an acronym that describes the protagonists; RED is short for ""Retired, Extremely Dangerous"". Viewers are introduced to Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) a retired veteran agent of the field looking to do something with himself but can't figure out what. After being attacked one night in his home, Moses brings along Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), a friendly phone operator in order to keep her safe. While on the road, they also reconnect with the rest of the team; cool man Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), crazy paranoid man Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) and Eagle-eye Victoria (Helen Mirren). Together they look to find why they're being hunted, while the hunter himself named Cooper (Karl Urban) works endlessly to stop them. Jon and Erich Hoeber, two writers that do not have much consistency in their projects penned the screenplay adapted from the comic book. For this particular entry though, this has been their most widely acclaimed work.Having older agents come back into the field and still be lethal is a nice idea and the actors cast for those roles fit them well. The whole conspiracy subplot that involves the main characters can get wordy at times but it is understandable to some degree. The real problems are unsolved questions that appear throughout the movie. Things happen where it wasn't revealed at all and no answer was given by the conclusion. What's the point of that? Nonetheless, the actors themselves work well with the parts they were cast for. Willis, Mirren, Malkovich and Freeman all have acceptable chemistry with each other. This is perhaps one of the few times where Willis doesn't have to act so tough all the time in order to crack a smile. Even Mary-Louise Parker has a good number of quips for how strange Willis' character acts at first. Although the fact that the role of Sarah is somewhat a love interest to Frank is a tad cliché in itself, the real question is, who thought Parker and Willis looked good together? They aren't ages apart but Willis looks too old.John Malkovich's part is not an uncommon role, and being that his character is a little nutty, it fits right in. Marvin Briggs is the most comedic of the bunch being that he gets anxious to kill. On the other hand, Morgan Freeman slips away with his character practically just being himself but slicker. As for Helen Mirren, her part comes across delicate on the outside and a brutal sniper on the inside. Heck, Mirren doesn't even blink when she fires her weapons. Karl Urban as Cooper is another dangerous agent and although he's mostly cruel, he does have a human side to him. There's also other appearances from other actors like Richard Dreyfuss, Ernest Borgnine, Brian Cox and James Remar. For action, there are a number of sequences that are quite energetic. With the premise involving secret agents trained to kill, one would expect to have plenty of gunplay and explosive activity, of which it does. Throughout the running time, guns range from revolvers to powerhouse machine guns. Not to mention all the hand-to-hand combat too.Florian Ballhaus handled the cinematography for this film. The shots themselves were well executed but the look itself isn't that impressive. There wasn't much of a visual style to this film. There's not even a whole lot of director Robert Schwentke's ""snap-zoom"" movements, which is a pretty awesome trademark feature. The picture is wide and does get a number of urban landscapes but it's just not much to look at or to be fascinated with. One would think since Ballhaus has worked on movies like The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and Marley & Me (2008), there would be some kind of appeal. The musical score composed by Christophe Beck is another enjoyable listening experience. Much of Beck's composition mixes his usual sounds of bongos and drums with several different cues. These cues switch between guitar and clicky electronic synths that help elevate the action sequences when necessary. Also with Beck having experience in making music for comedy films, mingling action and comedic cues would make perfect sense coming from his perspective.The title is obscure just like its comic book origins, but it is one of the few comedic adaptations in the DC canon. The cinematography isn't unique nor is every question answered, but the actors are well cast, the action is fun, the music is great addition and the comedy is well timed.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Entertaining, Styled Almost as a Parody","Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a retired agent who is stuck in a rut – his only joy in life is his phone calls to his pension case worker Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), who is as bored with life as he is. When Frank is pulled back into his old line of work, he finds himself responsible for Sarah whilst trying to survive.This film is surprisingly light-hearted entertainment and full of likable characters. Bruce Willis plays his trademark cool, collected role, holding his own during gun fights and car chases, a believable veteran of the genre. Mary-Louise Parker brings a bubbly and inquisitive character that clashes wonderfully with Willis' role which provides an unexpected sweet element to the film. John Malkovich delivers a highly entertaining performance as Willis' partner in crime, offering plenty of laughs throughout the film. There are some great minor roles from Hollywood royalty such as Dame Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, and Brian Cox. The film is all about contrasts, and that doesn't just stop at the characters: there is a fair bit of action, offset by humorous dialogue-heavy scenes. The styling of it is almost like a parody of itself: it doesn't try too hard to be one thing or another, it just throws a lot of things into the mix and goes with it.RED is entertaining and surprisingly comedic, with some great characters portrayed by a good cast.

I kept on Laughing.... and Ducking,"The first few minutes of this movie are blissfully misleading. You could at this point be forgiven for thinking this movie was about to be another Sleepless in Seattle. But then three guys in homeland security fancy dress costumes pump lead into the fixtures and fittings of Bruce Willis' house. Next thing you see is Willis tossing a handful of ammo into a frying pan and leaving it on a roaring stove. After that it all gets hot and messy as a load more guys give the house a lead makeover. There after, the action never stops. The plot moves quickly and turns right angles throughout. And it's funny. It's a non stop giggle even though the violence is pleasantly graphic. Nice cameo performances from Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss - always good value. Karl Urban plays cold steel - he was riveting in The Bourne Supremacy as Kiril the Russian Treadstone assassin - and does action well. He's focused and smart and dangerous. He's a guy to watch. Willis is as ever Willis, clinical, whimsical etc. always watchable. Great action and physically punishing. Marie Louise-Parker, civilian and Willis' love interest seemed to get used to being shot at too easily. I know I could never get used to it as a civilian. That aside she got my sympathy. Helen Mirren and Brian Cox, stalwart quality performances. John Malkovich though was matchless. His character, ex CIA and somewhat unhinged by years of acid abuse and paranoia just kept me laughing. An actor who often plays malevolence - and nobody does that better - playing an almost homicidal nut job who's so paranoid he believes everybody is out to get him.... and they are! And yet he is a ruthless killer too. I don't know, he just made me laugh the whole way through. A great performance like the Muppets character ""Animal"" in human form.

For example, Morgan Freeman has a cameo as an 80 year-old terminal cancer patient who dies willingly for his friends as the ultimate deus ex machina. John Malkovich gets some good laughs as the conspiracy theorist armed to the teeth: all of his conspiracies come true.What it shares with similar films is a predictable and improbable concoction of a plot that pits Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis as retired CIA agents against the Vice President of the US (or really, the corrupt industrialist behind the VP). For starters, the Bad Guy could just have stopped after killing a reporter who dug up too much dirt. If he had not started offing the Good Guys, none of them would ever have noticed anything is amiss - end of movie. Then there are the usual situations where a cut to the next scene gets the characters out of impossible situations, the people with dislocated/shot shoulders who fight on like nothing happened, agents with handguns who don't die in a spray of heavy machine gun fire, etc.But these nit-pickings are really irrelevant in such a film. The story breezes along with fewer dull moments as it progresses, the acting is solid as expected from a cast of this caliber. There are nice touches like the animated postcard transitions between locations. And just when you worry that the writers are setting up a lame sequel in Moldova, they deconstruct that idea by reducing it to silliness. A well crafted show good for an entertaining single viewing. If you want plot consistency, go watch a film by Ingmar Bergman or Alfred Hitchcock.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Old, but not past it.","Retired CIA black-ops agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) seeks help from his old colleagues when he finds himself the target of a hit team.There's a scene in RED (which stands for Retired: Extremely Dangerous) where John Malkovich's character fires a single bullet at a rocket propelled grenade heading his way; the two projectiles hit each other, the resulting explosion killing the woman who fired the RPG. It's that kind of film.If you can accept the ridiculousness of the action in this all-star geriatric espionage caper, then there's a reasonable amount of fun to be had despite a rather unexceptional and instantly forgettable plot (apparently based on a DC graphic novel). With such names as Helen Mirren, Bruce Willis, Richard Dreyfuss, Karl Urban, Ernest Borgnine, Malkovich and Morgan Freeman on board for the ride, and a hefty dose of the aforementioned OTT violence, the film is never boring, even with a slightly overlong running time of 111 minutes.At the end of the day, RED features Willis and Urban in a fist fight to Aerosmith's Back in the Saddle, and Mirren firing a large-caliber machine gun, and sometimes that is all you need for an entertaining time.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Die Hard With A Pension""","When you know that RED stands for 'Retired: Extremely Dangerous', you expect older actors and explosive action and you get plenty of both from a film with its tongue so firmly in its cheek that it's almost a spoof. Leading the gang of ex special ops personnel is Bruce Willis which might suggest an alternative title of ""Die Hard With A Pension"".Other members of the old - in both senses of the word - team are gravelly Morgan Freeman, manic Johm Malkovich and cool Helen Mirren (great to see the one-time Queen with huge weaponry). Want some more old-timers? You've got Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfus and even Ernest Borgnine (now in his 90s). The only young actors - and they are in their 40s - are Mary-Louise Parker and less well known Karl Urban.So this is not a movie for the usual teenage demographic of much Hollywood fare but more a pitch to attract the middle-aged viewer who will enjoy familiar faces combined with action and humour but wonder where the plot went.",,Anonymous,Crime

He is reunited with his former friends and foes to get to the bottom of what is happening.The friends turn out to be Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich as the paranoid Marvin. Karl Urban is the super CIA agent in pursuit, hampered by these old timers at every turn.Mirren has a hoot of a time as a flower arranging hit woman and it's all nicely played along.This is a good mix of laughs, action.

Undeniably mindless fun perhaps....,"Where do old CIA agents go to retire, well they either get really old and lecherous, go crazy, assimilate into polite society or just get lonely and bored - RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous)Frank Moses (Willis) is going down the lonely route, phoning his pension benefits clerk each week for a chat to chase his benefits cheque (Louise-Parker), all perky nosed and cute. A cheque he has already received, which he deftly rips in half as he talks to her.Following a re-modelling of his house courtesy of the ""9 Millimeter"" interior design company, Moses gets to meet face to face with his long time phone buddy. Seconds later they are on the run picking up Moses old ""Wet Ops"" CIA buddies, Joe (Freeman), Marvin (Malkovich) and Victoria (Mirren) as they seek to uncover the truth behind recent events and clear their names.The group is closely followed by the dogged and government authorized assassin William Cooper (Urban), all set to kill Moses for reasons not specified, let alone barely mentioned.Moses of course is trained in everything, adept in the use of weapons, hand to hand combat and Mandarin if and when required. A colossal fight with his younger counterpart inspired partly by being called ""Grandpa"".The premise is good and with a great cast including Richard Dreyfuss and Brian Cox, this should be a rollicking action comedy, with the oldies kicking serious butt.The tone for such a film is very important, comedy sits very uneasily with brutal action and here the balance is not quite right. Whereas the A-Team is all about fantasy, this skews closer to reality in places and feels uncomfortable at times with the mix of humour and ""movie"" real life, this is especially true of Marvin's paranoid fantasies.Heavy weapons, gunfire and exploding cars can be fun but this is a heavy hitter cast list and yet we get very few chances to hear or see the interplay between the group. We see the occasional glimpse, a wry Willis smirk or glance from Helen Mirren, admitting the occasional contract on the side as she misses the thrill. The actors are just not utilised enough, why assemble a great cast and then present nameless stuntmen/women perform cool stunts for most of the running time?Of course anything with Mirren firing heavy weaponry with a sardonic grin cannot be all bad but it cannot sustain a 115 minute film on this alone. Hopefully breaking into the Pentagon is easier than having old soviet spy buddies help you out but one ever knows these things for sure.Moses might also be reminded that driving around heavy traffic with a duct taped woman in the back seat, with the world and his wife owning mobile phones, might, just might, raise suspicion?SummaryUndeniably mindless fun perhaps but a real let down following the initial trailers and expectation of a character driven film with added action, not the other way round.File under rather disappointing, or alternatively, somewhat wasted opportunity.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

ACTION COMEDYMore like a television film than it would be for a theatrical one- in terms of violence and it's situations! The action sequences that is in this film are well choreographed but carry so few- the comedy sequences stand out more than the action in segments with a smile instead of being just hilariously funny. The set up has Bruce Willis and company being eliminated by the government by being part of this hit list! This elimination campaign set up by the government has Willis and comp. Go and find out why that is! This is what the rest of the film spends much of it's time on as well as the chemistry with the ensemble cast which includes Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich! It is called ""RED"" because of what the letters stand for, which is ""Retired Extra Dangerous"" and some are given that label!

R.E.D. doesn't disappoint,"This is a movie that is unique straight from the top menu. It features visual styling similar to a Marvel film, with fun animation and wonderful editing in the top menu as well as in the credits. The special effects throughout the movie are on par with summer blockbusters.Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Hellen Mirren, and John Malkovich are just a few of the actors that make up the experienced, recognizable cast of characters, all of which play a distinct and useful role in the movie. The younger actors Mary-Louise Parker and Karl Urban provide a fun contrast to the older, more ""outdated"" characters played by the rest. Even though the basic plot is nothing fantastic – a former CIA agent avoiding capture and discovering a deadly secret – the wide variety of unusual characters and a few interesting plot twists keep you entertained and wanting to see what happens next.Of course, Bruce Willis does phenomenally well playing the ""Retired Extremely Dangerous"" CIA agent Frank Morris. He's just as clever as he is dangerous throughout, while John Malkovich adds humor to nearly every scene he plays as the paranoid ex-agent without being overly comical. On its surface, RED bristles with intense ""Die Hard"" style action interlaced with witty humor that everyone can appreciate.The characters played by Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, and Karl Urban give the movie a deeper meaning and sense of drama and romance. Mary-Louise Parker's character finds herself in a real life romantic thriller novel, while Morgan Freeman's character gives the audience a heartfelt story of life and death that leaves you feeling good inside. The young, arrogant presence of Karl Urban's character sets up unmistakable drama between him and the experienced Frank Morris keeping the audience on the edge of their seat.There are moments in the film that seem overly ridiculous and fairly unlikely to happen, but those are all part of the fun of the movie and are easily overlooked.As a whole, the movie gets an 8/10. The acting is wonderful, the visuals are pleasing and cool to look at, the plot is mostly sound, and any flaws are insignificant enough to be ignored. Simply put, its exciting, hilarious, and fun for anyone to watch. Whether you like action, comedy, or drama, this movie has something everyone will enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Explosive retirement,"It's nothing new for a film to be based on a comic book. With Marvel now having its own studio and Christopher Nolan unable to finish an interview without talk of Batman, I think it is fair to say that we are a society inundated with comics. These films have a pretty developed audience of young fanboys. Red is a comic book film for a different audience. The film is without a doubt enjoyable and features an incredible cast, but it is a comic book film made for those in cardigans not vintage tees.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), a former black-ops CIA agent, is having a rough time adjusting to retirement. In his life of boredom, he begins a phone relationship with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), a customer service agent working for his pension office. One night Frank's old life intrudes into his new one as a hit squad descends on his house. After disposing of his would-be killers, he heads to Kansas City to protect Sarah. In order to better assess and deal with his risk of death, Frank decides to get his black-ops team back together. With the help of his old friends, Frank has to figure out who wants him dead and why, all while avoiding CIA agent Cooper (Karl Urban) who is hot on his tails.In my hometown, there is a small art theater. I always knew of the theater and that it played smaller films that often were looked over by the larger multiplexes, but even after having a bit of a film awakening in my freshman year of college I never took the leap and bought a ticket. That was until two months ago when I plunged into the place I had always eyed skeptically from afar. As I ventured in, I was smacked in the face by the smell of mothballs. I told my nose to relax and pushed forward. My way was now blocked by a group of ladies, bearing a striking similarity to the Golden Girls, on an afternoon out. While walking down the aisle of the theater I noticed that I was being stared down. Eyes from all around locked onto me until I had settled into my seat. The reason: my age. I was easily 35 years younger than every other member of the audience. It was an odd feeling to say the least, a completely unique film-going experience. Nevertheless, it did open my eyes a bit. Previously I had a caricature of the elderly constantly pooh-poohing the films of today. ""I miss the real movie stars"" ""everything is just so loud"" ""what's with all the colors"", the voices would sing in my head. But wait there are actually older folks that still enjoy going to the films of today. Seeing Red bolstered this theory.I saw this film with my parents and during this time there was but one group that featured individuals younger than 20, the rest of the audience was above 40. It may have been this particular audience that so influenced my experience of the film. Putting that aside I will say that I liked the film, but not as much as the people surrounding me. I was shocked by the collective excitement expressed when Ernest Borgnine appeared on screen. In retrospect, this makes perfect sense. While Red is a comic book film with copious action, featuring gunfire, fistfights, car chases and explosions it is also a discussion of the nature of retirement. Willis' character misses his old life and is grasping for things to fill his now empty life of retirement. He is clearly unhappy and it isn't until his life is threatened that you really see the twinkle come back into his eyes. I can't understand retirement as a threat, so this aspect of the film is somewhat lost on me.The action is good but not anything special. There aren't really any moments that truly stand out as exceptional action set pieces. One gunfight does feature some pretty great bits from John Malkovich and huge explosions but nothing new. The story at times feels like an afterthought with some third act developments that are a bit forced. You will be entertained but that's all thanks to the cast.Oh, have I not mentioned the cast? Just writing the cast list is amazing. I don't know about you, but deep down I have always wanted to see Helen Mirren shoot a machine gun. Then you have Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis, John Malkovich adding some insane comedy and Morgan Freeman just kind of hanging out. It's nice to see Mirren and Malkovich so deftly handling the action since I can't remember another time that they have had the opportunity. I could gush over Mary-Louise Parker but I'm not sure how much is her being good and how much is my crush on her. Karl Urban kicks some ass too. If there is a weak member of the cast, I don't remember him.What if the cast of Cocoon used to be in the CIA? Now I don't know how many people have been asking that question, but Red seeks to answer it. With a mediocre story and generic action set pieces, the cast is the film's saving grace. Without this cast, the film would have sucked. Malkovich is all kinds of funny as the mentally unstable team member, and Mirren's comfort with automatic weapons will leave you wondering why she doesn't do this more often. Red may not be the topic of conversation come awards season but the cast makes sure that you get your money's worth.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A color lost in the shuffle,"Hollywood has crossed a threshold of tolerance in creative redundancy, and Red serves as a great example. Sure, it's based on a DC Comics graphic novel that was out years ago and had it been released as a feature film any other year we wouldn't be having this conversation. But now, in 2010, we have a succession of like movies pouring into theatres and Red is lost in the shuffle.Frank (Bruce Willis) is living a boring life in retirement, as observed through the obligatory daily routine montage (an apparent domestic independent filmmaker must these days). He spends his free time reaching out over the phone to Sarah (Mary-Louise Park), who becomes as target due to association. You see Frank is RED, a CIA operative who is classified as retired extremely dangerous, and someone wants him dead. This forces Frank to meet-up with his old pals Joe (Morgan Freeman), Victoria (Helen Mirren), and Marvin (John Malkovich) .Together they fight their way to the top of the CIA in the name of getting their lives back to normal.Two positives stand out. For one the cast is rich with well-known talents who don't drop the ball. Mirren and Freeman could use more screen time; while the former makes it count, I'm afraid the latter is served up with negligible material. Red has some mildly amusing scenes, and I think what helps nudge it along the correct path is the mature cast. Otherwise I can't find a unique concept. Some of the action is clean and easy to comprehend, generally effective. Some gags are worthy of a grin, but nothing more. Red isn't working overtime to raise the bar.The theme of government killers being hunted by their former employer has been greatly exploited this year; I think Hollywood is trying to enforce a human rights view. It's not right for me to place the blame on Red, but I am reminded of At The Movies when Siskel and Ebert judged Predator as an inferior Aliens clone. Maybe if The Losers was a critical slam dunk last year we could point and scream (coincidence that both have an explosive scene amid shipping containers?)Since this subgenre overload has come all at once, it's impossible to single out one as the cheat. Nonetheless there is some fatigue in repeatedly seeing the same treatment played out before you. Even if Red came first, I wasn't having the knee-slapping good time the generic muzak score was suggesting. **",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The Losers, The A-Team, The Expendables....RED.","R.E.D stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. That's what has been tagged to Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and he is a target of a hit. The ones trying to kill him underestimated his skills and he is out on a mission to find out who is trying to kill him and his maybe girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker). So he rounds up the gang and they set out to find out who is behind everything.RED is pretty much exactly like the other films I mentioned before (Losers, A-Team, Expendables) with only difference is that this film's angle is that the people who are dangerous are retired old people. The cast has Bruce Willis, doing his John McClane thing without the one-liners and more precision. Morgan Freeman pulling his Wanted role but in a good guy role. John Malkovich playing a retired CIA test subject that has been given daily doses of LSD for 11 some odd years. He seems like one of the Malkovich's that crawled out of the tunnel to his body in Being John Malkovich. Helen Mirren, in an offbeat choice. She plays sexy and dangerous and can hold her own against the boys. Karl Urban is the lead CIA officer sent to take them out, he plays his assassin role from Bourn Supremacy. He follows orders, not knowing if he is doing good or bad. Of course we have the Mary-Louise Parker character, who is like the audience, not knowing any of these things we are experiencing and are along for the ride.Malkovich steals the show. He plays the role of conspiracy nut with a gun very well. He's off kilter and has the funniest bits in the film. The film is based on a comic book so you can expect over the top action and stunts. A revolver showdown versus a bazooka? Check. Playing baseball with a grenade? Check. Casually exiting a vehicle spinning out of control and nearly getting hit by the bumper while shooting at another vehicle and not blink an eye? Check. RED is over the top and funny. If you enjoyed The Losers or the A-team, Red is more of the same.I enjoyed it, the plot revolves around a cover up and an old job that comes to bite those RED members in the behind. The twists it tries to give us is half baked but forgivable because the film is, overall an enjoyment. I must criticize the relationship between Bruce Willis and Mary- Louise Parker, it doesn't seem fleshed out enough to be taken at face value. They chit chat over the phone and he kidnaps her to protect her from people who are trying to kill her because he has had so many phone conversations with her. She ends up liking the thrill and excitement of his life, yet he says that she makes him feel like he can have a normal life. This conflict is never resolved or brought up again.Morgan Freeman doesn't have enough screen time and the role could have been played by virtually anyone. Karl Urban is a likable guy, I seem to appreciate his role in everything he does, even if the film turns out to be uneven. He's good here too jumping onto moving vehicles to catch other moving vehicles (did I mention this film is over the top?)RED is enjoyable and like I said, fans of those previously mentioned films will get a kick out of this one. It blends comedy and action well enough to pass the time. It's enjoyment hangs on the fact that these old people are kicking ass. It works. I keep mentioning how over the top it is, but it never reaches the heights of the over the topness of the A-Team. If that is any indication of this style of violence. I forgot to mention Brian Cox, he plays a Russian who becomes an integral part of the 'team'. Poor guy is nowhere to be seen in the promotional ads for the film and yet he has more screen time than Freeman. Anyways, RED is good popcorn fun. It's problems are obvious ones for a film like this, but the direction is slick and the film is funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I'd like to marry Dame Helen,"The thing is, I usually have high expectations for Bruce Willis movies. Stuff's gonna get blowed up. I like that. I also have an affinity for movies involving multiple Oscar-nominated actors. But too often I'm disappointed. The actors have no chemistry, and the stuff blowing up is of little consequence. But Red was different. I found it impressively exciting – a fairly straightforward plot helped along by fun, inventive effects and truly wonderful acting.Willis plays Frank Moses, a retired former CIA agent who happens to be falling in love with the voice of the woman (Mary-Louise Parker) who's responsible for making sure his pension checks are sent. Frank intentionally rips up his checks just so he can call back and talk to Sarah some more. Okay, that's a little weird, but innocuous enough.Shortly after introduced to Frank and Sarah, a hit squad shows up at Franks home and basically destroys it, and thus our hero is on the run from whoever. He naturally travels to Kansas City to find Sarah, because he's pretty sure that the baddies who went after him had been monitoring his longish conversations with said bureaucratic wonk. Sarah's not exactly down with this strange man visiting her in the middle of the night and then taking her on a Grand Adventure, but since we know Frank's a good guy, we're sure she'll come around.Turns out, quickly enough, that someone is out to kill not only Frank but members of his old team, something about an event that occurred in Guatemala in 1981. The team, all retired, reunites to figure out what the bejeepers is going on. Frank tracks down Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Marvin (John Malkovich) and brings in Victoria (Helen Mirren), formerly of MI6. Object: break into their former place of work (CIA!) and find out what's what.Pretty standard stuff. Will the romance between Sarah and Frank? Will the team discover a Grander Conspiracy that involves some of the highest-ranking people in American politics? Will all of the team members survive? Will we discover that the guy who's supposed to take them down (Karl Urban) isn't, in fact, the baddest bad guy? Easy to figure out. But that's not the kind of movie this is supposed to be, one that needs figuring. It's an action movie with touches of comedy and quite a bit of surprising heart.The biggest asset that the movie has is its cast. It's not typical for actors who have done well by themselves in other movies to become a cohesive unit in an ensemble movie like this. Sometimes the actors try to outshine – outact – each other, as if to prove they are just that good. As a result, the movie suffers; the plot is relegated to the background, and everyone chews scenery. End of story.Ain't so here. These guys seem like they're long-lost friends. Willis and Freeman were infamously in the terrible Bonfire of the Vanities some twenty years ago, and Malkovich and Mirren sort of worked on The Hitchhiker's Guide, but that's about it. Mirren herself is really exceptional – no surprise – as a sharpshooter with her own colorful past.Any movie that makes me realize how awesome even dumb movies can be is a winning movie. Red is an escapist movie. You don't watch it to see an intricate mystery; you go to see a slam-dunk, bang-up good time. And that's what you get.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Red,"I do have no idea this film is another adaption from a comic series, Retired Extremely Dangerous, a group of retired special agents vs. a wipe-out scheme. It is highly tantalizing for me to see Dame Helen Mirren shooting machine guns in her blonde hair, maybe the trailer should take the blame as it is a bit misleading, the film turns out to be just another plain comedy with a little piece of action, which is far from meeting my satisfaction, I don't regret to watch the film, but after a second afterthought, the film is too mediocre with many details worth deeper excavating.The cast is my primary reason to watch the film, however, nothing is pleasantly surprised, John Malkovich is as insane as a scene stealer (whose role is to offer comic elements), Bruce Willis is the only action star, who had undertaken the sole close combat with Karl Urban in the middle of the film. The loving couple Helen Mirren and Brian Cox serve as sidekicks alone, poor Mary-Louise Parker gave a safe performance which barely suits her character as the love interest of Bruce. The villain Richard Dreyfuss looks like an older version of Leonard in THE BIG BANG THEORY. As for Morgan Freeman, he was hardly there in the film.The film was nominated for the Best Comedy/Musical Film in the Golden Globe this year, which had ironically proved how ridiculous the Golden Globe could be, even the notorious BURLESQUE and THE TOURIST (2010) also got the nominations in the same category.

So once more poor Morgan Freeman is squandered.Besides his old buddies, Bruce takes along Mary-Louise Parker, a telephone operator at the agency that manages his pension. He's fallen in love with her voice. He says she has to go on the run with him because her life is in danger. Of course. Her life will be much safer with the target of thousands of rounds of automatic weapon fire. The villains in thrillers couldn't play Duck Shot on Atari. And the good guys are only any better because the screenwriter is the god exercising deus ex machina for your viewing pleasure, not because they've endowed their characters with any brains or inner life to speak of.This celluloid vacuum isn't even close to as skillful as it acts like it is. It runs out of steam not even 15 minutes in and begins repeating itself, and the deficiency of a persuasive plot thread doesn't alleviate this syndrome. The film's over-the-topness does not excuse unanswered questions like why not a single neighbor not only looks outside or calls the police but even turns on their lights after Willis' house is completely destroyed by an entire tactical team armed with machine guns they unload various times? Why do the bad guys want our grizzled group dead? I sincerely cannot recall. Why does Mamet's beautiful and underused wife Rebecca Pidgeon, playing the zealous handler of our team's main CIA adversary, send this top agent of hers into a top-secret archive to get a highly classified report which she knows exposes absolutely nothing? If a notoriously effective CIA assassin is so inordinately good at what he does, why does he sit his kidnap victim in the back of his car with duct tape over her mouth while driving busy roads long distance? Why does Willis infiltrate a character's home to hold a family hostage and then leave without achieving anything? Why am I still sitting here even halfway through, still watching this? If a spoilsport evaluator has the nerve to spotlight that Willis is risking a stranger's life for no worthy reason and that ditzy Parker never raises a sincere protest about it, defenders will respond that an action comedy doesn't have to make sense if it's got enough, you know, action and comedy. But the action is a flaccid miscellany of slo-mo and CGI, and save for Malkovich, who's intermittently useful as a madcap LSD martyr, the comedy comprises cheesy, ineffectual backbiting rather than incisive remarks about age or espionage.I think middle-aged and older folks are supposed to enjoy this abject nonsense, because it's ceaselessly trying to manipulate us with music and contrived revelation how clever it thinks its retired characters are, and that they've ""still got it,"" but the joke is on this movie because it's just as inexhaustibly stupid and utterly routine as any number of Michael Bay, John Cena or Vin Diesel vehicles those little shavers guzzle down. The only difference is that this one can't decide whether it's a farce or a retread.In one scene, Mirren is shot and a blood stain spreads on her white dress. In a closing scene not a day later, she's perfectly chipper and has had time to send the dress out to the cleaners. A story is about diligence, attention to detail, not shortcuts and the path of least resistance to all the big bangs. But what is so maddening about this movie is not its storytelling flaws and anti-intellectual cheesiness, but that the overseers at Summit and DC Entertainment know it. And every coveted master performer in its amazing cast knows it too. It's all a big flex of Hollywood's muscle, reminding us that no matter how increasingly hard it is to get a truthful human story made out there, how many personal visions are squandered and artistic visions are rejected, the bigwigs can in a time of recession take $60 million, effortlessly gather the most eye-popping jamboree of great actors we've ever seen and crap all over our faces. And make their money back. So they can do it again. And again.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Old style butt kicking,"Red – Review My rating – 3/5I'd like to call RED a comedy more than a thriller. Coz if you expect to see a thriller you will expect it to be serious. RED is not that serious thriller. True it has thundering big explosions and million rounds of ammunition released towards a house until it falls down but that's all doesn't seems to be 'that' serious.RED has a league of retired special black ops team members kicking young people's butts. Maybe all the old dudes would love it if the world is like that. But in reality I don't think so. The plot is about Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) , a retired special ops member from CIA trying to get in to the roots of reasons why some people are trying to assassinate him and his old buddies. And I don't know how but his so called girl friend who he has fallen in love for her voice also thinks that it's a good idea to tag alone. Either she is completely dumb or insanely stupid or both.So while Frank is on his 'quest' he gather few of his good old days assassination buddies to the ride and make a hell of a scenes in few places. He practically sneak in to the CIA like it's another usual government office (Along with his dumb/stupid girlfriend) to check on some of his old operation files. And then instantly plan and executive a massive kidnap plan which vice president of USA is the target. Don't get amused. It's a comedy after all. Especially when there is 'Rajini Kanth' style action all over I'd bet all my chips on Frank.Packed with heaven high explosions and bullet exchanges time to time RED is not a bad movie after all. But it's not a good movie either. You decide!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mary-Louis Parker best part of the movie,"Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a retired CIA operative living out his life in a nondescript suburb. He is what's considered RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous). His only joy comes from calling his pension call center rep Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker). He actually ask her out, but then a team of expert soldiers comes to kill him.The best part of the movie is Parker's indignant response to Bruce Willis kidnapping her. She's the best part of the movie. It's the part of the movie that they need to keep at its center.Bruce Willis is playing the cool detached persona. It doesn't make for an energetic character. It's cool to see for awhile especially when he's teamed up with Parker. But her character's role diminishes as more old timers get rounded up.The action is over the top as expected. Other than who however, there isn't much to distinguish this cartoon action from all the other cartoon action.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Would Be Rememorable but . . .,"Walking into Red, I had high hopes. I was excited to see a movie with an older cast full of some of my—and also my parents'—favorites. Bruce Willis is Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who is trying to uncover a very high-tech and somewhat unoriginal government conspiracy theory. He hunts down his old pals that he fought with in his ""glory days."" The crew includes old chipper Morgan Freeman as Joe, paranoid John Malkovich as Boggs, and the glamorous ""goddess,"" Helen Mirren. Some of the higher points of the film were Bruce and Karl Urban's bloody fistfight in the middle of the CIA headquarters, Helen Mirren's gun-obsessed character, Victoria, and Malkovich's crazy persona, which fits perfectly into a stereotypical retired government secret agent. One of the downers was the unnecessary character of Mary Louise-Parker. Really? Why did these filmmakers stick a skanky (sorry for the language, Ms. Platter), young damsel-in-distress in the midst of an intense action flick? She seemed out of place, especially since she is young enough to be Bruce Willis' daughter. The make-out scene at the end was way too much to handle. This detail proved to be one of the deciding factors of the film, which disappointed me even more. The plot revolved around the track down of the people on the VP's hit list, and less about the development of the plan to take out the vice president himself. It was no 24, but I still expected Jack Bauer to pop out of one of those shiny black Escalades any minute, carrying a grenade launcher. I guess Bauer wasn't old enough to land a part in this movie. Overall I'll give this film a solid 6.5/10 for the excellent acting, but brought down by unnecessary characters and a clipped screenplay.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dull moments? Code RED.,"October 2010. If movies about social networking sites and mishmashes are what passes for ""A truly cinematic experience"" nowadays, I guess you could count me out. That is, until I noticed that a movie I never saw any trailers for, and full of stars, called RED was out. Easily taken in before I read anything about its plot, I went and saw it. That blind watch I'm definitely proud of! RED is clichéd in terms of story- a retired agent has his house destroyed by a secret agency and makes for the next state, picking up some friends along the way in an all-out, over-the-top action adventure. But as cliché as it is, RED is also just fun. We have Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis (in the tough guy role as usual), the chick from Weeds, Helen Mirren- all are fantastic. There's plenty of over-the-top action that's fun, it's hilarious, and overall it's a fun movie if all you ask for is just some pure escapist fun.In the end, RED is definitely not art or Oscar material, but it is one of the most fun movies of 2010, and recommended for some pure entertainment!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"RED stands for: Really Entertaining, Dude!","Short n' Sweet: Awesome. I just came back from watching it. Exactly as I was expecting, FUNNY, ACTION, ENTERTAINING. What else you really expect? Honestly, why the hell do we go to movies? Despite our tastes, we expect value for the time and money. Well good news, this one has both. I really laughed for the first time after ""Burn after reading"". Good (but a bit predictable) plot, bunch of shiny stars with good chemistry and finally if I want to summarized into one word I would say: John Malkovich! He is the ACE in this title. Seeing lady Mirren so comfy behind that gigantic machine gun, was A blast. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A rip roarin' good time,"A team of Ex- Intelligence operatives come out of retirement when they're lazy days are disturbed by pesky assassins. Led by Frank (Bruce Willis) the team marked RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) reorganizes to embark on one last mission.It's interesting that all of the stars have at one point played an assassin in their acting career; Helen Mirren – Shadow Boxer, Bruce Willis – The Jackal, Morgan Freeman – Wanted and The Contract, John Malkovich – In the Line of Fire. Upon seeing the trailer I got a chuckle because those where the characters that came to mind. Granted those bad guys didn't ride off into to the sunset to live a happy retirement. But this is a cool premise to show that even though a person may not be 25 years old they can still be formidable adversaries.All are now retired trying to live peaceful, relatively normal lives. But sometimes the past just doesn't go away. Frank must find out who is killing former operatives and why. With the help of Joe (Morgan Freeman) they follow the trail that leads them to smarmy arms dealer Alexander Dunning (Richard Dreyfuss). Wow, when was the last time Richard Dreyfuss was in a movie? With Hollywood being so youth driven, it's nice to see some older folks taking center stage. It's not every day that you see the over 50 crowd shooting guns and blowing up stuff. This movie was so fun. The quirky characters are a scream. Seeing Helen Mirren, the queen for goodness sake, shooting a gun so gigantic that it may as well have been a cannon was worth the ticket price alone.John Malkovich's paranoia keeps the audience chuckling with his crazy eyes and mannerisms. His scene at the ship yards highlights that he is still a bad ass. Mary Louise-Parker does a wonderful job as the wide-eyed ditzy love interest of Frank, Sara. Frank has been pretending not to receive his pension checks in order to talk with Sara, the customer service representative, on the phone. With his phone is probably bugged the bad guys know he likes her. So Frank ""kidnaps"" Sara for her own safety. Somehow these two seem a perfect fit; the customer service agent and retired spy/assassin. Yep, sounds right to me, haha.In true action movie fashion we see that Bruce, the youngest of the team, has still got it in a scene when he goes one on one with Karl Urban. There's nothing like a little hand to hand combat. There is plenty of shattered glass, punches you can feel in the audience and broken bones.The storyline was a little weak but it was enough to keep things moving. The idea is that the Vice President has ordered exterminations due to their involvement in an operation many years ago. Yeah whatever, the ultimate draw is watching these guys kill. In a nutshell, go see Red, enjoyable characters and premise. It's worth the dough.www.rivareviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dialogue is appalling,"nothing makes the dire dialogue of this film more evident than the collection of excellent actors assembled to deliver it.i don't often comment on this site, but i urge anyone about to sit down to this film to do themselves a favour and avoid it at all costs. for the first twenty minutes, it sounded like this script had been written by a child. every line was delivered with an attempt to disguise it's misgivings with added sincerity, which only went further to emphasise the lack of quality in the written words. the fight scenes are ridiculous (the film's only redeeming feature) but even these you don't feel are part of the film's self-deprecating irony. a stupid, god-awful film. avoid.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gets the comic tone just right to make it an enjoyable action movie with its tongue in its cheek,"I first heard about this film when Bruce Willis appeared on the Daily Show. The clip they used was the one where Willis steps out of the spinning police car and is narrowly missed by it as he calmly opens fire on his assailant. On the face of it the clip looked ridiculously overblown and the special effects used weren't great either and it didn't look real (which didn't help with it looking daft either). On the strength of this I wasn't fussed about seeing another film where obvious special effects make the impossible appear possible while the audience are left with nothing but spectacle. Despite this I wound up seeing it this weekend and have to admit that the clip does work in context even if it doesn't as a standalone.The difference is that the film gets the tone just right and makes it easy to enjoy by having its tongue in its cheek for most of the time. This is essential in a film where we are expected to believe that retired agents over 50 years old can still beat all challengers and pull off ridiculous feats such as shooting a missile in mid-flight with a pinpoint shot. I'm sure some will not get this humour and therefore the film will not work but for me I found myself quickly charmed by the good-humoured nature of it and I found it very easy to enjoy as it delivered solid action with a knowing wink. Plot-wise it is just as silly but again this is carried along by the fact that it is enjoyable and quite fun.The script is a big part of it and it hands the cast some nice banter which is a big part of the film being fun. They respond to it well, even if more could have been made of the age thing. Willis is a necessary evil but one that works. His wise-cracking personae and his ability to wryly undermine himself while also doing action means that he is perfect for this sort of film but the downside is that part of the ""concept"" is that the main characters are old and retired. Yes, Willis is old but at the same time we are used to seeing him be old and invincible in other films (where we are asked not to see this as an issue) so it is perhaps a jump to expect him to fit in as ""old"" here. He does work well with Parker though, who herself is good value as she ""gets"" what the film is doing. Malkovich is enjoyably manic while Mirren, Freeman and Borgnine are solid. I liked Urban's supporting turn.Overall Red is not a brilliant film, it is not something people will rave about for years to come. However what it does do it easily entertain. The action is solid but the comic tone is key and it gets this just right – never being dumb but never taking itself too seriously either. It is what it is and it is well done for the genre – a good Saturday night movie.",,Anonymous,Crime
Punches above its weight.,"Red must've been a blast to make. The entire cast look like they enjoyed it immensely. It's not a surprise really. I'm sure they thought their gun-toting days were well and truly over. Dame Helen Mirren's list of things to achieve in her illustrious career probably didn't feature shooting a massive automatic weapon at dozens of Secret Service agents. I doubt Malkovich considered he would be swatting grenades with the butt of a rifle at the ripe old age of 57. To be fair, Willis has still been kicking around the last couple of years with underwhelming actioners like Surrogates and Cop Out, but this is a welcome return to form for him at any rate. The younglings, Parker and Urban, look chuffed to share screen time with the seasoned vets as well, although Parker's 'confused waif' persona grinds on the nerves very quickly.Those expecting the family-friendly, Space Cowboys level of action will be in for a shock. Red is not soft. Although very funny in parts and featuring a tongue-in-cheek vibe throughout – Jon and Erich Hoeber's humorous script deserves credit for that – Red is an action flick first and foremost. Featuring one of the most hard-hitting fight sequences this year – Willis and Urban's bruising office melee – this graphic-novel adaptation doesn't hold back. More importantly though the set pieces convince, thanks to respectable CGI, well-staged gun fights and stirring camera work. And the sound design is loud. Very loud. Perhaps to accommodate the seniors groups who unwisely choose this as their monthly Morgan Freeman movie.Different – and better – than expected. This sneaky blockbuster punches above its weight and below its age.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Power-Packed Action Movie With The Factor Of Love!,"Only because someone told me about RED 2, that I watched this. And boy, was I not impressed?Bruce Willis is amazing as the action hero who kicks ass with his oldie friend group to get back what he has only achieved recently. What sets off as a mystery, then turns out to be an action beauty with trips & turns, explosions, gun-slinging, snipers & RPGs, CIA & SS, oh God!Music is the attraction of this movie with an extra applause to the screenplay. The initial sequence involving Bruce's real identity is magnificent. And the background music is cool! Locations are exotic and the postcard depiction is inventive. Someone rightly said that this should have been the real Expendables. Still, with a small plot hole in this fantastic vividness of action genre, I would recommend it because we have Morgan freeman and the lady here is hot. John Malkovich is crazily genuine as editing is sufficient. 7/10BOTTOM LINE: Get that DVD/Bluray NOW!

Passably entertaining action flick with a great cast,"""Red"" is certainly familiar and nothing exactly fresh, but it's passably entertaining and action-packed with a really solid cast of veteran actors playing...veterans.Bruce Willis does one of his typical tough-guy roles as a retired CIA agent living a life of seclusion, quiet but observant of his surroundings, when he is suddenly targeted to be killed along with his old crew (which includes Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich). Mary-Louise Parker joins them on their adventure as a mandatory romantic interest, given little to do other than a variation of her airhead character from ""Weeds,"" and there are nice supporting roles from veteran actors such as Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine, the latter of the two being 90 years old and still going strong.Rising star Karl Urban is the semi-villain of the film, a government agent trying to chase Willis and his gang down before they assassinate a political figure (for reasons I won't spoil), and his is probably the least predictable character; he's introduced early on as a straightforward baddie and you think you can expect what might happen to him, but he takes a more sympathetic turn halfway through the picture.The cast has a lot of fun with the material -- Malkovich in particular, who chews up the scenery with gusto as an agent that was fed daily doses of LSD for years and has completely lost his mind -- and the movie sets itself up nicely for a sequel, but it's not really necessary. This is ultimately a been-there, done-that action film that is probably a little too pleased with itself at times, never quite as fresh or stylish as it thinks it is, but it brings enough to the table -- and has a solid enough cast to back it up -- that it's worth the time.

Forgetful wacky action movie,"This is one of those wacky action movies that is also very forgetful. Yeah it did have it's moments and was fun at times, but almost everything in this movie has been done before and nothing really stood out much. I first read the comic book which this movie is loosely based on and wondered how they were going to make a movie out of a super short comic book. The answer is add more characters, more wacky action and comedy while the comic book is dark and gritty and add more story involving the conspiracy and such. And some stuff that wasn't answered in the comic book or left unanswered on purpose is shown in the movie. There is also barely any character development in this and the girl that Bruce Willis's character falls for is more annoying than funny or fun character to watch. Some critics liked heard in this, I personally didn't. Yes, the movie is wacky at times and it also tries to be funny, but it really isn't at all. The character interactions was okay and kinda enjoyable at times though and the action isn't that good but it's alright.

"Great fun, but a little old and predictable","First up, I have to say that when I entered the theatre I thought I had just walked in a retirement home. Sorry grandpa.

It was certainly fun to watch and hear the fifty and sixty years old couples in front of me clapping and laughing. For the action part, I give it a 5 giving today's action standard. The story line kind of vague, and giving this is a DC Comics adaptation, I find it surprisingly boring. However, Bruce, Morgan, John and Helen, wow, what can I say. Put them together, it is like an acting university with every genre you can imagine. Individually, they are unbelievable. All together, no matter how bad the other actors are and how weird certain moments are, they simply make you feel great and nod and smile and laugh and whatever you feel like doing. I will happily surrender my $12.50 again to watch them in action. Also surprisingly good is the funny and wacky Marie Lou Parker and of course Brian Cox. I want to say that the acting is at least an 8. But that will be unfair. Because for these guys and ladies, they don't need to act. So there you have it. It is a fun movie.

There's no pro like an old pro!,"After seeing the cast list for this action comedy, I was so intrigued I had to watch it. Brucie, we all understand. His last couple of action comedies have been disappointing though so a real return to form is most welcome, Hail to the King, Baby! Morgan, perfect in support both for action & comedy. I enjoy everything he turns his hand to and he's having a blast all the way. John Malcovich, consummate actor playing for laughs and having a ball. Surprising, Inspiring, Brilliant. GREAT casting choice. Brian Cox, another favourite who's support adds weight to the whole shebang (I'm somewhat biased hailing from the same toon!) The always impeccable Ernest Borgnine has still got it! Dame Helen wielding heavy weapons?!!! The scriptwriters hit me for 6 with that premise. The last time I laughed out loud at the mere description of a film was Arnie & and Danny DeVito in 'Twins'! None of the above cast list is a new face. We've all got a view on what we have & haven't enjoyed seeing them do on the big screen so you kind of expect them to play to their strengths...& there's no disappointment, everybody does. However, something magical happens when actors at the top of their game just decide to have fun with what could have just been a reasonably funny script. There's a genuine chemistry, warmth and comedic performance above and beyond the ordinary with this gang. Nobody has to try too hard, it just comes naturally. Just to add to that joy, they're ably supported by the younger team of players. The interplay, hooks and playoffs move the story along with aplomb. What makes it stand out is almost every scene you can see they're having fun. There's some unexpected twists, Morgan's part throws up some surprises but let's face it the BIG surprise is the world's sexiest sixty year old Helen Mirren wielding the cake tray then the heavy weaponry?!! Did I mention she's sexy?I adored Mary-Louise Parker who was Brucie's love interest but Dame Helen, it's not just the acting chops.There's an old story in Hollywood that actors can still get the roles until they're well past their prime but actresses are all washed up once they're 40. Can someone PLEASE sit EVERY casting director in the world in front of this film then because I would like to speak on behalf of the entire male population of the world (& probably most women) i.e. that audience you're trying to attract. There's not a living, breathing male on the planet doesn't recognise beauty and talent...today it goes by the name of DAME HELEN MIRREN.

HILARIOUS Romantic action comedy!,"Just got back from the theater.I can't remember that last time I have so THOROUGHLY ENJOYED myself! There is a 'vibe' to this film that if you can go with it, will bring a smile to your face for 2 hours.It's actually a very gentle film - despite all the explosions and guns a blaring. It's also a tender lover story (a couple of them, really) - but all encased in a gentle and funny action comedy.The plot has to do with retired assassins, but what makes the film work is the acting, direction, timing and dialog. Every frame is filled with a wink and a nudge and a smile.There are gut busting scenes, but mainly just a lot of smiles and small laughter that are gingerly peppered across the film.While there is action, I would definitely not call this an action film. Die hard action junkies will be disappointed.If you want to see a sweet film, full of laughs, warmth, witty dialog, great acting and lots of explosions and gun fights - this is the film to see.I think all the actors were great - it's hard to pinpoint any single great performance.

Incoming... But failing to leave much of an impact!,"I had no idea what this movie was about and hadn't actually heard about it before my friend suggested that I saw it, so I did. And truth be told, then I was left with a somewhat empty feeling.Alright, well the movie is not a bad movie, far from it. There was a lot of really nice action scenes and they were spiced with just enough comedy to make it interesting. I was especially amused by the grenade launcher scene and the ""grenade baseball"" scene, those were just priceless. And also seeing Helen Mirren with a huge caliber machine gun like that, that was just beyond your wildest imagination. This is where the comedy kicked in and it worked well.As for the cast and their acting. Well, blow me away and shiver me timbers; this movie was packed with huge names and lots of amazing talents. But honestly, I didn't think Bruce Willis carried this movie, and it was somewhat a reminiscent of ""Cop Out"" to watch him in this movie, which kind of brought the enjoyment of the movie down a notch for me. But Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren they carried this movie and they put on amazing performances in their roles. The roles played by Karl Urban was also good, though I am not much of a fan of his, but he still did a good job in this movie.What didn't work in this movie, besides Bruce Willis, was the story. It was a bit weak and didn't have enough punch to come through with the impact that it needed. For me, it was a relatively empty excitement I got out of the movie, and I was sitting at the end of the movie thinking ""why? was this movie really necessary to have been made?"" But hey, we are all different individuals and have different likes and dislikes. And I am sure that lots of people out there will find ""Red"" to be quite a kick, and go for it guys.Yet again I think about the grenade launcher and ""grenade baseball"" scenes, they were by far the most memorable throughout the entire movie.For an evening of action where you don't have to put your mind to much work, the movie ""Red"" might be a good choice to go with.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Falls apart in the second half,"Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is bored. A former CIA agent of great importance now living off of retirement, the highlight of his day is when he calls Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), his benefits representative whom he flirts with. Things take an exciting turn, however, when a hit squad breaks into his house and attempts to kill him. After putting down his new foes, Frank then sets off across the country to round up all of his old comrades (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren) as he tries to figure out who's trying to kill them and why.Similar to ""The A-Team"" and ""The Losers"", ""Red"" is all about stylized action. It revels in its ridiculousness and has a fine appreciation for over-the-top explosions. Based on a graphic novel, 'Red"" doesn't waste time with such issues as reloading, collateral damage, or the laws of physics, something I can certainly admire when done correctly. ""Red"" left me feeling a bit cheated, though. This movie is a lot of fun but it could have done so much more with the premise. The misuse of such a great cast is criminal. Willis is excellent, bringing visions of an older, more mature, but still awesome version of John McClane. Everyone else seems to be mismatched or out-of-sync as they just aren't given much to do. I have no idea why Morgan Freeman was cast in the first place. If you're not going to use Morgan Freeman then why bother adding him to the equation? Likewise, the story is jumpy, going from place to place, event to event, without much development or wrap-up. It's a bit like a video game as our heroes (or anti-heroes as the case may be) go from level to level. And just like ""The Losers"", ""Red"" lacks a compelling villain which could have helped me overlook the movie's other flaws. It has its moments (mostly in the first half), not to mention an excellent supporting part from Bryan Cox, and I can't deny the entertainment value as a whole. I simply expect an action movie with this level of talented actors to provide me more than above average entertainment.Check out my site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",,Anonymous,Crime
"Better than I expected, worse than what it could have been...","The title of my review says it all. Bruce Willis starts in another mediocre movie. This time seems to be the typical corporate espionage type of movie, of course mixed up with comedy, hilarious action scenes, undeveloped but ridiculous characters and the last but not the least... a crappy story for a fun-to-watch movie. This movie is entertaining but at the same time it could have been much more than that. This movie could have been a little bit smarter, wiser and why not funnier. The story itself is pretty much the same. CIA agents trapped in some ""conspiracy"" thing, they try to take the matter in their own hands and solve the problem, they succeed and the guy gets the girl. Nothing new. What I was impressed though was the delivery of those key moments in a movie which were timed very good to keep the audience interested in the movie.As for the casting, Bruce Willis did what he always does being the character-actor he is, but Bruce was not the guy who stole the show. John Malkovich takes that easily. Each scene he's in was hilarious and the way he played (again a typical JM character) that agent was fun to watch. The dialogue was pretty good, there were some very good jokes but every now and then you got the cheesy one that made you go from ""ha-ha-ha"" to ""hm-hm-hm"". The rest of the cast was OK, nothing being good nor bad even though I just couldn't find Mary-Louise Parker attractive and fit for her role but maybe that's just me. As for the action-scenes, there were some (many?) of them which were screaming for attention and hilarity but at the end I guess you could get over it since this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. I could name this movie as being ""The Losers Meets Burn After Reading"" because, in fact, this movie has the stupid action scenes from The Losers, the crappy story from the Losers and it also has the delivery from Burn After Reading and the thin humor.As far the technical part, the editing was the stand-out, the music was so and so, started good turned bad getting better turned worse and so on, the cinematography was pretty much average and one thing irritated me so bad: those postcard crossovers between the cities. I mean, it looked so lame from my point of view and the ending was just ""mehhh""... but then again that's maybe just me.The final take on this movie is that it's a entertaining movie where you don't need to pay attention to the story too much. This is easily a matinée or a rental (as the guys from spill would say) I recommend it for anyone who is lazy and wants just to watch something fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Decent Willis vehicle,"This film brings nothing new to the genre (old codgers show they still got spunk, like the last thirty years of the life of almost-eternal George Burns in art and in life). I don't however agree with some of the extremely negative reviews. Yes, it may be hard to see great actors like Mirren and Freeman hamming it up, but what the hell, they looked like they were having fun, and we all know that good roles aren't that easy for ageing stars – Mirren can hardly redo Elizabeth, can she? Sure, the thing is full of clichés, and there are several improbable segues. But we're all supposed to be grown ups by now, having seen a gadzillion Bourne type flicks, so we know that all spies keep hidey-holes full of weapons, passports and money, so we shouldn't gripe that it's not explained in the film. Just take it as a given for the genre, sit back and enjoy the decent pacing, minimalist script (for once!), sympathetic actors (Mary Louise Parker is a major scene-stealer), and great casting for the secondary parts (Brian Cox as a shady Russian, Richard Dreyfus as an arms dealer who's channelling Dick Cheney, Rebecca Pidgeon as a CIA boss dragon lady). It's a Bruce Willis action slash comedy slash rom-com, for heaven's sake. Judged on its own terms, it's decent, well crafted, and I certainly didn't feel my time was wasted. Casablanca also started its mythic journey as a well-made B film. This one won't age as well, of course, since comedies especially topical comedies never do, but for now its nice to see good actors having fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great movie!!,"RED (retired extremely dangerous) (2010) is a very entertaining and thrilling action film. Helen Mirren was by far my favorite character in this movie! She was great in this movie, so slick and cool!! And of course Bruce Willis is great in here, such a great action hero, as he is in most movies. Mary Louise Parker and Morgan Freeman were great as well, all the characters in RED are so well constructed and cool to see. The script for this movie is well written and has just the right amount of action and comedy mixed in. The director really did a great job with the action sequences, they were very slick and fun to watch. The visuals and the whole look of the movie is very good too, and I loved the costume design as well. Overall, the bottom line is that RED is just a cool, fun time for all to see! There is also very funny dialogue between the characters, Marty Louise Parker's character is especially funny. I really loved her character! 10/10 for RED! Love it every time, never gets old.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Flashy, Fun & Shallow; RED Proves Age Doesn't Hurt Action","Just as Stallone did with THE EXPENDABLES, Bruce Willis proves he's not too old for action in RED. It seems 2010 was the year for off-the-wall action films, and while RED wasn't the best (that would be THE A-TEAM in my opinion), it definitely wasn't the worst. It's based on comic mini-series from Homage Comics, though pretty loosely from what I understand. I've never read the series so I couldn't tell you, but I enjoyed the film adaptation from director Robert Schwentke. The film centers on retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Willis) as he discovers the agency has marked him for termination. He snatches up Sarah Ross (Parker), his pension fund handler on whom he's got a crush, and hightails it out to find his old team members. With the CIA on his trail and a conspiracy unraveling from his past, Moses recruits some of his fellow retirees: Joe (Freeman) has cancer and is spending his final days in a retirement home, Marvin (Malkovich) lives in the swamps of Florida hiding from government satellites, and Victoria (Mirren) runs a bed and breakfast while taking the occasional contract on the side.The movie's not bad, but it's nothing to get excited about. It's got some great action sequences, but the film falls into the same trap as many other modern action films. The characters never seem as if they're in any real danger, treating even the tightest of situations as a total joke and smirking their way through trouble. The film tries to jerk us back to reality for a moment halfway through the film with an unexpected death but it doesn't take long to jump back into the next action sequence. It's a flashy, fun, and completely shallow. The film comes off as more of a comedy than an action film, with plenty of jokes about the aging characters going toe-to-toe with their younger adversaries. My favorite scene in the whole film has Bruce Willis in a brutal fight with Karl Urban (as the CIA agent in charge of bringing Moses in) to the sounds of Aerosmith's ""Back in the Saddle"". It's the only fight that seems to have any weight behind as it appears the two are beating the crap out of each other. The rest of the fights are loud and devoid of suspense, but fun enough.It's a shame the film isn't better because it looks like everyone involved is having a blast with it all. Willis hams it in and passes through every scene with a wry smile on his face, and Mirren seemed to enjoy the chance to join in on the mayhem (I'm sure she doesn't get too many offers for blowout roles like these at this point). Malkovich does crazy better than just about anyone, so he's perfect for the role of an ex-CIA agent who's mind has been warped from repeated secret LSD testing. The coolest part of the film is Brian Cox as a KGB agent who's passed his prime and longs for the good ol' days of the Cold War, and Karl Urban reminds us he has the potential to be one of the coolest modern action stars (I always thought he was pretty good in DOOM). All of this, and Richard Dreyfus in a supporting role, and the film still never rises past the point of eye candy. I loved watching it, but nothing about it stuck with me afterwards. There's always the chance for a sequel, and if RED is given another chance I hope the filmmakers will try to rise above forgettable action romp.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Hysterical Fun Action,"The CIA starts killing off some of its old, retired operatives and that's when the trouble starts. . .And a LOT of people start getting killed.It's Bruce Willis' cool aplomb as he moves through each scene with ease and a little smirk that makes this movie non-stop hysterical. Malkovich is off the wall screamers funny, but the others are funny because they carry the lines with total straight-faced élan that I am SURE there had to be a few re-shoots just to edit out the snickers. Especially when the lines are played off Karl Urban's character who is a great granite-faced straight-man.And the action was over the top and fun-- Guns, Guns, LOTS of AMMO expended and one beautifully crafted fight scene in the CIA office that had me wincing!

Halfway between comedy and action but doesn't quite work well as either,"Red isn't as great as the positive reviews its been getting. Its really not that funny in the comedy part and the action scenes aren't that impressive. Some cool fight scenes but not that many. The scenes have been done many times before and have done better. With a talented cast, I expected the film to be much better, and I was disappointed. The main problem with the film is that it tried too hard to be hip but fails considering the age's of the main cast. There were many jokes and gags that failed and that simply were not funny. The romance was also cheesy.The characters weren't that great. Though the only saving grace here is John Malkovich, who steals every scene and is really quite funny. Same with Mary-Louise Parker, she performed well and was the most intriguing and careful character IMO. Bruce Willis as Frank is, well Willis, not a stretch- seen him done the same role a few times now. The negatives are Helen Mirren, though looks excellent for her age, doesn't make her role feel realistic enough (she's 65 firing machine guns/cursing), it seemed too fake and her attitude was really annoying. In the third act when she becomes a presence the film goes downhill. Morgan Freeman is really criminally underused, and Karl Urban is quite talented and is becoming very versatile but wasn't that convincing as the lead villain. All in all, don't expect anything original, or good. It's not terrible, just below average, and should have been much better.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Utterly ludicrous over the top hokum but none the worse for that. At least it entertains,"Somewhere in the opening credits we are told that RED is based on a graphic novel, and I also notice DC Comics logo in there somewhere. That is the key to it all: keep that well in mind if you decide to see this and you probably won't be disappointed. IMDb bills it as a drama, comedy and a thriller, and I suppose that is more or less a reasonable description, although is in not top-notch drama, laugh-out-loud funny or particularly suspenseful. You do, however, want to know what is going on and why it is going on. RED is entertaining enough, but something of a big-budget pot boiler. Bruce Willis does this sort of hard man act standing on his head and I should imagine Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich had rather pressing bills to settle because throughout they are slumming it. But what the hell. RED has no pretensions and if it is nothing but way, way over-the-top 23 carat hokum it is none the worse for that. Take it with a couple of pinches of salt, have several cans of lager to hand and resign yourself to passing a couple of very undemanding hours.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Crack a joke, snap a neck. Lament the state of the world. Wonder why the kids don't call. It's hard being a retired assassin.","When bad guys try to X Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) for no apparent reason he takes off, pausing only to gather up his call centre operator possible girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) who he has never met before he starts to conduct his own private investigation.Despite some initial reluctance from Sarah at being apparently held hostage by a bald 50ish guy who might pose her significant threat the duo move quickly in that cinematic way and uncover a conspiracy that might go all the way to the top – all in a few days.Along the way it becomes evident that Frank wasn't a lone target, in fact someone is systematically offing many retired secret service agents – all now classified RED Retired Extremely Dangerous – so Frank sets about notifying those still alive to see if they can help.In quick time the obviously paranoid, presumed dead, off the grid shut-in Marvin (John Malkovich) comes on board, as does Joe (Morgan Freeman) who is battling cancer and leaves his retirement home cushiness to help.More help comes in latter stages in the form of Victoria (Helen Mirren) and an unlikely ally in Ivan the Russian – apparently all Russians are called Ivan.Karl Urban is secret service guy William Cooper charged with tracking down these elderly loose cannons, and Richard Dreyfuss makes a cameo as a man with all the answers.What follows is a quite enjoyable but admittedly formulaic action-comedy with maximum damage and minimal good-guy casualties. It is one of those films where you have to laugh when someone explodes as it is all so ludicrous.The good guys smile and crack jokes as they make hundreds of children orphans and the headline cast of guys more familiar holding awards instead of automatic weapons all seem to have a bit of a laugh laying waste to hundreds of fit young crack troops.Despite the subject matter and head count this is all quite breezy, light and entertaining, with chuckles and explosions favoured over logic and realism.At the conclusion of the film I wondered if this would be at all entertaining had it featured a bunch of young heavily muscled protagonists, then I answered my question pretty quickly when I realized this is The Losers Part 2, only set some 40 years on from the original.I only the thought The Losers was so-so. I think Red would be marginally better if it had a cast of young 'uns but not that much, So I guess at least part of the enjoyment was to found through the perverse pleasure of making broken hip jokes each time one of the stars threw themselves around or as Helen Mirren's floppy arm skin wobbled as she blazed away with a massive machine gun at people a third her age.The only significant downside is that for some reason one of the cast needed to find luuuuurrrrvve, hence the annoying Frank and Sarah subplot where she is supposed to go gooey as a guy who could be her Dad's golfing buddy kills another crack soldier with his bare wrinkled hands.If you miss seeing Red it is fair to say there will hardly be a massive gap in your life – but at the same time this is an enjoyable couple of hours and it is fun to see some of the senior cits get a chance to make a few guilt free kills.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Kill a young bloke, have a cup of tea. Kill another young bloke, take a nap. Crack a joke, snap a neck. Lament the state of the world. Wonder why the kids don't call – Oh yes, you killed them.

A Veteran Cast That Does Not Disappoint,"When you put together a veteran and talented cast of actors including the likes of Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfuss and even Ernest Borgnine and then add into the mix some talented younger actors such as Mary Louise Parker and Karl Urban, you know that you're not going to be disappointed - and ""Red"" does not disappoint. It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it's a fun and action packed movie that sometimes makes you laugh.Willis plays Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by the agency he used to work for. Lonely, bored and smitten with Sarah (Parker) - who works at the pensions office for former government employees and whom he would call repeatedly just to talk to her - he eventually drags her and several ex-colleagues into the work of figuring out why the government wants him dead, which leads eventually up to the highest echelons of the U.S. Government and a cover up of war crimes committed many years before. This features all of the standard action scenes that you'd expect to find in such a movie, always mixed with a relatively low-key but fun story and good performances from the two primary leads - the ice-cold but amusing Willis and the baffled and very cute Parker.It's good fun and nothing too serious and represents a great vehicle for the veteran actors named.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Mindless is exactly the point of this action-packed, star-studded extravaganza. John Malkovich, in particular, is hilarious.","Recently, I got out to see the new madcap, action/comedy Red, based on the graphic novel by Warren Ellis, and Cully Hammer.My advice: Don't go in expecting the greatest movie ever, but do expect to have a great time.In the film Bruce Willis plays Frank Moses, a man who is RED (Retired and Extremely Dangerous). Over a long period, he's had an over the phone relationship with a Kansas City receptionist named Sarah (Played by Mary Louise-Parker). After a rather intense invasion of his home by mysterious gunmen, he travels to Kansas City, and kidnaps Sarah, fearing that the people who want him dead, may also want to kill her, and also tries to always keep one foot ahead of a CIA agent named William Cooper (Played by Karl Urban). He seeks help from old, and equally dangerous friends such as Cancer-stricken, but intelligent Joe Matheson (Played by the legendary Morgan Freeman), excessively paranoid stealth-man Marvin Boggs (Played by John Malkovich), and caring, but fiery assassin Victoria (Played by Helen Mirren).This film really is, in every way, a mindlessly fun popcorn flick, filled to the brim with laughs, and reckless action sequences, kind of in the same category as Roland Emmerich's Independence Day, minus the aliens, and on a considerably smaller scale. The movie may present a bit of elements that has been seen in a number of films, but its stylistic approach, and clever wit is what makes it better than most of those.Aside from a great cast I've mentioned earlier, it also includes appearances by other legends like Ernest Borgnine, Brian Cox, and Richard Dreyfuss. The main cast is really what makes it so great, such as Bruce Willis, who's definitely still got what it takes as an action star. Mary Louise-Parker could have been great, but as it goes, she's rather good. Helen Mirren is very effective in somewhat short screen time, as is Morgan Freeman, albeit to a fairly lesser extent. But the true standout is John Malkovich, whose character is so fun, so bizarre, and utterly, and hilariously paranoid (Often for nothing but good reasons).It's oh-so enjoyable, reckless, witty, and brimming with action.

There is a need for movies like Red that rehabilitate older actors, now that Hollywood has overdone the teen mania for more than a decade. It's time for a generational balance instead of the either/or absolutisms. At the same time, I'm tired of Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman, who are among the few older actors who survived the Hollywood decimation of the aged. It's time to retire these two for good and give others a chance. Not to mention that Willis's skin looks far too artificially smooth for a retiree. The movie's pace is slower which is alright, but somehow production felt it was necessary to subject us to constant obnoxious silly caper music. It's insufferable.A lot of fuss was made about the supposed extreme and surprising violence. Other than two guys being blown to pieces, there's nothing outrageous here or surprising. What is pointless is the fake comedic angle that Hollywood always uses to cloak its violence in or any other disagreeable issues. Red while entertaining also got on my nerves.

Mary-Louise Parker as Bruce Willis's innocent-caught-up-in-mayhem girlfriend provides a neat focal point for the viewer. John Malkovich gives an eye-rolling performance much as he did in Con Air.

Red - 3 Stars,"Any film that features Helen Mirren operating a mounted machine gun in a pretty white dress deserves at least three stars. And a movie that miserably fails in maximizing the fun it could get from its solid cast should not earn anything above the rating of four.Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malcovich, and Helen Mirren are outstanding actors. All of them are above the age of fifty, which is obviously not the common age for a lead role in action flick these days. That is why I admire Bruce Willis very much. At age fifty-five, he can still star in big-budgeted, stunt-filled action movies without suffering straight-to-DVD or plastic surgery.In the past few years, most of the images I see in the posters of this genre are ""young"" men who either look like a supermodel or a wrestler. Or Dwayne Johnson. Or Jason Statham. But anyway, the entire punchline of RED is that we get to see old-er people fire the guns and detonate the explosives.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/red/",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Silly, Sick And-But  Very Entertaining","I loved the first half of this film, then it got a little silly with the predictable Hollywood anti-CIA/government agenda but, overall, it was still a very entertaining film with wild characters. It's definitely something not to be taken the least bit serious, just enjoyed as a dark comedy with a fast-moving story and a good amount of action and intrigue.John Malkovich - no surprise - steals the show with his wacked-out, paranoid character ""Marvin Boggs."" Like Johnny Depp, Malkovich is very good at playing strange-but-always-interesting characters.As mentioned, the messages are suspect, to say the least (i.e. professional killers are good guys once they aren't connected to a country. Heck, that's what are here and they just love killing, especially the old lady in this film played by the hard-looking Helen Mirren.) The cast is extremely deep and they're all fun to watch, not just Malkovich.Silliness aside, it's still an enjoyable film that thoroughly entertains, from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent action comedy,"Let's face it, RED is nothing more than an excuse for aging actors to come together, shoot stuff up and play tough as nails action heroes. Kind of like Expendables, except intentionally hilarious. And it's that intent to be a comedy that raises this film above Expendables. The idea of old ex-agents going out for a last hurrah is ridiculous enough, but when those agents are played by Willis, Malkovich, Freeman, Mirren and Cox, it just cannot be taken seriously. Sure, you'll buy that these people could have been badasses, but the visual of Helen Mirren shooting a gatling gun is still one of those funniest things I've seen in a while.Luckily the film never takes itself too seriously and most of the film is filled with lampshade hangings, callbacks, parodies and jokes about how old they are. All of the main actors are powerhouse performers, and it shows. They have great chemistry together and obviously enjoy spending time together like this, which is reflected in the quality of their acting.The story is nothing special, truth be told, but for a comedy plot it's not all that bad. It catches your interest, keeps you interested and contains a few honest twists. Could it have been a bit better and more original? Sure, but I have no real complaints about what I ended up getting. You're going to see this film for its humour and actors, not for its story.RED is a definite must watch for all fans of even one of its actors, for fans of action comedies and for everyone who wants to be entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Red Alert Fun,"After a long time there's finally a cool fun action movie. Silly may be one of the adjectives used to describe 'Red' but that doesn't prevent it from being entertaining nonetheless. While there's plenty of action sequences that involve fights, gunshots and explosions, it is the dialogue and chemistry between the actors that made this movie. The impressive ensemble too is quite unique. Who would have expected to see Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss and Morgan Freeman in the same film? All the actors do a great job even though I felt that Freeman's character was more of the token black guy. It's fun to see Mirren play a hot dame with a machine gun and Parker do more comedy. Malkovich too is hilarious as the slightly paranoid one who thinks everyone's out to kill him. 'Red' has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to brighten one's mood. It's certainly not a bad choice to watch with friends or family.",,Anonymous,Crime

Die Hard with a walking stick,"I don't know why I feel so 'dirty' watching 'Red.' Deep down I know it's hardly Shakespeare and I should never rate it more than a 2/5. However, there's something oddly satisfying from watching a load of old actors go crazy with guns and take out wave after wave of trained henchmen like they were immortal. 'Red' is effectively an action-thriller, with a healthy dose of 'Bourne-like' spy-movie thrown in there. Bruce Willis plays a retired John McClane (not really, but he might as well – effectively a retired CIA killer) who, something, something, something, ends up on the run with a woman he's been flirting with over the phone. Naturally, there's hired government killers on his trail at every turn and he must fight for survival every step of the way while he desperately tries to prove his innocence. Think that plot synopsis sounds familiar? Well, it does. It's basically the same as every other recent (Bourne clone) spy movie made in the last few years. It's nothing new, but it is fun.I guess you could say that it's a bit of a gimmick having the lead being an 'elderly' balding (sorry Bruce!) hero, as opposed to a young man with a nice tan and full head of hair on the run. In fact it is the 'age factor' that is this film's only real selling point. Bruce doesn't go it alone, he's helped out by an aging John Malkovich, an aging Morgan Freeman and an aging Helen Mirran – all of which are quite capable to murdering any young, highly-trained upstart who gets in their way. And, yes, it is fun to see them in action.Despite the serious subject matter of death at every turn, the film never even attempts to take itself seriously. It knows it's daft and over the top and that's its main saving grace. If it tried to make us think that a bunch of senior citizens could really do all this then it would be ridiculous. However, throughout all the car chases and shootouts it almost parodies itself.If you like your action movies fun (like pre Daniel Craig Bond) then you should appreciate this, plus if you're a fan of Bruce Willis doing what he does best, or just want to see Helen Mirren wield a sniper's rifle, then you should definitely enjoy this. The plot is simple, Karl Urban is kind of wasted as the film's primary antagonist, hell bent on Willis' capture/death, but he's a nice addition anyway. Just don't think too deeply about why an older man still has to have a considerably younger love interest at his side!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Expendables for old character actors,"RED is a big ensemble action movie, and thus must be compared to the recent The Expendables. RED is better. But it is by no means a perfect movie either.Like The Expendables, your enjoyment of RED depends largely of how much you get a kick out of the actors on screen. And I for one love more old, crazy character actors than wrestlers and other muscle stars, even though I love 80's action films with all my heart. In addition to leading Bruce Willis, you'll get John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, Morgan Freeman, and a couple of smaller parts I don't care to reveal yet, even though they are found on the cast list. And all these actors seem to have a genuinely good time - for once they get to shoot guns instead of doing boring drama. Except for Bruce who has a boring romantic subplot - that at least happens among all the action and not bizarrelly stopping it a'la The E-movie. Without the cast, or even with just Bruce, the film would be sort of a lacklustre spy thriller, even if it has a few truly kick-ass sequences (most of them are found in the trailer). But Malkovich and Cox in particular always bring a smile to my face, even with some lesser material.One thing that really bugged me about this film was the use of music. It was way too generic and comedic and always too loud. I get that RED is supposed to be an action comedy, but the makers should take a page from the ZAZ filmmaking: Everything is much funnier when done with a straight face. Without the wink wink -attitude this could've been an even greater action film. But I still enjoyed it a lot.*** / ***** http://fastmovieblog.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
""" I'm Retired, not  stupid ""","During the Cold War, the two sides of the world did their level best to outguess the other, often times, they caused more confusion than not. From the hundreds of people who fought on either sides there were many who were often sacrificed for the good of the cause, only to discover that what they did, was unnecessary. Having wasted millions of dollars in a vain attempt to win for their flawed ideology, there was also the Human cost of the mindless and most assuredly useless endeavor. Therein lies the basis for this film written by Jon and Ereic Hoeber and directed by Robert Schwentke. It tells the story of a group of aging Secred Agents who find themselves retired. Case in point is that of retired Former agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) who one day discovers, someone is trying to kill him. He escapes assignation and flees from the gunmen. In the process, he singles out and kidnaps Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) a lonely, but thrill seeking office worker. Together, they learn of a special Traget List scheduled for termination. Unable to find the killer squads on his own, Moses locates his former agents including Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) former KGB agent Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox) and Gabriel Singer (James Remar). With special guest stars like Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine in key spots throughout the story, this action packed, deception filled, fast-paced and explosive laden movie makes for a terrific and exciting film destine to be a Classic.

His idyllic existence is one day broken when a team of heavily armed men turn his house into dust in an attempt to kill him, it's up to him then and a few old friends to try and get to the bottom of the mysterious kill squad. Now I've not read the graphic novel so I've no idea how closely this relates, the premise is OK and it's well executed but ultimately it just falls flat, there doesn't seem to be enough substance and it ends up just being a waste of an excellent cast. Sure seeing Helen Mirren wielding heavy arms is fun but she doesn't even enter the film until the end, Willis is smirky, Malkovich is goofy, Urban is stern, Freeman should know better and Parker is well Parker. Add them all together and you should have an explosive mix but it never quite delivers on the promise. It's nice to see Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine pop up and there are a couple of great set pieces but I couldn't shake the feeling that it should have been better than it was.

Taking his new girlfriend hostage to keep her safe, the group get their first lead in a murdered journalist and find corruption leading up to the vice president.This high profile action flick has received generally more favourable reviews from the critics. It opens well, setting the tone nicely for more of the same stuff through-out, which is just as well, because action is a genre that desperately needs something to come along and shake it up a bit. But somehow Red doesn't live up to this early promise, and emerges as another example of how the genre can't compare with the sort of classics it used to be known for (for this critic, anyway.) The story just feels really disjointed and hard to get into, not clever enough to be confusing, just...a bit of a mess, really. In the midst of this, it's hard to spot any really exciting action, which only serves to make the pace drag even more.Cast wise, all of them are just working on the personas they're known for, and not to great effect. Willis should manage this sort of thing in his sleep, but here can't make his wise cracking hard man act stand out much, ditto Morgan Freeman, who's just softly spoken again, and wise cracking here and there, while Malkovich does his wacky eccentric thing to the most annoying effect he can. Only Mirren offers anything resembling class and gravitas, with her presence in the film.

Old is Gold!,"Bruce Willis plays a retired CIA agent living off government pension. As Frank Moses, the highlight of his lonely suburban life is when conversing with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), a customer service agent handling Frank's pension. By deliberately destroying his pension checks, Frank often uses this as an excuse to call Sarah, thus building on a platonic relationship. A nice little off-beat romantic comedy, right? Wrong! Common now, ""Yippee-ka-yay"" and all that jazz, this is Bruce Willis we are taking about. So anyway, one quiet evening, just before Frank retires for the night, a hit squad storms through his house but is unable to take him down. As it seems, Frank is Retired, but Extremely Dangerous (RED). Knowing that the hit squad must have watched his every move while tapping his phone calls, Frank heads towards Kansas City before his assailants can bait him with Sarah. Frank then re-assembles his former Black-ops team with the terminally ill Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), the paranoid Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) and former MI6 operative Victoria (Helen Mirren). Together, they learn that they are on a hit list having been involved in a secret mission in Guatemala dating back to 1981. With a CIA crack team led by William Cooper (Karl Urban) hot on their heels, Frank and his old buddies must now hold it together before facing an explosive showdown that involves the Vice-President himself.For what its worth, this is a film that doesn't try to be more than what it sets out to be– an entertaining action comedy. Speaking of action, what can you expect from old timers playing over the hill retired government spooks, right? Wrong Again! At 56, and as the tagline says, Willis still has it. So does 74 year old Freeman along with the Academy Award winning Helen Mirren. For the most part, action scenes are over the top, and in true Hollywood splendor, some scenes are almost ridiculous. Steeping out of a moving vehicle, lining up a shot and then emptying a clip before the vehicle stops spinning is as believable as a snow storm in the amazon. Then again, this is an action comedy after all. Sure enough, Malkovich steals the show while offering some hilarious moments through the film as a paranoid conspiracy theorist. As Marvin, he is insanely funny and brings his unique sarcasm in the form of funny one-liners. Adding on is Freeman with his usual wit and can literally slap you into laughter. Mary-Louise Parker is the unwitting victim in all this and humorously portrays the example of how cautious someone should be when wishing for something. Karl Urban on the other hand, is great as the determined CIA agent, but finds it hard to contain his native Kiwi accent towards the end. Then of course is the lovely and charming Mirren. She is an epitome of grace and screen charisma, even if her character wields the biggest guns in the film.German director Robert Schwentke knows how to make an entertaining film. Known for his 2005 thriller ""Flightplan"", Schwentke goes all out with Red and fires from all cylinders. Brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber's script is justified by this director while adding his own finesse to their work.

Great film,"Well it was an interesting idea, I'll give them that. Get some older actors together and put them in an action movie that has them kicking ass and taking names against people half their age. It's not everyday that you get to see Bruce Willis teaming up with Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich to solve a government conspiracy and clear their names in the process.In this somewhat confusing plot, we see Bruce Willis taking the star role as Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who spends his days looking forward to his daily phone conversations with his pension administrator Sarah (Mary Louise-Parker). It isn't long until his idyllic life is uprooted when a hit squad is sent to his house with orders to take him out. Apparently Frank is one of many who are on a hit list. Why is Frank on this hit list? It has something to do with a government cover up from the 1980's and apparently Frank is one of the loose ends.Realizing he's going to need some help if he is to survive, he goes to his former associates. Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marv (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) join Frank and together, this team of Red (Retired and Extremely Dangerous) CIA operatives try to figure out just what the heck is going on. Along the way, Sarah also gets pulled into the shenanigans and the team sets out to expose the conspiracy at hand.The story is a bit messy at times and as the film goes on, it seems as if the filmmakers were less concerned with preserving the fluidity and logic of it all and more concerned with keeping the action up to par. The story goes from somewhat acceptable to just plain ridiculous and by the end, rather than trying to remember the details of it all, you'd rather just forget. It's just one big incoherent mess that descends into nonsense rather quickly.It's not original in the slightest and I'm not going to try and pretend otherwise. Red has a fairly familiar story. In fact, at times it feels all too predictable. What will ultimately draw you into Red isn't the plot, rather it's the chemistry between the actors and the somewhat entertaining action that may leave you mildly pleased as the end credits roll.All the action is shot pretty well and the humor is mixed in nicely.

Review: Red,"The Pitch: C.I.A. vs. O.A.P.s.The Review: There's been a trend over the last twenty years or so of action movie stars getting increasingly elderly. Maybe it's our ever increasing fondness for nostalgia, or perhaps the novelty of seeing old fogies with big guns appeals as much in theory as the opposite, extremely young end of the scale that Hit Girl and her friends occupy. But for whatever reason, action stars have kept making movies as they get older, and indeed movies are now taking this a step further and making action stars out of the bus pass generation.Based on a Warren Ellis comic book, RED has compiled a cast list with varying familiarity with the action genre. Bruce Willis has the most extensive action CV, and although into his fifties is still deemed sufficiently cool to be leading man material. John Malkovich and Morgan Freeman both have history in this genre, but in both cases it's less auspicious in the relative terms of their previous works. Crucially, while all of them can normally be relied on to deliver good work, none of them is a reliable mark of quality when it comes to bullets and explosions. They are all at least serviceable here, although Willis especially is little more than that.But they are just the tip of an iceberg that's made of acting quality so solid it would put a hole in your average battleship. Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss and even Ernest Borgnine, who was retired before I was in short trousers, all pop up, often far too briefly. Getting more screen time are Mary Louise Parker as Bruce's love interest, wandering through wide-eyed and screaming, and a rather stoic Karl Urban as the man sent to track down and round up this bunch of geriatric gunslingers. The biggest stunt of the casting is Helen Mirren, who gets a very big gun and smiles sweetly as she twists most of the male cast around her little finger.So what do you make out of a comic book and a bunch of willing actors of generally advancing years? Director Robert Schwentke, whose previous form peaked with the Jodie Foster snoozefest Flightplan, manages to make a serviceable and lightly enjoyable action movie, with the odd entertaining set piece and a few mildly smirk-worthy lines, but it never really gets into top gear. It is worth saying, though, that the action is at least clean and generally well handled, and avoids the camera fitting and shaking so prevalent in today's action movies. It will take up an hour and a half of your time divertingly enough, but that's also about how long it will last in your memory – and, given the age of the cast, it's probably about how long it lasted in theirs as well.Why see it at the cinema: Some solid, well handled action, a few decent laughs and an absolutely killer last scene which mixes both will all get benefit from a large screen and some company.The Score: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Was I watching the same movie, or is this perhaps what an American audience finds entertaining.I see it referred to as a romantic action comedy.As a comedy, it was barely funny. Perhaps laughable, but nor funny.As a romance, c'mon. Old people?! Romantic? As an action. There was one cool scene where Bruce wills slips out of a moving car to shoot up another moving car, and other than that is was bang bang bang, guns and flames. Lame action.If you want to waste two hours, watch Red. If you are easily entertained, watch Red. If you are anything like the majority of reviewers, watch Red.

Old-fashioned fun,"An action comedy, starring Bruce Willis in self-referential (and slightly self-spoofing) mode? Yeah, Cop Out wasn't that great. Fortunately, Red is a stronger piece of material for two reasons: first of all, it's based on a really good comic-book by genre maestro Warren Ellis; secondly, Willis isn't paired with Tracy Morgan, but a talented ensemble including Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.The former John McClane plays Frank Moses, a retired man who spends his days sitting around the house, reading trashy romance novels and talking on the phone with an attractive woman (Mary-Louise Parker) working for the pension office. After a failed hit on his life, Frank - who is revealed to be a former CIA operative - discovers he's been labeled RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) and decides to get to the bottom of the story with the help of a few ex-colleagues (Freeman, Malkovich, Mirren) and former enemies (Brian Cox), while a young, ambitious agent (Karl Urban) is on his trail.With the comedy/action balance firmly in place and the ""old people"" angle (minor roles are played by veterans like Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine) being a big part of the film's appeal, it could be easy to mistake it for an Expendables rip-off (Willis being in both movies is another element to consider). However, Red is a different beast: the tone is less tongue-in-cheek (there's no equivalent of the Stallone/Schwarzenegger encounter), and, with the exception of Willis, none of the actors have a reputation as actions stars, though they've all had experience in the genre, including Mirren (she previously played an assassin in Shadowboxer). As such, the film is a fun piece of entertainment that takes itself seriously enough to not become ridiculous, but is allowed to play with genre conventions.Almost inevitably, the plot is on the thinner side of things, primarily because the original comic is only used as the basis of the first five minutes. After that, it's up to the screenwriters to come up with a worthy follow-up plot: intriguing, but hardly more unpredictable than the average action movie. That it stays believable and enjoyable is, obviously, due to the cast: everyone appears to be enjoying themselves, particularly Malkovich who has another go at his more manic turns (see Burn After Reading), and the younger players - Parker, Urban, Julian McMahon - are up to the challenge. As for Willis, his solid and entertaining lead role ensures Cop Out is nothing more than a distant memory.Red may not be the best comic-book adaptation of 2010 (hello, Kick-Ass and Scott Pilgrim), but it's got the humor and energy to provide a nice couple of hours at the movies, plus characters that would be fun to watch again. A Malkovich-centric spin-off, perhaps?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"It is what it is, light hearted and fun","In short, a good movie which makes the most of a stellar cast.Willis is in top form from start to finish in this action packed romp of a film - Willis doing what Willis does best. In fact, all of the cast combine surprisingly well together to create lots of chuckles amongst a plethora of explosions and gun fights.Malkovich is the main culprit for giggles, playing a zany ex CIA operative, obsessed with weaponry and who has spent many a year high on LSD - cue guns encased in a cuddly pig teddy! Mirren plays an ice-cold sniper with a heart which in a way combines elements of both her Prime Suspect self and her Calender Girls self Freeman is typically Freeman, playing a wise old head who thinks of everyone before himself, cue the string quartet for the emotional 'I miss the good ol days' speeches. But the best surprise was seeing Brian Cox back in action. No nonsense Brian Cox who it seems dominates channel 5 and ITV 2 at times for the sheer amount of 90's films he appeared in. Usually associated with being the bad guy, who does he play in this film? A Russian agent. Brilliant decision to cast him, nuff said.In the future I can see this film appearing many a time on TV around the holidays, almost akin to Die Hard and Mission Impossible, and I for one will always make time to watch it as I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The film knows exactly what it should be and doesn't pretend or try to be anything else - Action/Comedy at its best.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Retired and Extremely Dangerous,"""Frank Moses"" (Bruce Willis) is a former CIA agent who specialized in ""wet work"". And he was very good at his job. But he is now retired and has developed a crush on a person named ""Sarah Ross"" (Mary-Louise Parker) who he has never met but helps him with his retirement check over the phone. One day a team of assassins are sent to kill him at his home and after killing all of them he realizes that his phone records might jeopardize Sarah. So he drives to Kansas City and kidnaps her. Along with that he gradually gets in contact with several other people he has worked with in the past to help him out. Naturally, all of them are just like him: Retired and Extremely Dangerous. Anyway, for an action-comedy this film turned out to be pretty good. Both Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker turned in decent performances but it John Malkovich (as ""Marvin Boggs"") who really stole the show as the paranoid agent who was subjected to LSD for 11 years. He was simply hilarious. That said, I liked this movie and I recommend it for those who enjoy films of this nature.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

RED - Retired and Extremely Dangerous,"""Old man, my ass.""Red is the action romp that recent movies like The Losers  and Knight & Day have tried, and mostly failed, to be. It's fun without being dumb, funny, not too long or short, action- packed, and has a great cast as a bonus.The story is about a retired C.I.A. field operative (Willis) who is seemingly targeted by his own agency for death, for some unknown reason. He goes on the run with his recent acquaintance/love interest (Mary-Louise Parker) and looks up a bunch of his similarly retired buddies to help him find out what's going on.And it's that cast of supporting characters that really makes Red worthwhile. It includes Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Brian Cox, and they all seemed to be having a ball as action stars.  Karl Urban also pitches in as the primary agent in the hunt for our dangerous oldsters. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better cast than that in ANY movie, regardless of genre.My one real problem with Red was the story. The best that could be said about it was that it was there, and it gave an excuse for the gang to get together and hop all around the U.S. Action movies admittedly don't need spectacular plots, but that of Red often left me cold.Other than that, I give Red a full recommendation. The casting was inspired, and it's just undeniably entertaining to see these guys (especially Mirren and Malkovich) blowing people away and just generally proving that bad-asses come in all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Doesn't deliver the goods,"On the face of things this movie seems to have everything going for it: with an action movie about a retired CIA agent being chased by his highly skilled pears, with Bruce Willis in the leading role, and a distinguished row of beloved actors by his side, the viewer may ask him or herself what can possibly go wrong? Surprisingly, the answer is: practically everything.After a very promising beginning, the movie very quickly ran out of steam. The remainder hour and a half exhibited a rather dull story line and action scenes that wouldn't be innovating even in the 1970s. The direction of the action scenes seem to have no soul: they were void and unoriginal, with not mush thought brought into them. Just a bunch of people running around with guns doesn't quite cut it in today's standards. After so many action films being produced in the last three decades, the viewers thirst for something new. This movie just repeats old formulas and is not even good at that.Other than in the beginning there was a rather well done action scene at an air port. Too bad it was highly unrepresentative to the rest of this movie. On any other respect, the movie seemed to deteriorate as it went on. The end-scene was as unreliable as it was anti-climatic. The villains were shallow: their motivations were unclear and unreliable, and there was nothing particularly interesting about them. To sum up in tow words: disappointing, unfulfilling.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unfunny and incoherent at times,"This film is about several retired secret agents who are escaping from the CIA, as someone from the authority wants them dead.""Red"" is certainly over hyped. I cannot see what is so great about this film. The story telling is quite poor, with scenes incoherently pieced together, especially the scenes in the beginning. After watching it for half an hour, I still struggled to understand what's going on. As the film progresses, the plot becomes slightly clearer, but is still messy and unclear at times. It is supposed to be funny, but I do not find any scenes funny. Indeed, John Malkovich's character is annoying and over the top stupid. Helen Mirren is under utilised in the film, and she does not appear so natural in handling firearms. Julian McMahon looks far too young to be a vice president. When the characters themselves are not believable, how can one enjoy the film? I think ""Red"" is an unfunny, forgettable and a disappointing film.",,Anonymous,Crime
An entertaining mixture of genres with a bunch of great actors,"The big names of Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and the highly memorable and convincing John Malkovich unite in this quite diversified movie that has a strong humorous and human touch but soon turns out to be also a tension loaded conspiracy thriller with good special effects and action scenes. This mixture strangely fits very well together and gives this movie a more unique touch as it is neither a simple conspiracy action thriller nor a dumb parody. The main characters have all something crazy and unique about them and I especially adored John Malkovich in this flick that easily beats the concurrence.The story is rapidly told. Bruce Willis plays an ex-agent for the CIA that has become old and dreams of a life in tranquillity with a beautiful woman by his side that he seems to have met at the telephone. But as life is life, his past is still haunting him and for an unknown reason the organization he worked for is chasing him and his old partners now and he has to live on the run to save his future love of his life and find out the reasons beyond this conspiracy as he reactivates his old partners in crime for a new mission.Even though the story is in the end quite predictable and not very original at all and even though the main actors have all done a lot more interesting movies in the past, this flick is highly entertaining from the beginning to the end and worth to be watched once even if I would not consider a purchase of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""I am getting the pig...""","I have seen this movie about 4 times already, and it really does not get old. It is an absurd, and entertaining movie that is very fun to watch. The movie is about an ex CIA agent who is a victim of a threat from an assassin, and he needs to find out who it is and why he is a victim. Along the way, he meets a woman whom he loves and....she is also a victim. He brings back his gang and pretty much kicks ass the whole movie. Now, the plot has been seen thousands of times before, except it has been seen in more serious action movies. This is a comedy. So, it is at least semi-original. The movie definitely has some flaws, and it is far from being flawless, it is not supposed to be an Oscar winning classic. The performances from the ensemble were all fantastic, and the supporting actors also did a very good performance. The pacing was perfect, and was not at all too fast or too slow, but the cinematography was not great in my opinion. It felt like the entire movie was a trailer. There was hard rock playing practically the entire time, and the cinematic views for very....movie trailery (I know that is not a word, you know what I mean). The fight scenes however were very well done, they felt real, and the sound effects were great. I just wish that there was not music playing for 90% of the whole movie. But besides that, it has a decent ending, and it is hilarious. Especially in the beginning. And believe it or not, unlike many action comedies, it is actually quite suspenseful. I found myself in suspense throughout. So it is funny, thrilling, and entertaining. It has flaws, yes, but it is a good comedy.In conclusion:
Plot: 8.6/10, semi-original, but also semi-unoriginal.Acting: 9.2/10, excellent performances.Pacing: 9.5/10, perfectly timed and paced.Cinematography: 6.2/10, not very good at all. Except the action sequences, and all that.Characters: 8.4/10.Entertainment level: 9.7/10, highly, highly entertaining.Emotional impact: 8.5/10, emotional does not only mean sad, it can be every emotion, and this movie makes you go through some for sure, plus there is one sad part.Realism: 7.3/10, I forgot to talk about this, but there are several things that do not add up. So, that is a flaw, but it is not completely surreal either.Ending: 7.3/10, kind of expected, but satisfying nonetheless.Final rating: 83%",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Red & Knight & Day,"Red and Knight & Day I decided to review these two films on my facebook reviews together as they are in some ways comparable.In the first, Knight & Day, Cameron Diaz, Day, is returning home for her sisters wedding when she stumbles upon Tom Cruise, Knight, a CIA agent who having been set up as a patsy is forced to go undercover and on the run. Through a set of unbelievable circumstances the two embark on a farcical roller-coaster ride of espionage and death defying feats.In Red, Bruce Willis is a retired CIA agent who having pressed the wrong switches upset someone lurking in the shadows. Forced out of hiding he joins up with fellow CIA retirees John Malkovitz, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren. Together they too embark on a farcical roller-coaster ride of espionage and death defying feats.This however is where the two films part company.When Cruise and Diaz appeared on Top Gear, (UK) Jeremy Clarkson said of the two Hollywood actors ""this is where humans will be in 100 years when evolution has reached perfection"". Sadly I disagree. What comes out from this film that you do not have in Red is that very Hollywood obsession with appearance. The need to have endless cosmetic surgery, reconstructive dental work and lifts in your shoes. Peel away the make up, remove the implants and fake faces and what you have is very normal looking people. This is relevant to the cause as Knight & Day seems lost where as Red knows its own identity. Action packed and full of CGI and exploding things, stunts and gun battles both films are fun to behold. Cruise leaps from moving vehicles and hand to hand combat with sharks, it is the consummate Tom Cruise film, but in the same breath it's not an action film. It has the underlying feeling that it's a comedy action. A problem arises however, because it's not funny. The key element in comedy is humour and in Knight & Day there is at no point a moment when you laugh. It is then simply a film of no substance, same old same old, which rides on the back of America's, and now the world's, obsession with 'beautiful people looking beautiful'. The problem with beautiful people sitting around looking beautiful is that nothing ever gets done. God made most people either ugly or normal looking so we could do things slightly more important than walk up and down a catwalk. And this brings us to Red.In Red, the lead characters are all old, wrinkled and gray. There's not cosmetically enhanced beautiful people leaping from rooftops but normal people undertaking equally improbable things as in Knight & Day with the exception that they can all act far better than Cruise or Diaz. There is as much action packed exploding CGI things and despite their age none of the cast look out of place or struggle to be convincing. Red mercifully never takes itself too serious but with tongue in cheek catapults the ridiculous characters into the impossible with full vigour and there is more humour to boot.I enjoyed both films, both are best described as 'cerebrally relaxing' and would give them each 7/10 for entertainment value, the downside is that one ends with the overwhelming feeling that a sequel will be following along behind and it's not actually the one you want to see more of.Red is Good Fun 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I haven't killed anybody... in *years*!,"Retired life is not agreeing with Frank(Willis). He tries to get in contact with a sweet young woman(Parker), but other than that, not much happens. Then one day, he's attacked. Oh, it's fine. He's ex-CIA. Did I not mention that? Someone has put a hit on him, and he's gonna find out who. With the help of some old friends. This has two main draws. It's an adaptation of a beloved Warren Ellis mini(which I have not read it). While I can't comment on how it treats its source material, the stylization(appropriate in amount(this isn't like Sin City or 300... it's closer to something by John Woo), with effective use of slow-motion) of the cool action(though it isn't terribly tense, our heroes take care of the opposition with ease), much of the camera-work(with extended pans, simulating comic book panels) and the tongue-in-cheek tone really fit the medium this was ""translated"" from. The other thing is the cast. Bruce being a bad-ass is always a positive. Mirren with guns and in this role is fun. Freeman is surprisingly little in this. Mary-Louise isn't bad. Dreyfuss is definitely good. Malkovich is enjoyable as a raving loon, if it is quite forced at times. Cox is downright goofy, chewing almost as much scenery as a Russian as Curry did in Congo. And that's one of the unfortunate things. Only about half the humor works. The rest just falls flat. Because of how over the top it is(and at times, it is maybe too silly), this doesn't fare well when it tries to be serious... it utterly fails to balance the two, and when we're meant to care, we simply don't. This would be fine if we weren't supposed to... however, we are, here and there. The dialog is often dry(and that doesn't refer to wit) as sandpaper. I honestly have a hard time believing that some of this stuff made it past early drafts. The talents do what they can, usually failing to save it, and we have to suffer through rather poor delivery every now and then in this. There are things in this that you kind of expect, and yet they still ""work"". On the whole, it certainly is entertaining, if there is little sense of danger(it does manage to be exciting some of the time). The plot is pretty straightforward, and winds up not really sticking with you. Almost nothing surprises you as far as developments go, and impact of them is nonexistent. There is a bit of mild to moderate violence and brief strong language in this. I recommend it to those looking for something light that the concept appeals to. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

He still has it!,"Its been 22 years since Die Hard launched Bruce Willis' career. He has had a roller coaster of ups and downs since then. I consider his movie Cop Out, which came out earlier this year, as a major down! Here he is back on top in this very exciting and enjoyable thriller. He plays a burnt out former CIA agent who is so bored with retirement that he conducts a long distance phone romance with a government secretary (Mary Louise Parker in a delightful, show stealing performance). I really felt bad for Bruce's character. He was the best the CIA had and yet his character just yearned for love and a simpler life. John Malkovich should get a ""ham of the year award"" for his performance as Willis' crazed CIA buddy. I love the part when he blows that woman away after she calls him ""old man"". The always great Morgan Freeman is also on hand and brings his usual dignity and class to his role, my only complaint is that he didn't have enough screen time.

"Action-Packed, Yet Light","Red is an entertaining romp featuring a stellar ensemble cast including Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, and Morgan Freeman.

Completely absurd but absolutely lovable one,"I really hope that more films like Red will be made in the following years.

You don't expect the movie to be anything more than fun. The plot is plain simple, but the way it's executed gives it air to breathe.A few more twists would be nice, a bit more of Malkovich too. But I don't regard these issues as flaws. The would have only contributed to the overall movie reception, not it's essence.The cast, the obvious winks, the effects (with really big winks) and the lightness of the whole picture (you expect fun and it delivers) makes Red a film worth watching.

Comfortable Thriller,"Frank Moses (Willis) is a retired CIA agent who needs to know why the CIA is trying to kill him and his former team.RED: Retired Extremely Dangerous. Got it? That applies to Frank.This is a comfortable thriller. Everything happens and goes wrong, but no matter, Frank is here and he's got everything under control. The movie is almost dreamlike in that everything is done in a somewhat subtle, but efficient way. Kind of seamless if you will. No one panics, no one overacts although Marvin (Malkovich) does give that a go from time to time, but Frank is there to restrain him. And, from time to time we do hear some good, almost LOL lines.Mary-Louise Parker's character, Sarah, plays Frank's love interest perfectly and one could very easily fall in love with her from the get-go. Morgan Freeman (Joe), Helen Mirren (Victoria), Richard Dryfuss (Alexander), Brian Cox (Ivan) and Rebecca Pidgeon (Cynthia) were all a joy to watch. Ernest Borgnine (Henry) - yeah, I thought so too, but there he was big as life - just gets better with age.But, it is Karl Urban (Cooper) who really steals the show. If they ever do a real life ARCHER (cartoon character kind of a James Bond), Mr. Urban would be my choice. He's perfect for that role. He is so good, you almost want him to catch Frank and his team.

Filled with supposedly clever comedy clichés, it only produces a couple of laughs during the entire film.The only saving grace are the performances, with Karl Urban being the best, closely followed by Morgan Freeman and Mary-Louise Parker, and with Bruce Willis being in his element with a solid but predictable performance. Both John Malkovich and Helen Mirren's considerable talents are largely wasted in this film, both being pretty much toothless, although it does suits Helen Mirren to wield huge guns.With the right director and camera work, this film could have been so much better and actually deserves it!",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Cast Makes the Film,"Red (2010)** 1/2 (out of 4)Lightweight but entertaining action picture about a retired agent (Bruce Willis) who has a hit put out on him and the woman (Mary-Louise Parker) he loves so he reaches out to some old partners (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich) to help him. RED isn't going to win any major awards and it's certainly not going to go down as one of the best action pictures out there but it still has enough charm and a terrific cast that makes it worth watching. It's almost hard to believe but there are actually four Oscar-winning actors on display here. There's Freeman but we've also got Richard Dreyfuss, Helen Mirren and Ernest Borgnine in a small role. The wonderful cast is certainly the biggest reason to check this out as all of them are quite good in their roles and appears to be having fun. This is especially true for Parker who clearly steals the film as the somewhat dimwitted regular gal who finds herself mixed up in this conspiracy where one body is falling at all times. Malkovich plays that eccentric weirdo like only he can and Freeman is also good and that's no different here. Willis is pretty much just playing another version of himself but it's still fun. The action scenes are quite creative in their own way and I really liked the visual style brought to the screen by director Robert Schwentke. He manages to never take the subject too serious and instead he keeps everything moving at a nice pace with the charm factor high. Again, RED isn't any sort of masterpiece but if you enjoy any of the cast members then you should have a good time.",,Anonymous,Crime
Red: 7/10,"Red, retired extremely dangerous. Those terms are to describe Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Hellen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, and Morgan Freeman. The cast is very well known, three out of five won Oscars. But the cast has nothing to do with the movie's stylish direction with its tough attitude. The director has this crazy attitude to direct a movie that's fun and enjoyable for both the audience and its cast. Considering that people in the cast is elite actors, this is kind of a fun project for them, something enjoyable instead of intense acting. That's what made the movie fun, the cast knew that this isn't that serious and they tried to have fun with it. We felt the charm of Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker. We felt cool when Hellen Mirren picks up a gun. And we felt disgusted when Morgan Freeman tried to score some booty. But most of all, we felt this is better entertainment than some big budget movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Old dudes love this film,"I watched this movie with my father-in-law. He's in his 60s and I think this movie spoke to his heart. It's based around the usual action movie clichés about some tough guy agent who's forced out of retirement to kick some butt a final time.The best part of the movie is the casting. Bruce Willis is a bit paint-by-numbers in his usual role, but John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, and Hellen Mirren all play against type and it's fun to see them in a cheesy shoot-em-up movie instead of their usual more ""sophisticated"" roles. Malkovich steals the show here. He's so good in fact that I almost wish they made a different movie with him as the star. His performance alone is reason enough to watch the movie. The entire film is a bit like Expendables, but I think the RED guys are in on the joke a little more than Stallone and crew, who are still taking themselves too seriously after all these years.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Your eyes are so beautiful""","DC pulls more towards dark dramas, while Marvel strings action blockbusters that border with comedy. This time, DC beat Marvel on their ground. Although it is based on the graphic novel and it has traces of comic-book attributes, ""RED"" (Retired: Extremely Dangerous) doesn't have a comics-like atmosphere. It is an action-comedy with elements of romance, which is so entertaining and funny that the only reason I did not watch it in one breath was that I was constantly rewinding the scenes to see them again. Action scenes are well-staged, and the editing and effects do not lag behind. There are also great music and a totally awesome cast. Bruce Willis is, as usual, an irresistible charmer, whose character is called Moses and he's something between McClane from ""Die Hard"" and Jimmy from ""The Whole Nine Yards"". Mary-Louise Parker is luscious and has perfect chemistry with Willis. And when their support are legends such as Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Brian Cox, Helen Mirren, and Richard Dreyfuss, there is no doubt about the quality of the acting.You know, if it is the CIA, then there's only one place we can go to find out why they're coming after us.

It Is Fun!,"Poking fun at the James Bond era will always be good fun. Austin Powers did it so irreverently, and if you didn't like that, you should like the more dignified comedic venture found here.

It does not draw away from the action, nor does it overshadow the story.Production style is smooth with a tongue-in-cheek look at the Cold War days, a paranoid view of the American government, and a hopeful view of the future. I did not know what to expect, so I had no preconceived notions surrounding this film, so my cold reaction is that it was totally enjoyable, and one I WILL own.This work features little character development, but it doesn't seem to need it.

Entertaining and well-acted,"First, let me say this: I LOVE Bruce Willis. I grew up watching him in the series Moonlighting and the Die Hard movies. His comedic talent is off the charts and his ""bad boy with good heart"" personality is so sweet and...well, hot :) And the dude has proved he can act in ""serious"" dramas, too, although it's a known fact that comedies are usually more difficult to get right than dramas.In RED, Bruce that we know and love, the bad boy with a golden heart, makes a return, in the company of some awesome supporting actors! The story is nothing new (but what story is, really?), but well told, and extremely well acted. I loved the direction in this one, the way the different cities they traveled to were introduced, and the soundtrack is spot on! Also, fight scenes do not overshadow the telling of the story, but fit right in with the pace of the narrative.I also saw The Expendables a few weeks ago, but I must say, RED is so much better. Both movies play on the same idea of veteran agents, but RED is so more finely tuned and complex and funnier, and the chemistry between actors is so obvious. Who knew that Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Hellen Mirren can make such great action movie heroes! Mary Louise Parker is so good in the role of the ingénue who goes from a boring 9 to 5 office job to this crazy CIA man-hunt without even blinking! I loved it!All in all, it's a great movie.

Ah...Alright,"Robert Schwentke's 'Red' is an average cinematic experience that fell short of my expectations. The reason? The mostly uninspiring Screenplay, that appeals in bits and pieces. Action scenes are good, so are some performances, but this box office hit lacks soul & the fast-paced energy one expects from it.'Red' is about a yesterday team of CIA's agents gearing up, after an old rival decides to bump them off, as he feels they know a lot about him. Thus the seniors go, no holds barred, to get their nemesis down!To give it's due, 'Red' does hold appeal. The problem is that, the writing in the first 20-25 minutes is very loose and doesn't engage. The film actually begins after John Malkovich's entry, and remains steady. But the climax, is a letdown. Robert Schwentke tries his best to rise above the disappointing screenplay with his able direction, while Florian Ballhaus's Cinematography carries a look. The Editing is just fine.Performance-Wise: Bruce Willis gets the highest screen time, and he seems to be pipped up. Morgan Freeman doesn't get much to do, while Thespian Helen Mirren enjoys her part. John Malkovich is excellent. He truly steals the show. Mary-Louise Parker does a fair job. Brian Cox is hugely amusing. Karl Urban is very sincere. Richard Dreyfuss, after a long time, seems to be in command. Julian McMahon is wasted.On the whole, 'Red' is half-baked, harmless entertainment, at best. Watch it, if you must!",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

An evil film which should never have been made,"This is a deeply immoral film and everyone associated with it should be ashamed. The film goes far beyond the trivialization of murder to encompass also the trivialization of psychopathic murderers themselves. Four internationally famous film stars of a certain age have come together in this film to disgrace themselves and retrospectively damage their lifelong reputations by their appalling antics. John Malkovich, who has done such fine work in the past, here makes a complete ass of himself attempting unsuccessfully to be funny while playing a paranoid psychopathic killer. Ha. Ha. If Malkovich is that much of an insipid fool, then we must reevaluate his entire life's work. And then there is Helen Mirren. Carried away by her own vanity, one presumes, she thinks it cute to smirk and make wry smiles and witty asides while confessing eagerly that she simply can't stop killing people. Titter, titter, isn't she just the cutest thing? Now we turn to Morgan Freeman. How can a person of his supposed stature possibly lend his name and talent to this toxic soup of cutesy cutesy psychopathic killers? Does Freeman think he, like his vain and heedless colleagues, is also being ever so amusing? Does he too wish to start a new career as a stand-up comedian? I have heard glowing reports of him for years from some of my best friends who are close friends of his: he is such a fine man, what a wonderful fellow. Well, I can now discount all of that, as it all goes into the trash can. They can say what they like, but the evidence is before us, and that speaks louder than words. And this brings us to the mumbling, bumbling Bruce Willis. He does this sort of relentless killer thing all the time, so we expect nothing less of him. He, like Nick Nolte and countless others, evidently thinks he is Marlon Brando. That is why he mumbles and whispers all the time, so that only about half of what he says is audible. Idiot actors like Willis believe that mumbling 'draws the audience in' and makes them pay more attention to the empty, vacuous ego who mumbles. Yes, Willis, down boy, down boy! Producers know very well that when the hero mumbles incoherently in an action movie it doesn't matter, because nobody is listening to the words anyway, they are just waiting for the explosions and the gunfire and the screams. Who wants to hear what Bruce Willis is saying when he is busy shooting people and blowing things up? The dialogue in the script means nothing in such circumstances. Screenwriters are pointless vestigial organs to an action movie production: their dialogue is largely ignored, except for the odd sound bite to steer the audience through a cut or a transition of scenes. This film, like so many other Hollywood action movie monstrosities, is like a computer game. Bang bang bang. Boom boom boom. Flash flash flash. The aim is to kill as many people as possible and 'score'. The aim is also to blow up as many things as possible. Retard adolescents who spend their lives killing people on small screens like to have bigger and bigger explosions, and Hollywood action movies carry this over onto bigger screens, and with even bigger explosions. The more people who get killed and the more things that get blown up, and the bigger and more grandiose the explosions, the 'better' the action movie. And if John Malkovich can behave like a jibbering monkey and be the unfunniest funny man in the history of comic books, well that is meant to be really something too, especially if, as in this film, he lives in an underground bunker which resembles the hideaway of a psychopathic teenaged computer nerd. For this film is quintessentially adolescent, and makes no pretence at embodying even the slightest flicker of either intelligence or conscience. I see that the film's director Robert Schwentke is currently making a film based on a comic book. Well, that sounds about right for him. But I wonder if he can read it? Is he that advanced? This film is based on 'a graphic novel' which presumably had no words and just pictures. That too figures. Such is the level of illiteracy in Hollywood today, that the 'books' on which films are based are now either without words or with mere comic balloons. The lunatics have finally fully and totally taken over the asylum, and they are all illiterate baboons. Today I got an email add from amazon.com advertising the DVD of the film RED with the catchline: 'Are you looking for something in our Comedy DVD department?' Well, what does that tell us? It is confirmation that the glorification of psychopathic murderers is now officially classed as comedy, and is desperately, uproariously funny. So funny is it in fact that all the world's genuine victims of psychopathic killers can be presumed to have been not murdered at all, but must really have died laughing. Yes, the next time a madman rapes and kills an unfortunate girl, that is comedy. All the people dying in Libya because of the psychopathic Gaddafi are really laughing themselves to death, with Helen Mirren wryly smiling and with that hungry killer's glint in her eye. Maybe Mirren, Freeman, Willis, and Monkeyvich should all go to Libya and help Gaddafi's African mercenaries murder people in the streets. Maybe they would be at home in that environment, and they could crack jokes with each other about it, making cute little smiles and wry glances at one another and could say every time a body falls in the street: 'I feel so good at being back at actively killing again, as I have missed it so much.' And Monkeyvich could make apish faces as the court jester of the madman Gaddafi, while Mirren, Willis, and Freeman laugh heartily at how wonderfully exciting it all is.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

"This is what ""turn off your brain"" movies should be like","RED is the story of a group of Retired Extremely Dangerous people who are being targeted for assassination by the government they once served. I am a sucker for a man-on-the-run story, and there's something fun about one where the guy on the run is also smarter and stronger than everyone chasing him. I love going on this journey, and Bruce Willis is the perfect guy for the lead role because he looks like someone who is getting older but could still hold up in a fight against anyone. I like the layers of planning that go into all these operations, and how they carefully execute their plans so that they can continue to come out on top when faced with insurmountable odds. I also think most of the comedy is solid, particularly with John Malkovich as the hyper-paranoid former agent who is constantly shown to be justified in his paranoia. I also have to mention how much I always love Karl Urban, and his performance here was amazing.I will say, there are a lot of people being killed in RED, and many of them are government agents who are just doing their jobs. You have to be willing to accept that the protagonists of the film aren't all that concerned with killing other people and potentially causing some collateral damage as well. Since the action and violence is so exaggerated and extreme I kind of accepted it, but when my mind starts to think too much about the film, then I realize these are more like anti-heroes than anything else. There are also a few too many convenient last-minute rescues that started to make it feel like these people could do anything. I can let a lot of that slide, though, since I know this is all based on a comic book and there's an added suspension of disbelief in those stories. While RED is far from a great film, it is an enjoyable one and that's all I really needed from it. I had fun watching RED, so it accomplished what it set out to do.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A comedy without any laughs, a thriller without any thrills.","I really wanted to enjoy this film.Such a stellar cast and so much potential, but boy did the scriptwriters and director blow this one big time.The film just bumbled from one scene to the next, with no concept of pacing, timing, let alone story or character development.I can't believe with so much going for it that something so dull could be turned out. I think I laughed once.It only gets a a 3/10 because it was great to see Ernest Borgnine in two scenes, a truly lovely fella and a credit to his profession.A missed opportunity and not worthy of your hard-earned cash.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

One You'll Watch Many Times,"Someone said this was what The Expendables was supposed to be. They hit the nail on the head. I caught this on PPV and seeing actors like Willis, Freeman, Malkovich, Dreyfuss, and Karl Urban, (who was great as Bones in Star Trek), to name just a few - thought it was worth a look. It definitely was! RED is funny, witty, action-packed, well acted by a veteran cast and one of those movies you will enjoy seeing repeatedly.RED has just the right balance of chaos and mayhem for him, romance for her and comedy for all to make this a movie almost everyone will enjoy. And, if you were as disappointed with The Expendables as I was, you'll find that RED is exactly what you were expecting to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not what I was hoping for,"Red is a 2010 action film directed by Robert Schwentke. It stars Bruce Willis who, as the title indicates, is RED, (Retired and Extremely Dangerous). Recently forced into retirement, Miller is having difficulty adjusting to the retired-life, and spends his time sitting around, watering an avocado and talking with a customer service agent named Sarah Roses (Mary-Louise Parker). Soon after the film begins, Miller comes under attack from a hit squad. This leads him to believe that Sarah is also in danger, so after fending off the attack, he packs up and goes to Kansas City to protect her. The pair hit the road and soon run into a large cast of other retirees.The most prominently featured secondary cast member is Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich). He's really the only character that Miller and Sarah run into that actually gets the screen-time they deserve. The additional characters actually make the film more entertaining, because when they aren't around, Miller and Sarah mostly just spend their time going from place to place. The action only really kicks once they recruit the ever- rotating number of characters they meet.It's really a shame that Red lacks so much in the action department, because that is the biggest thing it had going for it. Seeing good, albeit old, actors involved in crazy shootouts and other over-the-top action sequences is something that I was really hoping to see from Red. Instead, I got some mediocre actions scenes that occur only intermittently between the plot points being hammered out or scenes that attempt to be dramatic. They are too infrequent and mediocre to really be effective at keeping the audience entertained.What actually takes the most time out of the action is the film's attempt to actually explore what it would be like to go from being an action star to a retiree. Sadly, none of these scenes really add up to anything. They seem there just to kill time, and never actually explore this idea in as much depth as I had hoped.Seeing as how the majority of the actors in the film have been around for a long time, one would believe that at the very least, the acting of the film would be really good. While it isn't bad, nobody, except Willis, stood out. The characters are all fairly one-dimensional, and none of them show any real depth. They seem to always know pretty much all that is going on, and seem to hope that the action scenes would carry the entire film. When actual depth is attempted, the film falls flat. It becomes boring, and this isn't helped by mediocre acting.Even though none of the actors really made an impact on me, the film was still better when more of the actors were on the screen. The action scenes appeared to be waiting for there to be at least 3 main characters to show up before anything would happen. Bruce Willis actually does carry the majority of the film, and is the one constant throughout. The other characters come and go, seemingly at will, so you can never get used to any specific one.If there's one thing that Red does have in its favor, it's the fact that it is intermittently humorous. Some scenes, like the opener, are actually really funny. Sadly, this level of humor does not keep at a high level throughout, and ends up becoming kind of dry by the end. The times where the film is funny mostly come from Willis playing the entire thing with a straight face, while dealing with everyone else that is around him. There are certainly times where Red will make you burst out laughing, but those times are quickly replaced with boredom.Red was a film that I actually had fairly high hopes for. It was supposed to be a fairly humorous film with high-profile stars involved in exciting action scenes. The only part of that premise that really happens is that the film does have high-profile stars. It's just too bad that they aren't really given all that much to do, and what they are given isn't all that entertaining. The film does have times where it is really funny, and a couple big action scenes, but the gaps between these almost managed to make me want to fall asleep. There just isn't all that much to Red. It doesn't really explore what getting old is like, it isn't incredibly funny, and what action scenes it does have are too infrequent to actually matter.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Perfect Movie!,"I don't know how I missed these when they came out but they are absolutely the perfect mix of sarcasm, wit, and wanton destruction and definitely go on my rewatch list!They could not have cast more perfect actors, their chemistry was brilliant throughout.Bruce Willis is his usual charming self and John Malkovich is hilariously brilliant.Helen Mirren is stunning as always and, honestly, I have not seen Mary-Louise Parker since Fried Green Tomatoes and now I wonder why because she was great too.These movies get my highest recommendation for this genre...I would rather watch them than any more Marvel movies.I only wish they made more of them!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Movie of 2010,"I found this movie to be a perfect mix of genres. The action wasn't overdone like most movies and the comedy couldn't have been better timed. Even though the film was centred around a romantic idea it wasn't a romance, more an attempt to lead a normal life. Leaving this movie more in the action genre than romance.The characters were well casted and really meshed giving the movie a real feel. Bruce as always was a great lead, making you not only want to know what happens but need to know what happens.The surprises throughout the movie were great and you never knew what to expect even though the storyline was very similar to a lot of other movies and you could tell what the end product would be.In conclusion I would say that this movie is a must see, settle in and get ready to laugh as I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Sadly, what should be a fun movie misses the mark completely","When I heard about this movie (and especially after watching the trailer), I was dead excited about this: a fun action movie which is simply aiming to give you a good time, which, I do not have a problem with. I liked The A-Team, simply for how fun it was to watch.Sadly, RED failed to make me laugh what so ever, and I frequently found myself bored out of my mind, painstakingly waiting for the movie to be over. Somehow, there seemed to be no life at all, whether it be in the characters or the script, regardless, something was lacking.A HUGE problem I had with the film is that the script did not know how to treat the characters properly, as there is one character who may as well not have been here at all but I will not say for those who may want to see the movie.The biggest let down of RED is that the iconic moments from the trailer sucked here. For example Helen Mirren's famous line from the trailer was disappointing, the build up was terrible and the moment itself was even worse. Likewise, the scene where Bruce Willis and John Malkovich's characters first meet, the scene was poorly handled, large due to the uninspired tone the scene had.The action sequences are fun to watch though, especially any that involve Helen Mirren or John Malkaovich, who steal every scene they are in by the way, as does Mary Louise Parker and Morgan Freeman. But sadly, Bruce Willis comes off one dimensional and very flat, which was a shame as I know he is a good actor.Overall, for me, the film was too dull, the script didn't do anything for me and half the characters I felt were pointless and therefore, a waste of talent here.But there will be people who will enjoy this film and good for you, I am glad you were able to sit down and have a good time.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
perfect combination,"I normally wouldn't put in an action adventure movie when I'm home alone without my husband, but I would definitely put this movie in when I'm home alone. It is so funny. It is like they took a screwball romantic comedy and an action adventure comedy that is somehow also serious and perfectly combined them. I love how the young people think it will be a piece of cake to takeout the older ones. It is so fun to root for the 'underdogs.' The opening part just cracks me up, Bruce Willis' life as a bachelor. How anybody could live that boring and own a gun and not shoot themselves in the head is beyond me. It just cracks me up every time. I hope they make more movies like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Maybe rent it if you have the time.,"Bruce Willis, at the age of fifty-five, who is fifteen years off from the new official retirement age, and certainly doesn't look old takes on the burden of trying to carry on the wit that these characters are trying to do. Main problem. This movie thinks that it's a lot cooler than it actually is. It suffers from major reality pot hole glitches, but I guess that isn't much of a problem for an action movie, but whatever the case is, this movies tries to flow really fast and it's easy to keep up with it, but when you think about it, there is just a lot of stuff that quite frankly doesn't make sense. The Emmy award winning Parker who has made her career mainly off ""Weeds"" and ""The West Wing"" plays the girl that is kind of tagging along with the crew that are hardened by all the killings that they have done. Apparently she is like pure gold to Bruce, and the group is recognizing that there is a weak spot apparently in their leader. I didn't buy it. He is trying to maintain a witty cool the entire time and it didn't really work itself out that he is a caring and compassionate guy; he seems more interested in saving the girl and being the hero. The characters contrast each other so much, that it doesn't really give a variety at all; it just gives a polar opposite in situations, which instead of bringing worth more wit, it sort of just makes things unrealistic and sort of awkward.Despite its top notch cast, ""Red"" suffers mainly from a script that brushes over to many pot holes and develops characters that do not entirely click with each other, a lot of people will probably have a good time at it. It's not a terrible movie; it's much more of a slower paced action movie and has some good acting. It isn't your everyday ordinary action thriller film due to its embracing of charm and wit. Whatever the case, you'd have a better time renting it than paying ten bucks for it.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
AARP vs the CIA,"Despite an obscure acronym for its title, ""Red"" is a wildly entertaining live-action cartoon. Logic and reality vanish early on, and the audience embarks on an imaginative ride through CIA-conspiracy-paranoia territory. The CIA is assassinating a list of operatives from a covert operation in Guatemala. Retired agent, Bruce Willis, is awakened from a dreary life of chatting about lost checks with a Social Security administrator, Mary-Louise Parker, and solicits aid to solve the murders from several equally retired former compatriots. The geezer quotient in ""Red"" is extremely high, and AARP could use the film to promote how exciting life can be after retirement. Led by 55-year-old Bruce Willis, the rough retirees include 73-year-old Morgan Freeman, 56-year-old John Malkovich, 64-year-old Brian Cox, and 65-year-old Helen Mirren. Not content with this stellar cornucopia of seasoned performers, director Robert Schwentke enlists 63-year-old Richard Dreyfuss and 93-year-old Ernest Borgnine, who looks thirty years younger, in supporting roles. With four Oscars and decades of experience between them, the cast is expectedly superior to the material.However, the engaging plot, based on a graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, is often amusing and moves at a breakneck speed that shatters stereotypes of senior citizens. Thirty-eight-year-old Karl Urban, who plays Willis's adversary, CIA agent William Cooper, comes up bloodied and winded against his elders. The film appears to have been shot all over the U.S., and the clever use of postcard inserts keeps the audience aware of the settings, even if the scene changes occasionally confuse the players. ""Red"" benefits most from its exceptional cast. Willis plays Willis in his best ""Die Hard"" mode; Malkovich plays Malkovich in his amusing wacko mode; and Mirren plays the proper English lady who serves tea, arranges flowers, and occasionally kills people. Like the audience, Parker is initially caught up unwillingly in the mayhem, but her lust for adventure takes hold and she begins to enjoy the ride. While perhaps not a classic, ""Red"" is nonetheless a good action film that delivers, and a trove of outstanding actors that have aged like fine wine appear to be having a great time and supplementing their Social Security checks at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Delightful Fun!,"I really enjoyed Red. It's too bad that they don't make action movies like this anymore.

Bruce Willis stills has his action mojo. John Malkovich really played his part well as the crazy guy. The best part was Helen Mirren.

Only Brian Cox as a retired Russian spy and young CIA hit-man were remotely interesting. Throughout the movie, there's a sense that the director is just trying to get us all to love seeing these actors together on screen, without bothering to provide a script.

Red provides Bruce Willis and an all-star cast in an entertaining thriller,"Just watched this action movie with some humor and romance with my movie theatre-working friend this afternoon. With stars like Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich (what a month he's having appearing in both this and Secretariat which we also enjoyed), Helen Mirren, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ernest Borgnine (wow, in his 90s and still active), Red provided plenty of pleasures in the thrilling department while also slowing down enough to get you to know the characters and their backgrounds. And seeing many scenes from New Orleans-which happen to be a two-hour drive from where me and my aforementioned friend live-was an additional treat. Okay, I'm not sure if what I saw was organically logical from beginning to end, but nevertheless, me and my friend enjoyed Red immensely. So yeah, that's a recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best spy film of 2010,"When the first trailer of RED was released there was buzz and anticipation that going to be a fun action comedy. Loosely based on a graphic novel by Warren Ellis, RED delivers and shows that other action heroes still got it.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), is a retired black-ops CIA agent who is struggling to adjust to civilian and spends his time telephone Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), a woman who works for the pensions services. But Frank has been tags RED, Retired, Extremely Dangerous and a target for assassination. He goes on the run, going to Kansas City to protect Sarah and reuniting with his out team, Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren). They set out to find out why the CIA want them dead, with a young, ambitious and talented agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) leading the hunt.RED is far from a perfect film, there are some holes, but it an entertaining film, providing action and comedy in equal measure. With a fun script director Robert Schwentke was able to give us visual comedy, but it is the verbal comedy and performers that is the real strength, with Parker and Malkovich delivering the most (how can anyone not love Mary-Louise Parker?). The first fight scene was a over-edited, but the rest of the action is well handled, like the scene in the cargo yard with explosive devices landing on people's heads. It would have been nice if the action was a little more violence but there are plenty of gun battles to satifity the audience. The basic plot is a Macguffin, an excuse for action sequences, there is still enough of focus and story was simple. Weirdly whilst RED is a comedy and light-hearted in it's approach with some holes (like how do Frank and Sarah travel across America so quickly), it is more believable then say a film like Salt, because there is a lack of technology, that the actions are resourceful and they is a simple focus.There is an excellent cast in the film. As mentioned Parker and Malkovich were stand out performers, with Parker being a excellent comic performer (and well, one hell of MILF), she has just has natural comic timing and believable. It was fun that Malkovich plays a paranoid man, playing his is follow and well, turns out to be right. One of the themes is that Willis and Parker play lonely characters who are looking for companionship and do it well, playing a convincing couple, with Willis being a little like his character in Twelve Monkeys early in the film. Willis is a convincing action hero and I do like to see older actors kick butt. Freeman is such a strong film present that he can read the phone book and give a great performer whilst there is nothing sexier then Helen Mirren with a large gun. One of the best feature in character development is making William Cooper out to be a man doing his job and that he has a nice home life with his young children; a man who thinks he is doing the right thing and someone is not evil or bad, he is a real shade of grey. Urban is a good actor and I hope to see more from him. But Richard Dreyfuss basically plays his character like he was Dick Cleney, and whilst I do enjoy a Cleney bashing, the character was one-dimensional and false, totally underdeveloped. And whilst I like Brain Cox, his gives a poor caricatures of a Russian man and a bad Russian accent; it would have been better to cast an Eastern European actor.But overall an fast paced adventure and a good way to spend two hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just because they're old doesn't mean they  can't kick your butt in a fight.,RED is a gem of a movie it doesn't take itself too seriously and manages to have fun and toss in a few twists and turns. The Story is: Frank Moses is a retired CIA black Ops agent and he's been retired for a few years bored and alone his highlight comes when he speaks to his pension case worker a young girl named Sarah. then a hit squad attacks him and Frank strikes back and realizes that Sarah might be in danger. Anyone who was Associated with him might be in danger so he goes off to rescue Sarah and reassemble his old team to strike back. The real joy is watching Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman and John Malokvich and Helen Mirren interact they are the movie. The story is simple and made for action it was adapted from a comic book so don't expect any brain trust here. if you came to be entertained and relax or on the edge of your seat for a couple of hours then this is the movie for you.

Spot-on casting,"""I was hoping you'd have hair . . ."" Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker)We know Bruce Willis doesn't have hair, but like his reluctant companion, Sarah, on a picaresque around America, we think he's cool because of the lack. And so Red goes, a comedy-adventure about the CIA pursuing one of its retired agents, Frank Moses (Willis), who needs to consult with old friends to find out why he's a target.A slick comic-book adaptation, Red (Retired: Extremely Dangerous) carries off its satire of the action genre with spot-on casting and never a moment of taking itself seriously. Not that I ever doubted Willis can't handle a younger partner (see Moonlighting) as he does here with Parker in one of the year's best pairings, superior to the also reluctant Cameron Diaz with Tom Cruise in the similar Knight and Day, which had Cruise as a rogue operative and Diaz as the potential romantic partner. Willis and Parker are just more relaxed about the violence and love mix.It's the supporting cast that makes this movie so much fun, from a gun-toting ex-assassin played by ever-attractive Helen Mirren to a sodden Russian mobster played with relish by Brian Cox, but not to neglect Richard Dreyfuss as another heavy with a light touch. All are having fun (Ernest Borgnine makes an appearance as well), adding to the growing thesis that aging stars still are as bright as ever, and maybe brighter than the younger crop of hyper Bournes and Bonds.More than one critic has labeled the Expendables, Gran Torino, Bucket List, et.al. as geri-actioners, and I like the tag",,Anonymous,Crime
Great actors+Great Script+Great humor=Great film,"This movie is DIE HARD with a humorous twist. Bruce Willis is his usual unflappable tough guy with great subtle adlibs. Mary-Louise Parker is both hilarious and adorable in a role that took some great acting to carry off believably. John Malkovich, who does so well playing thoroughly evil characters, excels as the paranoid former CIA agent and former victim of a government mind control program. Malkovich shows unbelievable comedic skills rarely seen elsewhere, as does veteran actors Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss. I had never heard of Karl Urban before, but he carries off his role as a dedicated CIA agent flawlessly. My wife who seldom likes loud, violent movies gave this movie a 7 or 8.

"A fun, entertaining, suspenseful, funny action movie that is driven by great, enjoyable characters","If I had to sum up this movie in one sentence, it would be a fun, entertaining, suspenseful, funny action movie that is driven by great, enjoyable characters. Sure, there's an all-star cast: Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren, but every one of them makes a character of his/her own.Willis, whom over the years has come across as a seemingly ordinary guy, but when messed with, he comes off as a tough, no nonsense, cliché one-liner hero. He follows this formula perfectly. His initial appearance is a quiet, simple, lonely middle-aged guy who lives in suburbia. Everything he does is routine—he wakes up at 6 a.m., works out in his basement, eats breakfast, you get the picture. But when his idyllic home is blown to hell (literally) from mysterious men in black outfits, armed to the teeth with machine guns, he reveals himself as a gifted fighter and marksmen—the old Bruce Willis is back and better than ever.If you're looking for humor, look no further than John Malkovich. He often plays nutty roles, and this is one of his best. His character paranoid and somewhat delusional, but he holds a charm that makes him probably the most lovable character in this film. His delivery of lines is priceless and the demeanor he carries for his role is perfect. Perhaps he can get an Oscar nomination for his role (maybe unlikely, but I sure hope so).Morgan Freeman (whom I never thought of as an action hero) holds himself as the old wise man that he always portrays in movies. But beneath the age, he always has a card up his sleeve in case of a deadly situation. Helen Mirren is the similar, but she has a taste for the dangerous, always wielding a gun of some sortjust in case. And for someone her age, she is gorgeous.Other great roles are delivered by Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfus, Karl Urban, Mary Louise-Parker (whom I've never seen before), as well as multiple others. The editing, sound, music, camera work, and lighting are all flawless. The pace is moderate. The 1 hour and 51 minutes did not fly by, but I wasn't bored at all. The story was mostly good, but it could've been better, then again, it's an action flick. Story is not the main goal.For an action flick, this movie has it all. Humor. Explosions. Gunfire. Even a brutal martial arts fight and a sense of the ridiculous. And once again, brilliant characters.3.5/4",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Retired-Extreme-Dangerous - and fabulous!,"Talk about a great time - 2010's Red is a fun and exciting experience.The film stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ernest Borgnine. Willis is an ex-black ops CIA agent, Frank, who enjoys talking on the phone with the young woman, Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) responsible for sending his pension checks. However, when he realizes that someone is trying to kill him, he also knows his phone has been bugged and she's in danger. So he kidnaps Sarah and takes her along while he reassembles members of his old team: Joe (Freeman) who is living in a nursing home, Marvin (Malkovich), who is living a bizarre, paranoid existence, and Victoria (Mirren), who seems to be some sort of socialite, and they try to find out why, after all this time of being retired, someone is after Frank, and who is it? Fast-paced, with great performances, Red is funny and fun, with nonstop action. Malkovich is a total scream in the wildest role, as is Mirren, an elegant British lady who is aces with a shotgun. Mary-Louise Parker is great as a woman who reads spy novels and now has a chance to live one, and her chemistry with Willis is wonderful.A total treat. Don't miss this terrific cast in an excellent film, directed by Robert Schwentke and written by Joel and Erich Hoeber, adapted from the graphic novel.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fun Action Comedy with a Few Decent Laughs,"I am a little bit of a fan of Bruce Willis and when I first rented this movie I wasn't expecting nothing perfect but it turned out be a whole lot better than I thought. As Red is based on a comic book that I've never heard of, it sure stands out as a comic book based movie. The acting was fairly good and the special effects as well such as the close range of the slow motion bullet and the missle both colliding into each other. For all you action movie fans, red has just what you need for a god action flick with the usuals like explosions, shoot outs car wrecks, etc. I would recommend this films for anyone that is tierd of the stupid action comedies that fail to make us laugh.

Entertaining Mindless Bullet-fest,"If you have read down this far in the review list, then you know the plot. Frank (Bruce Willis) is getting the old spies together to take down the bad guys.The plot is a rehash of a dozen movies like A-Team and Rambo III where old guys get together and fight for justice. This version kept moving, and the support cast was strong including Mary-Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfus, and especially Helen Mirren. Helen delivered some great lines that were fun to watch, sadly she was not in the movie that much. RED worked as a movie, and I enjoyed watching it.Head tough-guy Bruce Willis is not interesting or likable enough, and he is the weak point of the movie. I'd like to have seen a dozen other actors. Bruce is bald, just like the cartoon character, but he is not really a very good action hero.I liked paranoid Marvin's (John Malkovich) paranoid rants that turned out to be just what the NSA was doing -- in terms of their listening to them and tracking them.The special effects were solid; they didn't achieve splashy. I did not care for the post card motif -- perhaps this is borrowed from the comic book.The end of the movie was pretty clever, and I liked that.I give this movie an average rating, so it is a five. Bruce Willis fans might give it a seven.More: I love Helen Mirren with a machine gun. She was the best!",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Feel Good Movie of the Year,"15 October 2010. Sometimes it just feels great just to feel good and the movie Red eventually provides just that experience as this late summer comes to a close. There is seriousness, outlandishness, poignancy, drama, action thrills edited together in scenes that in themselves can see millions without words. This well written script has almost all of it and the difficult balance between comedy and drama is artfully and delicately put together without ripping apart the movie. With BOURNE-like precision along with the MR. AND MRS. SMITH (2005) lightness, Red brings together a multi-talented movie in a comedy-drama with an inner heart for a number of characters, even the antagonist assassin in the movie.Reminiscent of TROPIC THUNDER (2008) in its comedy-drama genre, yet with even more style, and more along the lines of Steve Carell's GET SMART (2008) yet with even more freedom to develop fresh characters that brings out the best of the all-star cast. Singular scenes and individual character performances are also echo some of the nice comedy, psychological action from THE MATADOR (2005). Perhaps the great apparent weakness or omission is the lack of great disguises used in the movie which would be assumed would be important and lacking the slick and subtle comedy drama character such as Jeff Goldblum in MR. FROST (1990). Even the comedy-family-drama of THE NANNY (2007) or FUNNY PEOPLE (2009) reflects the new delicate interplay of various movie genres that RED seems to have successfully captured.Both predictable and perhaps somewhat unpredictable, the balance between to two elements in this movie captures the best of both cinema worlds resulting in one of the most entertaining and psychologically satisfying movie of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Retread and Extremely Disappointing!,"'RED': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A cast of high caliber veteran celebrities highlights this DC comic's graphic novel adaptation. Robert Schwentke (who's directing credits include 'FLIGHTPLAN' and 'THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE') directs this tale of a team of 'retired and extremely dangerous' (which is what the acronym stands for) CIA agents called back into action after being framed and setup for assassination. The film stars John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and sadly Bruce Willis (but I guess he's beginning to get that age where he fits in with a cast of old timers) as the team. The film also co-stars Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine. The cast is pretty impressive, the rest of the film not so much.Willis plays the leader of the team Frank Moses. As the movie opens he spends his time flirting with a federal clerk named Sarah Ross (Parker) on the phone, falsely reporting lost retirement checks. He's attacked at his home one day and of course being Bruce Willis he manages to overcome the team of assassins sent to kill him and immediately flees to aide Ross knowing they'll come after her next due to his romantic interest in her. He takes her against her will and rounds up his old team (Freeman, Malkovich and Mirren) and alerts them of their danger. The team once again reunites in order to use their collective skills and resources to find out why they've been framed and staged for assassination and save themselves from extermination. Urban plays the lead CIA agent hot on their trail.The movie looks and sounds like a lot of fun but the fun is slammed down the viewers throat to the point where it's not really fun anymore. The actors are all good in their roles and fittingly cast (except for Freeman who is shamefully underused and the way he's written in and out of the film is embarrassing, for an actor of his stature) but the material they have to work with is weak and the direction is routine and uninspiring. Every joke is forced and every action scene is by the numbers and somewhat boring (mostly, there are a few exceptions). The movie is extremely cheesy in the way it pauses for each actor to have their moment, in the middle of what should be an intense action scene. It's just a huge gimmick and at no time feels like a genuine action / comedy. I'm amazed at the number of critics that sold out and gave this film a good review. That's why you never trust a critic. This movie is mediocre at best and entirely disappointing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4rYA-j3f3c",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thoroughly enjoyable,"This film was thoroughly enjoyable. The mega-star cast didn't hurt anything. Bruce Willis was as Bruce Willis does. He completely nails his character's initial ennui, and then takes off with the plot. Helen Mirren is always great, and it was such fun to see her gleefully shooting machine guns. John Malkovich plays semi-crazy better than anyone out there, and does so with zest here. Mary-Louise Parker was also fun in her fantasy-come-true adventure role. Honorable mention to Morgan Freeman and Ernest Borgnine (at 93!). To enjoy this sort of film you have to get past a few plot holes, such as government agents firing thousands of rounds in public with no obvious curiosity by the media. (CIA or not, you can't do that!) You won't be wasting the 111 minutes if you want some light entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Malkovich! Malkovich! Malkovich!,"The plot of RED (not to be confused with Warren Beatty's epic ""Reds"") is not intended to be believable. The plot is only a vehicle for showcasing the talents of a group of truly excellent actors in a comedy. It is very very funny. A lot of really good lines and comic repartee. I am reminded of the exchange in ""Crocodile Dundee"" when a punk attempts to rob Crocodile with a switchblade, and Dundee says, ""You call that a knife? This is a knife,"" while pulling his large Bowie knife from his boot.Of the star-studded cast, some are reprising character types they've used before. Bruce Willis is the lovable bald tough guy. Mary-Louise Parker uses the same character traits she uses in Showtime's ""Weeds"" series. Morgan Freeman plays his cameo role as the same Morgan Freeman character we've become familiar with. I'm not saying they aren't good or that they are limited to those portrayals (Willis, for instance, plays a different character when he wears his hairpiece), just that the roles are no stretch for them.There are a number of American actors, such as Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman, who are known for an uncanny ability to transform themselves into the character they are playing. Dame Helen Mirren also has a repertoire of diverse roles, from Britain's current Queen Elizabeth to Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison. I don't think she ever played a comic assassin before, but again, it didn't seem a stretch. Again, not a criticism -- she is delightful in the part.Richard Dreyfuss is another actor who has a very diverse repertoire. (I don't understand why he was listed as far down in the credit order as he was, even though he has relatively little screen time.) In RED, he convincingly plays a mean and vicious villain.But it is the very versatile John Malkovich who steals this show! He plays paranoid retired agent Marvin Boggs. Sarah Ross (Parker) says of Boggs, ""Wow. This guy's insane."" Frank Moses (Willis) replies, ""Well, he thought he was the subject of a secret government mind control project. As it turns out, he really was being given daily doses of LSD for 11 years."" Ross (Parker) then says, ""Well in that case, he looks great. Yeah.""Malkovich perfectly portrays a character that fits that description. That's why I summarized my review as I did (taking it from that scene in the sci-fi film ""Being John Malkovich"" where Malkovich causes what scientists call a ""singularity."")",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Close to as bad as it gets,"Consideriong the boatoad of acting talent wasted in Red and that it somehow garnered a 7 rating on IMDB I think it is safe to say Hollywood began its death throes long ago. Everyone is a ch\aricature. What is supposed to pass for humor is sophmoric idiocy. We are treated to action scene after scend where heroes can't be killed but kncoking off supposedly trained government agents is, to quote our friend, barely an inconvenience. It would have been better off as a straight spoof but no doubt the studio and the lead actor needed to be puffed up in another glamour role. Can't afford to be made fun of.

The film is fast-paced and a nice length (1 hour and 51 minutes).

Morgan Freeman breezed through his part and remains as smooth as ever, his expression was spot on when he asked his nurse to adjust the TV set picture (she had to bend over) he wasn't interested in the TV picture at all, wink wink.

"For Honor, Love, and Laughs","In a breathtaking sequence Bruce Willis's Frank Moses swerves his car protecting Mary-Louise Parker's Sarah Ross on-board. As the car door opens, Frank steps out, draws his Gloch, and fires into the Navigator windshield with CIA lead William Cooper (Karl Urban) behind the wheel. Retired CIA operative Frank hasn't lost his edge. ""RED"" is an enjoyable surprise. Director Robert Schwentke keeps it fast, furious, and fun working from the taut clever screenplay by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber. ""RED"" is based on the DC Comic by Warren Ellis and Cully Hammer. RED stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. In ""RED"" the CIA's most deadly retired agents find themselves targets of a covert assassination conspiracy. Now forced rogue, they must unravel the principle thread, and kill the man responsible.The charm of ""RED"" underlies its character and singularity. What culminates in ""RED"" is its story of honor. Bruce Willis is awesome, and at his grizzled best. I love Mary-Louise Parker, who is both quirky and sexy. Morgan Freeman is whimsically powerful. John Malkovich is completely out there as paranoid freak job Marvin. Karl Urban is amazing. As William Cooper, the CIA agent assigned to terminate Frank, he is a charismatic presence governed by a noble cause. Director Schwentke brilliantly blurs the line between good and bad, distinguishing the noble cause beyond their borders.Isolated Frank (Willis) fosters a romantic relationship with Sarah (Parker) over the phone. She is the government employee, who issues Frank his monthly pension checks. Frank is the self-imposed recluse in snowbound Cleveland. Sarah inhabits her florescent lit cubicle in the Kansas City Office. She daydreams of escaping the daily grind. Be careful what you wish for.Frank musters up the courage to ask Sarah out for a date, having business in Kansas City. Under Black Ops surveillance, a kill team strikes Frank's residence. However, Frank brutally dispatches the team with firepower and martial arts skills. Realizing the deadly conspiracy, Frank kidnaps Sarah. She admits later, "" not my best first date."" Sarah reluctantly distinguishes that she is dead without Frank. On the road and on the run they reunite with Frank's team mate Joe (Freeman) at a senior's home in New Orleans. Joe has terminal cancer. Obtaining more mission intelligence, Frank and Sarah meet up with Marvin (Malkovich), survivalist holdout and Ops LSD victim.They thwart more kill teams. In desperate resort, Frank brazenly infiltrates Langley. He obtains the Top Secret file from archive keeper played by reliable Ernest Borgnine. Frank violently schools Cooper (Urban), and barely escapes. Losses are taken; his team seeks refuge with semi-retired Victoria (amazing Helen Mirren) at her bed and breakfast in Virginia. The ""band is back together"". Apparently their operation in Guatemala 30 years ago is the fatal tie. Their assassination orders may come from the highest chain of command.Frank has a possible weakness or power—he is falling for Sarah—""I really like her."" Motherly Victoria confides, ""Frank, you're such a romantic."" On the snow covered knoll armed with her sniper rifle Victoria warns Sarah that ""if you break his heart"", she will hunt her down, kill her, and bury her in the woods. Wide-eyed Sarah says, ""OK."" This is the guilty pleasure of ""RED"". ""RED"" has a comic convolution and paradoxical gravitas. The cast is impeccable. Mirren is awesome. As Victoria she also compromised a past mission shooting her lover Ivan (the great Brian Cox) 3 times in the chest, following orders. At the moving story arc, Willis hugs Freeman, saying, ""It's been an honor."" Schwentke expertly balances the vibrant action, whimsy, and gravity. Ultimately, ""RED"" is about fighting for the just cause, for love, and for honor. That is worth going to movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Morgan Freeman is older looking but John Malkovichh really has aged. Even Mary Louise Parker is less annoying than usual. Richard Dreyfuss should dye his hair he looks a bit washed out.

At night a group of armed man break into his house and attempt to kill him. He escapes, taking along a clueless woman (Mary Louise Parker from TV's Weeds.)

OK effort but just not more than basic stuff,"With its jazzy score and high quality cast, Red thinks it's a pretty cool movie and to be fair at times it is, but for me just not overall. It uses action well and uses it enough not to make you think about the plot going on around it too much but it isn't good enough for me to cover the pretty average movie this is. It's pretty generic really, I mean don't get me wrong it tries to maybe make itself feel new and refreshing but for me it never steps up to a level at which it needs to get to if it wants to be enjoyable, but actually not also brainless. The plot revolves around an old team of RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) ex agents who come together to try and stop high skilled assassins and thugs sent from unknown assailants.The cast has a lot of big names in it, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and other names where you just might watch thinking ""Hey its them, what are they doing in this"". It does kind of feel odd if you come from the perspective of knowing nothing about this, big names are basically turned into action stars and with the exception really of Bruce Willis, many of the big names in this you would not expect to ever see them in such roles. They have fun for sure and it is fun in certain moments, but I feel it isn't fun enough and it never does enough to truly feel satisfactory. Bruce Willis as Frank Moses is, well he looks bored in the role, he isn't great here and although I think he is great casting, he doesn't do a good job. For me the two polar opposite actors here are Mary-Louise Parker who is pretty bad and John Malkovich who is pretty awesome, could not be different in how they play out their individual roles.Robert Schwentke directs and he doesn't do a great job, doesn't get enough out of the story and although the action is well taken care of, some choices in the pacing and timing of things is not done well. Too often in this it is a case of why didn't they shoot them in the head, why did they take so long to shoot and ultimately, who would or how would you ever get out of that or do such a thing. I don't like to criticise a film like this too much I mean it is mediocre but does contain some OK bits certainly, as mentioned the action is good, Malkovich is pretty funny and sometimes the cast can make all the difference in a scene, so this is not all bad by any means.I must mention the screenplay from Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber who both create a script that could I guess on paper look pretty nice but when visualised like how it is, just does not. The movie looks like it wants to be stylish with nicely done stunts, pretty pumped up action characters and a score that gives off a smell of self- satisfaction. In fact on the point of self-satisfaction, that is the one thing I truly felt made this irritating, you can see where the people making this thought ""oh that looks cool, put it in"" and I don't mean the actors but just the technical side of things as all. I'm not going to say don't see this, it's nothing bad in fact I don't even think it's poor but it is average though, same old and it just for me couldn't escape that feel.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Turns out the Americans àre capable of bringing quite solid 'comedy' movies to the big screen (without making them about sex-driven teens or road trips with a story as flat as the tarmac it's set on). These past few years we have been blessed with pictures like ""The Hangover"", ""Knight and Day"", ""The A-team"" (ok, maybe that was an accidental-comedy), the ""OMG, it's Sarah Palin!""-line from ""Did you hear about the Morgans"" and then some more which don't come to mind now...Red is the kind of movie you don't watch when you're expecting a spy-thriller. (Even though that would have been a fair expectation before they put Bruce Willis on the cast-list, no offence Bruce.) The movie has a story that's not too very deep which, in this context, is kind of a good thing. Within the first 10 minutes we get our first show of excessive violence, without getting too Rambo. I notice an honest smile on my face. Good work. It sets the tone for the whole thing immediately, mocking violence-dripped movies and having deeply funny dialogues at the same time.When I first browsed the cast I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

The trailers gave me the impression this was going to be way too much service to the fans (or perhaps the A-list actors in it). Something like the Expendables only with less action and more eye rolling.I am happy to say I was wrong. This is a solid action lite-spy thriller movie which at no point made me roll my eyes. The action sequences are over the top but at no point they are stupid. Some of them are even more realistic than most other films out there. While the movie is very violent with no fear of covering violent acts (apart from one), at no point it feels the violence is out of place. The story is in its own way believable enough. It bares resemblance to a well know film of the mid 90's but I wont' mention which out of fear I will give away too much. The active is very good, all the technical aspects/parts are very good and in general it feels like a good fun action movie for the fans of the stars in it.If you want to watch a good action movie but don't feel like watching something which requires you to completely turn off the lights in your brain, it's a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
BLACK OPS ACTION COMEDY MASTERPIECE,"I had such a blast time watching this Movie! Makes me remember when I was a kid on weekends we used to watch with my old man fun action movies like true lies, we must have watched a lot of times that one, he always loved the shooting and the explosions without the violence, the goofy romance between characters that sprung within the shooting sequences, it's all there. RED is a proper classic, is so fun to watch is those movies that you can watch every now and then and still laugh and get fun. What I don't get is the users that criticise RED for its lack of realism, It's what is all about, crazy shooting that make no sense, if you want a serious movie with beleivable shootings RED is not for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very good!,"As somebody already said, I wanted to watch only for Bruce Willis but the movie hypnotized me or something. Really good movie. So Bruce Wilis is a ""normal"" guy living in a normal house when one night ""The Cleaners"" come to his house to kill him. He then goes on assembling his team (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich...) to find out why were they after him. Action is in the centre of the movie and they are sticking to it which is very good. There is a lot of comedy: at some moments way to cliché in the other way to good (especially some references). A lot of laughter is guarantieed as well as a lot of action. This movie is definitely ""MUST SEE!"" material.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's a Blast!,"10 years old but still a very fun movie to watch. When I see promos for movies with a cast of huge actors all coming together for a shock-and-awe action flick, I usually get nervous because the actors themselves have to cover up for a lackluster plot. However, this movie really delivers.Bruce Willis is in excellent form in both the action and the comedy aspects of his character. John Malkovich's comedy timing is amazing and steals pretty much every scene he's in.RED is not an Oscar contender, and has absolutely no pretense of making a statement or considering itself high art. It's a blast nonetheless. This movie leaves you feeling happy and satisfied. Highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""this is so bad""","Minute 58 was about the point I could stomach no more. And Mary Louise Parker uttered the phrase I needed to hit the exit door. ""This is so bad"".Yes indeed.It is I guess supposed to be a comedic thriller. But the humor is lame and the thriller is lame. The plot is so corny and artificial. One good example is the conspiracy nut who Bruce Willis recruits- the guy's such a hackneyed stereotype of a conspiracy nut it's just one more ""roll your eyes"" aspect of the movie.I am amazed that some people gave this good reviews. There's nothing in the last half of the movie that could resurrect it to even 4 out of 10 stars.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Cast and a lot of fun!!,"This film was a great blend of casting especially placing Helen Mirren and John Malkovich in the sort of roles you don't ordinarily expect. Bruce Willis was really great as well. In addition, Mary Louise Parker, Karl Urban and Brian Cox do a fine job in their respective roles. And it's always great to see Richard Dreyfus show up as a bad guy.The only disappointment I had was the underutilization of Morgan Freeman. I felt like they began to develop his character but just when you thought he was going to have more to do, he didn't...After watching a few recent DVD releases lately that really made you think to follow the plot (Inception and the A Team), it was nice to view something that was just plain fun....",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A group of retired agents team up to save their lives from the government.,"An all-star cast, brilliant writing and top-notch special effects, what else can you want from an action film? Red is the perfect action film that strays between the lines of dark comedy and action thriller. Big names such as Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren headline this epic action comedy, all taking on distinctive character roles and creating memorable performances. Bruce Willis takes on the role of Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who is now being hunted by the government because he is ""R.E.D"", Retired and Extremely Dangerous. He meets up with his witty pension agent and reunites with his old band of ex-agents to counter-attack the plot against them. John Malkovich does a fantastic job as an LSD ridden ex-agent who's eccentric ways and mannerisms provide the majority of the film's comic relief. Helen Mirren plays a savvy sniper, who is classy but dangerous when it comes to her missions. Morgan Freeman makes an appearance as an ex-agent that still packs a punch. The film is based off a comic series of the same name and has elements of it in the film. The fighting sequences are intricate and fast paced. If you love guns, big guns and really big guns, this is the movie for you. Extensive gunfights and car chases leave the viewer riveted to their seat. The non-stop action and perfect one-liners make R.E.D an instant action classic and an epic adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
MUCH better than Jonah Hex!!!,"Out of all the the well deserved backlash against steaming pile ""Jonah Hex"" RED beats it hands down in everything moviegoers look for: Character development, story, plot twists, action, and of course dark, witty humor sprinkled evenly out in all the right places. True, it's not Oscar material but it succeeds in it's goal of being just a good movie; something Jonah Hex failed at immeasurably. While Jonah Hex was filled with camp and disjointed scenes at characterization of it's main players, RED gives it's characters plenty of screen time to give the audience insight into their pasts, feelings, warmth and charm, making them more than 2 dimensional and you really feel for the characters as they set out to save their hides from a secret and deadly conspiracy.I like this movie. A lot. With a witty and funny script and some truly awesome set pieces and plot, RED is one of the best comic book movies to put Jonah Hex and it's ilk to shame.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
By-the-numbers action comedy,"An unwieldy combination of lame comedy and tired Hollywood-style action, RED is so staggeringly by-the-numbers that you can almost see the gears grinding and the multiple scriptwriters trying to come up with the next gag or action scene. It's also quite watchable, although completely forgettable, so much so that a week later you won't remember a single scene of it.A bored-looking Bruce Willis stars as a retired secret agent who's forced to gather together a gang of equally past-it has-beens when a group of rogue CIA agents decide to hunt them down and kill them. In essence, it's another excuse for a group of ageing stars to have one last adventure; a plot device that has been done in everything from THE WILD BUNCH to SPACE COWBOYS.RED is particularly by rote, and a typically frenetic Hollywood pacing can't hide the paucity of imagination or the distinctly unimpressive successful gag rate. Willis gives one of those exceptionally laid back, almost bored performances that's been blighting him recently (see A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD for the worst example), but the supporting cast, in the form of Karl Urban, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich, are better. The less said about the female cast members the better: Mary-Louise Parker is horrible, and seems to think she's gurning her way through a rom-com, while the sight of Helen Mirren trying to act tough and wield heavy weaponry is, frankly, embarrassing.Some not-bad action scenes and a whole plethora of expensive special effects are thrown into the mix to bring things to life, while at the same time forgetting basic characterisation or even giving the audience a reason to care. It's a pity that this is the best Hollywood can do these days as it makes the era of LETHAL WEAPON et al look like halcyon years gone by.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hilarious,"Bruce Willis is back to the charmer that characterized his early career, and he is joined in this action-filled spy spoof by Helen Mirren (of all people), Ernest Borgnne (who is surely dead), Morgan Feeeman, John Malkovitch, Mary Louise Parker and assorted other actors and actresses. The plot isn't worth summarizing because it is ridiculous, and it's easy to understand why the CIA refused to cooperate --- although, to be fair, it did not arrange for the director, the screenwriter, or any of the actors to be assassinated, which might have been a natural response. It's as filled with weaponry and killing as any video game, and it has about as much redeeming social value. But it makes Bruce Williis seem worth watching again and it is a hoot to watch Helen Mirren as a cultured assassin foiling a CIA plot in service of the worst of the bad-guys played by Richard Dreyfuss, another casting against type. Check your logical faculties at the door and enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Back in the Saddle Again!,"Red Still Armed, Still dangerous, Still got it Red is based off the DC comic book of the same name. It surrounds Frank Moses. An Ex-CIA man Frank is threatened by a group of assassins, he decides to bring together his old team and uncover a government conspiracy that threatens them and the other Ex-CIA agents. The film helms Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.The film has a excellent cast, Bruce Willis still showing how great a actor he can be. Morgan Freeman is underused and doesn't get much screen time but the time he does have he delivers the same great performance that we love. Helen Mirren's character is a nice twist as she plays a gun toting pensioner who's hobby's differ from knitting to taking the old assassination contract. And John Malkovich is the best part of the film. Every time he comes on screen he delivers a laugh and makes his scenes really fun to watch. The story is rather average for this film but I can tell that Robert Schwentke was trying to make it interesting so I'll give him a point on that. Mary Louise Parker was a nice addition too and is nice to see her in a action role.The film's main problem is at how predictable it is, it comes across as a straight forward action flick, with some comedy and romance thrown in. But it's a fun one at that. This may just be a problem that I only have but it would have been nice if the film was given a 15 rating. For a film called Red, you'd expect a bit of blood and gore thrown in. But that's just a small problem I have with it.Red is definitely a fun film and should be seen with a few friends.

Many other epic action blockbusters such as Avatar, The Dark Knight, Terminator 2 and Inception have all succeeded of being all spectacular and of course memorable that people appreciate for the experience of the movie.

Ripping Good Entertainment!,"RED (aka Retired Extremely Dangerous) is the moniker assigned to four retired CIA operatives, and if ever there were a film that demonstrates that folks beyond retirement age are still impressively functional, this is it. The story is adapted from the graphic novel by Cully Hamner and Warren Ellis by screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber and directed with great style by Robert Schwentke. But has been said often, it is the brilliant cast of experienced actors that makes this film one to treasure as simply splendid entertainment.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is bored in his retirement; his only point of interest is a recurrent telephone conversation regarding his pension check with an equally bored government worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker in a role that finally gives the range of her comedic talent its due!). Their conversations are overheard by the CIA - William Cooper (Karl Urban) and his boss Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) - and Frank is marked for assassination. Bu told frank is wily and outsmarts and out shoots his intruders, escapes to take Sarah away from her boring desk job and a caper begins. It seems there is a plot to uncover the USA Vice President's involvement in a Guatemala coups and Frank seeks out his old confreres - Joe (Morgan Freeman, living in a nursing home but very alert and involved with CIA thinking patterns), Marvin (John Malkovich, a half crazy near delusional but very fine marksman living in an underground hideaway), and Victoria (Helen Mirren, living the elegant life of teas and social activities while privately still taking contract jobs to knock off bad people). At first Sarah is perplexed by the 'abduction' on the part of Frank, but soon becomes an involved participant in the drive to expose the secret of the Vice President. The group engages a retired Russian spy (Brian Cox) who just happens to be Victoria's old boyfriend, and together these REDs use their skills, and brains, and great humor to achieve their goal. It is the old REDs against the young CIA agents that provides the tug of war that makes the film soar.The cast sparkles in this richly colorful movie brimming over with CGI effects and impossible situations. This is not a deep film but a movie that will entertain form the first frame to the final rather surprising episode. It is a pleasure to simply watch the talents of Willis/Mirren/Freeman/Malkovich/Parker/Cox interact like so many pieces of a fine Swiss watch: they obviously love what they are asked to do!Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

What a smooth actor he is--I hope he takes an award for this movie. Morgan Freeman is terrific too, though he doesn't look close to the 80-year-old he is said to be in this part. Bruce Willis is better than usual. His portrayal of emotion is much like the description Dorothy Parker gave to Katherine Hepburn years ago, it ""runs the gamut from A to B.""

"Good action doesn't get old, it just gets smarter","While Bruce Willis was entertaining running around in Live Free or Die Hard, you could tell there was a nineteen (Die Hard) or seventeen (Die Hard 2) year gap between his last outing. And RED is the perfect vehicle for this change. Frank Moses is not an old guy trying to be a young man, he's an old, lonely, grouchy guy, who's lived his life in the shadows and is now trying to get some company, when someone starts trying to kill him for something that happened in his past. Given how secretive his work has been, and how nearly everyone he meets ends up dead, Moses has quite a few friends willing to help him figure out what is happening, all of whom not are not only strong actors, but willing to play it for laughs. Malkovich, as an overly paranoid killer, whose paranoia could be justified gets the level of worry just about right for the film, and his banter with Willis makes for a great buddy film. I once saw an SNL skit about Morgan Freeman, were he's bemoaning never being the romantic lead or action hero, always just helping out white guys with their problems. And this film is no different. He's just as watchable as ever, but the idea of him crawling through ventilation ducts or involved in a high speed car chase dies early on. And then there's Helen Mirren, playing a cool as ice MI6 sniper. This is a great role for her, and you half expect to see her take out a room of armed goons while cooking, and then bemoan the fact that she hasn't added enough seasoning. All the characters are very strong, but psychologically unbalanced, so their main hunter - Karl Urban as the ultra professional William Cooper - makes a great foil for the geriatrics. He's a young man who does things by the book, and this youth vs experience makes the cat and mouse chase stand out from other, similar stories. Oh, and Mary-Louise Parker as the love interest dragged from a cubicle into the middle of all the craziness is fun to watch, as her life spirals out of control in the company of all the guns, bombs and car chases, but you'll want to see this film for the four older actors teaching the young ones how it's done.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The only thing that was interesting was the initial ""I'm in love with the guy just by his voice"" setup. The longer it went on, the more boring it became.And I don't feel like the main character has any motivation to do what he has to do. They keep bringing in new characters because the story isn't interesting enough, but it's also cheap and annoying. It's impossible to make a story like this last for 120 minutes.

Totally Willicious,"One automatically thinks that if the movie has Bruce Willis in it ... its worth more than the price of admission. And this movie is not the exception to the rule! I think one of the reasons I like Bruce Willis, besides his piercing dark eyes staring at me from a parking lot as I made my way home, is that he doesn't have a need to use profanity to make him look and sound tough! By the way, having Bruce Willis' eyes glued to you is quite the compliment! The man is as smooth as a glass of the finest cognac available ... and he has a knack for teaming up with just the right people, when it comes to casting a movie. It would be interesting to get a peek as his list of what he terms to be ""his friends!"" Anyhoots ... it was nice to see Ernie Borgnine in a movie again. He may not be the best person in the world to stand next to at a cocktail party ... GOD forbid ... but his acting has always been top-notch. And his roles are often as likable as he was in McHale's Navy. Oh My, did I just date myself ... perhaps I should add that I heard he was likable in that series?! Mary-Louise Parker ... what can we say about this weed? The role suited her ... and she suited the role! Mary-Louise is someone I've never met, or even seen around Hollywood ... which can be a good thing. But, putting that aside, Mary-Louise is definitely a pro when it comes to tackling a role and giving her all ... and making it her own! John Malkovich ... one wonders if this kook is as kooky off screen as he is on screen. Another top-notch action hero actor with a quirkiness that makes you want to buy his a couple shots of tequila ... just to see if they straightens out his head. Not that we would want him to be any other way than he normally is ... another wonderful addition to the nut bowl! Hmmm ... I need a cashew! Speaking of cashews ... we come to Helen Mirren, the sex kitten of the over fifty set. Sassy, smart, and ready for whatever action is available ... casting Helen in this ""blow the hell out of them all"" film was, well, ""spot on!"" She gives us one heck of a phrase that suits most of our lives ... ""Life, sometimes, is complicated!"" When isn't it? Helen also proves, in this film, that a woman's accessories are extremely important when it comes to attending high profile charity events. I wonder what kind of accessories Michelle Obama wears ... oh, right ... her husband's check book ... silly me! Morgan Freeman ... his role was too limited, considering that he is as much a powerhouse actor as is Bruce Willis ... however, another powerhouse that had an even smaller role was Richard Dreyfuss.As for Karl Urban ... cute haircut! Just kidding, Karl. The man is gorgeous, and I have a hunch he'd probably make a pretty good James Bond. Although, a tone-up would do wonders for his career, his acting is as solid as it gets! All in all ... love the movie! The special effects are perfect ... a little too perfect ... I think I can go another decade without seeing a person blown to smithereens! Film cutting was excellent! Directing was excellent! I hated seeing that gorgeous house, in the beginning of the movie, destroyed! Actually, it was only the inside that I liked so much!

Good for whom?,"I really wanted to like RED, I couldn't help but be excited by the legendary cast and the promise of laughs a plenty. Yet somehow for me it ended with a pretty devastating sense of disappointment and emptiness.I'll attempt to break down where it all went wrong by stating that the problems are in the main fundamental. Firstly the script is as unoriginal as it gets churning out tired old clichés and drab gags that tell themselves. Secondly the direction is confused and inconsistent, director Robert Schwentke seems to try too hard to be the star of the show using distracting and overblown visuals meshed in with an unforgiving collection of load expensive gun fights. Further the film lacks the ability to find it's audience, jumping fidgetily between generic action comedy and stumbling occasionally into attempts of deeper and more contrite self-reflection.The least irritating element of the film is the cast, who with all mentioned previously are left with the unenviable task of trying to make something of out of very little. Bruce Willis leads from the front as the former Black-ops agent Frank Moses who endeavours to reunite his former crew (Mirren,Freeman and Malkovich) to help him solve an intricate plot he has unwittingly become part of, whilst dragging over-matched love interest Mary-Louise Parker along for the ride.I can't help but feel that with such an illustrious cast and big budget that this was a wasted opportunity. RED isn't half as terrible as it is disappointing yet it's just hard to shake the feeling that the cast had a much better time making it than I and many others will have watching it.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

He is bored with his hum drum life,regularly rips up his monthly checks just so he can call the CIA pension office just to talk with the person in charge of his plan... played very well by Mary- Louis parker. He is set up for assignation from the higher ups in the CIA for what he knows about and old job assignment and his crew of ARRP assassin's were involved in back in the 80's.(I thought the CIA was supposed to be the good guys what gives here). He is hunted down by the CIA agent William cooper (Played very well by Karl urban) who is assigned by the higher ups to hunt down Bruce Willis and his pals. They come across a conspiracy theory involving VP of the United States, and Alexander Dunning (played by Richard Dreyfuss pulled of the villain role very well as nasty arms dealer).Throughout the movie Bruce Willis and his band of aarp hit men travels across county to put clues together to find out why they want them dead. It a very well written movie and, the cast looks like they are having a lot of fun just acting like kids shootouts, kicking butt. They do a very good job with the traveling scenes. They don't keep it confined to one area. They travel across country and utilize various locations to add to the fun of the movie... I especially love john malkovich's as Marvin Boggs a crazy as a fox agent. John steals some scenes in the move that are just too funny to describe here.

WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH,"Why the Hell didn't I watch the trailer for this one and why didn't I read more of the reviews rather than just believing the 7 rating on IMDb.
Yes, I was fooled by the pretty good rating and by the fact that some fine actors signed on for this.
I just won't waste any more time on this review now that I've wasted nearly two hours on the bloody movie.
Very poor in every way possible. I shalln't be watching it again. Maybe I can sell the Blu-ray to some unsuspecting fool.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Truly awful,"Really,does Bruce Willis have no shame? It's well documented that he's a greedy jackass, but this is just shameful. 2 things jump out from this cookie cutter junk-actors of some skill (Helen Mirren and John Malkevich) prostrating themselves in such dreck. Two-Mary Louise Parker as anybody's love interest. Shoddy, predictable, and basically already done a dozen times",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Fluffy Action Comedy,"The action comedy Red is directed by Robert Schewentke and stars Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban and Brian Cox. The film takes place all over the country and is set in modern day.Frank Moses (Willis) is retired and extremely dangerous. He calls up the pension office frequently just so he talk to Sarah Ross (Parker) because he admires her. When a group of assassins tries to kill Moses he goes to Kansas City and kidnaps Ross because he fears that she may also be in danger. William Cooper (Urban) is a CIA agent who is assigned to track to Moses and take him down. Moses must find out why he is being hunted and he goes to his old friends Marvin Boggs (Malkovich), Joe Matheson (Freeman), and Victoria (Mirren) to help uncover the wide spread conspiracy. Nothing is more dangerous than the retired and extremely dangerous.The screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber was weak and conventional. Every twist and turn was easily foreseen and I felt no attachment to any of the characters. Let's just start with something that annoyed me at the very beginning of the film. When the assassins enter Moses' home they would not be all grouped together because they could easily be shot down, they would separate and cover the whole house. Then after that the group of assassins outside of the house just shoot at the house in the middle of a neighborhood. Ridiculous! It would be so much easier to just do a search and destroy, not just a shoot a lot and hope you kill the guy. Now onto the characters. There was no need for Frank Moses to have a love interest, it just makes the film more corny. Secondly I never got to know either Moses or Ross. The character description for Moses would be retired CIA agent and Ross would be normal woman. That is all that you know about those characters. On a positive note there were some funny lines in the screenplay, most of them were from Marvin Boggs. Still though it is not a good comedy, and as you can see from my above comments it is not a good action film.Robert Schwentke's direction was not terrible, even if it was great I could not give this film higher than a 7/10. He had some cool special effects going on, such as when Moses gets out of the police car and just starts shooting like it is nothing. But Schewentke is also to blame for the way the assassins at the beginning were choreographed so there goes the director points for cool special effects. Besides the special effects though there was nothing amazing about the shot choices. I can't imagine him giving much direction to the actors since they are all veterans. Willis, Freeman, Malkovich, and Mirren probably said to Schwentke during rehearsal how he isn't necessary to be there, we all know how to not really act in a movie that will hopefully win the opening weekend.There were a lot of stylistic choices in the editing by Thom Noble. All the transitions with the post cards were an interesting touch to the film, it definitely didn't hurt it at all. I felt at times though that Red was trying to imitate Kick Ass with all of the special effects and stylistic editing. That isn't a bad thing but if it was it did not really compete with Kick Ass in that category.The acting overall I would have to say is pretty poor, with one exception. Bruce Willis basically just read the lines and looked all suave, and he was a poor lead. He in no way brought me into the film the whole time I just kept thinking this movie is made for people to feel like they are watching a movie. The same goes for Mary Louise Parker, in how she just played a conventional normal woman put under extreme circumstances. Now the only person in this film that I can actually say is good is John Malkovich. He is great as being a paranoid, insane, ex spy who just wants to kill everyone and thinks everyone is trying to kill him. Almost all the laughs in the film comes from him, he steals the show away. Morgan Freeman is like Bruce Willis who plays a suave guy with a couple of one liners, nothing too special. Helen Mirren has a small part but she also brings in a few good one liners. Karl Urban plays the CIA agent trying to kill Frank Moses and he is decent nothing special. He in no way does a bad job, he just doesn't do a good job. I just have to say that the woman that Urban's character takes orders from in the film is probably one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. All she does is say lines with an evil voice. I'm not going to look up her name because then she wins. Lastly Brian Cox is kind of decent as a Russian spy guy, he gives a few laughs out.If you were really hoping to see a movie that is extremely thin then this is the one for you. I'm giving this a 5/10 just because Malkovich did some strong work in here. If you want to know some better action comedies than this off the top of my head there is Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Live Free or Die Hard, and True Lies. This is just a light hearted movie, so if that's what you're into then watch this.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
action and that's it,"Retired Extremely Dangerous is a good action movie. It's that kinda film that you expect to see if you want to just chill and get entertained. There are some quite impressive action scenes. Also there are some quite comical scenes which make you probably smile. But that's about it. A lot eye-catching mistakes can be seen. There are many plot holes too. It's like if you are not entertained that much, all you want to ask is why- questions or 'how is that possible' questions.There are some superb actors around. Bruce Willis is good with his elegant and skilled character. He is definitely not retired. Others look solid but to see them do something totally different what we are used to see, like Helen Mirren shooting a machine gun on a party dress, is a little awkward.Nevertheless, if you are bored and you want to get entertained by a fast-paced action movie, you could give this one a go.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nothing to blush over,"Sometimes, the mere novelty of an idea can see a movie through the entirety of its run time (for a recent example of this, see the action-star-has-been extravaganza ""The Expendables""); and sometimes, the novelty falls apart well before the movie is over. For its initial hour, ""Red"" engenders optimism about where it will ultimately wind up: retired CIA operatives played by Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren find themselves targeted by assassins for unknown reasons. During this introductory period, we are treated to some stunning action setpieces, some amusing (if not always hilarious) character development, and some name actors doing what they do best (Willis, especially, seems to be having a blast playing a parody of the summer action hero he helped create). Director Robert Schwentke stages the action and cross-country story with a kinetic fluidity; it's a shame, then, that the film (adapted from a DC comic, believe it or not) eventually succumbs to the demands of a plot that, by the time it rolls around, feels half-baked an disposable.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A Short Review for this watchable, but forgettable movie","I think one would know what to expect from this kind of movies, the over the top action, clichéd hunt the bad guy with your friends, oh there's a list to help you out. You know if you start looking for plot holes and mistakes with the movie you'll find plenty but one can choose to ignore these and watch it just for the actions. But its devoid of any good action in the first 40 min. Performances by everyone is fine nothing commendable but you are not here to see performances are you? Story is predictable and nothing else worth mentioning In all its watchable and can be fun and enjoyable with friends. I would have given it 6 but i'm deducting one for boring me through the first 40 min.Verdict: meh.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Practically no realism, but what did you expect?","Robert Schwentke's adaptation of the graphic novel miniseries is not a movie that one can take seriously. ""Red"" makes no pretense about being a silly action flick. Bruce Willis is the star, but John Malkovich's conspiracy theorist is the best character. Helen Mirren is the most surprising cast member; someone who won an Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth is not the type whom I would expect to co-star in a movie about a former black-ops CIA agent on the run.The movie contains practically no realism: a hit squad machine-guns a house without waking up the neighborhood, and there's a car chase through a conveniently empty street. But let's face it: we shouldn't expect anything realistic in these flicks. This is one movie that knows exactly what kind of a flick it is. It's easy to enjoy if you accept it as something silly.Also starring Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban (Éomer in the LOTR movies and Bones in the ""Star Trek"" reboot), Morgan Freeman, Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine. Therefore, ""Red"" is a combo of people who have worked with Jessica Tandy, Ian McKellen, Clint Eastwood, Steven Spielberg and Frank Sinatra.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A rip off story line of Mr. and Mrs. Smith or Ex CIA comedy drama,"Typical script of a superstar cast, with the bald headed Bruce Willis, ex CIA agent , boring blah, action comedy film, didn't we see like 8 similar movies come out in the pre-pandemic, Blu-ray DVD era? LOL. The film is okay, story like I said is a rip off of other movies. Same type of vibe similar to Ocean's Eleven mixed in with like a Jason Statham movie. The soundtrack also, very similar to other movies, with Aerosmith's 'back in the saddle again' catchy jam, and The Meters ' Cissy Strut'. Good songs, but a okay soundtrack with two good songs, can't make a bad movie a good movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's not bad visual chewing gum and Mirren is great - but it is juvenile and doesn't feed.,"A ""romp"" I think they say. Plot is not worth discussing. There's only one way this works - becausee it is TOTALLY a Formula: Get Big Name Stars On a Break between Projects. Pay them off. Shoot quickly. Throw the mud at the wall and see if it sticks with the public. This one stuck , others do not. Mirren is the savior as you are locked into her face when she speaks - and she always takes her acting seriously, even in this piece of fluff. Most shameful effort for the money? Brian Cox - a cynical and mildly offensive performance ....unfortunately a little too close to the real Brian Cox for comfort.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Average, nothing special","This move is just average. Nothing special and I did not expect anything better. Just a movie for the brainless. Poor script, idiotic story and too many famous names. I don't know why most people say Malkovich's role was so great, same it was in ""Burn after reading"". Actually he is not playing AT ALL! He is making some faces, but with his face its more than enough for most of people to consider it ""acting"". Well, this is just Malkovich, all this acting is nothing he couldn't do while shaving in the morning.Generally not recommended, unless you have few bucks too much for the moment, but I tell you - its an average movie for people who think more about popcorn than about the movie itself.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Could've been so much better,"As Morgan Freeman puts it,""We're getting the band back together. That's nice""and it's when the cast is having fun with the material that ""RED"" is decent. And a solid cast it is, but the lead was entirely miscast. Bruce Willis applies his halfhearted smirk and lets everyone else do the heavy lifting. And so much of this focuses on his character, so he just sucks the energy right out of it.I didn't like watching this very much because the tone was all over the place. When the (better) costars were on the screen, there was glee, there was energy; and they're doing their best with lackluster characters. If Willis would just get out of the way and let Malkovich, Freeman and Mirren work, this would be great.5/10Speaking of Helen Mirren, she's the shining star of this movie. She just lights up the screen like the guns she wields (which are huge). And that is something to see.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thrilling,"Red movie which stars Bruce Willis is perfectly done well. The script was well written. What makes this movie so much fun is the cast. Bruce Willis is excellent as Frank Moses. He's equally convincing as a retired man living a life of monotony or a world class spy. There's a scene where one moment he's an old man shuffling around his house in a bathrobe, then a moment later he's snapping a hit-man's neck. It's a great transition and that contrast offers up a lot of comic potential that Willis makes the most of. Over all I like all of the main leads playing retired but all of them have the power or training to hit back at someone. These movie is one of my favorites. Its actually addicting and it's something that i could watch over and over.",,Anonymous,Crime
suffers from the usual flaws but still a good time,"Slick, funny, well-cast action-comedy based on the graphic DC comic. Frank Moses (Willis) was one of the top agents of the CIA, but has long since retired and put the old life behind him. Unfortunately the past comes back to haunt him when he unexpectedly becomes the target of lethal black ops agents who've made it their mission to eliminate him. In a race against time, with his deadly adversaries in hot pursuit, he reunites his old team (Freeman, Mirren, Malkovich) in an effort to uncover the conspiracy. A few longueurs and some familiar plotting, but it's hard to miss with this cast, these energetic action scenes, and so many laughs. Parker seems out of place, but Malkovich has more fun than anyone as the cunning, yet extremely paranoid member of the group. **½",,Anonymous,Crime
