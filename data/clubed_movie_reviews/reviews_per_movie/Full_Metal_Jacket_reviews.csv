The movies finally got Parris Island right,"Though I've read only a couple of dozen of the nearly 500 comments on this film, I didn't see any from ex-Marines who'd had the Parris Island experience. I went through PI in 1957. The time period in the picture would have been about 1967, since the in-country sequence includes the '68 Tet Offensive. Little had changed in those 10 years except the switch from M1s to M16s.For the most part Kubrick got Parris Island right on the money. And why shouldn't he have, since his screen DI, Lee Ermey was in fact a real DI before he started acting (he played another DI in ""The Boys of Company C,"" an earlier and lesser Vietnam flick)? He had a built- in technical adviser. The screams and insults and profanity and physical punishment were all part of the DIs armamentarium. When you're facing up to 75 young strangers you need to immediately establish absolute authority and hang on to it for 13 weeks. Furthermore, you want to break the breakable as soon as you can. My platoon had its Private Pyles and though none ended up as he does in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" I remember that they simply disappeared from our ranks, never to be heard from again. Nothing Ermey as Sgt. Hartman does is exaggerated.Kubrick, however, does exaggerate. Speaking of Pyle's ending, it's almost impossible for me to imagine that a recruit could manage to sneak a clip of live rounds away from the rifle range. Every shooter at the range has his own rifle coach, and every single round is very carefully accounted for. Kubrick started the killing one scene too early.I've read that DIs nowadays are forbidden to use the time-honored f-word, and are not allowed to lay hands on recruits. I don't know if that's good or bad for training (I had my face slapped hard my first day of boot camp and that was just for openers), but then all of us old-timers like to brag about how tough it useta be!A final note: It's interesting to compare ""Full Metal Jacket"" to another attempt at a portrayal of Parris Island, Jack Webb's ""The DI,"" made around '55 or '56. Webb tries for authenticity, but as I was to learn a year or so later, his PI was a boy scout camp.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Very good movie- A film of 2 halves: the first perfect, the second lagging behind but good enough","I finally got around to watching this for the first time.The first half is a 10/10, the second half is a 7/10 and falls apart into what seems like every war movie's clich√©s, even though it's good enough.The first half is a masterpiece of filmmaking- there's almost no flaws, the pacing is perfect, the acting great, it has an instant classic type experience to it you'll never forget.The second half is good, decent but it doesn't rival the first half and its perfection. That makes its let down even more pronounced.So overall, I give it an 8/10 because you can't overlook the drop in quality of the second half.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Full Metal Jacket 30 years later,"Strange, as I sat to watch Full Metal Jacket for the first time in years, what I remembered most was Lee Emery's Sgt Hartman's rantings and Vincent D'Onofrio. In fact, it was Vincent D'Onofrio's Pvt Lawrence, known as ""Gomer Pyle"" that made this Stanley Kubrick film, truly memorable. I'm noticing this more and more as I get older and revisit old films. The performances, certain performances, even in supporting roles allow a film to keep growing with the passing of time. Full Metal Jacket a shattering film or I should say, two shattering films. The first part, the training, the intro is a masterpiece practically impossible to match up, so, the second part doesn't match it. But, still. A film-experience. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance even more powerful now, 30 years later. Enormous! The British skies over Vietnam is another reminder than an artist's eye knows no boundaries.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
You asked for comments Vietnam era Marines,"I was a Marine at Parris Island in 1977 and I can certainly tell this film is very accurate in every respect right down to the blanket party scene. The base that they used in England looks very much like Parris Island, right down to the Grinder and the barracks in the background. The part where they are running on the road with Joker carrying Pyle looks like the road to Elliots Beach. The Cadence is true to life as well as Senior Drill Instructor Hartmans dialect, all of the comments I can say 100% that I have heard on The Island and had them used on me. For a person who was there it had me fooled, although the O-Course and the rifle range are completely different in layout and looks. The inside of the barracks and the head are identical to the real thing. For anyone viewing this film trust me it doesn't get any closer to being Parris Island and I would say that the ""Gunny"" saw to that. As far as the in country segment it looks pretty much like the real photos I saw in USMC training films.",,Anonymous,Drama
Paint It Black,"""With flowers and my love both never to come back ... It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black"". So sings the man whose throbbing song marks the film's end, merciless lyrics to describe thematically a story that is as wrenching as it is mesmerizing.There are no villains in this film, only heroic victims. The villains are all off-screen, comfy behind mahogany desks, or dressed for success and giving shrill speeches about how maintaining peace requires war. Strange logic.First it's boot camp, a dreary prospect at best, for an ordinary group of young American men. Here, a sadistic drill Sargent, in colorful language, barks out orders and insults straight from Hades. It's do or die, almost literally, for our greenhorns. It's an ordeal of blackness from which some may never recover. Still, the grunts learn a valuable lesson; namely, that life is mostly physical, not mental. It's a lesson some ivory tower college professors never learn.But then it's on to an even blacker black ... Vietnam. Combat scenes are rendered believable by effective visuals and terrific sound effects: pounding percussion, amplified sounds of equipment and footsteps across explosive debris, and an always present, ever-so-subtle ... echo. Potent and torturous, these scenes convey a Zen-like immediacy, an impending sense of doom. And then at film's end, those lyrics ...Composed of two, barely overlapping, parts, the script's structure is a bit unorthodox. But the film works, owing to an intensity that never lets up. R. Lee Ermey is of course terrific as the harsh drillmaster. Casting of the young lions is okay, though a tad weak in one or two cases. Insertion of pop songs of the era works well, to amplify the cultural disconnect between a war-torn Vietnam and an indifferent America.Like reading a history book, watching an occasional war movie is good for the soul. It puts one's problems in perspective. For that reason, this particular war movie is better than most. It's riveting, intense. And the sense of impending blackness hovers ever present over the story's heroic victims, like the sword of Damocles.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fascinating Despite Come-Down,"The first half of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is so intensely entertaining that director Stanley Kubrick can be forgiven for the slight come-down that follows. The opening scenes draw us into the strict world of ""maggots"" training to join the ranks of real men, otherwise known as Marines. We see the characters humiliated, yelled at like children, beaten and, in one tragic case, broken down. It's an unpleasant yet fascinating place to visit from the comfort and safety of our living room couches. Yet once the action shifts to the Vietnam War, when you would expect even better, something is lost. The characters seem less real and the atmosphere less intriguing. Overall, however, there aren't many faults to find with this effort, but be forewarned that it's certainly not for younger viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Kubrick is genius.,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket seems like an uncompleted film, but to me that's poetic justice to one of America's uncompleted wars. The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like you are there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war. Kubrick is the master.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
'Born To Kill' - The best Vietnam war movie of all time,"SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death.A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to ""weed out all non-hackers"". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes ""Gomer Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself.The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show.'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the ""duality of Man"" according to Jung. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Compelling from the first time the shaver bites,"Goddamn you Stanley Kubrick. For me Clockwork Orange set the standard a long time ago for cinematic perfection; FMJ just raises the bar. Sitting around with bored in-laws I quietly slipped this into the DVD player, 20 minutes later conversation has ceased and everybody is absorbed. Predictable Kubrick really, stunningly lit, musical soundtrack that is oh-so-right, and the cinematography -Jesusmotherofmary. Ten years before anybody had thought of picking up a movie camera and running with it, Kubrick had perfected the technique. War is hell? -it sure looks a vision of hell.

"""The dead know only one thing - it is better to be alive""","Full Metal Jacket is an excellent war film. All the characters are very well written, and represent very common characters in the military. There's always a class clown, a hardened individual that's respected, and someone who just isn't capable. The acting of Vincent D'Onofrio in this is exceptional, he only has a short amount of screen time, but his story is very sad and impactful. The second half of the film starts to become less enjoyable, but nevertheless it's still a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
FMJ,"Arguably the first half of this movie is what this movie is remembered by. It's a incredible piece of acting and writing. It fully engages you and doesn't really let you go. Though it does at a moment become predictable where it will end. But being the bare witness to the demoralization and dehumanization of humans to turn them into killing machines is somewhat unmatched.The second half however is underwhelming. Few of the things seen truly feel impactful and that's also due to the somewhat underwhelming performance, writing and directing of Pvt. Joker. I don't know why they did it but his emotional vulnerability is all over the place, one moment he doesn't even care about a fallen squad member, and then he does, there's no transition. And it made the character unbelievable and thus ruined much of the emotional turmoil for me. The second half felt simpler and cheaper to me in general, dumb, ignorant soldiers in a war they aren't supposed to be in. The acting just felt somewhat flat as well. Like the banter between Joker and Animal Mother. And the anti-war message was lacking to say the least due to a lack of visual despair and agony.The directing and music is fantastic (though not that bird song..ugh), not much more to say there than you'll hear more than enough iconic soundtracks and beautifully shot scenes (set design mostly). Some practical effects and such feel lacking though and is inconsistent, one guy gets shot, blood splatters everywhere, another guy gets shot, and nothing, just falls down to the ground unconvincingly. This was especially bad during a ambush scene at basecamp where the enemies just ''played dead'' it seemed and fell with grace.So yeah, I'll remember this movie for its first half, but I almost already forgot most of the second half...definitely not one of Kubrick's best.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
terrible second part,"Honestly, Very overrated. Not bad, but overrated. Nothing special or outstanding. Except for the first part.The first part I really enjoyed. The geeky ""boys"" who had to endure the hard training and Viscous personality of their drill sergeant. Some funny scenes and some showcasing the atrocities they had to endure and the effect it had on their mind and psyche. Which led to the shooting and suicide at the end of the first part.Loved every bit of it, the acting the build up and where the story is going. Honestly, it was heading to become an AMAZING movie!But.....Unfortunately, the second part is where it went south. Very random scenes and not engaging at all. Subpar and cliche war scenes without any point. Just random shooting at buildings. And barely any good acting that show how war is, they barely had any expressions and feelings. Nothing much with the plot (the second half) nor the dialogue. Could have showcased how their minds are affected. Also, why show the atrocious training in boot camp if they don't lose their minds at war or at least show how?Yes, Joker the decent human being who has the peace sign and a good heart was trained brutally to be ""born to kill"".. but what's so weird or mind blowing? The second part was very vague.(note: the highly trained born to kill guy joker drops the weapon like a coward when he saw a girl shooting when had no ammo)Also, the whole movie was background of shooting.

A film of two halves,"'Full Metal Jacket' was a film that I had been meaning to watch for a while after all the good stuff I had heard about it.It really is a film of two halves, unfortunately I didn't like the 2nd half.The 1st half at boot camp was excellent, we saw a lot of character development and emotion as well as a lot of humour and really serious issues. R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio were just brilliant.The 2nd half I didn't enjoy as much, it looked great and there was a lot of action but it was just a bit boring and felt really dragged out, whereas the 1st part just had everything that you wanted.Glad I got round to seeing it but wouldn't watch it again, slightly disappointed after a really good start to the film.6/10.",,Anonymous,Drama
Kubrick's version of Vietnam,"Stanley Kubrick always managed to bring something new to his palate whenever he made a film. He brought dark comedy to the screen with Dr. Stranglove, an epic story with Spartacus, and a film more important for its efforts than box office potential in the film Paths of Glory. This is what makes Full Metal Jacket so entertaining.Humor, horror and political commentary are the themes which shape Full Metal Jacket. From the overbearing drill sergeant to the war loving soldiers. It all seems to make sense within this film, never overstepping its bounds or being to subtle. Kubrick may have alienated some his hardcore fans with such a mainstream-type story, but then again, he helped mainstream movies take a bold step. What doesn't the current cinema owe Kubrick?",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
R. Lee Ermey.,"R. Lee Ermey dominates this Stanley Kubrick directed Vietnam War drama, as he plays profane, no-nonsense, ultra tough Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, who belittles, browbeats, and insults the marine recruits in brutal boot camp training. Vincent D'Onofrio plays a slow-witted recruit who gets it the worst from Hartman, until he finds out that he is quite good at shooting... Mathew Modine plays ""Joker"", since he has an overt sense of humor that also captures the attention of Hartman, whose relentless, unmerciful verbal attacks take their toll in ways he didn't imagine... Film then picks up later, as Joker is a war correspondent for Stars & Stripes, who witnesses first hand the insanity of Vietnam...R. Lee Ermey so dominates the first half of the film(in an unforgettable, searing portrayal of dehumanization) that, when his part is over, it leaves a looming shadow over the rest of the film that is never lifted, though it is still a well-presented look at the war, though nothing exceptional.

"Still modern today, all too modern.","One of the greatest war movies ever, a statement very few will dispute. I will therefore not illustrate this point : thousands have done it before me, often brilliantly.I'd rather lay the stress on Kubrick's modernity in ""Full Metal Jacket"". Indeed the USA being once again at war, it is interesting to compare the way they wage war these days with the way they did back in the sixties. And the comparison is edifying. Just apply the following statements to Iraq and you will realize NOTHING HAS CHANGED : - the marines are trained to become killing machines without being taught minimum knowledge about the people they come to defend. - the boys know nothing about the Vietnamese and reason according to American standards : for instance ""Cow-Boy"" complains half-jokingly half-seriously that there are no horses in Vietnam. Another example is the soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse Club hymn after fighting, which strikes as particularly out of place. - they try in vain to impose democracy through gruesome violence and destruction. Such similarities abound and testify to the film's absolute - and unfortunate - modernity. I wish Kubrick was still with us. I also wish George Bush and his advisers had seen this masterpiece and - most of all - understood its message. They would have avoided another bloody war doomed to fail.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Kubrick - yay! One of the best war-based movies ever,"I like Kubrick's stuff. Generally any movie he directed was several notches, in quality terms, above any other director (particularly those working nowdays). Does `Full Metal Jacket' continue to show the mastermind behind `2001', `The Shining' and `Dr. Strangelove'? Yup, it does.As plots go. there isn't much here. I don't particularly care because the script makes up for it. `Full Metal Jacket' is very much a movie of two halves - the first half dealing with a group of conscripts in training at military camp and the hardships they endure under their `hard-as-nails' instructor. The second half is about their exploits in Vietnam itself. Fights? In 'Nam? Haven't we seen all that before? Yes, but rarely with such an experienced hand at work. And it's the camp scenes that are so wonderful.Gustav Hasford et. Al. have produced an excellent script, particularly for the opening hour. There's barely a moment's pause before you're thrown into the screaming face of Sergeant Hartman. He's hurling abuse at his new recruits with lines so forceful and sharp they'll have you gasping in shock while simultaneously laughing in incredulity. It's the way the script runs in without a pause for breath that helps so wonderfully - and the fact that it's so powerful. It's never just about one-liners from a sergeant, it's also telling a story about how humans work under these conditions. The first half is about how they suffer under their own at home (and very well told it is too), the second half about the human condition under the duress of war. It's an interesting comparison, and a tale well told. The battle may lack some sort of overall context or resolution, but then I feel that's in keeping with the movie - it's about the individual, and not the war, and such elements cannot be easily quantified.All the characters have a grounded `real world' feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil/beyond-hope look he gives later on (anyone who has seen the movie will know the one I mean), remains as the most frightening look I've ever seen depicted onscreen. All in all the cast accredit themselves well here.And so to the direction. It's Kubrick. It's good. Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. There's some lovely use of filters (that haunting blue). There's a brilliant subtle score, that's eerie when used, but never intrusive. There's a very good command of pace - the viewer is never left idle or bored, and the story (particularly in the tremendous first half) flows along smoothly. Great touches abound throughout - check out the many examples, such as the opening scene of Hartman marching right up to the recruits (and to the camera), spitting and screaming vindictive comments, almost as if at the viewer. Some may criticise the almost disconnected feeling you have in the battle scenes towards the end, but I found their stillness, their quietness, and raw power, far more effective than the flash-bang wizardry employed in tripe such as `We Were Heroes'. I can blather on about Kubrick for ages. so I'll stop now.Is `Full Metal Jacket' perfect? Not quite because of the `two halves' syndrome. Although they do contrast and complement one another, the first half is very much the stronger half. The second feels weaker against it. In and of itself the second half would normally be regarded well, but it doesn't have the visceral power that the first does. I love both bits, but I do love one bit more. This makes the movie suffer just a little. There's so much to like here though that I can't criticise too much - and so much to cherish (especially in the lines delved out). Once more the main man succeeds. Definetely worth seeing. 9/10.",,Anonymous,Drama
Brutal anti-war film flirting with satire,"Marine recruits are followed as they endure basic-training at the hands of an abrasive drill instructor and are then deployed to Vietnam in 1968. This was Stanley Kubrick's almost over-the-top contribution to the trend in 'Nam-based anti-war films in the late 1970s and 1980s and may be best known for Gunnery Sergeant Hartman's (Ronald Lee Ermey) eloquently imaginative foul diatribes as he torments the neo-jarheads, especially pudgy incompetent Pte. Leonard (Vincent D'Onofrio ), or 'Pyle' as he is immediately christened. The war scenes are quite good, especially the lengthy set piece about the VC sniper in the ruined factory and, as expected from the auteur, the cinematography and direction is excellent. Many of the characters seemed to be almost caricatures, with minimal 'back story' and 'new names' (their boot camp nicknames remain with them), and although this was likely part of the 'message', I found some of the marines, notably 'Animal Mother' (Adam Baldwin) bordered on parody (as did Pyle's demented grimacing when he finally cracks under the consent abuse at the hands of the sadistic Gunny). Good but not quite at the level of 'The Deer Hunter' (1978) or 'Apocalypse Now' (1979). The 'Mickey Mouse Club' closing scene is memorable.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"a superb, grim, cold, moving film","A preliminary note: anyone who liked this movie well enough to read comments should know that a considerable amount of detail in both it and _Apocalypse Now_ had origins in a 1968 Japanese novel called Into a Black Sun, by a Japanese war correspondent working in Vietnam at the time. It took about 20 years to be translated into English, but it's in American paperback now. I recommend it.I just saw this movie for the first time since it was deployed in movie theaters in '87. As then, I was knocked out by what a great film it is. I can't help but contrast it with such movies as Apocalypse Now and Barbarians At The Gate, both movies that I admire, but let's face it, they are florid and melodramatic. Full Metal Jacket is anything but. It is so cold and hard in tone that it freezes your bones. At the same time, both the cinematography and sound track are so good, so effective, that the watcher can't look away from the movie.This is classic Kubrick, in my opinion: the correct correlation of visual and audio information, with a plot that is so horrifying that one lies awake for awhile.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Power of Film demonstrates the Horror of War,"A gritty, intense, no-holds-barred war film that grabs attention from the very beginning and holds it all the way through.  The only detriment to this film is the fact that the first half (Boot Camp) is so much more powerful than the second half (Vietnam).The film is basically about how war sucks the life out of humans and turns them into 'killing machines'.  The greatest performances in this film are of course R. Lee Ermey, the savage drill instructor, and Vincent D'Onofrio, his slow-witted whipping boy.  The viewer alternately laughs and cringes at the relentless abuse and degradation inflicted by the former on the latter.  And at the famous line, ""What is your major malfunction?"", the tension reaches an almost unbearable limit and the viewer ceases to move or breathe.This movie, like many of Kubrick's, is too graphic for many people, but I highly recommend it to those who can withstand its assault on both senses and consciences.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing Kubrick does it again,"This is another Kubrick masterpiece that has pleased people all over the world. This time it is a different kind of a war based movie, and I have to say that it is one of the best if not the best war movie of all time. Many people write that the second half of the movie is bad, or even horrible. I agree that the first part of the movie is the best part, because it shows a completely new side of the lives of marines. No other movie has ever showed that base camp training episode as well as Kubrick does it. It is very psychological and painful to watch these men braking down and then rise as cold-blooded killers. No one shows that as well as ""Gomer Pyle"". As many others I think that the drill Sergeant gives this movie an extra spark with his comical lines and hard personality, he actually makes you laugh, and even so you really get to hate him. The second half is the actual battle in Vietnam. This is where the movie is more similar to other war movies, but yet it is unique. Kubrick is all over the place throughout the entire movie, the camera and sound effects along with the music keeps reminding us that this really is a Kubrick film. The second half is without doubt also amazing, because of the uncensored madness it makes you sick with sorrow and hate. The sniper scene is of course one of the strongest and most terrifying scenes of the second half. Also the interviewing part is a very good idea I think, Kubrick finds yet another way of showing the different mind states of these men. That makes the characters even more real and makes you even more sympathetic for them and their destinies. In every way a breathtaking movie from start to finish. Kubick uses all the methods of making a good war movie, and then some. Besides that the movie is filled with intelligent and poetic lines, beautiful details and symbols, and some of my all time favorite movie quotes. This movie leaves a stain and it will always be high on my personal list of movies. Watch it, enjoy it, watch it again and love it. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Superb, one of Kubrick's best","I like Stanley Kubrick, and I love his films, especially 2001, Barry Lyndon, Paths of Glory, Dr Strangelove and this, his penultimate film. Full Metal Jacket is a harrowing, violent and foul-mouthed film, yet it is superbly done. True, one or two parts may lack tropical realism, but the atmosphere the film creates is extraordinary. The film looks excellent with skillful cinematography. The script is very well crafted and does have a sense of realism, while the story is compelling with the transition from the training at the camp to the bombed Vietamnesse city smoothly done. I am with those who thinks the first half is better than the second, but that is not to say the second half isn't good, it is more than good, but the first half really was outstanding.

That Giant Sucking Sound,"The unifying theme of Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' is that Vietnam put American in the toilet; each of the film's three parts, or ""Acts"", has characters in what is repeatedly described as ""a world of s--t.""

Narrator protagonist Matthew Modine (as James ""Joker"" Davis) not only wears a ""Peace"" button on his uniform, but also has written ""Born To Kill"" on his helmet (to illustrate the duality of man). The reason for the war is explained, ""We are here to help the Vietnamese because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out.""Probably, the film's strongest ""story"" is told in the first ""Act""; it features drill sergeant R. Lee Ermey (as Hartman) belittling overweight Vincent D'Onofrio (as Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence). This story literally ends in the latrine, where a successfully trained killer demonstrates his ability. Some of the material in the rest of the film becomes very weak, in comparison; especially disappointing are some mid-movie scenes ""staged"" for the camera of ""Stars and Stripes"" photographer ""Rafterman"" (Kevyn Major Howard) - the characters all say silly things for the camera. Still, some near-poetic moments of humor and brutality remain to be seen.******* Full Metal Jacket (6/17/87) Stanley Kubrick ~ Matthew Modine, R.

The Marine's don't want robots - they want killers.,"This is the journey undertaken by Private ""Joker"" J.T. Davis, from brutal training camp to Vietnam itself.As most people know by now, Full Metal Jacket is divided very much into two different halves, halves that to me show the best and worst of the talented director, Stanley Kubrick. For the first part we are subjected to the training regime inflicted on wet behind the ears boys, boys soon to become Marines out in the harshness of the Vietnam War. This is real dehumanising stuff, frighteningly essayed by the brilliance of drill instructor R Lee Ermey's performance. We know, see and feel that the boys are primed to be killing machines, unemotional killing machines at that, with Kubrick astutely weaving the brutality of camp into the moral quandary that was the war itself. One particular recruit, Private Gomer (a heartfelt and unnervingly great Vincent D'Onofrio) is the film, and Gustav Hasford's (writer of the novel and co screenwriter here) point of reference in this incredible first half. It's with this strand that ""Jacket"" burns itself into the soul of the viewer, to hopefully set us up for what will be Private ""Joker's"" (Matthew Modine) preparation for the Vietnam conflict.Then it's that second half...Where do we go from here? We already know that ""Joker"" and his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped of their basic humanity. Soldiers primed to kill, it's harsh, but true. But Kubrick has already chilled our blood and bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy of the ""Boot Camp"" set up. Modine's (who isn't strong enough to carry the picture) ""Joker"" is now the film's axis, a clever, most definitely articulate character, who is thrust into the murky and muddled battle of the Tet Offensive, yeah and so? All it amounts to is a prolonged series of rationale and philosophical musings on the false war. Kubrick even shifting to safe mode with a clumsy narration segment spouted by ""Joker"".Full Metal Jacket is a truly fine film, but it's not the brilliant one it really should have been. If one can take the time to venture deeper with the second half, then it doesn't deliver on the already made point promise of the first part. Technically it's flawless, incredibly designed, with Douglas Milsome's cinematography stunningly effective. But I'll maintain to my final day that Full Metal Jacket finished up as being bloody and pretty instead of being a poignant and horrifying masterpiece. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best war film I have seen,"NO SPOILERS! This is a review, not a synopsis.First of all I love Kubrick's work, so I came into this with a bias. However I have seen a lot of action and war films, and this one, to an individual who never went to war, seems the most true-to-life, taken as a whole. This IS how you have to look at this film, incidentally; trying to break it down into two or three parts and say which was better is missing the point of the film, I think.In the same way that ""Trainspotting"" was an anti-drug film that did not gloss over anything, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is (for me) an anti-war film that stares straight at the ugliness of war and the potential for violence within almost all people, especially those trained, conditioned, even twisted, into military roles, without preaching even a single time. Less allegory and more applicability! Wonderful!The camera work was superb. I felt like I was walking through the movie with the Marines, from the barracks to the battlefield scenes.I have seen others criticize this film for the voice over, but I felt that it was used sparingly, and was helpful, not overdone. The narrator doesn't say anything that seems out-of-place.Others have commented on the music, the acting, and so on, so I won't add my repetitive comments, except that the drill sergeant is perfect!The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL.10 out of 10, perfect.",,Anonymous,Drama
one of the most compelling war movies,"In Parris Island, South Carolina, a group of raw recruits are brought in to be trained by the hard-nosed Marine Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Joker (Matthew Modine) tries to help the slow Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) which comes to a sad end. The second half starts with Joker in Da Nang working as a reporter for Stars and Stripes. Then the Tet offensive happens and Joker goes out to report. He's reunited with Cowboy (Arliss Howard) who is leading a rifle squad.The first half is anchored by the great performances of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. They are incredible. The second half is the war. Matthew Modine leads competently but it is the mesmerizing directions from Stanley Kubrick. It is always The Trashmen's Surfin' Bird that comes to mind first. It's impossible to lose interest during the second half. Some people may want it to be more obviously anti-war. It is not quite so blatant. It is murky just like what I imagine the Vietnam experience actually was. The long uncut scenes impart an immersive feel. It is one of the most compelling extended war sequence.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The greatest war film but maybe incomplete yet,"Full Metal Jacket is definitely a film that is very far from Kubrick's filmmaking method. And definitely, if it was a successful movie, it would be the best war movie in the history of cinema. But the film does not match the logic of Kubrick's filmmaking and the director's subconscious. The logic of Kubrick's filmmaking is not that, for example, The camera is in favor of the soldier at the beginning of the film, or that it condemns such militarism. This type of narration is definitely simplistic. Maybe my idea also agrees with the director's point of view, but because it is not completely realistic in the movie , The movie is unsuccessful. However, it is a great movie, but it is not the greatest war movie in the history of cinema like ""paths of Glory"".",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The making of marines,"Thirty years after Stanley Kubrick did Paths Of Glory about the futility of World War I Kubrick did Full Metal Jacket about the American experience in Vietnam. The wars were incredibly different and the French were fighting on their own soil, still the frustration of war and the stupidity of the high command make these films markedly similar.Another Vietnam classic came out around the same time Casualties Of War and that dealt with the army. A very different experience to be sure because the army contained draftees and folks in the National Guard and Army Reserve who LBJ did not call up for Vietnam. Hence it was a haven for those of us not quite ready to give up our young lives. It was sure different from the training these guys were getting on Parris Island. In fact many was a night I comforted myself with the thought about what the marines were like.Matthew Modine plays the lead here, a fellow who goes through the training and then is assigned as a journalist to Stars And Stripes. He is the voice of screenwriter and novelist Guy Hasford whose book Full Metal Jacket is based.Today we are in open ended war in the Middle East started to be sure by an attack on our native soil. But we got sidetracked by some old fashioned imperialist objectives in Iraq and now we've got ISIS to contend with. What should our response be? Certainly it has to be a multi-faceted one, it can't all be about dropping bombs on people different from us. It's like we learned nothing from Casualties Of War or Full Metal Jacket.I think if the film has a weakness it's that the training portion of Full Metal Jacket is better than the combat one. That is because of the performances of R. Lee Ermey as the redneck gunnery sergeant and Vincent D'Onofrio as the poor fat slob of a recruit.I cannot emphasize too much that D'Onofrio, Modine, and the rest are all volunteers. That being said I'm at a loss to explain why wasn't D'Onofrio just not washed out. Ermey if he was doing his job properly would have. But he was having too much sadistic fun.That being said when D'Onofrio prepared for the part no doubt he created a back story as to how his character came to Parris Island. I would love to ask D'Onofrio how that came to be.Full Metal Jacket is an enduring war classic and will be shown right along with Paths Of Glory as long as we have means to entertain and educate ourselves.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
7.62 Millimeter. Full Metal Jacket !!!,"This film is really scary and easily one of the best films ever made. There are many reasons to say that. Private Pyle is definitely one of the most disturbing character ever written in the history of cinema. Other characters as disturbing as him are Antonio Ricci of 'Bicycle thief', Devdas Mukerjee etc. Beginning is mindblowing. All the characters are defined in the first scene itself. Joker and Pyle stand out as wrong people in the wrong place. Later Joker gets a promotion for his straightforwardness in the first scene. Its interesting because may be thats how officers are identified amongst 'pukes'. Pyle comes across as regular jovial 'fatbody'. What marines make of him is I think the whole concept of the film. Very weird piece of writing.Most of the things have already been discussed so I'll be really short. I'm surprised no one has said anything about the background music. This movie has brilliant background music. All the Pyle's scene are brilliant. 'Last night on the island' will remain one of the best scenes ever shot in the history of cinema. I must admit that I got really scared when I watched it for the first time. Vincent D'Onofrio shocked me in every scene. Very gifted man. I watched the whole film and then I watched the first half twice and some scenes again and again. R. Lee Ermey and Matthew Modine are good too but this is definitely Vincent D'Onofrio's film. ""This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine"". Mind blowing. By the way the order of Joker, cowboy and Pyle keeps changing as Hartman walks in the first scene. Probably Kubrick didn't think that he would have someone watch this film that many times. Masterpiece!!! 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This film's divergent halves confuse too many people,"People just refuse to use their brains. They love the first half of Full Metal Jacket, and then basically give up on the second half. It is depressing. Don't you think you should at least try to understand why the film is split up like that? In fact, despite what so many people think, Full Metal Jacket is a perfectly structured opus - one of the most original pieces of art ever created.

Kubrick knows nothing about war.,"Speaking as an actual infantry veteran of Vietnam, I'd like to make two short comments about this film.The first half is excellent.  It is an authentic, though condensed, portrayal of basic training.  Obviously the presence of a real retired drill sergeant (Ermey) had a lot to do with that.But then Kubrick's faulty imagination takes over.  Starting with the climactic latrine scene and carrying throughout the rest of the movie, this film is total hogwash.  I was aghast at the skewed, completely erroneous, just plain wrong depiction of this platoon's actions in the war in Vietnam. Kubrick either had no advisors, or ignored them, when it came to the second half of this movie.  I have never seen such a load of tripe.See FMJ for the first half, and just rewind it and put it back in the box when you get to Vietnam.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
22 years on!,"Saw this film at the age at 22, and just re watched it 22 years later. The brutality of war shocked me at 22 and shocked me again at 44. One of the best war/drama's ever to be put on film, but it got me thinking! When will humanity ever learn? world war 1 and 2, Korea, Vietnam, then the gulf wars, Iraq, Afghanistan, and all the same mistakes made again and again, and all for what? To feed the politicians needs to flex their urge to send young people to the other side of the planet to get wasted? And then when we make so called peace then to invite the enemy to come and live in our countries? Ask your self who is the real winner and loser of all these wars? Great film but think about the reality of it all, voice your views to your local politicians and get our young people to come back home in 1 piece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best vietnam war movie alongside Apocalypse now,"Full metal jacket is almost like two completely different movies in one. The first is at the boot camp where we see people being trained to join the soldiery, and the second one takes place during the actual war. Through a series of disturbing and bloody scenes, Stanley Kubrick shows a brutal world of the late 60s, and how military dehumanizes soldiers and turns them into mindless killing machines. The characters are having fun, cracking jokes, showing that even in a place as dangerous as Vietnam, they are still having fun, brutally murdering enemy soldiers. At the end, it's almost as if they realised.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Plus ca change...........(The More Things Change),"A gentleman (from France, I won't hold this against him), wrote a comment about the ironies and callousness of the characters of FMJ. I would like to politely disagree with him on several points. As a former marine myself, I went through boot camp at Parris Island, SC, where we were taught to be killers. I was fortunate to never have to do so. In 1998, I was deployed to Japan as an electronics technician with an aviation unit, and prior to deployment, my squadron received several hundred hours on Japanese history, culture and tradition, in addition to the requisite safety, security and terrorism briefs that occur when deploying to a foreign nation. The process was the same when I deployed to Saudi Arabia in 2000. As for the Mickey Mouse at the end, they were not being callous (as a group, individuals are another story), but the battle depicted in the movie was Hue (pronounced WHEY) City, and one of the bloodiest of the war, and were all trying to remember a happier, simpler time in their lives. I have been through the training that Joker, Cowboy, Sno-Ball and Gomer Pyle went through, and I would like to think that I became a better man because of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is two films...,"The consensus seems to be that this film is two separate dramas, and that is an accurate assessment.  Kubrick, as always, shows the audience events and then allows them their own conclusions (sort of like real life, huh?)I served in the Army and like most veterans, the boot camp sequence (the first film) is funny, scary, informative and exhausting, just like basic training.  When the story shifts to Vietnam, it loses a little of its appeal and originality, but it is effective in showing the utter uselessness of war, especially the disjointed, aimless jaunt that existed in Southeast Asia.I'm not so sure this is the best war film ever made, or even the best film about Vietnam.  The film is thought provoking, though, and very well acted. Why isn't Matthew Modine more highly regarded?  His performance here is very good, and with his roles in Birdy and And The Band Played On, he seems to be one of the best actors in the 25 to 40 range.I do like this film, and I think it is another example of Stanley Kubrick's brilliance, but I can't say that it's great.But, to his credit, a Kubrick film is just like a military experience. You've never seen anything quite like it before, and you'll never come across anything like it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Story That Shows The Pain Of The Army,"Full Metal Jacket is a good war tale showing the psychological side of the marines and how it breaks men down into cold, numb killing machines or tearing them into insanity.

It's not all about the battlefield, it's about the people under the helmets.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Been There, Done That, Seen Better","Full Metal Jacket is considered by many to be a great movie. I am not one of those many. In fact I believe quite the opposite. I think this film is not only terrible but repulsive in countless ways. It attempts to show the horrors of war but does nothing but trivialize them. Also what exactly is the message of this movie? That war is bad? Well if thats what the message it certainly isn't something new. Of course then this movie has to make up in what lacks in an original message with some sort of creativity and stylistic features. In this way the film fails horribly.The acting of many of the relatively unknown actors is at best average. No actor stands out except for that of Vincent D'Onorfio who makes his exit less than half way through the film. The directing and writing of the film is absolutely horrible with the first half of the film used as a build up to a flat second half. Its almost as if the film is actually two separate ones: an average one and a disgraceful one. In the basic training sequences which takes up most of the first half of the film comes off as more hilarious then a brutal depiction of man being forcibly turned into machine. In the 2nd half of the film many of the sets made it too obvious that it was exactly that; a set. They were unconvincing with a lack of a realistic touch and screen shots out of a TV movie.As the movie wore on the lack of attention to detail became quite apparent leaving much to be desired. The ""tough"" characters came off as cheesy as everything seemed to just collapse within itself. The dialog in the movie felt useless and inconsistent with what was happening with in the film. By the end I didn't even care what was taking place. There were no character motivations and scenes became very predictable. Compared to the many classics made about Vietnam this one doesn't even come close.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
A good (but heavy handed) anti-war movie that has an enjoyable vein of black humour,A bunch of young men join a marine training camp to prepare for war in Vietnam.  However before they can face the enemy they must make it past the rigours of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  Once past the training they face a war where many may not return alive.  They learn that the dehumanising effects of war run through every stage and are complete.This is Kubrick's most accessible film and I suspect that contributes to it's high rating on the imdb.  There can be no other reason why it would rank so high on it's own merits.  This is not to say it's a bad film but it is certainly not one of the best anti-war films ever made.  The plot is a game of two halves ¬ñ first the training camp and second the actual conflict. The point that both halves hammer home relentlessly is that war dehumanises those involved.The first half is enjoyable pure and simply because of Emery's Gunnery Sergeant.  His is a witty character despite the inherent cruelty in his actions.  However eventually his screen time is ended and the film continues to make the same point over again but in a different setting.  The problem is that it hammers it's point home so heavily that it doesn't allow us to work things out for ourselves.  Even things like Platoon and the like allow us to work it out ourselves!  The film's strength is it's wonderful streak of black comedy that runs right the way through ¬ñ it is the reason for watching and makes it feel a little different from other hardcore war movies of this ilk.Kubrick is always going to be watchable but this is not one of his best. His cold direction is usually excellent but here it is alienating and clinical when we should really be getting to like the soldiers involved. The film is still good but I felt that the flaws are too much here.  Emery is undoubtedly the main reason for watching this film.  He gives a great performance that is a mix of improvisation and script that works well and guaranteed him work in the same role for many years.  Modine is suitably wide eyed as our guide through his experiences but he is like most of the other marines ¬ñ just blank characters for Kubrick to work around.  Only D'Onofrio (Pyle) came out of this as a real person.Overall this is a good anti-war film but not a great one.  There is no doubting the power of the message and Emery easily carries the film till the war itself.  It is still a very good film but I suspect that the fact that this is Kubrick's easiest film to get into explains why it is rated so highly.,,Anonymous,Drama
The madness of man.,"Unlike many other (Vietnam)war movies, the movie focuses in my opinion on the madness of man instead of the madness of war.The first half shows how the soldiers are being dehumanized during their military training by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a legendary and already classic role by R. Lee Ermey. The second half shows the madness of man in a war situation. Both of the halves are good and in a way can be seen as a movie alone but for some reason the two halves don't really flow into each other, which is my only real complaint I have about this fantastic and most certainly unique movie. Then the eternal question of which half is the better one? I'm one of the few who actually like the second half more as the first but that is just only personal and different for everyone.It's strange that the Vietnam battlefield looks more like a WWII European battlefield but I'm sure Kubrick had his reasons for it. Kubrick also manages to put many other weird and unique situations in the movie, which makes this movie truly an unusual viewing experience that shall leave quite an impression on you. Only a brilliant man such as Stanley Kubrick can come up with these kind of scene's.Despite the oddness level of the movie, the movie still manages to also impress the more casual viewer. The battle sequences are made with lot's of profession and with some beautiful cinematography and great use of music.The characters are good and typical Kubrick like. Many of the actors give the performance of their lives. Especially Vincent D'Onofrio who gained a record breaking 70 pounds for his role.Not the best Vietnam movie but certainly the most unique one. You'll love it long time.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Be prepared.,"After a several year absence, Stanley Kubrick returned to the screen with the hard-hitting ""Full Metal Jacket"", about an American platoon going to Vietnam. The movie wastes no time in getting down and dirty. Sgt. Hartman's (R. Lee Ermey) monologues haranguing the cadets are likely to knock the breath out of anyone. But that's only a preparation for what they experience once they reach Vietnam.If you've seen Kubrick's other movies, then you probably know that he pulls no punches. And believe you me, he doesn't here. We usually talk about the first and second parts of the movie, but one might say that even the second half has two halves: when they first arrive in Saigon (a safe, Americanized place), and when they actually go into battle (get ready for things to get ugly).All in all, maybe this isn't Kubrick's best movie, but definitely worth seeing. Matthew Modine is the nominal star, but there's also Adam Baldwin, Vincent D'Onofrio, Dorian Harewood, Arliss Howard, and some others. Just get ready to be blown away.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

8.3 Is Simply Nuts,"Kubrik has assembled the worst cast and put to film the most laughable/unrealistic movie about any was in the history of war movies. The boot camp scenes at the beginning, while overdone to the extreme, were riveting and worthwhile watching. Especially for Vincent D.'s performance. He seems to be the only character given any consideration about character development. He was superb, and should have been around for the duration of the movie. At least he finally got that sergeant to stop yelling. But in retrospect I'm sure he's glad he wasn't associated with the ""in country"" part of this disasterpiece. The negative reviews are right on the money, but there's really no way to prepare the viewer for just how simple minded it really is. The sets were quite ridiculous and unconvincing, and the acting is some of the worst you will ever see bar none. I don't like movies where the director is so obviously manipulating the viewer into how to feel, and that's all this was. War bad. Well everyone can agree on that so why not just make a realistic movie? The soldiers were given the most idiotic, cliched heroic lines that fell flat repeatedly. I laughed at the big final battle scene it was so awful. It must be nice to blatantly and repeatedly defy direct orders from a superior officer. Apparently nobody got the memo that Cease Fire means Stop Shooting. I know it's confusing. Scenes were long and drawn out for no purpose excetp to maybe give you time to get to the fridge for a beer or better yet something to perk you up. There's nobody to like, nobody to cheer for, and ultimately no point to this film whatsoever. Terrible portrayal of a horrendous time and it deserved a more dignified treatment than this travesty. No deep underlying message, no morality lesson to speak of. Just a film showcasing the worst Hollywood could offer.

A Film Of Two Halves,"FULL METAL JACKET has one of the most bizarre structures in film history. The first half of FMJ is rightly regarded as being one of the great segments of cinema . Kubrick/Herr/Hasford`s razor sharp script takes us on a blackly comical tour of the horrors of basic training with Sergeant Hartman , private Joker and Leonard Lawrence being the central characters , but then the film cuts to the battlefields of `Nam with only a couple of characters like Joker and Cowboy linking the two segments . Also disappearing is much of the first half`s wit with only the irony of American firepower bringing down tower blocks in retaliation to a sniper being the only real clever and knowing aspect to the script . It`s confusing too because with the exception of Joker and co. the rest of the film doesn`t really tie in with the basic training segment , perhaps the film would have worked a lot better if the entire film was taken up with the basic training ? And I can`t help noticing that much of the terrain doesn`t really resemble the jungles of South East Asia , as everyone knows FMJ was filmed in and around London and it often shows. Still it`s a film worth watching if only for the basic training scenes which are certainly more convincing than those seen in HEARTBREAK RIDGE . A couple of questions though ...If there`s any former USMC men out there could you write in and tell us how realistic the training scenes are ?I used to be in the army myself ( Royal Engineers ) but we never EVER called instructors "" Sir "" . In fact if someone in the British army made that mistake they`d receive the reply "" Don`t f****** call me sir . I work for a living "" along with a few other choice insults .

I'm not saying it's perfect or fantastic by any means, but it's very memorable and engaging; cursed vibes all around. The rest of the movie doesn't need to exist, it feels like filler and really not much else. It is absurdly boring as well as forgettable. I think this movie would've been better off as a short film. Leave the boot camp parts and chop the rest off.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fantastic - ignore the criticisms,"This superb film was a big improvement on Kubrick's previous film, The Shining. It is a far more confronting spectacle than the poetic, stylised violence of A Clockwork Orange, despite the latter's notoriety. The brutality of FMJ is unceasing.While the war scenes may seem pointless and directionless, this film more than any other war film I have seen captures the small-scale and scrappy nature of urban warfare. There is no grand narrative from the point of view of the individual unit or the individual soldier - just lots of snipers and corpses and skirmishes over ruined buildings. These individual skirmishes have no obvious strategic value and no obvious relationship to one another or to the world war against communist imperialism. They may be fighting for freedom, but the soldiers are motivated by other things - camaraderie, macho posturing and the urge to kill instilled in them at boot camp.I cannot understand those who criticise this Kubrick film above others for consisting of multiple episodes with very different feel and setting. It appears such people have never seen Kubrick's other films, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or A Clockwork Orange or Barry Lyndon or Paths of Glory or Lolita. Indeed, 2001: A Space Odyssey is even more disjointed than FMJ, not even having common characters between the segments. The films are no less brilliant for it. This is a consequence of the way that Kubrick worked, as revealed in ""Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures"" and Fred Raphael's admittedly unreliable ""Eyes Wide Open"". In Kubrick's view a movie was ready to be made when he had 7 or 8 episodes to string together. Often you can see the joins. Kubrick's legendary perfectionism arose from the fact that he didn't know what he wanted, only what he didn't want. Hence the voluminous research, the continuous script rewrites, the endless prop redesigns, the dozens of takes (all for petty and arbitrary reasons if he gave reasons at all) until by chance someone came up with a great idea. Only then would he move on. All this is why the greatness of Kubrick's films lies in the sum of the brilliant parts rather than the whole.FMJ fits right in to Kubrick's oeuvre. There is the ongoing theme of dehumanisation, the cynical world view, the hilarious black humour, the cold, distant and unsympathetic characters, the key use of pre-existing music, and the central role of war and conflict. Yet again, and very much like Werner Herzog he makes the surreal seem utterly believable, and reality seem surreal.For those who say there are better anti-war films, Kubrick said himself he was making a war film, not an anti-war film. He was trying to show the full picture, and leaving it to the audience to judge. The dehumanisation and brutality of boot camp, the moral ambiguity of the war and the vanity, crassness & questionable mental stability of some of the American soldiers is shown unsparingly, but so is the uncompromising barbarity of the communist enemy. You understand why the soldiers need the dehumanising training they are given. Animal Mother may indeed be an Animal Mother, but when it comes to the crunch he is clear-headed, effective and fiercely loyal to his comrades, and even musters a grudging sympathy for the dying sniper in acceding to Joker's humane despatching of her.All in all, an unforgettable film, totally different in feel to any other war movie I have seen. There is no glorification, no demonisation, and no redemption, but also no simplistic pacifist platitudes and despite everything, great beauty in the hellish ruins.",,Anonymous,Drama
A Critical Piece of Political Art,"As someone who was born in the late 90s, I wasn't privy to what life was like during the vietnam war but just hear brief anecdotes it's seems like while most average individuals were openly against the war, big corp., industry and government kept silent. So being able to look back and place a film that openly went against the big gov. Agenda is awesome! I hope more writers, directors, producers and creators alike take notes and remember that values DO have a place in art and media.

The perfect blend of Tragedy and Energy. the perfection of Stanley Kubrick.,"A very disturbing film about the Vietnam War, much darker than any of Kubrick's other films. The Music stands out as a major contributer to the film's mentality. Kubrick likes to use music of the time his films takes place, and it made perfect sense for Full Metal. The film really gets into the minds of the soldiers. What Apocalypse Now was for the Air Cav, this movie is for the Marines in Vietnam. The film's major point is the Duality of Men, and the beauty of Kubrick's shots helps instill a feeling of Victory even though all you see in the film is defeat. This is the most beautifully shot war film I've ever seen, even better than Terry Malick's Thin Red Line. Shots are crisp, perfect, colorful and each scene has its own embrace and feeling, paired wonderfully with the music. All in all, a beautiful war film that delves deep into the psyche of a solider in the Vietnam era. The perfect blend of Tragedy and Energy. the perfection of Stanley Kubrick.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Wonderfully thought provoking,"Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is celebrated as one of the best depictions of the Vietnam War and perfectly captures the dehumanizing process of war. The movie is essentially split up into two halves, the first half set in a bootcamp and depicting the main characters being humiliated and hardened into killing machines for the US marines. While the second half focuses on the soldiers after they have been deployed in VIetnam and now the war has a dehumanizing effect on the soldiers.The performances are great, from Vincent D'Onofrio's pvt. Pyle to R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman to Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker, all of whom delivered stellar performances that indicate the great machine that is the military boot camp system and war as a whole, its effects on the human psyche.Over the years there has been countless analysis and breakdowns of Full Metal Jacket, its themes and what it all means. I think that just goes to show the brilliance of Kubrick, to him it isn't about giving audiences a question and an answer but to present us with a rhetorical question that we can sit with and discuss amongst each other. I really enjoy the ambiguity of each key scene yet it is presented in such a way that as an audience you wouldn't just take for what it is, there is a sense that everything means more than face value and thus, is the beauty of Full Metal Jacket.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A tale of two movies,"I absolutely love the first half of FMJ. R Lee Ermey knocks it out of the park. His performance is both hilarious and terrifying. At first you wonder how he could be so cruel, yet slowly understand why he is doing what he's doing. He goes from calling the recruits ""worthless"" to ""maggots"" to finally ""Marines"". He sees their growth and that's why he was so strict. I've heard that many DI's during Vietnam would check the daily death notices to see if anyone they trained was killed. I can only imagine that Hartman would do this as well and his heart would sink had he recognized any of the names.As for the second half of the movie...meh, it's OK. It is no where near as memorable as the beginning. Everyone I know who has seen it can quote the basic training scenes almost word for word. The Vietnam scenes kinda go by the wayside.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The man outshines the rest of the movie so much that if you try to explain to people that this is the one where ""that sergeant is always screaming during bootcamp"" they will immediately understand what you're talking about if they have seen it in the past.

"Hardcore Marine Action, OORAH!","Stanley Kubrick has put up another fine masterpiece about the USMC getting reading for the Vietnam War. ""Full Metal Jacket"" shows how Marine life is not child's play, and the Drill Seargant from Hell(R. Lee Ermey, aka ""The Gunny"") really performed well in this movie. It is set in Parris Island, S.C., were the main Corp was locate to whip these civilians into shape. Gunnery Sgt. Hartman(Ermey) is one heck of a bad-a$$ Drill Sgt. who takes no crap from anyone. He didn't discriminate anyone, he treated everyone like an equal. However, he tortured Pvt. Pyle(Vincent D'Onofrio) so bad, he went over the edge after the training. He marched with his pants down, sucked on his thumb like a little boy, and had to endure a very brutal beating from the other Privates. Socking a drill Sergeant will call for a discharge or time in confinement, shooting him will result in court martial, and a dishonorable discharge. Of course, Pyle discharged himself with the same gun. The other went on and the brutal battle is ensured. The Marines don't play around, and they really show the sign of brotherhood of the Corp. The chants the Gunny made was a classic. ""This is my rifle, this is my gun..."" is the one song I think should be shared to only the military. It's always lock and load. This movie is a must for all members of the USMC. Whether they are recruits or vets, I this this movie a major SEMPER FI! CARRY ON! 5 STARS, OORAH!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Let the Debate Begin,"Full Metal Jacket (1987)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Stanley Kubrick's film follows a Marine (Matthew Modine) from his basic training with a brutal Sny. Sgt. (R. Lee Ermey) to a final showdown in Vietnam where a group of soldiers are being picked off by a sniper.Kubrick's return to the cinema after a seven year break came with a film genre that has pretty much played itself out in the past eight or nine years considering we got films like THE DEER HUNTER, COMING HOME, APOCALYPSE NOW as well as PLATOON. Many critics panned the film for being too familiar while others called it a masterpiece that showed the war unlike any movie before. I've always had a love-hate relationship with FULL METAL JACKET and it's probably a film I've seen more than any other Kubrick even though I think it's one of the director's lesser films. There's no question that the first hour is a masterpiece but I've never warmed up to the second half for several reasons but as any Kubrick fan knows, the more you watch his films the more you notice different things.This latest viewing of the film had me enjoying the second half of the picture a lot more than any previous time. I think one reason was that I got to see it theatrically on a very large screen and it brought out certain elements that I had never really picked up on before including the incredible cinematography. The camera-work has always been a strong point to every Kubrick film and I really loved the way that the camera pretty much just floats around during the second half picking up the action as it moves along. This really gives the viewer a first-hand look at everything that's going on and it really does put you in the middle of the action and this is especially true during the final portion where the marines are going up against a sniper.I still have some problems with this sequence including the interviews that are done by the film crew. I can understand why Kubrick would include these scenes but to me they really don't add enough to warrant their inclusion in the film but who knows... Perhaps my next viewing I'll see them in a different manor.The first half of the film is probably the most unoriginal as the training camp sequence has been seen in dozens of films going all the way back to the silent era yet Kubrick shows it in a way that makes it an unnerving thrill that will wreck each of your emotions. Kubrick paints some very dark humor in the film and most of it at the expense of Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), an overweight idiot who gets tortured not only by the drill Sergent but also the men in his group. I've always seen the first half of the film as a portrait of how much a man can take before finally cracking up. The picture shown here certainly needs to give credit to D'Onofrio but the main credit goes to Kubrick and that amazing vision.The way the camera glides around much like it did in THE SHINING brings the same claustrophobic sense of dread and one can't help but get caught up in the story. This portion of the film has some very funny moments but it's also incredibly disturbing simply because of the abuse Pyle takes and you can't help but feel sorry for him but at the same time you too want to hate him because of how stupid he is. The scenes are quite shocking in a way because of how raw Kubrick makes them and its this rawness that really makes this stuff seem fresh even though we've seen it before. Kubrick was a master with the camera and it's just amazing to see how quickly our emotions can change as one second we'll be laughing only to have that quickly go away as something darker happens.This first hour can easily be called a masterpiece because of how raw and powerful it is and in the end there's really not another basic training sequence that can compare. The second half has certainly grown on me with this latest viewing but I still think there are just a few too many flaws here for me to call the film a masterpiece or even a great movie. With that said, for countless viewings I said the same thing about THE SHINING but now that's on my list as one of the greatest movies ever made.",,Anonymous,Drama

Vietnam does not look like the UK,"It should be widely known that Kubrick movies are not to be enjoyed, but endured. As a ""cinephile"" my choice was to endure them only once, just to know what one of the most overrated directors in the history of cinema was up to. I duly watched FMJ at the time of its original release and did not enjoy it. Back then it felt like a late arrival, saying nothing new after Apocalypse Now and Platoon. Devoid of the emotional impact of those two other movies, dry, slow-paced and boring.Last night, I stumbled upon it on TV and out of curiosity I decided to give it another try, should my previous impression been marred by youthful ignorance. Alas not... In fact, years of movie-watching just enhanced my dislike for what looks more than ever like an half-baked, over simplistic war movie.As everybody knows, FMJ is basically two movies stuck together, with little relation to each other. The first half takes place during a brutal boot camp, with lots of shouting and humiliation from a sadist drill sergeant, leading to ""tragic events"" of some sort. The second half takes place in Great Britain, standing for Vietnam and failing miserably at the task.In no way the cold, gray UK could be mistaken for a sub-tropical country. In FMJ the actors keep their long sleeves down, no sticky heat, profuse sweating or ventilators flapping.Besides being infamous for its fake, chilling location, the second part is almost ludicrous in every other aspect. From the dialogs, which sound like a parody of macho war movies, but are in no way funny, to character non-development, to sexist use of local prostitutes - not once, but twice.We are shown twice what is basically the same scene (and the only female presence in the movie): a young Viet prostitute soliciting Joker and friends. Same scene some 15 minutes later, only this time the prostitute is pimped out by a local guy.I could ask many questions about this movie¬Ö For instance if Kubrick was supposed to be over-meticulous and detail crazy how did he missed the fact that the UK does not look like Vietnam? How did he missed the fact that he had the same scene twice? etc...In the poster's photo we have a helmet with ""Born to kill"" scribbled next to a peace sign, signifying the duplicity of human nature. This convey the full message you should get at the end of the movie, so you can spare yourself some time just taking a good look at the poster. If you want to add an additional layer of ""meaning"", perhaps you can infer that mankind (in the shape of main character Joker) is ""naturally"" good but can be trained to become ""bad"". Hardly a brand-new, mind-blowing concept.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Military as a sham.,"This is an excellent movie, for a while. R. Lee Ermey gives a riveting performance as the arch typical drill instructor, Sgt. Hartman. Ermey's performance should have earned him an Academy Award. In fact, it can be argued that Ermey's presence makes this movie special. Out side of that, the movie falters. Sgt. Hartman states clearly at the start that his order is weed out those who cannot hack his beloved Marine Corps. That means finding the bad apples. Yet, despite all his threats and abuse and blustering, nobody gets weeded out. The story line contains huge holes. First, regarding Gomer Pyle. Pyle fails at everything, yet Hartman does not flunk him out. Instead, he employs terror to try to get Pyle, a hapless screw up, to comply. Nothing helps, yet Pyle makes it. Boot camp has taught him only one thing: how to kill Hartman. Second, the story abruptly switches to Vietnam. The troops are cynical, demoralized and dysfunctional. They lack unit cohesion and esprit de corps. However, the story fails to explain the cause of their malaise. Joker, another bad apple from boot camp, is still in the Marines. Third, the character Animal Mother. His presence in the story is seems to make no sense, except that he is yet another bad apple that the Marines never weeded out. He's just more overtly anti-social. This entire movie depicts the military as a sham. Tell that to those who actually serve.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
An epic and impressive story of the Vietnam War divided in two halves competently directed by Stanley Kubrick,"A very strong and tough Vietnam war film made by the great Stanley Kubrick who has directed his film in the form of military drama , a formula much beloved by filmmakers of Hollywood , War and western movies , and revived successfully by this great director who at the same time keeps his recurring theme of dehumanization. The story opens in the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U. S. Marine Corps Training Camp, providing a brooding , sad look at Marine basic training . There a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the two-fisted Drill Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to ""weed out all non-hackers"". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes ""Gomer Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio) . One rifle, one gun, one for killing, one for fun !. In Vietnam The Wind Doesn't Blow It Sucks ! Vietnam can kill me, but it can't make me care ! Acclaimed by critics as the best war movie ever made ! .Born to Kill !.One of the best Vietnam war movies that took Stanley Kubrick more than a year to make . A sour and intelligent view of the Vietnam war is provided in all terrible , bloody and violent detail . This is a stunning adaptation of Gustav Hasford's ""The short time"" , being divided in two sections . Blundering , thorny and interesting Vietnam war film pre-dating the flood of the eighties and early nineties . It describes a pretty crude portrayal of America's thunderous days in Vietnam . Including a realist and thought-provoking dialogue with plenty of profanities , bad taste , swearings and sexual remarks. The story falls into two harrowing halves , both familiar staples of military movies . The particularly hard training of a group of Marine recruits and the combat action , in a slightly stylised and sanitised Vietnam which , as benefits the English locations , seemed devoid of jungle , but full od shattered villages , ruined towns and glowing skies .The feeling of these scenes is faintly unreal. More realistic , indeed the best thing about the movie , results to be the drill instructor , brutal Gunnery Sergeant : R. Lee Ermey , a real ex-drill himself , he's terrific , his dialogue is presumably ripped from his own experience in all its crudeness but often amusing colour . The fist half is so strong that the second half suffers in comparison , as it covers more familiar ground while keeping tension , thrills and emotions in check. Interpretations are uniformly good , with a lot of newcomers actors to be followed notorious careers , such as : Matthew Modine , Vincent D'Onofrio, Adam Baldwin, Dorian Harewood , Arliss Howard , John Terry , among others .The picture was finely acted , compellingly made and supremely directed by Stanley Kubrick . His film debut was ¬®Fear and desire¬® 1953 , a not very successful Kubrick movie , belonging to his early period when he made black and white , low budgeted flicks as the Film Noir : ¬®Killer's Kiss¬® , ¬®The Killing¬® and continuing with one of the best wartime pictures : ¬®Paths of Glory¬® produced and played by Kirk Douglas .

"A Terrifying, Gripping Action Tale on the Duality and Evil of Mankind","Full Metal Jacket grabs you by the throat and drags you along all the different and equally vile muds of the Vietnam war. No, actually; it goes further than that - it drags you on the muds of war and vileness as a whole.Through grounded and subtle dialogue; believable and passionate acting; an intense and terrifying score; brilliantly detailed and realistic set and costume design; beautiful and jarring shot composition and cinematography; real and powerful themes brought about with character and motif; and a storytelling technique with total literary cohesion and keen detail; Kubrick and his cast and crew build a world within our own that is direct, poignant and honestly brutal.This film shows precisely why violence can only cause violence. It shows how the peaceful can become the terrible and how the beautiful can become the ugly. Full Metal Jacket explains that war is not hell - because hell is for sinners only.It is quite probably possible to explain for hours how each character and action in the movie portrays Joker's line on duality. Perhaps it is possible to take such time to explain the theme's (or should it be ""themes'""?) connection even to the set design, musical choices, and costumes. But this is a review, not a thesis. So we shall leave that for another time.Watch this movie, but be fully prepared for its intense and disturbing violence.tl;dr: it's a Stanley Kubrick movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Two different films united by Kubrick's genius cinematography.,"As a self-proclaimed film buff, I have to admit that it's almost criminal that I've gone this long without fully watching Full Metal Jacket (1987). After all, I have seen most of Stanley Kubrick's filmography and I understand the importance of his oeuvre. I think my hesitation is that I've already seen most of this film just through the memes that it eventually spawned. That, and doing more of a ""straight"" take on a war movie after the perfect satire that is Dr. Strangelove (1964) felt like a disservice.Even though this movie is almost three hours long, it really feels like two completely separate films smashed together. I don't believe any other film before or since has quite captured that ""boot camp"" feel that the first half of this movie does. It's spawned so many quotable lines that it stands on its own without a need to follow up. Then we jump into war and it feels a bit more generic-even if it still contains a few memorable lines as well. By 1987, it felt like we already had plenty of these kinds of war movies that show how all the training goes out the window once you get into the field.The one thing that definitely redeems the second half (and enforces the whole movie, to be honest) is the subtle way that Kubrick shows mastery of cinematography. It doesn't bring attention to itself, but the little things stand out as different. Like how everything at boot camp is in focus, highlighting how no soldier is special or deserving of specialized attention. Or how a long one-shot introduces so much exposition about fighting on the front lines of the Vietnam War without saying so explicitly. This is the brilliance of Kubrick, and Full Metal Jacket is not immune to it.Two different films united by Kubrick's genius cinematography, I give Full Metal Jacket 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

From Dr. Strangelove to Full Metal Jacket, his work has captured my eyes and made many of my days.Its amazing how well Kubrick forms his characters and gets you to almost be in their shoes. Especially in Full Metal Jacket, its fun to see how the characters in every scene act or turn out.One of my favorite aspects of Kubrick is making a man look insane or crazy such as in A Clockwork Orange (with his character Alexander), the Shining (Mr. Torrence) and in Full Metal Jacket (Private Pyle) which was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.R. Lee Ermey's character was played so well, I felt as if I was being lectured by him.

But when the movie shifts to Viet Nam, the whole movie falls flat--the whole audience is bored listless wondering what the point is. A few vague references to ""the duality of man"" are made but never explored, the characters are shallow and cardboard.

(As it seem to happen to a lot of Kubricks movies).First half with the boot camp, drill Sargent Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and arrival in Vietnam is still great, but as soon as they hit battle it all becomes just embarrassing and disappointing display of mediocre acting and strange directing. No realism at all from a military point of view, not even a little. And the soldiers behavior in battle are completely unreal, all the time.Poor acting or poor directing? Maybe a little bit of both. Kubrick was clearly looking for something else than realism when he made those city battle scenes, but whatever it was he though he caught (and brought) to the silver screen it's all gone now. Well, except for the score (not soundtrack) that is still top notch. Still, I'm lowering my grade to 7.There are a bunch of way better (even older) movies to watch that explores the Vietnam war tougher, rougher and definitely more realistic.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Promising at first, but sure to disappoint","This movie has always been a real disappointment for me.  While its portrayal of the Marine training sequence is powerful and memorable, Kubrick continues to do a less-than inspiring portrayal of combat in Vietnam. Approaching the diaspora from a different angle than Stone, Kubrick hits upon some of the classic themes left (appropriately) untouched by Platoon. Yet, in some cases the ubiquitous slow-motion violence is needlessly gratuitous and the round-the-body one liner reflections and face-the-camera montage interviews are cheesy, if not reminiscent of other great 'camera-focused' escapades like Kevin Pollak's ""Opposite Sex"" and the recent ""that 70s show"".Pop music is played too often as if FMJ begins to lean towards a self-indulgent glorification of the 60s, even in inappropriate and distracting places.  Who can forget Joker and his colleagues (the few bright spots of the film: character development), but the movie fails to depict the subject matter in a realistic or subdued matter when needed.It seems as if to Kubrick, Vietnam is not a war where Americans were forever traumatized, but rather just another stage for pop culture to spotlight the trite 'duality of man' in an 'animal setting'.  I hated the movie.  This movie does little justice to the memory of those who were in Vietnam.  The movie immediately strays and wavers, becoming an uncomfortable hybrid between 'popular nostalgic war formula' and 'psychological thriller' and proceeds to do both very poorly.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perfect? No. But almost.,"No real point in singing this movie's praises, or saying Stanley Kubrick was a genius and a master of his craft.

Had it been this movie would be a 10/10 for me. The second half is still dark, vicious, and funny, just not as much as the first half is.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent and confronting,"This was the second film in a Kubrick double feature I saw at my local cinema tonight. Unlike with the first film, A Clockwork Orange, I feel like seeing Full Metal Jacket on the big screen (and a few years older than last time I watched it) made me like it a lot more.Long story short, I used to love the first half of this film and like the second half, but felt confused about how they connected. It seems obvious now, but this time around, it felt like one coherent movie. Key parts of the first half echoed in the second, and it overall shows how soldiers are dehumanised and traumatised before they even reach the frontlines of a war. It's a big, ugly machine, and Full Metal Jacket shows it's just as ugly whether you're being trained to kill or being made to kill.It gets into the heads of its fairly straightforward characters, and it's as much a psychological drama as it is a war film. Part of me wishes Joker had a little more to do as a main character, but he still works well to anchor the whole thing, and is ultimately a changed person by the end.The actual transition between the first and second halves still feels a little jarring to me, but other than the specific point where they join, Full Metal Jacket now feels like a complete film, rather than a scrambled collection of great scenes. Maybe that's me getting older, or maybe seeing it in a cinema helped. Maybe it's both, and I'm just trying to make a comment on the duality of man or something...",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perfect war movie,"He could be cold, harsh and mechanical with his style, precise as a surgeon's knife, and some didn't like that, but who better to make a film, not about war, but about the dehumanisation of the process, but Stanley Kubrick? The fact his vision of the story was so clinical really helped make this, quietly, the best war film ever made; Stanely never did things by halves.Every frame is weighted with oppression, each moment is saying something; every line, every gesture, delivered to fit Kubrick's vision. It made a star of Lee Ermey, whose Drill Sergeant was terrifyingly real, primarily because that is what he was in reality.Like all of Kubrick's work, this film contains iconic imagery that sears into your mind's eye and becomes very hard to erase; the final scenes, and the film's closing, with its perfect marriage of image, sound, and music, haunt you and leave you reflecting on the last 2 two hours.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A true anti-war film,"I have heard of the idea that every war movie is in fact an anti-war movie, because they all show the horror and brutality of the situation.I do not agree.Some war films, while showing violence and blood, have stories describing how war gives people the potential to be heroes; movies like 'Saving Private Ryan', 'A Bridge Too Far' and even 'The Great Escape' fall into this trap; they seem to say that, even though war is terrible, some good can come from it.A true anti-war film has no heroes. The statement is very clear: war turns men into vicious animals, with no drives except to eat, copulate, and kill. Films in this category include 'King Rat', 'The Dirty Dozen', 'Platoon', and of course Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'.With 'Jacket', Kubrick provides what is perhaps the most comprehensive and complete overview of how human beings are de-evolved through the military process. He begins in boot camp, where they are treated as scum, beaten and abused, and (in some cases) driven completely mad. By the time they reach the field, they are ""killing machines...angels of death"", and the horror of battle only makes it worse.They suppress fear, pity, love...and and all emotions that distinguish humans from animals. Sex is purely physical gratification, and killing is a rush. There is no loyalty or patriotism; the desire to retrieve a wounded comrade is more akin to how a pack of wolves protects one of its own. They act on instinct rather than reason, and they do not hesitate to destroy everything they see.That is the plot of Full Metal Jacket. The movie itself is a scathing example of how horrible war truly is. Perhaps there is the potential for heroism...but few, if any, rise to it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A fine war film, although not without considerable flaws. An assortment of various ideas that never really form together in perfect harmony.","Often referred to as one of his lesser great works, Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" is an assortment of various ideas that never really come together in perfect harmony. It's an anti-war film, a war film, a film about Military training, a film about Military combat, and a film about soldiers all packed into one little bundle. It's overstuffed, too full to carry all of its own weight, and it's got nowhere to dump the excess cargo but on its viewers.One of the film's characters, ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine), wears a peace necklace around his throat and a helmet with the words ""Born To Kill"" scribbled in the center throughout the film. ""Whose side are you on?"" someone asks him. He's not sure, and either is the film--which is one of its considerable flaws.The biggest flaw is its cold manner. This isn't a bad film, and far from it, but when compared to a Vietnam film such as ""Platoon,"" it seems rather weak in many comparable ways. But, as I noted in a paragraph above, the worst thing about ""Full Metal Jacket"" is the humanity of the story. It has virtually none whatsoever.This isn't particularly surprising, since Kubrick has often been famous for his cold style of filmmaking (""2001,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut""). Don't misunderstand what I'm saying--Kubrick may very well by an amazing director. But a war film is different from one about art and deep meanings--you have to introduce characters, get the audience to like them, have them suffer personal trials and tribulations, and have some emotional moments in the film. Kubrick fails at this on the same level that Stone succeeded, even though they're both trying to get across the same messages. (It doesn't help that ""Full Metal Jacket"" was released a year after ""Platoon,"" which makes it look like a pale imitator in comparison.)All of the characters in ""Full Metal Jacket"" seem very written, which basically just means they're words and motions on paper, acted out by individuals in Army suits. Of course, from a literal viewpoint, this is correct--but it's hard to doubt the realistic nature of a film when we are fully convinced that what we are witnessing is true. These characters in ""Full Metal Jacket"" seem hardly likable, and they are very rarely put through any type of emotional anguish, which is the key to all great war films--even ""Forrest Gump"" had some.I enjoyed the first half of the movie, which is basically the training period. We see a group of soldiers being prepared for conflict outside their barracks by a nasty Drill Sergeant (R. Lee Ermy). One of the kids in the group, Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), is a bit of a dummy--and the drill sergeant takes out all his anger and fury upon the kid. After weeks of training, Lawrence finally snaps in half and shoots the drill sergeant, then himself, leaving Joker as the sole witness.This is where the first half of the film essentially ends and the second half begins, which is all boring combat. This is where I started to grow weary of the film's heavy-handed anti-war protest and ineffective characters. There was at least some type of subtle setup for the Lawrence character, but all the other characters are just wandering clich√©s.This may sound like an ignorant thing to say, but it's not. I enjoyed ""Full Metal Jacket"" to a certain extent. I just can't find it anywhere within me to call this a great film, nor a perfect one. It has many flaws, most of which result from poorly introduced characters and unattached emotions. There are also flaws from a technical viewpoint, such as the voice-over narrative by Modine. It's like screenwriting guru Brian McKee advises students--don't use voice-over unless it's essential to the story. Any idiot can express characters' emotions with their own words.Voice-over was essential in ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon,"" but not here. It only occurs three or four times throughout the film and only halts the progression of the story. It's sloppy, pointless, and Modine's voice provides almost nothing to the story. Some people may disagree with me, but why have a character (in this case Modine) tell us where he's heading to instead of just putting subtitles in grainy Courier font? By introducing the audience to this voice-over, Kubrick does nothing but take the easy route towards scene explanations. Especially considering this voice-over is only used a handful of times for a few seconds each time.Regardless of technical flaws or figurative flaws, ""Full Metal Jacket"" fails where most war films succeed. Whether you agree with the message or not, Stone knew how to deliver the anti-war message within ""Platoon"" with deadly accuracy and subtlety. There's no subtlety here--Kubrick makes his echoing statement clear from the beginning on. And whether you personally like him or not, Stone also convincingly portray Vietnam. Even DePalma did a fine job of this in ""Casualties of War."" ""Full Metal Jacket"" isn't quite as convincing. Everything's heavy-handed. Everything feels fake. Everything feels contrived. It gets boring very quickly, and feels like an imitator of all the other Vietnam films. And the fact that it was released a year after ""Platoon"" seems to suggest that Kubrick may have indeed been borrowing a few ideas from Stone.There's a reason the die-hard Kubrick fans consider this one of his lesser works, and there's a reason you don't hear it mentioned very much when war films are discussed. In conclusion, it's just a copycat of many various films, with a dozen or so different ideas that never mix together very successfully.This is a good war film, but I can't say it's anything more than that.4/5.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
1987: A Soldier's Oddysey,"This is an excellent film that shows that film maker Stanley Kubrick has lost none of his skill despite a 7 year break between projects.The film is plotted in two distinct parts, the first half, which is the stronger part is concerned with the impact of brutal training on the wannabe soldiers, with the second part focusing on the story told from the central character, Private Joker, played by an effective Matthew Modine in a deliberate low key and understated manner. In fact most of the performances are subdued, with the exception of Adam Baldwin as a cynical and brutal Animal Mother and particularly Lee Ermey, who steals the show as the ruthless drill sergeant. He is totally captivating in the role, even if his character spends most of his time by humiliating the recruits - though the film posits that there are potentially tragic consequences with this approach as well as the production of a group of lethal killers.The second part of the film is still effective though, even it isn't quite as captivating as the first half. Vietnam is very well realised, particularly since it was shot in London's Docklands, which was derelict at the time! This is a tribute to Kubrick's skill as a director, particularly with his use of steadicam to develop a cold, objective realism peppered with black humour. Huge credit must also go Anton Furst's outstanding work as production designer and Vivian Kubricks score, though minimalist, is interesting and gives a refreshing and different feel to this non-typical war film. Martin Hunter's editing is also first rate.In summary and efficient, and highly effective observation of the dehumanisation of warfare on the soldier made with trademark Kubrick precision",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
My favorite Kubrick film,"Full Metal Jacket is one of the best films , Stanley Kubrick ever made. The film has humor, gut wrenching war scenes and brilliant acting. Matthew Modine is great as Joker, but it's Vincet D'Onforio and R.Lee Emery as Pyle and the Drill Sgt. The chemistry between these two actors is of David and Goliath calbiar. The film makes you feel like you're in basic training with the troops and although the film is violent it's still an art form. **** out ****.",,Anonymous,Drama
Ermey's Outbursts Made This Film Famous,"Well, the drill sergeant in this film certainly was memorable. No one will argue that. How good this film is overall, however, is up to debate. My feeling is that it's overrated because Stanley Kubrick - a favorite of critics - directed the movie and helped write the screenplay.It's notable, mainly for the ultra-profane and ultra-color descriptions that Lee Ermey uses as ""Gny. Sgt. Hartman,"" the Parris Island Marine drill-gunnery sergeant. Hearing several of his tirades is something you won't forget!At times, the film is too hard-edged, too political, too preachy and just not a smooth enough story. You know it could be much better.Yes, if my ears can stand the assault, Ermey can be fun to hear, and young, fat Vincent D'Onofrio as ""Pvt. Pyle,"" the victim of the sergeant's rage, terminates his boss in a memorable scene, the main character of the film is ""Pvt. Joker,"" played by Matthew Modine, and I didn't like the guy. Maybe that's another reason I don't rate this film as highly as others. I couldn't root for the guy the scriptwriters made as the ""good guy.""The clincher came when Pvt. Joker told the sergeant he didn't believe in the Virgin Mary, which got him points with the sarge. Being a non-Believer meant the ""kid is all right."" That, of course, is ultra-secular Kubrick getting his atheist propaganda in, something he did in several of his films.After watching several years of the TV program, Law and Order: Criminal Intent, it would be interesting (and strange) go back now and see D'Onofrio again. I probably wouldn't recognize him. After watching him as the dignified Sherlock-Holmes type ""Detective Robert Goren,"" I don't know if I want to see him back in this role, however!",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Kubrick's odd way of storytelling bogs down the movie and ultimately hurts the film's pacing, character development, and much more.","Full Metal Jacket was one of Kubrick's better films, and to be honest I was pretty torn on what to give this film. Although many will go against my decision, I decided to give Full Metal Jacket an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. The film had outstanding visuals and audio design, but Kubrick's odd way of storytelling bogs down the movie and ultimately hurts the film's pacing, character development, and much more. The acting in the film was great, and the tone literally put you back into the Vietnam War in 1968 (when the second and third act take place). This was an extremely hard film to watch, but I felt it was an absolute great representation of what war really is.

The best Vietnam movie,"I know it is certainly a big call to call this the best Vietnam movie of all time, but this is probably the most realistic account of it. It is also a great example of Director Kubrick's ability to show humans objectively, not trying to make out whether one is evil or not.Essentially the movie is divided into two parts. The first revolves around the training of marines, and shows the brutality of becoming a soldier. The second part then focuses on the actual battlefield.What is interesting about this film is that it isn't particularly violent, but still extremely powerful. This is about the psychology of War, about how various soldiers deal with a mad mad situation, and it does a great job of depicting this.Everything about this film is great. The acting is top notch from a cast of mostly unknowns, and the score is used to haunting effect. Camera shots also brilliantly portray the scenes, often from the point of view of the person shooting, to great effect. And if anything can be said to recommend this film, it is that there many great scenes that you will definitely never forget. A masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Kubrick at war with how we see war usually,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Ohe could write about how startling a film this is even the 10th or 11th or 15th time you've seen it, like I have up to now (as with most of Kubrick's films I've lost count how many times I've seen on a television screen, in the theater is another matter); how chilling it is to see once again the same method previously experienced in Clockwork Orange of rip-roaring, abyss-black satire blending together with a sense of tragedy and horror that is ever so rare in cinema (i.e. going from a vicious combat scene to the song ""Bird is the Word"" played over more combat, or just the general serio-comic attitude between Hartman and Pyle); how the ending brings to a head a fresh concern in the war film that is still as depressing, if not as authentically tear-jerky, as Paths of Glory; how any image seen on a big screen from Kubrick is Solid Gold, or how, admittedly, one or two scenes don't quite work that great (i.e. the ""documentary"" interviews the soldiers give to the camera crew).But since that's been written, might as well just sign the Mickey Mouse Club scene and go on with your day.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"The ""Saving Private Ryan"" of Vietnam","Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" does for the Vietnam war what ""Saving Private Ryan"" did for WWII- create a strikingly (and sometimes disturbingly) realistic portrait of the horrors of war. However, FMJ's depiction of the de-humanizing affects of boot camp and later the psychological effects of war on soldiers (similar to Apocalypse Now) set it apart from many other war films, such as Private Ryan. Matthew Modine and Adam Baldwin give excellent performances of de-sensitized GIs, but the true standout of the cast is R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor at Paris Island boot camp. Despite the fact that the film was shot entirely in Britain, Kubrick does a very convincing job of recreating Vietnam there, and all aspects of the film are very realistic and authentic. Also unlike other war films, FMJ doesn't focus on the action and violence (which is still very realistic) and instead relies on complex characters to drive the story. Modine's Pvt. Joker is especially interesting, dying to get into action one minute, but once the bullets start whizzing, scared out of his wits.Bottom Line: an excellent war film, and should be considered one of the best of all time. ***1/2 out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A strong work that I just can't quite wrap my brain around,"I can imagine myself in a few years wondering, ""What did I think of that one movie?"" I would pull up the blog, do a quick search, find the review, and be refreshed with my attempts at insight. My opinion that day would be reinforced by the opinion I had years back. Full Metal Jacket, though, is a film that I am always certain will have changes of opinion over time. Out of all the films that I have reviewed so far, this is the one that I feel like I could review again in a year and come to very different conclusions.I've seen this film four times, and I'm still coming to terms with it. I've moved beyond the idea that the first forty-five minutes are a mini-movie and wholly superior to the final seventy minutes. I still think that the first section of the film on Parris Island is superior to the second long section that ends the film, but there's definitely a deeper relationship between the Private Joker character. There are themes and motifs at play in the first half that continue into the second. I just can't quite get past a few things that hamper the whole experience for me.The events on Parris Island are both hilarious and horrifying, often at the same time. A group of marine recruits goes through basic training, and we latch onto two of the largely interchangeable maggots as main character, Private Joker and Private Pyle. These are, of course, not their real names, but the nicknames stick. They are robbed of who they were before walking onto the island. There's that dehumanization idea that keeps popping up in Kubrick's filmography. The process of training strips even the interior individuality so that they all become alike in behavior, marching perfectly in time, performing the same actions, and reacting the same way to their drill instructor.Our two main characters have different paths to this sameness. Joker is smart and thoughtful which allows him to navigate the minefield of the instructor's verbal jabs in ways that do him credit, eventually getting him the position of squad leader. Pyle, on the other hand, is stupid (not pejoratively, mind you, Pyle is obviously supposed to have an IQ of less than 90) and has incredible difficulty adapting to life in the corps. He has trouble telling his left from his right. He can't master the obstacle course. He hides jelly donuts in his footlocker. It is only after Joker is forced to take Pyle under his wing that Pyle begins to shape up, turning the corner in his training, and eventually going way too far in the other direction. He becomes the ultimate psychotic killing machine, putting a round into the drill instructor's chest after graduation before shooting himself in the head.Just from a cinematic experience point of view, this first forty-five minutes is a tour de force. It's nearly impressionistic and heavily reliant on editing to create the general sense of unease that pulls us in as we watch the humanity stripped so completely from Pyle to the point that he does only kill.The second section ends up feeling both more straight forward cinematically and more confused narratively, which can create a certain letdown from a movie going point of view. However, as I wrote earlier, there are stronger connections between the two sections that my first viewings of the film originally revealed to me.Animal Mother, for instance, seems like another version of Pyle. He seems pretty dim the first time we meet him, but he's also obviously a great killing machine. Knowing that the movie ends with Joker leading the survivors of the film in a rendition of the theme song to ""The Mickey Mouse Club House"", I began considering what that could mean more than an hour before it came up, and the idea of infantilization creeped into my brain. I began to watch as a group of children lost every parental figure they had (starting with the drill instructor) until they were faced with a great life or death situation without any guidance from a higher authority. There are also signs of the breakdown of all civilization in the face of war, an idea so big I'm not sure it fits terribly well in only seventy-minutes of screentime.And that's where I end up. I feel like this second half is simply tackling too much. Breakdown, though, is a great lens to view it through. Joker starts this section negotiating with a hooker for her time, playfully joking with her. That attitude extends through his meetings with his CO as a reporter for Stars and Stripes. His life is easy hidden away in Saigon. He can talk big about his time in the  and no one can really challenge him. It's when the Tet Offensive begins that his veneer of bravery breaks down and he starts shooting maniacally at a small invading force. He then gets sent out into the field to document some of the counter action.It's about here that I feel the movie just begins to break down itself narratively. From the time Joker is reunited with his mate from Parris Island (Private Cowboy) to the time that their squad leader dies in the final city, the movie kind of just swirls around without a real direction. There's marching and everyone talks big about nothing in particular. It's more of a dick measuring contest than anything else, and it culminates in another scene about a hooker as the men negotiate with her pimp and then jockey for who gets her first. As a contrast to the first hooker scene, Joker has little to say or do here. He's no longer standing out, and he's been pushed more to the background. Much like in Parris Island, he's more of one of several than an individual again.From purely a filmmaking perspective, the final thirty minutes, as the squad gets pinned down by a hidden sniper in a building, might be as good as the movie's first forty-five minutes. This stuff is really well filmed with clear action, a great outdoor set, smoke, and fire. It's tense as the squad watches several of their comrades take repeated sniper fire, mortally wounding them but not killing them, and the rest find a way around the sniper's position. It's a great sustained sequence that ends with the reveal that the sniper is a young girl, a wonderful point of irony to cap off the movie that's pretty steeped in it.Some more technical notes real quick. It's screamingly obvious that this movie wasn't filmed in Vietnam. It was filmed in England, and there's no place in England that looks like a Vietnamese paddy field, so there are numerous shots of the countryside that looks like flat bits of England with palm trees. The giant set that ends the film is both a blessing and a curse. When the frame's edges are filled with parts of the set, I find it completely convincing. When the edges of the frame extend out beyond the set, it once again feels like an outdoor set in the middle of England. I was also assured by my high school history teacher (who was a marine who had done three tours of duty in Vietnam) that while the yelling of the drill instructor was spot on, drill instructors would never ever strike a recruit.So, that's kind of where I am overall with the film. I know that the first half informs the second half, but I still haven't quite figured out how. I think I can grasp the overall thematic thrust of the film, but I haven't really developed it in my own head. I believe that there's more to this movie than my first four viewings have left with me, and I'm more than willing to give the film another try in the future. But for now, I have to embrace the incongruity between the two major sections, the flaccidity of a large part of the second section, and an opaqueness that I can't quite get through, and relegate Full Metal Jacket to the second tier of Kubrick's filmography. Maybe when I revisit this again in a year or so, I'll read this and build on my original thoughts instead of just repeating them. We shall see.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Kubrick's only misstep,"Kubrick failed to deliver a coherent or intriguing story with this film. I had watched the boot camp half twice and shut it off when they got to Vietnam. I couldn't stand the dehumanizing prostitute portrayal with the gratuitous ""these boots are made for walking"" needle drop. I finally gave the second half a try and all I can say is it was an absolute mess. It dehumanized and dishonored both sides of the conflict and constantly yelled its very basic message at you in the most ridiculous way. All the songs were completely unnecessary, the dialogue was unbelievable, the combat unrealistic, and it utterly failed as an anti-war movie. The ending with the female VC slowly dying and them singing Mickey Mouse was the most ham-fisted thing I've seen in any war film. It doesn't work as a satire either. Of course the drill sergeant did an excellent job and the basic training sequence was somewhat passable, however the latrine scene is where the movie fell off a cliff. It would've been much better for the story if they had private pile go crazy in Vietnam.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
Astonishing war movie,"The comments by many vets on this site, saying that this film to some degree reflects the nature of war, should be the highest praise for this film. I scanned the reviews looking for the comments of vets and found, in the first 14 pages, 6 vets stating that key elements of this film mirrored to some degree their experiences in Vietnam. I found this movie amazing. I agree with many of the more widely-held conclusions about this film. R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman is incredible, as is Vincent D'Onofrio as the tragic Pvt. Pyle. There certainly are two sections to this film, but the inspiration for both parts come from the same book and so, if both parts of the movie can be inspired by the same real lives, then it seems we should accept that both parts reflect different aspects of the military experience. I think that is fair. Capturing the emotional and psychological brutality of bootcamp, along with the horrors and the banality of war seem to be reasonable things to include in the same film.If anyone thinks that this film glamorizes war-from the death of Pvt. Pyle to the predicted destruction of the unit charged with taking out the sniper, as well as the sniper at the end of the film-they must be a psychopath.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Damion reviews Full Metal Jacket,"""Full Metal Jacket"" follows a single Marine-nicknamed Joker(Mathew Modine)-through boot camp and a portion of his time in Vietnam. It is loosely based on the story 'Short Timers' by Gustav Hasford. It is directed by Stanley Kubrick, known for long, eccentric movies that weave surreal and super real characteristics blended together, creating nightmarish, hollow and disconcerting movies.The boot camp portion of this film is what most people remember. The drill instructor is played by R. Lee Emery, and it is one of the most terrifying, moving, funny and convincing performances in movie history. Virtually a non-stop rant from his first appearances to his last he electrifies the performances around him and puts the viewer in boot camp with the rest of the recruits. Vincent D'Onofrio does well as Private Pyle, overacting in only one scene-though it is a critical scene. Matthew Modine's performance is almost tertiary to Emery and D'Onofrio's performance. We do get see him develop a little, the positive characteristics that will make him strong in Vietnam.The second portion blends sixties rock n' roll and Vietnamese urban warfare to tremendous effect. The war effort is crumbling and Reporter Sgt Joker is sent to the front to support infantry and get stories for the ""Stars and Stripes"". There, Joker confronts the full effects of war on himself, friends and strangers. One is hard pressed to remember at points that it is just a movie, so comfortable and real are the actors in their surroundings. The Door Gunner ('ain't war hell?'), Animal Mother, 8-ball and Cowboy are consumed by their roles.It is definitely not a movie for those easily offended by language. As an anti-war movie, it seems to have exactly the opposite effect. Nonetheless, it is a powerful performance, with the entire cast making it greater than the sum of its parts. It is the finest Kubrick movie that I've seen(out of eight). I recommend it for anyone over the age of sixteen who enjoys action or war movies. I rate this movie at nine stars out of ten. It truly deserves to be an American classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The feature is visually stunning, nice scenery, a few ""gooks"" up-close and lots of weapons and war-torn buildings. There's a wide range of emotions except for romance, hurray for realism ! You can see tree facets of the war going from training and it's hardship to comfy position finished by smelling blood. It's odd that they chose Joker, a war correspondant (journalist), for a main character ; I guess they wanted to show the hardening of a pretty normal guy instead of just jumping in the action with a testosterone/adrenaline junkie lusting for a kill seen in countless movies, it's more human that way.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Preparing for war is hell.,"First,let me state,that this is without question the nastiest movie,in terms of language,that I have ever seen.I am normally a person,who, though I rarely use bad language myself,am able to tolerate it when I hear it.With this film,however,I found myself blushing at the language used by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (they could not have picked a better actor to portray this man than R. Lee Ermey,by the way).Not only is war hell,preparing for it can be just as bad,if you don't have a healthy state of mind to begin with.This is the case for Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio,who really packed on the pounds for this role).You can almost feel him cracking throughout the first portion of the film,leading to a violent showdown with his tormenting commanding officer.The second half of the film is a basic display of the horrors of war itself,and very well done.Excellent direction by Stanley Kubrick,who always seemed to have a knack for not repeating himself a director,in terms of the types of films he directed.This was his ""war"" film,and it's an absolute masterpiece.Must see film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Boot Camp segment of Full Metal Jacket is the most accurate portrayal of Marine Boot Camp ever committed to film.The Boot Camp scenes are filled with dark humor, irony, and satire, but nonetheless, this is the way Boot Camp was.Drill Instructors could be both brutal and comical, but God help you if you ever laughed in formation, no matter how comical a Drill Instructor might be while doing his best to correct a recruit's attitude.Both Gustave Hasford, a former Marine and the author of the novel, ""The Short Timers"" from which the film was adapted, and Stanley Kubrick used some literary and cinematic license, which is to be expected, but were still true to the actual experience.The accuracy was enhanced by Lee Ermey's performance as GySgt Hartman, as he was Marine Drill Instructor during his ten years in the Marine Corps.Due to having been singled out for Vietnamese language training before going to Vietnam, I missed the 1968 Tet Offensive, which was depicted in the film.While the film also takes some license with the Vietnam scenes and relied as heavily on stereotypes as in the Boot Camp scenes, those stereotypes like all stereotypes, being grounded in reality, illustrated war as it really is and remained true to the actual events of the 1968 Tet Offensive.I arrived in Vietnam in August of 1968 and I guess a bit ironically, I was wounded during the 1969 Tet Offensive, which if you haven't heard of it, don't feel bad.The Leftist media got what they wanted by depicting the 1968 Tet Offensive as a victory by the Communists, when it was actually a huge and costly failure for the Communists, and hardly mentioned the '69 offensive, which was as massive as the '68 offensive and an even more devastating defeat for the Communists.""Full Metal Jacket"" is a monumental film in the classic Kubrick style and even if Kubrick meant the film to be anti-war and anti-military, it is in truth a tribute to those who served their country during a time of war when the majority of that generation sided with the enemy, refused to serve, rioted in the streets and campuses and denigrated, disparaged, and ridiculed those who answered the call of duty.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Let's be honest here, Platoon is much better","Stanley Kubrick is certainly a great filmmaker. Most of his films are more of an artistic creation and that is very evident in films like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. In 1986, the film Platoon was released and won Best Picture. In 1987, Full Metal Jacket was released and while it recieved positive reviews, many people compared it to Platoon and it is not hard to see why. Full Metal Jacket was based off of the 1979 novel, The Short Timers. Again, the film recieved positive reviews. I think the most famous negative review was from Roger Ebert on his TV show with Gene Siskel. Essentially, Full Metal Jacket is the first Kubrick film of my knowledge to not be so divisive amongst viewers. The film was a commercial success making well over it's budget of $16 million.The film is split into two parts. The first part follows new recruits at boot camp under the command of a very (and I mean very) abusive drill instructor Hartman. The second part sees a platoon moving through Vietnamese cities during the Tet Offensive.I remember the first time I watched Full Metal Jacket and I remember that I absolutely loving the film. Years later, I don't love it as much. Let's start with the first half of the film, Boot Camp. Many many people agree that the Boot Camp part of the film is the best part of the film. And it is. Right away, we see these new recruits lose their individuality and are starting to be molded into killing machines. This was something that was not entirely touched upon during Platoon as it did not have a boot camp scene. Come to think of it, I cannot think of any Vietnam War movie with a boot camp scene. (At this point I have not seen Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter). The first half is very memorable thanks to great performances by R. Lee Ermy and Vincent D'Onofrio and they perhaps the best actors in this film. There is a lot of in depth stuff that one can read into with these characters and it is really interesting. As we switch over to the second half of the film, the film somewhat loses me. The message of individuality is somewhat lost in the second half. The lead of the whole film has more focus but is not as interesting and the performance is mediocre at best. Yes, I want to see fighting in a war film and this film delivers and plays it rather well here. There is some suspense amongst the gunfire. A difference with this film when comparing it with other films is that the fighting is in a city and not the jungles. The sets look great and do look really believeable. One thing that was really interesting was the use of music. Most of the music was really cheery and happy which serves as a great contrast to the war going on. The characters in the second half are not really interesting and really the only thing I know about them are their names. To me, they are a bunch of nobodies. Things that both parts of the film have in common is the cinematography. There are some truly beautiful shots in this film. To be honest, the only way I can truly identify this as a Kubrick film, is through the camera work.For me, Full Metal Jacket is still a nice film to watch but has some flaws that keep it from being the great masterpiece that I see everyone calling it. It's message is very apparent in the first half but is easily lost within the second (and weaker) half of the film. Memorable performances from Ermy and D'Onofrio and great cinematography and effects keep me from giving this a lower rating.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
I'm a huge Kubrick fan and this is not my favorite one,"""Full Metal Jacket"" will always be judged by the shadow of previous Kubrick's movies. And that's why I think it could be much better. I watched it ten or more times and I always ask myself why Stanley Kubrick chosen this script. You can't forget that his previous movie was ""The Shining"" back in 1980 and he was desperate for a good story (not a statement about Vietnam war) and this option came as a surprise for everyone in the industry. The movie is build around characters and there wasn't much space for the attention for that little tiny microscopic detail, so important to Kubrick's work, that's why I consider it an atypical movie in his directing career. That care for the visual detail would return with his final and baroque movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Disgusting Masterpiece,"Full Metal Jacket is a movie where you can tell everything Kubrick wanted the audience to feel, they ended up feeling. Every shot of this movie looks like it could be a classic photograph and the war setting is really felt. It has the perfect balance of not being too vague about the message to the point where there isn't one at all, while not being preachy whatsoever.This isn't an easy movie to watch at all. It's crazy how the more it progresses, it only gets harder and harder to watch. I think this was definitely the intent if you look into the original idea of the movie's ending that Kubrick had. I really wish he would of stuck to it, but the ending this movie has still conveys the same thing, just not as extreme.My only other flaws in this movie were pretty major. There is one scene that it is supposed to be super dark and serious, and the main character has some unserious acting that really took me out of the movie. I just really wish Kubrick would of redone that one (knowing how big he is on that). Another one might seem like you can't really fault Kubrick, but it still is a issue in 2022. There is one song that choice that is absolutely atrocious. Even despite how popular the song is in pop culture in 2022 compared to 1987, it still is a horrible song and didn't fit the scene whatsoever.Besides my two gripes, this is a must-see movie with a message that still is strong to this day.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"To clean/sterile, Tet, the beginning of the end","I found the equipment, men and locations etc to be to clean which did not reflect the reality. Our guys over there believed in the cause in the beginning. Incrementally feelings changed to less and less. Then came Tet, not long after frag incidents really kicked off. Short timers just counted days and tried to steer clear of engagements. The men still fought for each other it's just short timers were really careful. Overall not a bad movie maybe the youth of our country will learn it's not always wise to volunteer. For it's time the movie does an OK job telling a story and the dialog is not that bad.

Full Metal Jacket,"Whilst Full Metal Jacket is two hours of stunningly graphic, no-punches-pulled Vietnam War drama, whenever I think of the Stanley Kubrick masterpiece, all I can think of is the first forty-five minutes: the infamous Parris Island basic training sequence with (real life soldier) R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman and Vincent D'Onfario as Private ""Gomer Pyle"". It is brutal. Disturbing and wholly unforgettable.The second stanza of the film, combat in Hue City around the time of the NVA's Tet Offensive, is good, and in a different film might be lauded even more than it already is, but is kind of a let-down after the events that have preceded it. Ermey's performance was all the more chilling because you get the feeling he probably wasn't doing all that much acting. The scene where Hartman is lauding Oswald and Charles Whitman as determined Marines with rifles was pretty disturbing. But oh so well done.A gritty, honest Vietnam portrayal. ""The Green Berets"" this certainly is not.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Almost a tale of two movies.  One training, the other Vietnam.","I have to say I am not the biggest Kubrick fan. Not really against him or anything, but I have actually seen very few films by him. In fact, other than this one, the only other film of his I have seen is ""The Shining"" so of these two my experiences have been mostly positive. This film starts out great in my opinion with a well organized basic training section. You get to meet new recruits as they get their head shaved, then you get to see what a Marine has to go through to be a Marine and suffice to say there is no way I could do what they do. Not only do you have a crazed Sergent constantly yelling at you and demoralizing you, I just could not handle the sleeping quarters and all that comes with basic training as I have social anxiety problems so I most likely would try to get away or off myself. I would not do what the one guy does here though. The second half of the film is a bit weaker and not as strong plot wise as the first part. This may have been done on purpose as to depict the Vietnam war as disorganized and chaotic and if that is the case it is done well. Just not enough plot structure for my tastes in this section of the film, still good, it just can not quite rise to the level of the first portion of the film. The acting is even though throughout the movie so that helps in the rather uneven Vietnam section of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
First half much better than second,"I've read that Lee Ermy's sergeant in this movie is not an exaggeration from how many sergeants have acted towards their recruits during basic training, the only difference is now sergeants are no longer allowed to put their hands on the trainees. However, all the verbal action and style in how they push them through training is spot on.Ermy, as Sergeant Gunnery, has the hapless Private Pyle as his favorite target due to his overweight, lazy, slacker yet smug attitude he had, well he started out smug before Gunnery broke his spirit. And he made sure to keep any of Pyle's laziness, his wiseacre tendencies, and his spirit away for good if he could help it. Much of the first half of the film is centered around the basic training and Ermy's constant belittling and bullying Pyle.In the real life military basic training, most trainees like Pyle would've been discharged or dropped out before Pyle went anywhere. Ermy seemed to have had a special need for keeping him there as his punching bag. However, it could also be argued that maybe also he felt underneath that through enough pushing, he could eventually have made a real soldier out of Pyle. He was wrong about that, with the top climatic showdown of the movie (which was not near the end like in most movies) between Gunnery and Pyle, along with his famous ""what's yer major malfunction!!!?"", and the surprise (well, the surprise for someone not like me who seen this movie many times).Other great moments during training including Pyle's reprocussions for sneaking in a donut (and the other recruits with the socks full of metal locks), the obstacle courses (particularly with Pyle's struggling through them), and the always tense introduction of the recruits with the Sergeant when standing down (along with the line copied from ""Officer and a gentleman"", ""Only steers and q****s come from Texas!! I don't see no horns!!"").All above being the first half of the movie which was much better than the second. The second part took place in Vietnam, minus the two biggest characters from the first half, and was basically just another cutout copy of films on troops in Vietnam. And, there have really been better movies about troops fighting in Vietnam such as ""Platoon"", ""Good morning Vietnam"", and even in ""Forrest Gump"".Arlis Howard was one of the main characters in the Vietnam section, who I remember from ""Plain clothes"" where he played an undercover cop posing as a highschool student to help solve a murder of one of the teachers. And there was that talked about prosritute scene in the Vietnam part which I didn't find that great. I honestly have on several occasions only watched this movie to see the basic training half, and have only seen the movie all the way through about half the times I've seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Full Metal Jacket is not just about war, but rather the psychology behind it.","A smart move from the legend that was Stanley Kubrick. We've all seen many war films, a genre that is well explored from a variety of different conflicts. Full Metal Jacket however chooses to go behind the scenes and focus on the training process that changes well intentioned men into trained lethal killers. You could easily split this in half and have two separate films, the first half being more psychologically charged whereas the latter showcasing the brutality of warfare. A ridiculously serious drill sergeant practically bullying a trainee marine so harshly that it slowly turns him into an unstable psychopath. That right there, was some really good psychology and made the film so much more interesting. Sure the Vietnam War scenes were depicted with a substantial amount of fire, blood and guns but it was the first half that really captivated me. Vincent D'Onofrio was the stand out for me, both convincing and expressive through his face. Matthew Modine was good, probably his best performance. Lee Ermey deserves recognition just for somehow managing to not lose his voice from all the shouting. Characterisation was present, perhaps not fully fleshed out as I would like but was just enough for me to care about them. Yet again though, it's the technical marvel that wins...Stanley Kubrick. His directing style is so damn flawless. The nice clean long takes, actors looking directly into the camera, slow motion deaths (particularly in the sniper shootout)...he is just phenomenal. Script was sharp as well. A great section of dialogue where our lead character wears a peace badge and a helmet that says ""born to kill"" for which he describes represents the duality of man. That really stuck with me. So whilst it might feel like two separate films (due to that ridiculously quick transition), it's hard not to appreciate everything that's shown to us. Another hit from Mr. Kubrick.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
slow pace equals more info,"i was not overwhelmed by gunfire. i had time to know a little about the people. that made this most clever a film to me. it was focused on a small group and fewer battles, true of many films i suppose but i had much more feeling for what was going on via the visuals (thanks mr. kubrick) and the characters. especially like adam baldwin as animal mother, crazy killer with courage and comradeship. this to me is one of the most revealing and thought provoking pieces created about war apart from 'all quiet on the western front' (the novel)and for me that's really saying something. the journalistic approach works and although my friend said in the other post he felt the movie to be split in 2 i did not. the mickey mouse theme is most telling",,Anonymous,Drama
Realistic Viet Nam war movie,"I was too young to be in Viet Nam, but from the comments that I hear about this movie from those who were there, this movie has realism that still affects them emotionally.This is probably the best role Mathew Modine has played up to that point. Not all the soldiers were like soldiers in this movie but I guess that's what the reality of it was at the time. The dichotomy or what didn't make sense was why did mostly middle class Americans have to be sent into this brutal war, that United States had no moral reasons to be involved.The part that was most memorable was the scene where a Viet Namese sniper took out an American soldier. One second you're alive, next second you're dead. I could see why you could be psychologically distressed after seeing something like that.To me many of the things that happens in this movie didn't make much sense. I guess you had to be there to understand it. The movie had a mood like no other movie I've seen. Whether it was a good movie or not is beyond me to judge, but it was produced well, and the acting was decent.How this movie appears to you probably depends on your experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Kubrick out of Ammo  with Full Metal Jacket,"By the time Stanley Kubrick made Full Metal Jacket it was evident the once enormously talented director had lost a step or two. Barry Lyndon was a beautiful bore to endure and his adaption of Stephen King's The Shining was drained of terror. Full Metal continued the slide but did not end it. The worst was yet to come with Eyes Wide Shut.Jacket is Kubrick's late entry to a long line of Viet Nam films that followed the unpopular war. The first half takes place on Paris Island where Marine recruits are put through basic training. It is a brutal and suspenseful first half made all the more powerful by Lee Ermey's intense DI. Once overseas the film founders badly. Kubrick keeps his camera moving with elaborate pans and tracking shots but his actors become lifeless caricatures and psychos, a rich pastiche of ugly Americans and moronic commanders. In Strangelove there was a dark comic touch that made it work. Here it only shows an out of touch artist trying to be relevant and hip with a paler Apocalypse Now take that was done (and done a lot better) eight years earlier.The last half hour really exacerbates matters with a scene that concerns routing a sniper. To maintain suspense this long is impossible in such a situation and it is proved here. There is also a contrived denouement to the whole scene that rings hollow.Put another director's moniker on it and the crit's would give it passable grades as an anti-war film with a touch too much self indulgence and sluggish editing. But since it's Stanley's watch what you say. Well since it is Stanley's I give Metal a five instead of a six since the great cutting edge director of classic original film work as Dr.Strangelove, 2001, A Space Odyssey and Clockwork Orange followed this time instead of taking the lead as he has done in the past. In this case with a less than impressive effort that borrows heavily from some of his past works.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Stanley Kubrick showcases his brilliance alongside a memorable cast with one of the best movies about the Vietnam War.,"Based on the novel ""The Short Timers"" by Gustav Hasford, Full Metal Jacket is one of the best war movies about the Vietnam War along with memorable performances from Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, R. Lee Ermey, Adam Baldwin, Arliss Howard, and Dorian Harewood. Having returned after being away since The Shining (1980), Director Stanley Kubrick showcases his brilliance once again bringing Full Metal Jacket to life on the big screen which was met with critical acclaim and also a hit at the box office. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.Full Metal Jacket is divided into two parts. The first half of the movie takes place on Parris Island where recruit training takes place. Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann (the late R. Lee Ermey) is the senior drill instructor who ruthlessly puts the new recruits through a brutal boot camp transforming them into Marines with the intention of producing Marines ready to go into battle. Private Joker (Matthew Modine) is the main character in the movie and we meet him alongside other new recruits such as Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Cowboy (Arliss Howard). Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann is verbally and physically abusive to the recruits though he sees himself as hard but fair. The second half of the movie takes place in the city of Hue in Vietnam. Joker has since been promoted to Sergeant and is now a war correspondent unlike other recruits who have gone on to join the infantry. While in Vietnam, Joker befriends fellow war correspondent Raftermann (Kevyn Major Howard) who are both assigned to cover the war. Joker also meets fellow marines including Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Lieutenant Touchdown (Ed O'Ross), and the sadistic doorgunner (Tim Colceri). Joker also witnesses the horrors of the war first hand but his sarcastic and dry humour have never gone away. As well as meeting many marines with colourful personalities, he finds himself caught up in the middle of combat as well as the Tet Offensive and the climax where a sniper targets the Platoon.Matthew Modine shines alongside Vincent D'Onofrio, Adam Baldwin, Arliss Howard, Dorian Harewood and Kevyn Major Howard. The standout in the movie is the late R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann. He is foul mouthed and full of colourful and derogatory insults and is seen striking the recruits. Though he sees himself as hard but fair, he is seen as a vicious bully who he has the single minded task of moulding the recruits into US Marines ready to kill the enemy.The late Stanley Kubrick did a brilliant job as writer and director. Though the movie was meant to take place in Parris Island, South Carolina and Vietnam, the entire movie was filmed in England.Full Metal Jacket was one of many movies released in the 1980's depicting the Vietnam War. It's captivating, disturbing, dark, and brilliant. Full Metal Jacket is still regarded as one of the best war movies of all time.A well deserved 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The inhumanity of War !!!,"One of the many characteristic aspects of Kubrick's cinema is the deliberate lack of humanity and intimacy. He made it a point to keep the viewer at a distance from the characters and the circumstances. 'Full Metal Jacket' is divided into two specific parts. The first part involving the basic training in the boot camp, benefits immensely from Kubrick's emotionally distant filmmaking. This first part is a brilliantly directed, shot and acted satire on the dehumanisation of young boys in the army. We see the innocent and honorable masculinity of these boys who want to do themselves, their families and their country proud, get replaced by toxic masculinity which involves killing your identity and your humanity, equating the lust for sex with the lust for violence, keeping all your emotions suppressed and in the end becoming ultra-aggressive, remorseless, animalistic killers. R. Lee Ermey pretty much single-handedly carries this first part of the film through sheer verbal aggression. The character of Sergeant Hartman played by Ermey is pretty much the devil just like the character of Terence Fletcher played by J. K. Simmons in 'Whiplash'. Just like great satire, there are numerous sequences and moments in this part where the audience will feel like laughing and then within a few seconds feel disturbed and disgusted for laughing at something terrible and reprehensible.While Kubrick's emotionally distant filmmaking is beneficial to the first part of the film, it actually to some extent becomes a weakness in the second part. In the second part, we move to Vietnam where we see the soldiers having to execute everything that they learnt in boot camp, at the real battlefield. Now there certainly are moments in this second half that I love like the sequence of the talking head interviews of the soldiers which further underline how pointless this war was and how clueless even the soldiers were about their missions and the general purpose of their temporary existence in Vietnam. I also especially loved the extended situational set- piece that the film ends with as it provides a devastating and perhaps a sorrowful conclusion to the arc of the character of Sergeant Joker played by Matthew Modine who for the major part of the film remains the voice of reason, logic and humanity. However apart from these aforementioned scenes, this second half of 'Full Metal Jacket' lacks a sense of cohesion. It feels like a random collection of vignettes, some of which aren't very interesting. The reason why some of the vignettes seem uninteresting is Kubrick's refusal to allow us into the mental state of the characters that are introduced in the second half or give us any insight into their psyches apart from some surface level behavioral tendencies. There are many scenes where we see the soldiers talk to each other and spend time together, but those scenes rang hollow to me and felt somewhat forced and artificial. This inability to completely appreciate the second half of the film on my part could be completely subjective. Since I loved the first half so much, maybe the change in setting and tone that takes place was always going to make it tough for the second half to measure up when compared to the first.Technically 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't as showy and attention grabbing as some of Kubrick's other films, however it still retains a lot of his characteristic visual touches like the use of one-point perspective and the use of steadicam,etc. The urban, ground level combat scenes are very well staged and directed. The production design has to be admired a lot for those scenes too. From an acting standpoint, I have already mentioned R. Lee Ermey for his brilliant performance. I think Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio deserve special mentions too for coming up with contrasting, yet equally compelling performances respectively.In conclusion, I'll say 'Full Metal Jacket' doesn't quite achieve greatness due to the flawed second half of the film. But it's still an exceptionally good movie that comes close to greatness due to the incredibly brilliant first half which I think is as good and as powerful as anything Kubrick has ever done in a visceral scene. It's a film that can be directly connected to 'Paths of Glory' and 'Dr. Strangelove' in terms of Kubrick's criticism of institutional authority, dogmatic patriotism and toxic masculinity. It's most certainly worth recommending.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The war movie that can't be made today,"I felt that this movie was divided into two parts, the first and second halves.In the first half, the story focuses on the boot camp training of the new recruits. They undergo harsh training from Sergeant Hartman, and the struggles of one recruit, Leonard, as he faces various challenges are particularly noteworthy. (Who could have expected that scene on the eve of graduation from training?)In the second half, the story shifts to the deployment of the newly trained soldiers to the battlefield. Unlike the first half, the characters who have been deployed into combat experience the horrors of war firsthand. The changes in the soldiers' hearts are well portrayed.The final scene is one that remains vividly in my memory among the many movies.

This is ART. It makes you think.,"Had the entire film continued on the track of the first half, it would have perhaps been better. The first half is terribly cruel and funny. The second half is also great, but not as enjoyable. But something that makes this movie great is that it's like three movies in one. The movie explores so many themes. Spending the whole movie is base camp would not have been able to do this. It's a fantastic picture.The first half takes place in the base camp and the soldiers undergo training. The film starts out very funny (laughing out loud funny) and life in the navy looks great, but it quickly turns when a recruit goes crazy. Then the second half continues with misery and war.It's one of the greatest anti-war films. How hard should you push your recruits? You need your soldiers to be tough, but abusing them untill they become insane killing machines? Think how much time and energy goes into training these people and how talented each individual is. But no one can do anything alone, it is only together that they can do any good. War leads nowhere but death.Also good soundtrack which is so resoundingly important. A little Nancy Sinatra never hurts. This is a film that must be seen at some point. The film briefly touches on the dualism of man which is interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Paint It Black,"Believe it or not, this was considered a flop and a disappointment for Stanley Kubrick back in 1987. Many of his fans were expecting a war epic along the lines of Apocalypse Now. But the thing is, Kubrick already made his war epic, in Paths of Glory. Secondly, it's clear by watching the film that Kubrick's intention was not to talk about the politics of the war, or even stage big budgeted action sequences. His goal was to encapsulate the overall feeling many had about the Vietnam War on and off the battlefield. A pointless exercise of human slaughter. Vietnam, for many, was the definition of man's inhumanity to man. That is what Full Metal Jacket is truly about. The unforgettable first 45 minutes of the picture has us see the ways in which these soldiers are desensitized. The loud-mouthed, profane Sgt. Hartman humiliates the new recruits to their core and as a result, mentally destroys the most vulnerable of the recruits in Leonard ""Private Pyle"" Lawrence. Once we enter Vietnam, Kubrick shows us the casualties of war, and man's inability to show humility towards each other. In the end, Vietnam is a killing field and some of those fighting it ultimately enjoyed the killing. Full Metal Jacket doesn't resolve like a novel, nor do any of the characters receive any kind of redemption. You can say that it's in the tradition of all of Kubrick's films.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

So much of this masterpiece is so very original, from the quotable lines to the perfect scenes. The film is very well acted and very well cast. Stanley Kubrick famously stated that he preferred adapting novels and improving upon them, and he proves his theory here. The use of music is great as well, particularly in the ending scene as well as in the one with the prostitute, which might be one if the single greatest scenes in any film ever. And while I'm not normally crazy about narration in film, it is very well done here. I've seen it many times and it never gets old.

Incredible.....,"Based on the novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford, comes 'Full Metal Jacket', which undoubtedly is one of the finest films ever made in the history of cinema! Incredible!!! Stanley Kubrick takes us back to a squad of U.S. Marines through their United States Marine Corps Recruit Training and depicts some of the experiences of two of them in the Tet Offensive (1968) during the Vietnam War. 'Full Metal Jacket' is a so-so-so good, that I was left awe-struck. The first 40-minutes shows as how 'Maggots' turn into 'Heroes'. The rest of the 80-minutes is on the war-back-drop. The climax is epic, beautifully thought & executed.If given a chance My Review for 'Full Metal Jacket' would never end.

An eye opener about War back then!,"Full Metal Jacket is a powerful and intense war film that brilliantly captures the brutality of military life and the Vietnam War. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it combines dark humor with harsh realism, making for a unique viewing experience. The performances, especially by R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio, are unforgettable and raw, bringing the characters to life in a way that's both gripping and unsettling. The film's dialogue is sharp and iconic, and the direction masterfully portrays the psychological impact of war. It's a must-watch that explores the dehumanizing effects of combat with an unflinching gaze.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
War is Hell,"It is rare that a film has nothing good to say about war. Though there have been an increasing number of films in recent years that work to show the true savagery of battle, there is always a touch of honor and nobility presented as well. In fact, in many films the overall presentation is that while war may be brutal, it is from that very brutality that true heroes are born. Indeed, these portraits of war show that fact as almost a given.But this film, like Apocalypse Now, shows that sometimes there is no honor to be found in war, and that horror and inhumanity can often be the only true things to be found in battle. From the sadistic boot camp of R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman to the widespread death and destruction of the Tet offensive, Full Metal Jacket shows us that sometimes when we place ordinary men into combat situations, we do not get heroes but rather killers and sociopaths.Kubrick is often known for giving us thought provoking films, but this title may be considered Kubrick at his best. Observing it all alongside Matthew Modine's pragmatic Pvt. Joker, we are encouraged to ask ourselves: what honor, what nobility are we supposed to find here? For many viewers, the answer will be none. This is a film both horrible and powerful, and should be viewed by all. Especially those of us who view conflict as the best means of resolving crisis. It may cause you to rethink that position. I know it did so for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Well made, with punch, but very straight forward for Kubrick","Full Metal Jacket (1987)An extremely straight forward, funny, and tragic Vietnam War movie, going from the excessive rigors of boot camp to the hard core horrors of hand to hand combat.Stanley Kubrick shows the bare bones of it, without romanticizing, and without making heroes out of anyone. There are two main emotional turning points, one at the end of boot camp, and one near the end of the movie, and both are about the madness of war and about death. And both are pulled out of the mainstream thread of the story with a jolt. It's sensationalism, really, but made with Kubrick rigor.A balance to all the horror is the humor, not as insane as, say Dr. Strangelove, but with a similar dry wit. The first forty minutes of the film are justly famous for their almost campy but still believable scenes of the sergeant training young Marines. (And this sarge is a real Vietnam vet who did this kind of training.)Compare this movie to Platoon and you'll see a much more restrained movie, and without the jungle warfare we usually associate with Vietnam. Platoon makes people out to be larger than life, and Kubrick intends more to say, hey, this is the real deal, whatever cinematic tricks are showing.But compare this to Apocalypse Now or Deer Hunter and you might start to wish Kubrick hadn't played it so straight. Full Metal Jacket lacks, above all, imagination, and as a movie, it needs it.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Stanley Kubrick is Pure Genius,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job of creating an aggressive beginning to the movie. The constant abuse of Gomer Pyle by Sergeant Hartman felt real and the versimilitude in the movie was frightening. The film also carried some of the greatest scenes in history. The scene between Pyle and Joker which awoke Sgt. Hartman was intense,raw and the words ""Full metal jacket"" will forever ring in the back of my mind. It also opened the eyes to the world of what an abusive drill instructor could do and what it could lead you to do.The other scene that was horrifying and the realism of the hazing of Pyle was as if you were there witnessing as a bystander. Kubrick did a terrific job of filming that scene and showing you the angst of Joker as he reluctantly gets in on the action. I feel like Stanley Kubrick attempted and completed in showing you what the Vietnam war could do to a average normal person and the aftermath of what a war like that could do.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Thought Provoking,"Kubrick's Vietnam War film is a study of the human condition, specifically the soldier's human condition, during basic training and war time. There is not much commentary on the justification of the Vietnam War, only an examination of what war does to the mind. There is a scene where an officer asks Private Joker why he wrote ""Born to Kill"" on his helmet if he wears a peace sign on his shirt. Joker replies ""I don't know. It has something to do with the duality of man,"" or something to that effect. The whole movie is about the duality of man; everybody wants there to be peace, but when an authority figure tells us to kill, it becomes natural. For this, Full Metal Jacket is a thought provoking experience.The first forty minutes of Full Metal Jacket follows a group of Marine trainees on Paris Island who want to serve in Vietnam. We meet our main character, Private Joker, but the first act is dominated by two performers, R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and Private Leonard Lawrence, nicknamed ""Gomer Pyle,"" played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Hartman is the toughest Drill Instructor imaginable; he is on his soldier's butts about something all the time. Pyle, however, is a natural screw-up, it is hard to imagine how he even made it to Paris Island, and Hartman is always the harshest with him, because he has been trained to believe that the louder you bark at a soldier the sooner they will shape up. Instead, it has the opposite effect on Pyle; he becomes mentally disturbed during his training, probably because he was never mentally fit to be a soldier in the first place. This segment typically receives the most praise; it is certainly easier to enjoy, because it progresses toward a natural conclusion, graduation day. Ermey also gives the best performance in the film, mainly because it was not a performance, as Ermey was a real Gunnery Sergeant. Almost all of his lines were ad-libbed. Sgt. Hartman is one of the most memorable characters in all of Kubrick's films.The rest of the movie does not really flow toward a natural ending; it just follows Private Joker on his daily exploits in Vietnam, and ends rather abruptly, making it harder to enjoy. The film's themes are exemplified in every scene, however. As a journalist, Private Joker has not been disturbed by actual combat, but he meets many others who have, particularly a soldier named Animal Mother. He cannot understand how soldiers can kill with such ease, but but he comes to understand in the final combat experience of the movie.Like all Kubrick movies, there is some good camera work here. I swear when people got shot in this movie I thought I had been shot too, especially during the sniper sequence. The only problem I have with FMJ, besides the disjointed quality of the second half, is that it never really feels like you are in Vietnam. The movie was filmed in England, and even though the sets were great, they still feel like sets. For these reasons, FMJ is the weakest of Kubrick's war movies (excluding Spartacus). It is still an intellectually stimulating experience that should not be missed if you like war films.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Good!!,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is one of the most powerful and brutal war films ever made. Released in 1987, the movie is based on the novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford and explores the Vietnam War from the perspective of young Marines. The film is divided into two distinct parts: the intense training of soldiers and the horrifying realities of combat. Kubrick's direction and his approach to both the psychological and physical effects of war make Full Metal Jacket a standout in the war film genre. A very good and intense movie that I've ever seen in my entire life, makes me want to watched it all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Well, pilgrim, only after ya...","IMDb Top 250: 87Like Joker's view of men, Full Metal Jacket is filled with duality: in the plot, structure, characters and theme. The only singular conclusion that can be drawn is that it is a great film, one of Kubrick's best.Famously FMJ follows Private Joker's time in boot camp, and then part of his experience in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. Primarily the film is about 'dehumanization', saying that the war experience strips men of their identities. But, unlike many, many war films, this is not in tandem with the message of ""war is bad"". I found that Full Metal Jacket doesn't choose to suggest that nature or civilians suffer, or convey the futility of war, but instead to primarily push that the soldiers involved lost a part of their humanity. I also fond the film to be decidedly pro- war, at least in comparison to films. This is suggested by the attitude of the soldiers, shown laughing and joking with each other, shooting up the bad guys with upbeat rock n' roll playing.I'm not saying Kubrick was pro- war, as he has made several films with opposite intentions, but that this is an interestingly refreshing angle for a war film.Characters are a key strength here, with a very colourful cast. Most notably and iconic is Hartman with his incredible insults. Of course he's scary and dominates every scene for the first half of the film, but some of his material is very funny, like his view on Texans and Lawrence (of what, Arabia?). I'd comment on the extraordinary script here, but R. Lee Ermey improvised many of his lines. But the script is excellent, with the film summary being a favourite quote of mine. Hartman's tone, scary and funny, is present throughout, wavering constantly, as the line between light and heavy material is often straddled.Our protagonist is nicknamed Private Joker, and that's all we really learn about him. He's the straight character in this zany world, levelheaded and intelligent. I'm reminded of Nick from The Great Gatsby, but more likable and witty. But not even worldly Joker is safe from the effects of the war he observes in others.Then there's poor, Private Pyle. All Hartman wanted to do was weed out the weak, to avoid sending the unprepared into the heat of combat. He was tough, very tough, probably too tough, as shown by the comparison between Hartman and Joker's teaching methods. However he was excellently acted and believably led to the shocking conclusion.I've forgot to mention with the past several Kubrick films how technically strong they are, but I can't avoid it with this one. The sets are lively, the sound is booming, the costumes have personality and the cinematography is strong. It's difficult to believe the whole thing was shot in Britain.Full Metal Jacket is one of the best war movies ever made, affecting its viewers in a way I can't quite understand. This is one of Kubrick's finest, and one of the most prolific pieces of pop culture he made. Witty, somber, outstanding. 9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good war film!,"First of all I love Kubrick's work, so I came into this with a bias. However I have seen a lot of action and war films, and this one, to an individual who never went to war, seems the most true-to-life, taken as a whole. This IS how you have to look at this film, incidentally; trying to break it down into two or three parts and say which was better is missing the point of the film, I think.In the same way that ""Trainspotting"" was an anti-drug film that did not gloss over anything, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is (for me) an anti-war film that stares straight at the ugliness of war and the potential for violence within almost all people, especially those trained, conditioned, even twisted, into military roles, without preaching even a single time. Less allegory and more applicability! Wonderful!The camera work was superb. I felt like I was walking through the movie with the Marines, from the barracks to the battlefield scenes.I have seen others criticize this film for the voice over, but I felt that it was used sparingly, and was helpful, not overdone. The narrator doesn't say anything that seems out-of-place.Others have commented on the music, the acting, and so on, so I won't add my repetitive comments, except that the drill sergeant is perfect!The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL.10 out of 10, perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Get through the gruesome training and maybe you'll survive hell,"Full Metal Jacket is Vietnam war movie by Stanley Kubrick and it is a masterpiece.The good. The mood is set to perfection with the exemplary score and the smooth pacing of the scenario. The story is done in two part, you get to see the ongoing effect of the training as it happens and its result in the field. It is personal, it is gripping, and psychologically brutal. A clear picture of what it is to become a soldier and what it requires on the field. Great photography and editing. Solid dialogs.The actors. Matthew Modine is in one of his best role, presenting a steadfast young man with the rare quality necessary to get through marine training with all his head. A young Vincent D'Onofrio, almost unrecognizable, gives us a performance of a lifetime with incredible realism. R. Lee Ermey is the quintessential army drill sergeant, a perfect performance. Adam Baldwin plays a shallow role, but gives it his best.The bad. Nothing.The ugly. Giving loud orders in an echoing building while sneaking on an enemy. It's the only error of the flick.The result.

"This movie does not ""fall apart at the end"" as some say","I'm a big fan of Kubrick.  His movies tend to have subtexts that are not readily apparent.A theme he keeps revisiting in his films is that of entropy, or the way a system can break down.  Witness HAL in 2001: A Space Oddyssey, and the ""military/political system"" in Dr. Strangelove.  It takes but a small thing to set destruction in motion.This one is similar, where the tightly regimented robot soldiers leave the camp all clean cut and organized, but later the story trails off into a non-standard, open and disarrayed ending that parallels the reality of the lack of closure such things have in real life.  Stories are ususally handed to us in nice, digestable packets, but the narrative here falls apart just like the military unit does.I think it is intentional.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great antiwar movie,"Many have found this movie consists in 2 parts. Personally, I find there are three distinct parts in this movie, the second one consisting a bridge between the 1st and the 3rd one.The first part consisted training the soldiers.
The second part consists in discovering Vietnam, its people and the other soldiers.
The third part finally was all about the war, its consequences and its effect on the soldiers.Full metal jacket is a very intelligent anti-war movie, perhaps a bit too intelligent, as many misunderstood its message. The movie manages to not only condition the trainees but also to condition us the viewers. And that's the power of the movie.And effectively the first part made us feel for the trainees. They were so strong, organized and funny that one could only feel sympathy for them. By the end of the first part one was expecting this hard training to result in forming some mighty heroes.However soon enough one sees the result of the dehumanization in the boot camp. Their experiences in Vietnam even accentuate this. At the end of the movie one realises even more that the soldiers not only are brainwashed but that they lost all of their humanity.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good film,"Good film The main character of the movie, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) goes to fight with his old friend ""Cowboy"" and his men in the city of Hue.

I really felt for the characters during the training, but when they were fighting I felt less attached to them. Most of this part of the film is the men hiding behind walls and getting shot. While it is interesting, I felt that I had had enough after a little while. There is one very good part to me, when the men are being interviewed by a documentary crew. You get to see how different people saw the war, and it seemed to remind me of the dehumanization process the war brings as well as some comedy from some things the men said when answering the questions.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
First half deserves Oscar; second half shows a different kind of war,"I had heard great things about this movie but didn't remember specific details until I saw it. I only saw it because WGN America is in my basic basic cable package which I have just to be able to watch what I should receive free with an antenna. And I happened to see a couple of interesting movies as I was looking carefully through the listings at Christmas.I know the G-rated version of Boot Camp from ""Gomer Pyle, USMC"", which the drill sergeant here was familiar with. This was nothing like that. At first I assumed this man was unspeakably brutal, but one imdb reviewer said yes, he was in Boot Camp during the era when this was set, and this was realistic. I'm sorry to hear that. This treatment of human beings was nothing less than disturbing and upsetting. And entertaining because it was so well done. In fact, we could even laugh at times.LAUGH? YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY? Sir, no sir!""South Park"" once tried to set a record for uses of the S-word in an episode. I believe this movie beats that record for the word itself and countless compound words that include it and then some. There were only a couple of words WGN America wouldn't allow.How could anyone treat people this way? Is this really going to produce confident fighters? For one man in particular, we saw the predictable result of treatment beyond what any human should endure. Yes, he will be a killing machine. But he is not the proud honorable warrior that the Marines are known for. More like a serial killer with a frightening expression on his face, a man we should be afraid to send to Vietnam.How did Lee Ermey not win an Oscar? Or at least get a nomination? And Vincent D'Onofrio should have at least been nominated as well. Called ""Gomer Pyle"" because he is such an incompetent idiot, he is patiently trained by Joker, in a way that is more likely to get results. I remember the same thing happening to the original Gomer in his show's pilot, only that was done by his D.I. who was given the impression Gomer was a general's son sent to test him. In truth, this Gomer Pyle probably should have washed out, as the original Gomer's D.I. believed would happen in his case. But then we wouldn't have found that quite as entertaining. Or disturbing.And talk about disturbing. I began to realize what I thought I had heard. I don't know if I ever did, but that's what happened.And then the whole tone of the movie changes. We get to laugh a few more times before things get really serious. Things aren't too bad where combat is not taking place, but it's still not family-friendly by a long shot. And regardless of which side they are on, Vietnamese people are treated like dirt by the white and black soldiers (I'm not sure they are all Marines, and I think ""soldiers"" may be an acceptable term for those in the service on land). After all, any of them could be the enemy.Finally, there is real combat. Wait, this is war? It's not the traditional image of war. It's more like war has been in the past couple of decades. In fact, it's like an episode of Lucas Till's ""MacGyver"" but far more violent, and there's no science genius who can solve any problem and make anything out of whatever parts he can find.Someone is filming a documentary, which makes things interesting. We hear the opinions of those who are serving.Oscar worthy? Not really, not here. But like Boot Camp, it is quite disturbing. The enemy is prepared to kill or be killed. Some of those on our side have quite an unsettling attitude. When we finally meet the enemy, there are moral decisions to be made. The right thing is done, though is there anything right here at all?Vietnam. It wasn't pretty. Neither is this movie. If you can stand it, this is a worthwhile experience.",,Anonymous,Drama

While there could have been more action in a Vietnam war movie I wasn't complaining about the action.My main issue was with the storyline, in that there wasn't one. This movie is simply a portrayal of the war crimes that took place during the Vietnam war. It is a jumbled collection of ""Shock Shots"" and Kubrick's personal beliefs about the war. I honestly believe that this film has such good reviews is due to the Kubrick bandwagon. Since watching FMJ I have seen several other Kubrick movies, (Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut included) and I honestly have no idea how Kubrick became successful.

"8.6 - A Great, Unique and Powerful War Film.","Full Metal Jacket follows a new recruit to the marines (who gets the nickname Private Joker) during his hard, dehumanizing training, and later on throughout the Vietnam War. He struggles to keep his individuality and values, serving but not willing to kill. On his helmet is the writing ""Born to kill"", and on his vest there's a peace symbol. When asked, at first he's not sure what it means. Maybe something about the duality of man, he finally replies. But the one who asked probably doesn't really get it.Anyway, to the review itself. A lot of people point out that movie has two distinct parts, and I tend to agree with that.The first part is in the bootcamp, and it's honestly quite perfect. The dialogue. The acting. The pacing. The characters, especially. Everything works together so well, and I got shivers going down my spine so many times during this part of the film. I can't think of a single thing the threw me off about this part.The second part, the war itself, has such a different tone. Strangely enough, the tone is a bit lighter on the second part, compared to the first. I think that it's probably because the soldiers are more loose out there. Even though some of them just hide the trauma and keep shooting, and some others laugh with disturbing joy while shooting helpless civillians, the bootcamp felt so strict, so cult-like, so traumatizing.I love this part as well - I think that maybe here and there it has some weaker moments, but the climax and ending are both great, and the camerawork here is literally phenomenal. The score and soundtrack are good as well (The first part had much less music, but it fitted the tone).And if action is what you seek in war films, well...I guess you'd prefer this part over the previous one, but I truly believe that the first part is at least near perfect.Overall, Full metal Jacket is definitely worth watching. It is an emotional story about human beings as the system breaks them, rebuilds them, and sends them all to fight a war that will break them once more. It's about protecting your identity. And it's about the scars that the army might leave on one that goes through it. I'm feeling an 8.6/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Dwells on the rigorous training than the battle on the front,"(1987) Full Medal Jacket
WARThere aren't too many memorable combat scenes except near the end regarding a Vietnamese sniper as much as the military training scenes on the whole first half of this film. Now that the Vietnam war is over, an expose of what is war like in Vietnam starting with ""Go Tell The Spartans"" to Oliver Stone's bleak point of view ""Platoon"" may have set the tone for more wars about Nam to come. ""Platoon"" may be the best depiction of what it was like on the battlefield but I have to say that ""Full Metal Jacket"" is the best film for what it was like training for that battlefield, fictionalize or otherwise. And what training it is which is described as somewhat relentless, harsh and cruel is what this film is best known for, especially the drill sergeant who is not like any drill sergeant that I've seen on screen especially black and white films about WWII.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The outsider's view of Vietnam,"To me, the ""big three"" (anti) Vietnam war films are:
1. Apocalypse Now
2. Platoon
3. Full Metal JacketAnd I rank them in that order, putting 'Full Metal Jacket' below the other two (and below several other well known Vietnam films for that matter). The main problem with 'Full Metal Jacket' is that it simply doesn't ring true on any level - it's obviously something that has been crafted and hammed up for the big screen, in order to convey certain messages, and that takes me right out of the film. This is basically Kubrick's style falling flat in this particular genre. Kubrick was always looking for non-realistic takes in his films (repeating takes over and over until he got the right one), which is what makes his great films great, but a war film needs to be something more visceral and real. In 'Apocalypse Now' you feel like you yourself are living on that boat. In 'Platoon,' you feel like you yourself are lost in the jungles. But in Kubrick's film, you are a passive observer, learning your lesson. This is not helped at all by the film almost being two short films back to back, each one being viewable in isolation without needing the other one. So 'Full Metal Jacket' becomes this stylized, outsiders take - a take from someone who obviously had nothing personally at all to do with Vietnam, and so instead of being from the viewpoint of a soldier, we get the viewpoint of a journalist, someone on the outside, looking in.It's certainly worth viewing, but for me I actually like it less and less each time I try to watch it, which is the opposite of most Kubrick films for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
an  analysis,"Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of the dregs of warfare ""Full Metal Jacket"" is often thought of as two films. This is easy to understand when one considers the films rather unconventional structure. You see most commercials films (as apposed to say ""art house"" fare) are divided into three acts. In the first act the dramatic conflict is introduced, in act two the challenge of the conflict is met by the protagonist, and finally in act three the conflict is resolved. Not so in FMJ, for you see this film is two act that don't quit ""jell"" in such a nice and neat way. Act one depicts life in marine boot camp. This being the act that the film is most widely know for. The second act is where things stray from the norm. You see act two only contains two characters from act one. One being the narrator/ protagonist  the other a rather small secondary character. The acts don't flow together in the previously mentioned three act manor. In act one we see ""Pile"" mis-treated while ""Joker"" tries to help him conform to the marine ways. ""Pile"" goes on to commit a murder suicide by killing his drill instructor and subsequently himself. Then on to act two we see Joker is now ""in-country"" as a correspondent. The only real tie to the first act is when he runs across a buddy from boot camp.  Each act is treated like its only miniature movie. Act one being the most popular and two like a weird sequel. FMJ not only lacks a third act  but also cohesive dramatic conflict. In act one the conflict might be seen as boot camp life and the protagonist could be ""Pile"". But ""Pile"" is obviously not in act two. One might find traditional conflict in act two but they would be mistaken for there is none. So what is the point of all of this you might ask.. Well you see what most screenwriters and Hollywood filmmakers forget is that there is no cohesive dramatic conflict in life. In life as in FMJ S&^% happens and all we can do is react and observe. And that's exactly what Kubrick wants. He wants to show us something and upon seeing this he wants a reaction. So what is he showing us? In act one he is clearly showing us the dehumanizing nature of creating a ""good marine"". And no this is not just a fictional depiction. Its a lot closer to reality than you might realize. You see the actor portraying the drill segment Lee Ermey served in the Marine Corps for 30 months as a ....you guessed it drill instructor. Much of his now famous dialogue were his own words.  All you have to do is talk to a marine about FMJ and they will tell you that's how  it was. The question is how do you a an audience member react to this display. In act two we are given a more ""traditional"" war film. Though unlike most Vietnam films FMJ second act takes place in decaying urban sectors as apposed to the thick jungles of ""Platoon"" or ""Apocalypse Now"".  It doesn't try to get you into anyone's head. Show you how this experience is changing the character. Kubrick is more interested in the audience. In the ""Vietnam the movie""  sequence soldiers are asked what they think about he war. There is none of your John Wayne hallmark patriotic propaganda.""Do you think we waits gooks for freedom? This is a slaughter."" -Animal Mother ""I wanted to see Vietnam, the jewel of south East Asia. I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating  people of a ancient culture and kill them"" -Joker FMJ is based on Gustav Hasford's novel ""The Short Timers"".  The book was a first for the for the marine and military war correspondent who served in the Vietnam war. Early versions of the novel were developed while Hasford was still serving in the war. Many of the novels central characters were named after pals he served with. Kubrick and Hasford had extensive phone conversations (Kubrick's often preferred manor of collaboration) over the script to what would eventually become Full Metal Jacket. A title Kubrick chose due to ""The Short Timers"" lack of mass popularity. Kubricks other collaborator was Michael Herr. Who has previously worked with Francis For Copola on the previously mentioned ""Apocalypse Now"" .",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Full  Hardcore  Crazy War!,"Full Metal Jacket is the third war movie that Kubrik directed and in my opinion is also the best for it shows the madness that is the essence of modern warfare ,in which the valleys of our society are thrown out the widow and are replaced with a system in which the humanity is worthless. I personally like very much for it is a lot of over the top moments, gruesome fights and a great criticism of the War in Vietnam and the war in general.The flick start with the new marines been trained in order to be fit for service. The training as you will see is made in order to kill the civilized and made these young men, killers and spoiler if you don't fit you ain't worth a s**t. The scene steal the nut job sergeant played by the real life sergeant Ronald Lee Ermey ,who is also the sergeant in Toy Story ,true story (:))!The second part of the movie is in Vietnam in which the devastation is more or less a mandating thing and the soldiers there seem to be calm in a alarming level. For Christ sake they sing ""Micky Mouse"" while marching with casualties of war left and right!!! In short the movie shows with a brutal way that human aren't meant to be in War, for in War we go mad and nothing is holy then.In short you should watch, if you haven't already' for it is a landmark of cinema and a blush of flick in general.

Kubrick does it again,"Wow. A War film done by Kubrick is the best. In fact, I was so traumatized by the experience that the next time I went to see it. Then years later, I saw the movie again when I was about 23-years old and I absolutely fell in love. The acting is incredible. The music is something that's stayed with me for years. Although, that's partly because I've watched this movie at least 15 times since I fell in love with it. Great movie with great attempt to SHOW WAR for what it truly is and I absolutely 1000000% recommend it to any war movie fans.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Does this film get you pumped up and hungry for war? Check out my review below to find out!,"""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), I remember when I first saw this movie. It was sometime during my 12th grade war and conflicts class. That was one of my favorite classes that I've ever taken in school, the teacher for that class, as well as my 9th grade social studies class was my favorite teacher of all-time, he's great! Any way, we did a unit on the Vietnam War in that class. Right as we were about to wrap up that unit, my teacher called for a vote from us. We had a choice of whether to take a test on the Vietnam War, or watch ""Full Metal Jacket"". Obviously, the vote was unanimous for watching the film. I'm ecstatic we did, I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way from beginning to end! As some of you know, I'm not that big a fan of war movies. But, ""Full Metal Jacket"" has found an exclusive spot on my top ten all-time favorite war films! Before I wrote this review, I watched it again in order to refresh my memory. Every time I see this movie, it just gets better and better. ""Full Metal Jacket"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is based on the novel, ""The Short-Timers"" by Gustav Hasford, who wrote the screenplay for this film, alongside of Michael Herr and also writer/director Stanley Kubrick. Now, I haven't read the book before. But, if this movie is any indication, I should check it out! Any way, the story is, a platoon of U. S. Marines go through boot camp training, but two of them have issues with their D. I. After that, the squadron is sent overseas to fight in Vietnam. I won't give any extra details about the storyline. But, let me assure you, when you watch it, you will be invested and intrigued all the way through. It's one of the fastest 116 minutes you'll ever spend watching any film. Props to you, Stanley Kubrick! He is one of my top ten all-time favorite directors, and his work here further solidifies that fact. As for the acting, it is stellar from the whole entire cast. They all do fantastic in this movie! But, the top three standout performances come from: Matthew Modine as Private/Sergeant J. T. ""Joker"" Davis, Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence and R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Those three really make this film! But, my favorite performance comes from R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Fun fact: R. Lee Ermey is a former Marine drill instructor. His original job was to be an advisor on the film set, to see that the boot camp scenes were accurate. However, Stanley Kubrick saw potential in R. Lee Ermey, and had him play Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. What a brilliant decision that was! It just goes to show, that some of the best performances can come from people with no formal acting training! He ad-libbed all of his lines and dialogue, which resulted in such a memorable and iconic character portrayal. This film shaped him into the celebrity we know today. Every movie he gets involved with is usually made a lot better if he's in it. But, in my opinion, this is R. Lee Ermey's best role and performance. He knocked it out of the park, and fired on all cylinders! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give this film an amazing atmosphere. The surprising thing about this movie, is that it was hardly filmed on-location. It was actually shot at various places in England! That was a bit of a stretch, but, they really made it genuinely look like Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and Vietnam. Props to the set designers! As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack written by Stanley Kubrick's own daughter, Vivian Kubrick a.k.a. Abigail Mead, is exceptional. Her film score sets the perfect tone for the storyline and helps bring the movie to life. All of the songs are outstanding! But, my personal favorite is, ""Hello Vietnam"" by Johnnie Wright. Whenever I happen to hear that song, it makes me want to watch this film. Plus, it's just a great song in general! The unique thing about the soundtrack in this movie, is that most of it is comprised of music by various bands, rather than being a traditional film score, and it works brilliantly. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is nothing but cinematic gold in the genre of war movies. I could watch it over and over and not get tired of it! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this film, go watch it, especially if you're a fan of the war genre. I guarantee that you'll love it! If you love war movies, then this film is essentially gift-wrapped for you. To wrap up my review, let us all have a moment of silence for the late, but great; Stanley Kubrick and R. Lee Ermey. May they both rest in peace. Any way, go and check out ""Full Metal Jacket"" today. Otherwise, you better be on the lookout for Gunnery Sergeant Hartman!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great war movie. goodbye my darling hello vietnam.,How did full metal jacket not win best picture of 1987. This blew all the other movies of 1987 away. What a great story. Great plot.

Not very original,"When Vietnam is the theme one starts comparing the films with one another. This is a revealing process in storytelling and in character creating. Not everyone is sincere - the trained eye is looking for inconsistencies that betray those who aim to impress while in fact are irrelevant and manipulating. It is not enough to maintain an anti-war stance - personal involvement is required when ideas are expressed and ideals are aimed. There is no doubt there are thousands untold stories about this era but on my knowledge only one film was ambitious enough to look higher, and it was not this one. In this case there is a story to be told but it is not as strong and convincing.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
one of the best Kubrick motion pictures.,"Full Metal Jacket is the next film that Stanley Kubrick Made after he made his MASTERPIECE ""The Shining"" and i could definitely see how he still has his touch from the last masterpiece that he did , the camera angles , the zoom , the effects , the shots , the sounds , the soundtrack , the whole vibe this thing is another Classic of Mr. Stanley Kubrick.The first Half is EXTREMELY good the scenes , the dialogue , the importance of the scenes; I genuinely think that the first half of this film is a 9/10 simply because of how INSANELY good the dialogue and the Character of the Drill sergeant that was AMAZINGLY played by the talented (R. Lee Ermey) he did such a masterful performance in the movie his character was harsh and reminded me of ""Terence Fletcher"" from another masterpiece called ""Whiplash"". What i like about the drill sergeant is he keeps pushing Leonard to his limits and his pushing makes him a better marinethere were some twists and turns here and there that shocked me about some characters and some scenes were VERY well shot by Mr. Stanley Kubrick , the way he handles the camera is magnificent and one of the scenes of the first half actually scared me but it was super good and kinda realistic.The second half of the movie where the marines flee to Vietnam to serve the war and keep the territory and whatnot and they discover more dangers ahead of them and there were some tricks and traps were done by the other side to not let them reach their designated spots.The second half of the movie is not better than the first , simply because the first act of the movie was too good that it made the second half not look so good , but thats simply an illusion , the first half was good and the second half was good it was not bad or terrible by ANY means and whoever says that is not too clever.The final 30 minutes were very good , the visuals were insane , the camera work was super great the whole vibe that was done for some scenes was extremely well done by Mr. Kubrick props to the legend for creating some of the best movies everoverall a very solid Kubrick Motion Picture.8.7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The war from hell and the demon drill sergeant,"Kubrick's dark and unflinching take on the Vietnam War is as hard to stomach as the nature of America's doomed conflict. It's a film split into two halves, with the first undoubtedly the stronger, depicting the dehumanisation of green recruits as they come under the command of a drill sergeant from hell ‚Äì a perfectly cast R. Lee Ermey, who dined out on his performance here for many years to come (and deservedly so). The second and longer half of the film follows the troops as they engage in a bloody and brutal conflict which culminates in a show-stopping climax.The film boasts strong performances, particularly Vincent D'Onofrio as the chubby recruit whose good nature is eroded by his brutal treatment at the hands of both Ermey and his fellow conscripts. Kubrick's style is almost unnoticeable as he delivers a documentary-style movie that focuses on intense dialogue and harsh situations rather than pyrotechnics and explosive battle scenes. While this doesn't add much to the war that we didn't already know about (the '80s was crowded with films like this, PLATOON and HAMBURGER HILL) it proves a strong addition to the director's filmography.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Language,"This is a good action movie, as a former Marine I've watched it a couple of times. Lee Emery the SDI, had the filthiest, gutter, sewer pipe mouth I'd ever heard. I went through Marine Corps boot camp, 1959, Plt. 344, All Colorado platoon. I, and it's been a few years ago, do not ever recall any of our DI's using the F word. They did use a few ""cuss words"" but not just filth for the sake of filth. The routine regarding, ""this is my rifle, this is my gun, etc."" We did have that, our DI's were way to disciplined and respectful to have us running around in our Quonset Hut holding our privates in one hand. Some may remember 3rdBn. at San Diego, were berthed in quonset huts just across from the confidence course, 1st and 2nd in hotels next to the grinder. There has always been a bit of a ""tiff"" among the Hollywood Marines and those at PI. The only difference I seen or found out later when I went to Camp Lejeune after boot camp, was the humidity and swamps in that part of the country. Being a native of Colorado, I'd never experience such high humidity, and it takes some getting used to. A DI's a DI, East or West coast.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Quintessential Kubrick, much better than ""Platoon""","This film is primarily about the dual nature of man: the primal instinct to be destructive and nihilistic versus the social instinct to desire peace. The destructive and creative forces of man pitted against each other is a theme common to many of Kubrick's films particularly ""A Clockwork Orange"". I rank this film above the grossly overrated ""Platoon"" simply because Kubrick says more about war than the trite cliche of 'war is hell'. Many people criticized Kubrick for opting to shoot the film on a sound stage in England. This issue is irrelevant to the message and content of the film. Kubrick dodged the typical depictions of the Vietnam war such as the drug use and the jungle warfare. Kubrick chose to focus on the city patrols. Matthew Modine is brilliant as the confused hero certainly more interesting and convincing than CHARLIE SHEEN in ""Platoon"". Most notable is the brilliant use of music in the film as well as the stellar camera work typical to all Kubrick epics. Lee Ermey is amazingly realistic  as the hard drill sergeant. See this Vietnam film and this one only. Unless of course you want to rent ""Platoon"" and ""The Green Berets"" and cry your eyes out with laughter.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

My 2nd Favorite War Movie of All Time,"Full Metal Jacket is my favorite Stanley Kubrick movie of all time, and it's my 2nd favorite war movie of all time.This movie is about Private ""Joker"" Davis (played by Matthew Modine) who is going through basic training and is suffering through insults from his foul mouthed drill sarge, Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and helps a guy named Private ""Pyle"" Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) get through basic training. Pyle takes a pretty bad detour, and Joker is graduating to the Marine Corps and is sent to Vietnam, where he joins the Battle of Hu√©.Full Metal Jacket was a masterpiece and a great war film. It had an awesome story, the acting was fantastic, the war elements were amazing, and it ran in a fast pace.R. Lee Ermey, did a great job in this movie. Not only does he get to be humorous, but he does a great job at playing a legit drill sergeant. Vincent D'Onofrio was pretty good at playing Private Pyle, as he turned psycho later on, and Modine was great as the lead character.The war elements were also phenomenal. With all the gun action, explosions, and violence, they really did a solid job giving this film some good war spirit.Over all, I love Full Metal Jacket and is definitely the 2nd best war movie I have ever seen right next to ""Saving Private Ryan.I give this movie a perfect 10 out of 10 and I highly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The last of a dying breed?,"This is not an epic movie. There are no heroes, no legendary feats in this movie, it's no band of brothers, it's a Kubrick film. And it's a fantastic one. Kubrick never did in complex scenarios, the plot in this movie, is simple, a group young Americans being trained to join the marines forms the first part, which to me is the main one. You can see Kubrick's work at its best in that first part. Seargeant Instructor Hartman, what a character! He is in your face from the first minute of the film, and those scenes at the camp were wonderfully shot. Close ups to bank on actors' performances and add intensity to the scenes, and intense they were. The humiliating and degrading treatment imposed by the Sergeant Instructor to the whole group, especially to Pvt Pyle, is frightening. The star performer in that first part to me has got to be Pvt Pyle. The scenes are shot in a succession of defining events, so that your eyes are scotched to the screen.The second part takes place in Vietnam, a Vietnam ravaged by war. Now I have to admit here that there have been better war movies shot in the heat of battle if you are looking for spectacular, rapid, grandiose fighting. Apocalypse Now would be a superb example. But here Kubrick, offers a more intimate view of fighting and always keeps it simple but pleasing on the eye. Many will say that the first part is of higher quality than the second, it could be true. But I think that the second part had to be shot in this way, nothing too over the top, a plot so simple and intense, so that it is difficult to forget. Do you remember most of the scenes in saving private ryan? No matter how much you prepare for war, how well trained you are, you can never be ready for the real thing. At the camp, the guys were subjected to the worst kind of treatment and yet in Vietnam, the war is a different proposition. Each war is different, the Vietnam war was not the same as the second world war when you knew what you were fighting for. It is certainly different to what is going on right now. But the films treating the subject of Vietnam war will be rarer and rarer, Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket are the best three films on Vietnam war. Therefore, Kubrick's work here should be a collector's item even if as an adrenaline junky, you could see better war films.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Much more than just a war movie, Kubrick nailed it!","Full Metal Jacket begins with perhaps the most enjoyable forty-five minutes in the history of all film. FMJ is one of my all time favorite movies by one of my favorite directors. This movies is just another staple in Kubrick's more than impressive film career. Unlike Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan, FMJ takes a look into a soldiers Psyche. It shows us how these guys actually went through hell to become Marines and how they are put under so much stress and pressure. Its more about their journey into the war than the war itself and that's what makes this movie stand out. Just an incredible film that is sure a classic. The totality of war, from the loss of self to ultimately the loss of life, has never been as thoroughly examined as in Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Its not only about of what does a soldier lives on the battle field is also all the process it take to become a man a killing machine, an excellent psychological movie that show you other side of the war stories.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unforgettable sights & smells,"No matter how well a movie is made, there are certain things that I remember about Viet Nam that can never be brought to the people that have never been in war. All the war movies that I watched or all the training in Boot camp never prepared me for the fact that very few of the people, both us and them, that were killed in the jungle, were recovered in a timely fashion. The dead were left to rot until hostilities stopped. This usually was a long time, and the memories of what they looked liked and the smell, will never be forgotten. This to me brought home the real horror of what we where doing to them, and what they did to us. There are more descriptive memories I could write here, but this isn't the place.S.J.

"In ""Full Metal Jacket,"" Stanley Kubrick throws terror upon us with a shovel","In terms of an ostensible plot outline, ""Full Metal Jacket"" appears to be much like any other period piece set in any war. As a matter of fact, the way that director Stanley Kubrick has constructed his story, it almost seems familiar and routine. It starts us with a collection of mug shots as new Marine recruits are shaved and prepared for basic training, takes us through their grueling preparations for war, and leads us into one of the most harrowing denouements of all time, in which many of those faces we saw at the beginning can no longer be found. But it is not the originality of this story that makes ""Full Metal Jacket"" so great (because it is not original in its plot), it is the sheer harrowing and gut-wrenching plethora of style and nihilism that Kubrick instills into its content.Right from the beginning, Kubrick alerts us that we are not in for a pleasant experience. Even though he creates images that rival the majesty of his 1968 masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" this movie does not leave you wrapped in spectacle, but in sheer horror. Watching our cast having their heads shaved with mask-like expressions devoid of happiness hints to us that it'll get worse for them. And it does. The basic training scenes, which consume half the picture with R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio dominating every frame, are grueling and heart-pounding as we watch these young and naive men be transformed into cold-blooded, deranged killers, some of whom are struggling to maintain their humanity, and others who will lose it entirely.For the back half of the movie, Kubrick almost seems to give us relief at first, by avoiding combat. Then he not only gives us it, but throws it upon us with one of the most shocking third-acts in cinema history. The climax becomes a mixture of three different war movie traditions. Number one, the gungho joy of killing best personified in black-and-white war serials. Number two, the fear of being killed in combat. And three, the traumatizing aftereffects of experiencing the first two. Anybody who does not find the ending of ""Full Metal Jacket"" haunting should sit down and think about their own morality. Kubrick has haunted us before with the terrors of HAL 9000 in ""2001"" and the Singin' in the Rain sequences in ""A Clockwork Orange."" Here, he piles terror on us with shovels.The movie is crammed with fantastic performances. R. Lee Ermey, once a Marine himself and in fact initially hired only as a consultant, is hands-down visceral and brilliant as the drill sergeant determined to turn his recruits into mechanical killers like their own rifles. Matthew Modine is commendably convincing as the baby-faced Marine who would rather write about Vietnam than experience it. The other two most notable performances are by Adam Baldwin and Vincent D'Onofrio, who are first-class examples of what war and combat do to people.""Full Metal Jacket"" is just as great as any film made about any other war. In the category of the Vietnam War genre, it ranks up with ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" and is probably the second-best of the four. Kubrick may have been telling an ostensibly familiar story, but the way he constructs it and manipulates our responses makes it idiosyncratic and towering above its familiars. It is one of the two best films he ever directed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I gotta say it's the first part was amazing though, I've never watched a movie like this, where the first half is awesome and then after that it's an unbelievably terrible, boring and pretentious. Long scenes where nothing happens and boring dialogue after boring dialogue. Movie would've been amazing if it stuck with the mood of the first part.

Those who are 'honest', Pyle cannot live with that and flips.Then how these 'super soldiers' actually perform in real war. Well, they talk ' the talk' but as it shows, 'they really can't walk the walk'. The battle scenes, soldiers talking to the camera, and the final scene is all an indication of that.In this movie Kubrick is at his best, poking fun at US army and its culture. and also American machismo male stereotype and their utter ignorance of the rest of the world.With Iraq a hot issue today, this movie resonates more then ever.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Tale of Two Movies,"Stanley Kubrick is hit or miss with me and this one is a hit. The 1st half of the movie when they are in basic training is an easy 10 stars but once the movie transitions to the Vietnam War itself, it falls flat at times.The movie is a quote machine especially from R. Lee Ermey's iconic drill sergeant character with stuff like:""Your ass looks like 150 pounds of chewed up bubble gum""""5'9""??? I didn't know they stacked sh!# that high""""Give your heart to Jesus but your asses belong to the Marine Corp""But the quote that would be his demise was the infamous ""What is your major malfunction numbnuts?""The rest of the film is following Private joker as he photographs the war.

Male bonding in the highest form,"The star of this movie is the drill instructor (D.I.) for the boot camp attended by the group of men that signed up for the United States Marine Corps. He is always verbally and occasionally physically savage to the men as he pulls apart their feelings and turns them into automatons that are at one with their rifles. It is interesting that Lee Erney, the man that played the D.I., was in fact a drill instructor during the Vietnam War and much of his dialog was ad lib. When the men are in boot camp, there are times when you empathize with them.
The war action is just as gritty, the last section of the movie is set in the Vietnamese city of Hue during the Tet Offensive when it was overrun by the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong. The set is so real that once I was done watching the movie, I went to a search engine to find out where the scenes were shot. I have watched actual footage of the battle for Hue and the reality is uncanny.
The story follows a group of young men that join the Marines and proceed through boot camp before being sent to Vietnam to fill various roles. After some time in country, a few of them are reunited in the battle for Hue. Despite their now brutal personalities, they show tenderness towards each other as only fellow soldiers in battle can.

It is, at times, genuinely shocking and the viewer gets very close to a particular group of rookies.The second half follows the same group as they enter the theatre of war. Unfortunately, all the combat action appears to take place on one, large, deserted industrial estate, with a few palm trees thrown in to try to create a sort of jungly feel to the action. The intimacy built up in the first half largely dissipates as clich√©d action scenes draw the film to a close.Despite this, I would recommend this film for the power of the first half alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of my top ten,"This movie is great. Great story, great acting and a lot of memorable scenes. You know a movie is good if you here quotes from it on a regular basis from people who probably don't even know where the saying came from (ie the younger generations).I love how it takes you from boot camp to the war and lets the viewer experience every aspect of the Vietnam war. It was a gritty time and the movie pulls no punches: if you are creating killing machines you have to be tough. Unlike todays army that is volunteer, most were there not by choice and the basic training scenes show the deconstruction of a boy and the construction of a soldier.The war scenes show these newly minted soldiers struggling to maintain their human element. We watch as the try and find balance between taking lives and knowing they will have to live theirs upon return.Many of these actors went on to play other great roles and I can't help but think it was due to their involvement with Full Metal Jacket.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Separates itself from many war dramas,"In what is probably the greatest war movie ever made, we follow an everyman, Private Joker (Matthew Modine), as he struggles through the torture of late-sixties boot camp, the boredom of life as a combat correspondent in Vietnam, and finally as a fighting soldier during the 1968 Tet Offensive. This gritty, uncompromising drama shocked many for its brutality, most notably Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as an ""oat-fed innocent"" private slowly transformed to a psychotic sniper with a death wish. R. Lee Ermey's unrelenting drill instructor is flawless and chillingly real, Modine is great as the cynical Joker, as is Adam Baldwin's portrayal of ""Animal Mother."" Dour and frightening characters all around. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is definitely the defining war movie because of what it does not attempt to be...cliched heroics and glory speeches (like other war epics ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""The Green Beret"").

One of the best military movies ever made,"The most 're-watchable' movie that Kubrick ever made. It was also the least Kubrick-y movie that he made, in other words it does not have the signature color scenes, strange lighting, ultra odd characters or strange story twists.This movie made the career of Ron Ermey, he has so many on liner insults in this movie that you could fill a book with them. He fit the part so perfectly because he spent over 10 years in the Marine Corps. In fact this movie has been so watched that a true fan can mouth along with most of the insults. Ermey's part in this movie has made him immortal, he will be forever linked to this movie.The supporting cast was also excellent, this movie showed the rise of excellent actors such as Matthew Modine and especially Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio's part as Private Pyle should have won an Oscar, he nailed the part as a mentally challenged cadet that twisted to the dark side.This movie got snubbed at the Oscars, one factor could be that it was so dark and negative that many people were put off. Another thing was that 78 was the same year that The last emperor and Fatal attraction came out.The only reason this movie is not a perfect 10 is because of the non-climactic ending.

"You Have Got To Be Kidding Me, Pyle!","Full Metal Jacket works a lot better when it's much more subtle.  For example, the ""preparation"" for war via boot camp is so haunting, it makes the actual war look weaker by comparison.  The boot camp sequence is a ripe slice of hell, and the war is not really scary, but kind of goofy.  Does Kubrick see Vietnam as untidy?  I'm no historian but I think forests and humidity had to do with Vietnam.  All in all, this film is still really good, and should be watched by anyone interested in war movies.  As with Kubrick's other movies, the film is moody and introspective, and the boot camp sequence is ickier than other war movie sequences.  In my opinion, after the boot camp sequence, I though that Kubrick ran out of things to do. Rating: 7/10 (Kubrick's dead?  Somebody should tell him!)",,Anonymous,Drama
"Shocking to see the material, but is it really entertaining? **1/2 (out of four)","FULL METAL JACKET / (1987) **1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:With Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" you get two masterfully constructed movies for the price of one-a movie about boot camp and a movie about Vietnam. Unfortunately, under most circumstances, neither film is worth viewing.It's shocking to watch the risks Kubrick takes with this material. From the opening shots, against a soundtrack featuring ""Goodbye Dolly, Hello Vietnam,"" images flash before our eyes of marine recruits getting their heads shaven clean for training camp. Cut to a rude, obnoxious, drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey), shouting curses at these young recruits as he passes down the double aisle of bunks at a basic training camp in Paris Island. ""From now on you'll speak only when spoken to, the first and last words out of your mouth will be sir!"" In this segment, we witness the agonizing training sessions and dills that these poor young men must conquer. Most of them do a fine job. All except for a moronic, uncoordinated maggot nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). The personalities of Hartman and Pyle clash like water and oil, or more like fire and propane.Little dialogue exists with in this personality conflict, but there sure is a hell of a lot of screaming and shouting of disgusting insults. I wanted relief from the Sergeant's nonstop obscenity and discrimination. Lee Ermey does wonderful things with his character, but the character is repulsive. He gave me a headache to the extent that I had to turn the movie off momentarily and walk outside to clear my mind and take a few deep breaths of fresh air.Considering a lot of Ermey's dialogue was improvised, I admire phrases like these. This kind of dialogue is great if you're looking for a hard-edged, realistic look at military training camps. But play that same kind of tone and dialogue for over forty-five minutes, then is it really entertaining? Engaging? If you answer yes, then I have just learned things about you I did not want to know.The second segment of ""Full Metal Jacket"" takes off when the trained military troops arrive in Vietnam. The movie then disintegrates into a series of detached, self contained war sequences. Most war movies, regardless of how disturbing or graphic, secure at least some rank within my emotions. ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" and even ""Tigerland"" captured my heart in very different ways, but this movie feels detached to all humanity and spirit. There is nothing harrowing about scene after scene of hopeless characters getting shot to hell if we don't feel for those characters. Kubrick eliminates his only two interesting characters in the first segment, leaving his second segment to shrivel and die.Although I disliked the film, I admire many things about ""Full Metal Jacket."" The film's serious attitude towards its subjects. Kubrick's ironic message that people produce killers, and that killers are not born, reverses his own stance as seen in ""A Clockwork Orange."" Kubrick's style also shows through; the film's finale holds true to his sardonic sense of theme and moralization. The two films also comment on each other. I never knew the phrase ""I am in a world of shit,"" could carry so much impact and meaning. I also liked how Kubrick refrained from glamorizing any aspects of the film. In several juicy sequences, there were distinctive possibilities of sex. While there is sex in the film, Kubrick avoids portraying sex on screen. I think he did this to evade a potential attraction and distraction to the audience.Stanley Kubrick was one of the most vivid, courageous directors that will ever live. He was a perfectionist, always creating a true portrait of his visions. He took risks. Some of them worked, some of them did not. ""Full Metal Jacket"" displays a stunning quality of filmmaking; it was nominated for an Oscar for its achievement in screen writing. But the movie fails to actually entertain and enlighten. I was disappointed in the film. Many audiences will remember Kubrick's portrait of Vietnam as a film that defined a generation, but it's too bad that the film didn't do it entertainingly.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Doesn't Compare To His Other Work,"As if he hadn't torched the military infrastructure enough in Paths of Glory and Doctor Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick returned to make another scathing film about war, this time set in the Vietnam War. Actually this film is set in two different places with one half taking place in the Marine Recruit Training. While there isn't as much shooting or killing, Kubrick still uses it as a means to display the dehumanizing nature of the military. It follows two characters primarily, one being the closest thing to a protagonist who the picture later follows through Vietnam and the other is the utterly incapable Pyle. The segment mainly shows how Pyle is grinded down by the demanding Drill Sargeant-played unforgettably by R Lee Emery-until he eventually snaps and kills him and himself. Where the storyline ends and the new one in Vietnam commences, but the same critical themes run unremitting. Though he may not be entirely wrong Kubrick's views are still fairly one sided and fail to see things from more than one angle.All politics aside this is also objectively one of his weaker films in terms of sheer quality. It lacks much of the intellect and artistry of some of his other films like Barry Lyndon and Doctor Strangelove as well as the entertainment value of Spartacus or The Shining. It's also rather blase for such a groundbreaking and visionary filmmaker as Stanley Kubrick. Not to mention Full Metal Jacket also failed to achieve its goal to an extent. The film was meant to disenfranchise people to military yet some viewers felt just the opposite-perhaps that's what Stanley was telling us?",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
"We might have just found something you're great at, Private!","Full Metal Jacket is undoubtedly the finest war film I have ever seen. Startlingly authentic and deeply intimate, the film is carried by a sharp screenplay, spectacular direction and some bravos performances. Though the film does have central characters, the main character here is the war itself and the story of recruit to hero. Some may argue that Matthew Modine's Private Joker should have been a more developed character, but I would argue he was given just the right amount of depth.The first 45 minutes - the story of Staff Sergeant Hartman and Private Pyle - is a flawless masterpiece. A combination of Hartman's spectacular one-liners, delivered with such flawless execution, and Vincent D'Onofrio's Oscar-worthy and woefully under shadowed performance, for the entire first act of the film I was captivated. The drills are real, the characters are real, and the mental anguish of Gomer Pyle is very real. The film dips very slightly when we go to Vietnam, as it misses any characters with the memorability of Pyle and Hartman. However, the film's superb screenplay and frighteningly staged battle scenes - superior in feel if not quality to every other war film I've seen - more than keep you engrossed.Kubrick's direction is masterful. There are moments throughout - tracking shots, behavioural quirks of minor characters, the dialogue of a dying Vietnamese, the hiring of R Lee Ermey - that scream ""master of his field"". In one scene, a lieutenant is asked about casualties as he stands next to a war grave. Clearly unaware of what to do, he constantly stops and smiles for the camera, a horrific juxtaposition given the horror just behind him. It is moments like this where Kubrick is to be considered in the conversation for Best Director of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Full Lethal Kubrick,"For me among the most terrific war movies ever made and of course also the best concerning Vietnam War; but it could have concerned any war actually. The first part, boot camp at Camp Pendleton, I guess, is the most impressive, the most terrific, the most unforgettable sequence ever filmed on boot camps; forget TAKE THE HIGH GROUND once and for all as the reference movie on boot camps. Vincent Donofrio gives here his best performance ever, for such a rather blank, wooden actor. It is s a shocking film, but it was the purpose, decided by the master, the unique Stanley Kubrick, the genius, whose heirs are now Christopher Nolan or Denis Villeneuve. Of course there is always Steven and Ridley, but they were already in action when Kubrick was himself still in the business. So, yes, this awsome, brutal, disturbing war movie is a milestone that no moviegoer can miss. No one.",,Anonymous,Drama
"""We've got to try and keep our heads until this peace craze blows over""","The major Vietnam anti-war films all took different approaches to the subject. Apocalypse Now cranked the war experience up into a surrealist nightmare. The Deer Hunter avoided dwelling on the conflict itself and instead focused on the psychological aftermath. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, made at a later time when the Vietnam was coming to be regarded as the previous generation's war, focuses on the transformation of men into soldiers.Like most of Kubrick's films, Full Metal Jacket is divided starkly into informal parts 1 and 2. Opening with shots of the recruits having their head shaved (their individuality literally being stripped away), part 1 looks at the training process. Kubrick emphasises the gruelling nature of this process with drab, Spartan sets, straight, symmetrical shot composition and scenes which are relentless and repetitive. It's the stronger half of the film ¬ñ part 2 just isn't as tight, and despite it's being more varied some segments are just boring.Compared to other Vietnam pictures, Full Metal Jacket has a rather small-scale, cheap look to it. This was the price Kubrick paid for his artistic independence. Having said that, it's impressive that the whole thing was shot in England (aided by one use of footage) and it demonstrates how much an imaginative director and design department can do with limited means. Take, for example, an abandoned industrial estate (of which England has had plenty of since the 1980s), remove anything that gives the location away, graft in a few palm trees, slap on some genuine signs and murals ¬ñ and you have an authentic looking Vietnam battleground.Full Metal Jacket isn't bad, but there are lots of things I don't like about it. Most of them are down to the screenplay. The dialogue isn't as smart as it thinks it is, full of philosophical pretensions and trite moralism. Kubrick makes some poor decisions as a director too. The over-the-top stylisation of Pyle's mental breakdown ¬ñ brilliantly staged as it is ¬ñ doesn't sit well with the realist, occasionally documentary approach used in the majority of the film. Later, in the combat scenes, he uses some really clich√©d slow motion shots when people get shot. Peckinpah popularised that, and he's also one of the few directors who could get away with it. Here it just looks amateurish.This is yet another Kubrick film which all too often gets overrated because it is startling and different. It has its strengths (there is some great use of music, although even that is disappointing compared to Kubrick's sublime rhythmic direction on Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon) but overall it's one of my least favourite of his.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not quite the full picture,"Stanley Kubrick, the eccentric director is lionised by Hollywood. A man who spent the latter part of his life living in London and shooting his films in England despite them being set elsewhere whether it was outer space, some hotel in the mountains of America or in this case a Vietnam war film.Full Metal Jacket arrived with plaudits from the critics. It is a film of two halves, the more interesting part being the first half set at boot camp with a sadistic drill instructor.The second half which is more action orientated, set in Vietnam is less interesting. Why? Because a year earlier we all watched 'Platoon' which swept the big prizes at the Oscars and directed by someone who served in Vietnam.Platoon fully conveyed the anti war message and politics of it all now that some years have passed by since the war ended.The Vietnam films were done better in Platoon and Apocalypse Now. Also these films were at least filmed in a far east location whether it would be the Philippines or Thailand.Full Metal Jacket was filmed in various parts of London dressed up as Vietnam.

The duality of mankind.,"I have only find one fault in this truly brilliant War Movie (by the maestro himself) Stanley Kubrick but thankfully it does not detract form the magnificence of both the acting performances and the tightest, most thrilling Direction. On one hand the part of Private Pile does not make too much sense, as I very much doubt someone so unsuitable and out of shape would ever be selected for the most torrid and physically demanding training to become a U.S Marine. Though stating this obvious plot ploy, he's also the most important character in the film. Rather than the construction of an elite fighting force, it simultaneously concerns the ultimate, deconstruction of any type of humanity (they once had). Lee Ermey (a real life drill instructor) is a real shock to the system and the rest of the cast is certainly up to the task. Also contains some highly realistic battle action, filmed in the Docklands (East London) and with a mind jolting ending scene, that will have you riveted to your chair! Terror, disbelief and the chilling horror of 'Nam'. The musical score with the collection of songs and creepy synth music is pretty much unrivaled.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""war is hell""","WARNING: this review may contain spoilersFull Metal Jacket is by far one of my favorite war movies. This movie, in my opinion is very much anti-war. Upon entering boot camp, the soldiers are still normal in the sense that they have not been stripped of their individuality. However,as we see with Sgt. Hartman's statements like, ""You're not even human f-ing beings"" and ""you are all equally worthless,"" the marines are not made up of a group of individuals: they are a part of a mean, lean, fighting machine.To become a part of this machine, the soldier has to be dehumanized. As we see in the film, the soldiers are subject to strict, systematic instruction that is supposed to bring about a methodical obedience. In this context, even the most harmless of men can become ruthless killers. This says a lot about human nature in general: we use violence to survive, or obtain peace and security. While this may be the ultimate goal and purpose of the military and war, Full Metal Jacket does a great job at painting a very different picture.The soldiers leave boot camp ready to fight and kill. Raptor Man complains about not having to shoot his gun at all after 2 years of being in Vietnam. Other soldiers boast about how many kills they have had. It becomes clear that these soldiers are not fighting for honor, liberty, or whatever we are told by our government (at least in this context). They are doing what they are trained to do (or, as the logo says on Joker's helmet, ""Born to Kill""). They are trained to kill the enemy, and all Vietnamese are seen as the enemy. The Vietnamese are not seen as human beings, which is made apparent when the soldier in the helicopter shoots at innocent civilians. While I realize this is not the case for every soldier, it does coincide with the whole idea of ""war is hell."" This is the picture Stanley Kubrick is trying to paint for us: war is hell, seemingly normal men are capable of committing atrocities against other human beings, and this is all in the name of¬Ö¬Ö¬Öwhat?I give this movie 10 out of 10.

The madness of war,"Unlike many other (Vietnam)war movies, the movie focuses in my opinion on the madness of man instead of the madness of war.The first half shows how the soldiers are being dehumanized during their military training by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a legendary and already classic role by R. Lee Ermey. The second half shows the madness of man in a war situation. Both of the halves are good and in a way can be seen as a movie alone but for some reason the two halves don't really flow into each other, which is my only real complaint I have about this fantastic and most certainly unique movie. Then the eternal question of which half is the better one? I'm one of the few who actually like the second half more as the first but that is just only personal and different for everyone.It's strange that the Vietnam battlefield looks more like a WWII European battlefield but I'm sure Kubrick had his reasons for it. Kubrick also manages to put many other weird and unique situations in the movie, which makes this movie truly an unusual viewing experience that shall leave quite an impression on you. Only a brilliant man such as Stanley Kubrick can come up with these kind of scene's.Despite the oddness level of the movie, the movie still manages to also impress the more casual viewer. The battle sequences are made with lot's of profession and with some beautiful cinematography and great use of music.The characters are good and typical Kubrick like.

Kubrick's War.,"Full Metal Jacket (1987)Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, R. Lee Ermey, Arliss Howard, Adam Baldwin, Dorian Harewood.There is one scene in 'Full Metal Jacket' that I want to talk about first. It is the scene near the very beginning with Leonard Lawrence and Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Lawrence thinks that Hartman is very funny, but as the film goes on, he starts to hate him more and more.'Full Metal Jacket' is really a different type of war film. It doesn't deal with war battles between Vietnam and America, but battles against ourselves. I don't mean like gun battles, I mean the way that we might feel when we see this film, we realize that we basically fought each other.Soldiers are trained by a mean drill instructor to begin killers, then you actually witness them doing it. The film is divided into two halves. The first half revolves mostly around Pvt. Joker, Pvt. Lawrence (Gomer Pyle), and Drill Instructor Hartman. The soldiers go through training at a South Carolina Marine Corps camp. Joker is the second leader in the group, and Pyle is ranked lower in the platoon because Hartman dislikes him and believes that he cannot do anything. Pyle doesn't have any friends on the squad and only is good at one thing, combat training.The second half is set in Vietnam. It revolves around Joker, Animal Mother, Eightball, and Cowboy, one of Joker's old buddies from training. They go off to fight as gunmen in the war, but also must save their fellow soldiers. Joker believes that war is a living hell, but at the same time, he believes that after fighting there will soon be peace.'Full Metal Jacket' probably isn't the best war film ever made, but it is a great film. It has a good story, another brilliant direction by Stanley Kubrick, and interesting characters. The acting in the movie is just almost perfect. Lee Ermey gives his best and very memorable performance as Sgt. Hartman, mostly because he was a drill instructor in real life. Modine and D'Onofrio were also very good. Dorian Harewood and Adam Baldwin deliver clever lines, and are interesting characters. There are much humor in the film, and it actually is funny. Some of Ermey's line are very clever. It's interesting how he they thought up all of his lines.At times, the film doesn't really fit together. It shows some unrelated material to the story. It loses its pace near the beginning of the second half, but recovers a little later in the movie. Joker's (Modine) narration throughout the movie goes no where. It's horribly told. I'm not saying that Modine was a bad actor, because he wasn't, but the narration sounds like he read it off of flashcards. The first scene that I mentioned really made feel bad for Pvt. Pyle, and it got worse later in the film. Pyle seems like he is Hartman's main victim, mostly because he seems worthless.'Full Metal Jacket' is a really good movie and almost a classic. I don't know how it could have been better, but it is fine the way it is. It is one of the best from Kubrick, and is underrated by some people, but is loved by others. Overall the first half is one of the most effective pieces of film I've ever seen, whereas the second is more or less just good. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great Vietnam Film,"FULL METAL JACKET was a great movie when it came out, and it has only gotten better with age. Everyone has their own opinions about Vietnam and the war there, but none of that matters here. It's just a gruesome look at one man's struggle to survive.The movie is violent, it is bloody, and it is great fun. There are many wonderful moments and tons of quotable lines. I understand that not everyone liked this movie when it first came out, but I would find it hard to believe that people still feel that way all these decades later. It's great!

Kubrick is a GOD!!!,"Full Metal Jacket is the best war movie ever. Full Metal Jacket shows us how army can destroy people's minds. It starts in a military base where men are trained to become marines for the Viet-Nam war. One man, who is a bit fat, is hated by the colonel, who beats him and who discovers a donut in his box. He makes the others hate the guy and one night, the others (including Joker, his friend)beat him up. He is sad and then decides to get better in the marine training...and it works, but he then kills the colonel and himself...Then they go to the war and many things happen...this is a psychological film, more human than The Thin Red Line, and more dramatic than Saving Private Ryan. The actors were excellent too, but it seemed like the film was incomplete. Kubrick is the master, a god!!! See this film at all costs! I give it 89%.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Full Metal Jacket - Great first act, disappointing second","In Stanley Kubrick's second-to-last film, Full Metal Jacket, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) tells an account of what happened to him in Vietnam. The film starts off in a boot camp. Private Joker, along with many other men are forced to follow extremely strict orders by Gunnery Seargeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). We see how the men are brainwashed into making them emotionally ready for battle. They are screamed at by the Seargeant that they are worthless, punished for the most minor mistake, etc. We meet one of the men, Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), who is the less physically active man who just can't get anything right. He is continuously harassed by the Seargeant, being completely humiliated all the time by the Seargeant and the other men.In the boot camp, we mostly see the mentality that the army wanted the soldiers to have. The yelling of ""I am a killer."" shows how these normal men have become something completely different than when they first came in.After the first half in the boot camp, Private Joker is assigned to be a journalist. For me, that was the point where everything turned into an average film. Many soldiers tell their views about the war, they are now desensitized to the killing of Viatmese soldiers, sometimes even civilians. The conclusion of the movie is quite surprising but they should have added more in my opinion.For the technical aspects, the direction was fine. Just fine, not excellent, extraordinary or great, I found it just a bit above average. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Kubrick, I have A Clockwork Orange and 2001 : A Space Odyssey in my top 20 but I didn't feel any genius or brilliance in Full Metal Jacket unlike the movies that I just named. The acting was decent but Vincent D'Onofrio played his character quite well, a very memorable and creepy performance.In the first half of the movie, I really enjoyed the character development of all the men in the boot camp. It was very good, it really made the viewer think. After we first go to Vietnam, the movie turned into an average war film. To me, nothing really stood out, the quality of the movie suddenly dropped. It wasn't bad, no, it just didn't feel like a Kubrick picture or a ""great"" film.Overall, I would still recommend this movie. I was disappointed but there is still a lot of good in it. Much more good than bad by far but I just don't see how it became to be considered as one of the best war movies of all-time.My rating : 7.5/10 - almost an 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Boot Camp Brilliance, Familiar Frontlines","The movie opens with an intense portrayal of Marine boot camp, where we follow a group of recruits under the brutal command of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, played with relentless vigor by R. Lee Ermey. This part of the film is an exceptional display of Kubrick's directorial prowess, offering a gripping look at the dehumanizing process of turning young men into soldiers.The boot camp sequence stands out for its raw intensity and dark humor. The performances are outstanding, particularly Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Pyle, whose tragic arc is both heartbreaking and haunting. The relentless drill sergeant and the transformation of the recruits are captivating, making this segment one of the most memorable in war film history. It's a masterclass in tension and character development, leaving me thoroughly engaged and invested in the characters' fates.However, as the film transitions to the Vietnam War frontlines in its second half, it loses some of the initial impact. The narrative becomes more familiar, with scenes that feel like they echo other Vietnam War movies. The pacing slows, and the film starts to feel like a standard war story rather than the unique experience promised at the beginning.Despite this, the film redeems itself with the climactic sniper sequence towards the end. The tension and suspense in this scene are palpable,
The cinematography throughout the film is impeccable, capturing both the harshness of the boot camp and the chaos of the battlefield. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of 1960s hits, adds an ironic contrast to the violence and chaos, enhancing the film's impact.In conclusion, this is a film of two halves, with the first half offering an unparalleled depiction of military indoctrination and the second half presenting a more conventional war narrative. While the latter part doesn't quite match the brilliance of the opening, it still provides moments of tension and drama, particularly in the sniper showdown.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Two movies in one,"I really like the way that the Late Stanley Kubrick gives us several movies in one. He did it with 2001 and he's done it again with Full metal Jacket. This really is the hallmark of a great Director...Part One runs for the first 40 minutes of the movie and is set in the USMC Recruiting Depot in South Carolina. It deals with basic training, where Gunnery Sargeant Hartman teaches men to love their rifles: to sleep with them and give them a girl's name. The whole training routine is dehumanising, and Private Pyle cracks under the pressure. This was the most interesting part of the movie for me, focusing on the psychology of war.Part Two is set in Vietnam and deals with the politics of war, the nightmare of combat in the field, and the impact on the local people.The dialogue is spiked with scathing humour, but this is a dark movie which doesn't avoid harsh realities, and it seems appropriate when the end credits roll over a black screen and The Stones sing 'Paint it Black'.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A pathetic movie for the American audience,"VERY SLIGHT SPOILERS HERESorry, guys, to write that, but I just don't like this film. Not even a bit. It got the 3/10 from me just because I'm aware of the existence of Titanic.Many of you write this film is authentic, blablabla... I'm pretty sure none of you has ever been in a training camp or in a war (neither I have). So how do you know? Well, I know it wasn't authentic. Consider the scene with the trainee in the camp having hard time climbing over the hurdle. Well, a funny scene, wasn't it? Just like an one from Police Academy. (BTW, I prefer Police Academy to Full Meta Jacket, when I want to see a comedy.) All the jokes (or at least half of them) make this film sentimental and the ""serious"" war scenes pathetic. Oh, yes, the war scenes... I really liked the authenticity of burning concrete. Have you ever seen burning concrete with flames in equal distances from each other? If not, watch the film, this is your opportunity! But the scene which really got me was when the marines went to save their dying/dead friend, undergoing a certain death and violating the orders. Well, if this is how American soldiers behave, then there's no wonder they didn't win the Vietnam war.Some of you say the strength of this film is in describing the violence. Well, I felt completely untouched. I'm not an American spectator, crying when the marines lose their brother in the war. If you want to see violence that makes you want to vomit and have bad dreams, you should see ""Salo"" from Pasolini - film without a single drop of blood (as far as I remember).Alright, all in all I think this movie is far away from authenticity, it has been shot for the American (male) audience and I don't like it. The last remark - people write that Full Metal Jacket is an epic film. No, it isn't. Why should it be? If you want to see a great epic film from Kubrick, watch 2001: The Space Odyssey.

Best movie ever!,"""Full Metal Jacket,"" stands as a cinematic triumph that skillfully navigates the grim realities of war with both raw intensity and profound insight. The film, divided into two compelling acts, seamlessly weaves together a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is visually arresting.The first half of the movie is a tour de force in itself, immersing viewers in the relentless crucible of Marine Corps boot camp. R. Lee Ermey's portrayal of the unyielding drill instructor is nothing short of iconic, delivering a performance that is both terrifying and captivating. Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail in depicting the rigorous training process not only adds authenticity but also sets the stage for the emotional journey that follows.As the narrative transitions to the harsh landscapes of the Vietnam War, ""Full Metal Jacket"" continues to excel in its portrayal of the psychological toll of combat. The film follows Private Joker, portrayed with nuance by Matthew Modine, as he evolves from a wide-eyed recruit to a war correspondent. The transformation of the characters serves as a poignant commentary on the dehumanizing effects of war, prompting reflection on the profound impact it has on those who experience it.Kubrick's masterful direction is evident throughout, with every frame meticulously composed to evoke a range of emotions. The cinematography captures the brutality of war with unflinching precision, while the juxtaposition of dark humor against the backdrop of chaos adds layers of complexity to the storytelling. The result is a film that is as visually arresting as it is thematically rich.Furthermore, the soundtrack, featuring a mix of iconic tracks, complements the film's atmosphere, enhancing the emotional resonance of key moments. The carefully curated music contributes to the immersive experience, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.In conclusion, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a cinematic tour de force that not only stands as a testament to Stanley Kubrick's directorial prowess but also as a poignant exploration of the human psyche in the face of the brutality of war. With its stellar performances, striking visuals, and thematic depth, the film remains a powerful and enduring work of art that continues to resonate with audiences, cementing its place as a classic in the war film genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An outstanding and unique war movie,"In 1987, 30 years after he'd firstly dealt with the subject of war in Paths of Glory, legendary American auteur Stanley Kubrick returned to the award-promising genre and released Full Metal Jacket. While it neither got the praise nor the awards it deserved when it came out, it has since then become a fan favorite and one of Kubrick's most beloved movies.Full Metal Jacket is split in two cohesive parts: the first and shorter one setting place at a military boot camp in South Carolina and the second one depicting the actual war events in Vietnam. The audience's relationship to the characters is supposed to be very distant and Kubrick lets us know very little about them. The narrator, nicknamed Joker, is a spectacled young man that believes to see through the military indoctrination. He tries to resist the system and, as he says himself, is only here to be the first kid on his block to get a confirmed kill. This is, of course, highly unconventional for a war movie protagonist and Matthew Modine plays him in a realistic, yet not particularly likable manner. Vincent D'Onofrio portrays the burly and universally untalented Private ""Gomer Pyle"", who gets permanently insulted and degraded by the vulgar and loud Drill Sergeant Hartman, who is played extraordinarily well by R. Lee Ermey, who was a real-life Drill Sergeant some time before. His eloquent and absolutely R-rated speeches are hilarious and simply the best part of the movie. It's sad somewhat, that his character doesn't accompany the recruits in the Vietnam War that follows; at some parts, I really wished for awesome one-liners like "" I bet you're the kind of guy that would f*** a person in the a** and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach-around!"" But let's not be too harsh: the second part, if remarkably more serious, is again entertaining and because of the excellently crafted war scenes utterly gripping.Typically for a Kubrick film, Full Metal Jacket has a lot of ongoing themes and motifs in it that you may not even recognize when watching it for the first time. He's dealing with sexuality and not only in the two scenes in which Vietnamese hookers appear. The recruits have an absurd relationship with their rifle - especially D'Onofrio's character - and in the film's second part the killing scenes seem to bring an orgasmic feeling to the soldiers. Furthermore, you can probably correctly interpret religious imagery as well as father-mother-child themes into the movie - the minute director Stanley Kubrick is likely to have intended all of them. But you don't even need to think about the film in such a 'sophisticated' way, Mr. K shows a great game with the war scenes already. There may not be as many as in genre classics Apocalypse Now or Platoon and, admittedly, they don't have the aesthetic greatness that the ones in the aforementioned Coppola flick had. However, what Full Metal Jacket has is an authenticity that is even more impressive if you are aware that the Vietnam scenes where in fact shot in a disused gas work in the vicinity of London. Kubrick made the most out of it and also did terrific work with the sound and the editing which is impeccable.Because Kubrick wanted to make the recruits as one multi-persona character, there isn't as much to find out about the individual characters as some people may have wished for. Yet still, there is a very interesting and often only subliminal character study on the protagonist, Private Joker. Most of all, while Full Metal Jacket has the same view on war as the majority of other war films (even though the movie's protagonist is a war advocate, Kubrick himself is, of course, against war - I hope you noticed that), it shows us something new. A partly documentary and partly alarming new take that could have been boring. Thanks to Kubrick, it's not.At least not at the first time watching it - the prolonged war scenes lose their thrill once you know what's going to happen.",,Anonymous,Drama

Kubrick Addresses The Complexities Of War,"The dual nature of man, wherein he is able to embrace both war and peace simultaneously, is addressed by director Stanley Kubrick in the decidedly anti-war film, `Full Metal Jacket,' starring Matthew Modine.  Divided essentially into two parts, the first half follows raw recruits through basic training at Parris Island, where the effects of what it takes to turn a man into a Marine / killing machine is explored, predominately through the characters of Private `Joker,' played by Matthew Modine, and Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), dubbed `Gomer Pyle' by the D.I, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey).  It's a hard, stoic study of techniques and motivation that inherently questions the system itself, and is deftly and succinctly illustrated by the results achieved, which are not entirely those desired. It's hard stuff to swallow at times, but engrossing, and Kubrick manages to gradually build the emotional intensity that gives such impact to the climax of this first part, which is without question the strength of the entire film. 	The second half switches suddenly to Vietnam, where Kubrick takes up his pallet and canvass, and while attempting to paint a realistic portrait of war, instead takes more of a turn away from reality, and the film takes on a sense of the surreal; the result is more reminiscent of the visual artistry of `The Thin Red Line' than of the truly gritty realism of `Saving Private Ryan,' and rather than make his statement  directly through the use of the story, he uses the movie to stage sequences of events to demonstrate the contradictory nature of war and it's consequences, and man's involvement therein.  And while he compares the moral and emotional conflicts with the physical, it is an acknowledgement of an inner struggle devoid of any proffered solution, though delivered quite subjectively.  The pace of the film is very deliberate and much of the dialogue has a `staged' sense about it that, rather than underscore the issues being addressed, has more of an alienating effect which serves to neutralize the emotional aspects of what is being presented. 	The story is told from the point of view of Modine's `Joker' , but though Modine does a passable job, his is a rather unsympathetic character whose purpose it would seem is merely to act as narrator and to serve as the `eyes' of the camera.  And, again, it only manages to distance the audience further, as Joker becomes a kind of buffer between the viewer and any sustained level of emotional involvement with the story or any of the characters.  Instead of a stirring fulmination against the lunacy of war and man's enablement of it, Kubrick's approach creates more of a sense of rather cold ambiguity.  Had Joker (as the lead) been a stronger character, and had the second half of the film been more like the first, instead of nothing more than a series of vignettes, this could have been a dynamic movie; as it is, because of Kubrick's choices, he made a good movie, but not a great one. 	There are two memorable performances here, one by Vincent D'Onofrio, who did an exemplary job of creating the hapless Leonard; the other by Lee Ermey, as the Gunnery Sergeant who could be the poster-boy for an anti-enlistment campaign.  Also worthy of note is the work of Arliss Howard, who brought `Cowboy' so credibly to life.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother); Dorian Harewood (Eightball); Kevyn Major Howard (Rafterman); Ed O'Ross (Lieutenant Tinoshky); and John Terry (Lieutenant Lockhart).  With `Full Metal Jacket,' Stanley Kubrick raises issues that are important, and makes some valid points about the causes and complexities of war, and the moral and ethical challenges of those presented with it.  Obviously, this was a passionate endeavor; if only he would have allowed more of that passion to make it's way onto the screen.  What a movie this could have been.  I rate this one 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Liberal Concept of Response to Lethal Environment,"When I first saw this film at the time it came out, I thought it was very good. But now that liberal H-wood has steeped me in its BS for all the years I had subscribed, I now see that the BS theme associated with ""Gomer Pyle"" is that growing into an instrument of war is insanity causing to some. That the ""hero"", ""Joker"", drops his gun when shot at, then mercy kills the sniper that someone else protected him from. And that war is a waste for liberal reasons, not realistic ones. I very much doubt that any actual war movie has ever been made, and certainly not this as one. Saving Private R may be as close as it comes for action and the sense of ""being there"", but the schmaltzy political backdrop takes something from it. Maybe one of these days .",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Raw, Honest, and Childlike","Kubrik flexes his directing muscles in a film unlike any other he had done previously. A true to genre war film, this retains only few of the signature traces of the strangeness that he is known for. Don't be fooled by the unassuming nature of the film though; this is perhaps the zenith of what a traditional war film can be.The plot is straightforward as can be, as we follow Joker through boot camp and into the blasted out lines of Vietnam. What this film does absolutely exceptionally is portray war and military life in a very real way. And I don't mean real in the way Saving Private Ryan is real; real in the sense of what the day to day attitudes of these men were. They tell jokes, they mess with each other, they are appalled by the job, they love the job, they love their brothers, they pay for prostitutes, they are saddened by the savagery. Of course, there are the exaggerated events at boot camp, but these only serve to show the way the military shapes these young boys into tools of war.The film is also funny. Despite being an obvious statement film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously. If there are any downsides to the film, it's perhaps that it doesn't try anything new. Kubrik executed the film to its highest potential and perhaps that's all we can ask of it.A very tight and entertaining film. Maybe missing that X factor that would propel it to being an all timer, but it's certainly a great film",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Lethal Camera,"Even if this had no opening credits, this would be immediately recognizable as Kubrick's work.All of his essential war film components are here, as self reference: the camera movement of ""Paths of Glory"", the 'fighting a square' and running the gauntlet from ""Barry Lyndon"". There is 'Rafterman' as the photographer (the camera operator) and 'Joker' as the writer. Modine is given the task of writing the story within the story as the character, and outside the story, narrating with retroactive knowledge.We love the beginning third for the spot-on performances of Ermey and D'Onofrio. But as with all of Kubrick's work, the plot and dialogue are really just secondary concerns. What makes this grip, unlike the works of many lesser filmmakers, is the supremacy of the camera. On the Island, the camera is on a dolly...disciplined, humiliated. In country, it is held-held, it marches, charges, crouches and hides. We get a lesson from the master in how to build story inertia through visual narrative inertia.And in the finale, the most striking feature here, the idea of the camera as rifle/rifle as camera duality. The camera literally becomes the sniper's weapon. And who ultimately puts a metaphorical end to the deadly vision? The photographer...then the writer dispatches it and the story with a prayer. Heavy duty stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterful war film,"""This is my riffle. There are many like it but this one is mine"". This cue could encompass this excellent movie released in 1987. Eight years after the end of the Vietnam War, Stanley Kubrick decided to depict it in a very original way, by representing the war as a tragic love story between a man and his weapon.The film is divided in two complementary parts. The first one focuses on a training camp, in which we follow a young man nicknamed ""Joker"" discovering the life in a barrack, and being bullied and humiliated by his sergeant. It is a transcription of the human relationships that appear when a hundred men renounce to think by themselves, which leads to terrible consequences. The second part shows Joker covering the Vietnam War as a correspondent for the newspaper ""Stars and Stripes"". We follow him from the rear to the very front, so we can confront the views of different unconventional characters about their situation.The originality in Kubrick's film is that he doesn't present the war as a hell where human are sent to being slaughtered, on the contrary of the majority of war films: blood is here considered as a God. And the dichotomy in the structure permits to distinguish the dogmatic part (the training) and the fanatic one (the fight). This religious presentation of the situation implies that the film is not the story of one person discovering the war: it's a real fresco of the soldiers. We are confronted to the ones who live killing, the ones who are disgusted, the ones who have become mac because they couldn't stand what they were doing¬Ö Blood is omnipresent, as a powerful and evil character.But the most important and stunning part of Kubrick's work is that he manages to transcribe the atmosphere of this very odd period, split between the horror of the war and the societal progresses of the sixties. The film is a superposition of contrasts, between good and bad, silence and noise, color and gray, calmness and violence¬Ö For example, Kubrick's alters long shots and very rapid cuts to oppose the cohesion and the hatred between soldiers. The music, that is nearly absent of the movie, appears once in the second part and is in total contradiction with the horror of the images shown. The paroxysm of those contrasts is when the soldiers joke about John Wayne on the battlefield.So in summary, Kubrick's movie mixes human relations, numerous representations of soldiers, a stunning direction¬Ö Definitely a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Let's talk about the source material,"The movie is well reviewed by others and most people find it very compelling. I like it to but am bothered by some shifts in tone in the final third although I think Kubrick deserves credit for not dodging the issue of atrocities.I prefer war movies that don't glorify war more as in ""Platoon"" or the great German U-Boat film ""Das Boot"" (see it in German with English subtitles, when they overdubbed it in English they wrecked a great background soundtrack). All in all there's a bit too much flag waving in this for me but it's a great movie but I can help remembering that part of the promotion for ""Full Metal Jacket"" including displaying the novel that served as source material for it in supermarket checkout lanes. Seeing Kubrick's name on it I picked it up. The novel was called ""the Short Timers"" written by Marine Gustav Hasford who was in theater during 1968-69. The great prolific essayist, columnist, novelist, screen writer (including my favorite sci fi movie, ""a Boy and his Dog"") Harlan Ellison said of Short timers ""It is one of the most amazing stretches of writing I've ever encountered."" Even though I know this is a movie review, not a book review, I have to tell you the source for most of the movie was written largely in a different kind of English called jarhead lingo. It was very cool to read inspired sections that are prose written with those word.Unfortunately, way more people were interested in watching Kubrick's movie than reading the real deal, the book didn't sell well, his deal with Kubrick wasn't very good and Hasford died alone almost broke in a motel room in Greece of heart related diabetic problems.I don't know which is more heartbreaking. Hasford's early death or the fact that ""the Short Timers"" is out of print while people still buy Kubrick's movie and somebody gets paid.The book has now become a rather expensive collector's item selling online for between $15 and upwards of $400.If you Google the title and his name you'll find a link to a scribd page that will load the whole book like a pdf.

Stanley Kubrick's genius comes through,"It is said that 90% of directing is casting. That is just part of Kubrick's genius. Another part of his genius is for capturing the right setting and ambiance. This movie has two part: first half is the boot camp drama with R. Lee Ermey (Sgt Hartman), the marine drill instructor, Matthew Modine (Prvt J.T. 'Joker' Davis) as the intelligent, aspiring combat reporter, and Vincent D'Onofrino (Prvt Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Leonard) as the overweight, whipping boy of Sgt Hartman. The drama revolves around Pyle, as Sgt Hartman finds pleasure in belittling his screw ups in front of the others. Joker is paired up with Pyle to be his teacher and mentor. This part of the movie describes the dehumanization process a marine endures in basic training as preparation for them to be fashioned into a weapon of war. The second part is the recruits in the battle field. Joker's assignment as a reporter allows him to view the war experience from an audience's point-of- view. Eventually Pyle tags along with Prvt Cowboy's unit (a fellow recruit) as they patrol the ruins of the city of Hue following an attack known as the Tet Offensive. Towards the climax, 2 of Cowboy's men get picked off by an unknown sniper. This represents the hidden death that lurks at every moment during that war when battling guerrilla fighters. Finally at sundown, Joker leads some men to a building where the sniper is positioned. The palm trees and fire in the ruins of the city makes for an eerie, oriental temple like atmosphere. The music (like elephant cries) in the background also contributes to this effect. Finally the sniper is found and wounded. It turns out to be a girl. Badly wounded, she prays and then asks the men to mercifully killed her. Animal Mother, a heavy machine gunner (like Rambo), wants her to suffer to death as payback. Joker, on the other hand, compassionately chooses to put her out of her misery. The segment of the movie with the sniper is Kubrick's commentary on that war. The Vietnam war was sold to the Americans and those who fought it as the U.S.'s answer to help liberate that country from communism. Ironically, it was reduced to a frustrating effort on the part of young recruits to fight an invisible enemy who very much hated them for their presence in their country.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I could totally see a Full Metal Jacket II: Iraq,"Watching this movie, try substituting the Vietnam era soldiers, with modern day weapons, vehicles and grunts and you get the War in Iraq! This movie was very entertaining and not like the other Vietnam movies of the time (Apocolipse Now comes to mind) where it is all dark and moody (thanks to the Doors music), but this one has humor to lighten the situation, but there is gore. It is war, duh! Also having draftees in a war situation vs. troops who volunteer for such an assignment really shows. Of course no one wants to be in a war, but if you have to be there, you have to have your head screwed on tight, but not too tight, or you snap. Excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
one of the best war movies ever made,"I love this movie it really feels like it was shot during the war! The drill instructor is played perfectly by Lee Ermey who was a real drill instructor (sorry can't spell) and the insults he yells at the recruits is some of the best and funniest lines ever uttered by an actor ever!!! There are so many great scenes too many to list well and I don't want to spoil any of it for ppl who haven't seen this movie yet!!

One of the Best War Films Ever,"The first ten minutes of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a disturbing, yet hilariously funny scene where a DI meets his new recruits.  Everything that comes out of his mouth in this scene is quoteable, classic obscenity.  What is truly haunting about this, however, is the transformation of the men in the marine corps.  Any other film would have followed the ""end of innocence"" cliche, but Kubrick makes sure that the audience knows there was little innocence to begin with in a confused, immoral war like Vietnam.  These boys are transformed into stone cold killers.  Robots, working for a cause they didn't care about.  In fact, one scene shows the DI instructing them to become as good as marksmen as Oswald!  Many of the men encountered in this film want nothing more than to kill as many Vietnameise as possible, horrifyingly enough, even if it means women and children.There is an unforgettable closing shot where all of the soldiers march on after a gruesome battle proudly chanting the Mickey Mouse theme.  In this harrowing, Kubrick-trademark close, Mickey Mouse becomes a metaphor for this sole attitude of Vietnam.  The great wars were over and these all-American boys had no intention of making any peace.Matthew Modine plays the lead, Private Joker.  He is brilliant as the faceless everyman of the Marine Corps.  Private Joker is to the brutality of vietnam just as Alex Delarge is to a society infatuated with sex in violence.  His helmet reads ""Born to Kill"", yet he wears a peace symbol to display the ""duality of man"".  He is very symbolic of how lost everything seemed to get.  We follow him through the three sections of the film, all conveying the horrors of 'nam.  The first act is boot camp in an opening that is ultimately unforgettable.  Here it is more than clear that there was a reduction in the vulnerable young men entering the corps.  Private Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Nofrio)is a fat, very dumb recruit whose screw-ups make him victim to the DI and his fellow soldiers.  The second fearlessly, unflinchingly shows the dehumanization of the Vietnamese people. Private Joker becomes a combat journalist, feeding his fellow soldiers lies so they keep their heads in the game.  He is assigned to a platoon where he faces action, which leads into the third act...the reality of combat.Stanely Kubrick made one of the best way films of all time.  His capability to tackle controversial issues made him perfect for a  Vietnam story.  This is not a film defending the war, it is a film exposing a reality that was lost like the whole purpose of the war was.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Not the best, ain't the worst","Personally I think that Vietnam films fall into three categories:1)Emotional sufferings due to war: Deer Hunter 2)Off it's head no direction war films: Apocalypse Now 3)Out 'n out guns and girls: Full Metal JacketNow don't get me wrong I thought it was ok, but never the less this is a rather predictable, ""kill anything that moves"" kinda film.The ""actors"" were basically caricatures of what you'd expect soldiers to be like:Pvt. Pyle- Token fat-guy Animal Mother- Mr. Macho Cowboy- all round nice guy just waiting to be shot.People these days are still complaining about Mr. Tarantino's use of the ""N"" word, yet Kubrick was offending audiences long before that, not one of the Vietnamese (Northern or Southern) has a name and all the Vietnamese women are portrayed as cheap w****s.This may seem quite negative, but on the other hand it was quite a light-weight fun semi-enjoyable",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
How to brainwash civilians and robotised soldiers,"Kubrick explores how the US army(or any army) takes ordinary run of the mill civilians and makes them into killing machines. This is done by removing all ideas of the previous identity. The hair is shaved, clothes are replaced by plain green army attire, the name is even removed for example 'private pile' or 'private joker'. After this dependency is required, this is done by controlling hunger and other bio survival instincts, no Jelly doughnuts! The biggest dependency factor in FMJ however is the desire to be good enough in the eyes of the Sargent.R. Lee Ermeys performance is incredible and hilarious. Having already been in the military for a number of years the research had been done and it shows with a performance not only true to character but is as entertaining as samuel L. Jackson in pulp fiction. The film does seem to miss the Sargent after we renter the 2nd half of the film but solid performances from the whole cast and Kubricks humour keep it entertaining while we deal with the more morally heavy material.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
How the bell sounds,"If this movie was about war, it might be seen as mediocre. That's perhaps why there are so many people deceived with the development of the story.Full Metal Jacket is about the way the human soul reacts to warfare; The way we prepare men for it, the way we look at it, not only the way we suffer it but also the way we 'see' it. The films character 'Joker' is like the playing card with the same name: It changes 'ad hoc'. More than the anti-war person that he happens to be, 'Joker' is the distant observer of a phenomenon he doesn't regard as his own but one that he is progressively part of. This dynamic process, from the absent recruit to the compassionate executer of a girl warrior happens through the eyes of a camera, the scenario being the very 'ink' that paints blood black. That may be the main reason for the sequence of the second part of the film. Kubrik spares the spectator to an excessive exposure to the 'horrors' of war concentrating, rather, on the relationship of a conscious human, 'Joker', with the 'facts of war' as he becomes progressively familiar with them (that's why Joker is a journalist, not a nurse). Far from an unrealistic and static picture of war, the second part of the film is relatively stripped of action of men suffering war in order to expose war as an external phenomenon, through Joker's pictures. That's how Joker sees it in the begining of the second part. We have here a picture not of war itself, but the 'ways in war' of the type of warrior that went through the first part of the film and, eventually, survived and the critical observation made by Joker of their deeds. Note that if 'Joker' was pro-war character the film could be quite the same except for the feeling expressed by Joker himself regarding the killing of the Vietcong girl. Full Metal Jacket starts with a critical analysis of the distortion of human values by army training or, as one might see it, 'restraining' of the human being and ends with a reflection on the necessity and the inevitability of that distortion through the rendition of Joker's character.The here is not 'Form whom the bell tolls', not even a remark (amongst many) that it does. Full Metal Jacket, a type of ammunition itself, is a look into the sound of the bell.All in all, a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best war ever,"No doubt Stanley Kubrick is one of the best directors cinema has ever known. In his life, he made things like ""Spartacus"", an excellent gladiator, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a wonderful sci-fi film, ""Lolita"", a sexy and hot romance, ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"", an ironical masterpiece, ""A Clockwork Orange"", a portrait of a possible future and this ""Full Metal Jacket"", considered by many the best war movie ever made.The film seems to be two different movies put into one. The first part shows the privates training in an island in the USA. Commanded by a brave, and sometimes cruel, man, the soldiers are often called ""maggots"" and they have to face really hard exercises. Some of them, like private Pyle, suffer from the pains and difficulties of their duties.The second part is the war itself in Vietnam. Through the eyes of Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who writes to the press about the situation in the battlefield, we see the war from a very true point of view. We feel like we are there in the platoon and sometimes and have the feeling we are soldiers ourselves.Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Drama
"""I must defeat my enemy who is trying to kill me¬Ö""","Full Metal Jacket gets a lot of negative criticism for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that people say that it doesn't do anything with the Vietnam issue that hadn't already been done before. I tend to feel like Kubrick already knew this, and that's probably why the film's plot is so thin that it's barely there at all. It is famously divided into two parts, boot camp and the famous TET Offensive of 1968. It's also true that, especially in things like the battle scenes, there is not a lot happening that is very far from what have become war film clich√©s, like a lot of guys hugging walls, pinned down under sniper fire.But Kubrick has one of the most definable styles of any director in the history of the cinema, and in a lot of ways it's true that his style as an auteur doesn't lend itself to the war genre very well. He loves long, slow scenes, accompanied with equally slow dialogue that would sound truly bizarre in real life but makes perfect sense in a Kubrick movie.Ultimately, Full Metal Jacket is a striking anti-war film, but it doesn't focus on the horrors of war, it focuses on the horrors of what people do to each other and become in order to prepare for war, about the irony of molding men into killing machines for the protection of our right to enjoy something as simple as Mickey Mouse. The movie knows that, even during times of the most intense war, the vast majority of people don't want to fight, they just want to live their lives and feed their families and watch their children grow. Kubrick gives us a tale of the cost of even just having a trained military force.R. Lee Ermey obviously has the most memorable role in the movie, as the startling drill sergeant who loves nothing more than the Marine Corps except Jesus and the Virgin Mary, even though he has a vocabulary that would make a sailor blush. Much of the fun of the first half of the movie come through his dialogue, as he viciously whips his men into shape, taking special pains to try and make one particular recruit, nicknamed Private Pyle, to quit. The amount of memorable quotes from this movie has to be among the highest from any single movie ever!Vincent D'Onofrio, by the way, as Private Pyle, is an absolutely astonishing performance. At the beginning of the movie, he is just like a kid misbehaving on the playground. As Sargeant Hartman screams insults and profanity into his face, he can't stop laughing, and for things like stealing and hiding jelly doughnuts he receives punishments like running behind the rest of the men with his pants around his ankles while sucking his thumb. The transition that his character goes through is the most powerful transition in the film, and drives home the film's message in no uncertain terms.(spoilers) It's interesting to consider that the movie kills off it's two main characters at the mid-point, and unfortunately this is where it loses some of its audience. A Kubrick-style battle sequence is going to be unique in a way that will put some people off, because even though it's the same as so many other battle sequences in a lot of ways, it's also totally different. Kubrick doesn't zoom around the full battle, giving us moments of intense war action, but instead focuses on one small battle, involving a lot of the guys we got to know in the first half of the movie and a single sniper. Aside from allowing for some great moments of tension, it also gives a shocking example of the horrific kind of psychological war that the Vietnamese fought.What I especially love about the movie is that, like so many of Kubrick's films, it can't be easily categorized. It probably raises more questions than it answers, which lends it its incredible staying power. It is tremendously entertaining, has several powerhouse performances, and shows off Kubrick's mastery of direction. It is stunningly photographed and, while the psychological impact of war may be shown a little heavy-handedly in the last act, it remains one of the best and most important war films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of a Kind,"This movie will always be remembered on the internet and comedies as ""the show that had that guy that swore a whole lot"". And this disappoints me very much. Although everyone who has ever seen the movie knows that it is a classic film that will never be doubled in any way possible, there are still many people who just know it as the film with many words you shouldn't say in front of your mom. Although this is disappointing, it is necessary to the movies success to have so much vulgarity in it, because without it... how would it be a Vietnam movie? This is undoubtedly the 2nd best Vietnam movie ever made, and I know how that sounds. But when you are second to ""Platoon"", then it isn't all that bad. After watching this movie, you will be in awe. Why? Simply because it has such lasting power that it will always be in your mind when you think about war.The movie looks at the war through the soldier's eyes. From boot camp to the front lines. The movie will show you emotion, integrity, bravery, heart, but most of all, a look at war that people have yet to see. Where small girls fight for their country just to survive, and where young men fight for reasons that they cannot even understand. This is what the movie surrounds. The conflicts of the soldiers, not the war itself. That's why this movie will always be a one of a kind classic that everyone must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Full Metal Jacket can't be compared to Apocalypse Now or Platoon, but you can't deny how it's one of the best-looking war films which offers brilliant acting and writing","Full Metal Jacket is a war drama I watched back in high school just because it was supposed to be this iconic war film, it was and I loved it, but the thing was how I didn't know who Stanley Kubrick was as it was my first film with him. In many years now since my first viewing, almost a decade ago, I have wanted to watch it with fresh eyes and see how a much more mature person would experience it. I see the whole war genre differently now than a decade ago, so what I didn't really know about Full Metal Jacket is how different it is and how it's more a drama than a war film, with emphasis on its many themes than its action sequences. Because this film is more about the characters and the boot camp training they're going through, honestly, Stanley Kubrick was the right person for this project as he was very strict with his direction, making the ruthless senior drill instructor feel natural, Lee Ermey portrays Gunnery Sergeant Hartman and used his actual experience as a U. S. Marine drill instructor to ad lib much of his dialogue. His first scene is the reason I watched the film, his performance is perfect for what the film and story needs. It also stars Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio and Adam Baldwin as the marines who're going through boot camp, with Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio being the best. Full Metal Jacket is directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford. It's a spectacular experience and cinema on the highest level, which offers an accurate view of boot camp training and might be among the best looking war movies. It looks even better with the 4k blu-ray I bought, the picture is clear and perfect, the sound too. About the sound and music, it's perfect, especially the sound design. Everything sounds real and most importantly is how it looks real.The storyline follows a platoon of U. S. Marines through their boot camp training in Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, primarily focusing in the first half of the film on privates J. T. Davis and Leonard Lawrence, nicknamed ""Joker"" and ""Pyle,"" who struggle under their abusive drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The second half portrays the experiences of Joker and one other of the platoon's Marines in Vietnamese cities Da Nang and Hue during the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam WarThe first half of the film is all about the boot camp training, it's comedic and full of drama, also certain themes of military brainwashing. It also focuses on Joker and him trying to understand human evil, which is a heavy focus in the last half of the film, also the horrors of war and what war does to the people, soldiers and bystanders alike. There's not much suspension in that first half, but the tension is there from start to finish and how the first half ends, you'll be left speechless. The second half has both suspension and tension, and plenty of it. This is where it goes from a war drama to a war film, the war scenarios are brilliantly shot and this is one of many times where the 4k blu-ray shines as the battle sequences didn't look this good when I watched it on Netflix almost a decade ago. The writing is truly spectacular with much of the dialogue you'll be able to quote.Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert called Full Metal Jacket ""strangely shapeless"" and awarding it two and a half stars out of four. Ebert called it ""one of the best-looking war movies ever made on sets and stage"" but said this was not enough to compete with the ""awesome reality of Platoon, Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter"". Ebert criticized the film's Vietnam-set second act, saying the ""movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces, none of them quite satisfying"" and concluded the film's message is ""too little and too late"", having been done by other Vietnam War films. Ebert praised Ermey and D'Onofrio, saying ""these are the two best performances in the movie, which never recovers after they leave the scene"". Yes, it can't be compared to those films, they're perfect, masterpieces. Yet, Full Metal Jacket is a film you should watch, it's an experience. I personally agree with how those films are better war movies, but you can't deny how well crafted Full Metal Jacket is, how its themes and how Stanley Kubrick directed it, brilliant. Between 1987 and 1989, Full Metal Jacket was nominated for 11 awards, including an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, two BAFTA Awards for Best Sound and Best Special Effects, and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for Ermey. It won five awards.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Reassessing ""Full Metal Jacket"" 30+ years later","Let me state upfront that I have seen ""Full Metal Jacket"" more than once over the years, but I can't recall when the last time was. I'm guessing it's been at least 15 years ago, if not more. Frankly, I remembered very little of the movie's specifics (mainly the ""drill instructor"" scenes). On top of that, I am a huge Staley Kubrick fan and admirer. When I noticed a few days ago that this film was on Showtime's schedule, I did not hesitate and eagerly looked forward to seeing it again, which I did just yesterday..""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987 release; 116 min.) is in fact two movies into one. The first one could be called ""Drill"" and covers the opening 45 min., and the second one could be called ""Deployed"" and covers the remaining 70 min. of the movie. But for 2 reoccurring characters, these 2 films stand on their own. ""Drill"" is nothing short of brilliant, with Lee Ermey's overpowering performance as the senior drill instructor front and center (Ermey was of course a real life Marines drill instructor and supposedly adlibbed major parts of his performance). But ""Drill"" really has nothing to do with the Vietnam war as such. ""Deployed"" is set in Vietnam, but here also I found little connection with the Vietnam War, as the series of platoon incidents that are presented here could've happen just as well in WWII or the Korean War. The fact that the entire movie was shot in England doesn't help. Yes, the performances are top-notch, and yes, the (Oscar-nominated) script is tight, but this film is really on the same theme as ""Dr. Strangelove"" as anything, namely the absurdity of war, rather than taking a close look what happened specifically in Vietnam. Compare this to, for example, The Deer Hunter, or Platoon, or Apocalypse Now (perhaps the most Vietnam-centric of them all).Is Full Metal Jacket a bad movie? Of course not. But neither is it, in my (very subjective personal) opinion, among the very best of Kubrick's films. I totally understand and respect that others may have a different opinion on this. In any event, I enjoyed watching this for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Half a film from half a genius,"Kubrick must rank with Hitchcock as the most overrated director of our time. Full Metal Jacket is one of his pretentious half-failures. The first part of the movie is quite compelling. The real-life drill sargeant is so good that we overlook the fact that the other characters might as well be carrying cardboard sandwiches with what symbol they are supposed to represent. The second part of the film is supposed to, I think, contrast the chaos and reality of the battlefield to the order and artificiality of the parade ground. This was done beautifully in Kurosawa's two masterful scenes in Ran. Needless to say, Kubrick is no Kurosawa, and is not up to the task. The man has no understanding of how to shoot an action sequence, or how real people, not symbols interact. This artificiality, which was tolerable in the first part makes the second part completely laughable. I once saw a very good snippet of Godard (himself vastly overrated..), comparing shot by shot, the sniper scene with real footage from Vietnam and lamenting upon how static, sterile, and lacking in excitement the Kubrick version is. I think all the weaknesses are summarized in the ""surprise"" climax of the film which I found to be completely out of place and as dated as the film and its director. The years have been much kinder to Platoon, or even Apocalypse Now.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama

Kubrick pulls you in like no one else.,"'Full Metal Jacket', like most Kubrick films, is about emotions more than anything else.  The experiences of the characters are so well sculpted that you become almost another character.  Their fear, panic, anger, and sorrow are conveyed to the audience.  Kubrick manages to accomplish this through several techniques.  Often in the film, characters look directly into the camera when they speak.  They're not addressing the audience, but you get the sense that you're being addressed as one of the characters.  Secondly, Kubrick keeps his camera down to earth.  There are no sweeping panoramas of battlefields such as are found in other war pictures.  The film is shot almost entirely at eye level, down with the grunts.  This film is an emotional journey that is both painful and thought-provoking.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Full Metal Jacket: 10/10,"Full Metal Jacket is the fourth Stanley Kubrick movie I have seen (the others are 2001, The Shining, and Dr. Strangelove). This is my second favorite out of those four.It's basically a two-part story. The first part is clearly the better part, and is one of the best acts in a movie I have ever seen. It has a drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey) sadistically dehumanizing recruits into the Marines for the Vietnam War. This is one of the basics of Kubrick movies, the dehumanization of humans. It is most clearly seen in The Shining, also. Among some of the new Marines are Joker (Matthew Modine), Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Cowboy (Arliss Howard). Gomer is fat, so the drill instructor likes to pick on him. The second part has them actually going into the war.It's really hard to put the first part into words. Ermey spitfires insults and hateful things for about ten minutes straight, without taking a breath or anything. He was a drill instructor before becoming an actor, and it shows. He was outstanding, just truly outstanding. He was screwed from winning Best Supporting Actor for his role. Just like the narration of Fight Club, it's hard to put how I feel into words.Something I didn't expect was that it had bits and pieces of humor that were in it. Most of it, yet again, came from Ermey as he was yelling at the recruits. I laughed a lot, even though they weren't that appropriate. The laughs, obviously, tapered off in the second part. Much of the humor wasn't P.C., either, but this was 15 years ago.Only a genius could put humor into a time of turmoil. Thank you, Mr. Kubrick.Overall, I have two complaints about the films. First, the editing was poor. Second, the second act could obviously not compare to the first one. Although the second part was good, maybe a 7/10, the first part was over a 10/10, so I took around an average. The second part, however, was very realistic and made me feel like I was in the Vietnam War.Ermey was terrific, as I said before, but Modine proved himself to be a good leading actor. Although he hasn't done much recently, he could come back as a good actor. I really liked the music in Full Metal Jacket, sometimes it was cheerful, especially in the beginning, when the recruits were getting their heads shaved. The narration was rather odd, coming and going.The violence isn't gratuitous, but there is a lot of it. It looked realistic, which is good. It's better to have realistic violence and blood than fake. Instead of sugarcoating the violence to a PG-13 level, they showed everything, graphic but not over the top. Unfortunately, all of the deaths were in slow motion, but that didn't stop me from looking at it and gasping in awe. Kubrick makes another bravura masterpiece here.My rating: 10/10Rated R for strong language and violence, and sexual refrences.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
It's a funny and serious movie at the same time,"Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  I can watch it over and over again and not get bored of it.

The comedy in this movie from Sargent Hartman names his privates to the scene with Private Joker and Animal Mother.  ""Well pilgrim only after you eat the peanuts out of my......"" you know.

The duality of man,"Man is truly capable of both great and horrific things. Our world is filled with murderers, violence and hate, yet its also filled with humanitarians, peace and love. Our world is in many ways a split system with constant battle between the good and the bad. This complex duality is found everywhere, but its easiest to spot where there is war.Full metal jacket is all about this duality and how a seemingly harmless man can be battle-hardened and ready to commit horrific acts of violence given proper training and posture. The title ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a metaphor for putting a ""though-jacket"" on a harmless man, to make him dangerous and ready for war.In the same way the movie portrays the duality complex, the movie itself follows the same structure. The movie is a two-act piece, where the first act is all about breaking down each man being deployed to Vietnam and making killers out of regular citizens. They all learn the way of the warrior and forget about their normal ways.The second act of the movie is more complex and a bit less memorable than the first. Here we see how even the toughest of men always meet their match. No matter how tough and ready you are, you will always find a better prepared and more hardened individual ready to put you down. We get the sense that there is no limits and you can always be humbled no matter how ready you are.Most people only remember the first half of this movie. This is a shame as the second half is just as important to understanding what this movie is about. I don't blame people for only remembering the first half, as it features one of the all-time great performances by drill instructor Hartman played by R. Lee Ermey.This movie is shot excellently and there is obvious thought about every shot, angle and prop being displayed. Director Stanley Kubrick went to great lengths to depict his take on Vietnam and this movie as a result of his careful thought is great. The long panning takes in the second act during the war sequences are especially memorable other than the great performances during the first act.I like this movie and its take on the duality complex, and it's certainly one of the better war/Vietnam movies.My rating: 85/100.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
At the gas works,"I enjoyed this the most of the Vietnam films I've seen. It's a weird film in many ways. Many have commented on the fact that it is actually two films rather flimsily stuck together. The first half, on the training, is rightly famous as the most extreme of its genre, but let's face it, it was not exactly a new idea, even in the mid 80s. An Officer and a Gentleman had visited the area not many years before. The way that that sequence ends is overdone in my view. It's certainly not subtle.What makes FMJ better than other films, such as Platoon or Hamburger Hill, is that it has some humanity about it. The end sequence with the sniper is touching. In contrast, Platoon goes so far in showing that War Is Hell and Life Is Meaningless that one starts to lose interest. Meaninglessness is actually uninteresting.It shares with other Vietnam films the problem that we don't really get to know the characters enough and cannot sufficiently follow or empathise with their motivation and actions. Matthew Modine's character can be summarised as 'nice guy with a sense of irony' and that's about all. This is not really enough to carry the film.For a British viewer like me, it's hard to forget that this was almost entirely filmed in England, a country not exactly famous for its similarity in geography and climate to the jungles of S.E. Asia. The use of the old Beckton gasworks as Hue City is weird. It's very obvious that no one is sweating and no one is fighting off mosquitoes, etc. They were probably wishing they could wear overcoats at the time!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A war film to beat them all,"Firstly I have to tell you two things...Firstly I rate this as my all time top film so I may be a tad biased and secondly this year is really the first year that I became a reviewer and this review marks my 100th review so reserved this for my top film do it.Well the film is spit into two with the first half we are at marine training and the 2nd half actually In Vietnam.Directed by the fabulous Stanley Kubrick and with many not so famous actors but some of the best acting around, you could not have seen a better film. The first half has you laughing in part but incredibly sad at the way some of these marines are brought up to fighting status. In particular we see one man totally broken by it and this takes us to a harrowing scene and the beginning of the second half.What we get in the second half is not a massive amount of action and it kinda follows around 5 main characters that have survived the humiliation, gutsy training and sheer brutality in the first half. They with their patrol come across an isolated small battle for their life and that's both physical and mental and for me with the score one of great mental horror...a simple scene but so damned powerful and strong.This film was actually 98% filmed around 3 miles from my home in London England along the Thames in Docklands where a regeneration programme to build new homes was taking place...I could actually hear the bombs going of when they were filming it and didn't know what it was till I saw it mentioned in local news.It's frickin awesome, powerful, sad, angry and as I said one of the best war films there are....",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
What Is Your Major Malfunction?,"""Full Metal Jacket"", which often seems to be more a random collection of loosely connected stories than an actual movie, dooms itself to mediocrity by telling its best stories first. The first half hour is incredibly powerful, possibly the best work that master director Stanley Kubrick ever captured on film . . . and then the film stumbles backwards, unable to maintain the impossibly high standards that it established for itself. Since the film has nowhere to go but down, down it goes, and without a unifying theme holding the film together, ""Full Metal Jacket"" degenerates into a confusing mess.""Full Metal Jacket"" is about the journey of one man, Private Davis(Matthew Modine), during the Vietnam War, starting with boot camp and heading inexorably onward to the horrors found in Vietnam. Throughout all his experiences, finds nothing but madness and chaos in everything he sees, from his maniacal drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, whose performance is absolutely flawless in this film) to the Vietnamese ""enemy"" to the soldiers on his own side. In a way, the original movie poster for ""Full Metal Jacket"" best describes the film -- it shows a soldier's helmet decorated with both a psychedelic peace symbol and the angrily scrawled phrase BORN TO KILL.The strength of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is ultimately its downfall as well - the opening training scenes at Paris Island. While Davis is essentially the main character of the film (or at least the main observer), the basic training sequence of events focuses primarily on the horrifying relationship between Drill Instructor Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and one unfortunate recruit nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). To be fair, Sergeant Hartman treats all the recruits (including Davis, whom Hartman nicknames `Private Joker`) with equal amounts of venom and disdain, but it's Private Pyle that's affected by it the most, and as such, Pyle's relationship with Sergeant Hartman becomes the cornerstone of all the basic training scenes. R. Lee Ermey (who in real life was an actual Marine drill instructor before his foray into acting) puts on such a brutally honest, harrowing, and disturbing performance that it's unforgettable . . . and it easily blows the performance of almost every other actor in the movie. (Watch for a priceless scene where the sergeant tries to inspire his recruits for a sharpshooting drill . . . and uses Lee Harvey Oswald as his shining example of marksmanship.) The exception to this is Vincent D'Onofrio, who turns Private Pyle into a ticking timebomb of insecurities, wanting desperately to succeed and to please the sergeant - although, deep down, Pyle knows he'll never be anything but a failure in the sergeant's eyes. Two masterful performances, both bordering on film perfection, but since neither Sergeant Hartman nor Private Pyle continue onward with Davis to Davis's part in the Vietnam conflict, the rest of the film suffers greatly. After basic training, it's off to the Vietnam War, and this is where the film just falls apart. Some scenes are undeniably brilliant, some are uninspired and awful, but no matter the quality of the scenes, there's nothing linking them all together. Perhaps this was Kubrick's intent, to show that one of the most horrifying things about war is just how meaningless it all is. But telling the truth doesn't automatically translate into telling a great story, or even a mediocre one, and ""Full Metal Jacket"" degenerates into a muddled heap of conflicting messages and morals despite its raw honesty. Yes, it's sad and horrifying, but it's done in such an detached, unfocused manner that the brain becomes numb to the horror, instead of outraged by it.Two grades for ""Full Metal Jacket"": An A+ for the basic training scenes, which are equal parts brilliant and distrurbing, and a C+ for the overall movie, which sadly falls apart once those basic training scenes end. Not one of Kubrick's better films.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A good first half that is bogged down by a meandering and pallid second one lacking a sense of urgency,"I know FMJ is widely lauded as a war movie classic, but I thought it was surprisingly weak. Is it because I saw Klimov's monstrous and harrowing WWII war film COME AND SEE the night before and FMJ inevitably suffers by comparison, even without me trying to force one? Could be. But I thought a relatively good (not great) first half is bogged down by a meandering and pallid second one that scavenges the ruins of Vietnam in search of meaning and momentum and comes up with canned one-liners.Kubrick suffuses the second half with notions of false bravado and how American aggressiveness brushes off in young freshcuts. I didn't find any of it much riveting though, probably because the ideas are too damn obvious. I mean, if there's a more potent symbol for gung-ho right-wing patriotism to make fun of than John Wayne then I sure don't know about it. Now, I'm not one to suggest subtlety is the only way to go about in war movies. After all I love FIRES ON THE PLAIN and COME AND SEE and neither one is quite the epitome of that. I like being grabbed by the neck and plunged headlong in the grime and brutality and told SEE. I just don't think FMJ's politics were particularly successful.And then you have the faux-interviews of the soldiers when one of them starts talking about how they're not fighting for freedom and how it's a slaughter and maybe they're shooting at the wrong *beep* Is Kubrick poking fun at war-is-hell genre conventions? That may very well be so even though I don't believe it. But what exactly is the point in that? I think what the second half severely lacks is a sense of urgency and foreboding, a sense of progression to a fateful conclusion. They're all laughing and teasing the Vietnamese hooker with the black guy's alabama snake in one scene, and in the next they're getting shot at by a sniper. Just a succession of scenes strung together in a haphazard manner. APOCALYPSE NOW is similarly constructed as a series of scenes that depict the American dream gatecrashing and being gatecrashed by the war but there's that sense of urgency that makes it riveting.",,Anonymous,Drama

Great movie...but,This movie to me is one of the all time great ones. Being in the military I loved the basic training part...especially now that I'm an instructor I love it even more....but that is where it should have stayed. It should have been all about basic training and a little more about the characters. The Vietnam part was OK it just turned too political (liberal) and to me it just took away from the initial shock value of basic training. There were parts that I feel were rushed just to be able to get them to the Vietnam scenes...if anything they should have just made like 10 minutes of Vietnam. If you saw this as a civilian then you were really in shock...watching it as a military person brings a huge smile to your face.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An Excellent War Film.,"Stanley Kubrick, the master director behind such masterpieces as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"" comes out with an M-16 and a full case of ammunition for this classic war film, ""Full Metal Jacket."" Shot entirely in England and with a roster of A-List actors, you get a senses-shattering look at the Vietnam War during the bloody Tet Offensive. This film delivers what it says: ""The Best War Film Ever Made"" and that tag line certainly describes it well. Matthew Modine's Private Joker is both comical and adds humor to this mix but as well as emotional depth and how one is truly altered by war. Vincent D'Onofrio's Oscar-worthy portrayal as the loving-turned-maniacal Private Pyle focuses on the way war recreates people is a chilling reminder to what happened over three decades ago. Of course one can not forget R. Lee Ermey's best film role as Lieutenant Gunnery Sargeant Hartman as the no-nonsense drill officer.The screenplay, written by Kubrick, Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford and based off of Herr's memories in Vietnam as well as Hasford's novel ""The Short-Timers"", is comprised of three ""chapters"": The Marines boot camp on Parris Island, the Marines first experiences in Vietnam and the disturbing yet suspenseful ending in the ruined city of Hue. A lot of people compare the three chapters in the film and say that the first chapter is the best and the other two pale in comparison. I completely disagree. I think the film balances the action and tragedy of all three parts and carefully molds all of them into one great film.All in all, a terrific motion picture experience and one experience you will never forget. Indeed if you want to make a war film, THIS is how to make one.This film doesn't glamorize war in any way compared to other war films in any shape, form or fashion whatsoever. A definite MUST SEE.P.S. Stay tuned during the closing credits (or should I say opening since this film, like many Kubrick pictures, put all the credits at the end) to catch the Rolling Stones playing ""Paint It Black.""",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Once more unto the breach.,"Following upon such previous works as PATHS OF GLORY and DR. STRANGELOVE, Stanley Kubrick again turned his scrutiny to the follies of war in FULL METAL JACKET, based on Gustav Hasford's autobiographical Vietnam War novel ""The Short Timers"". This 1987 drama, featuring a talented non-star cast headed by Matthew Modine, did lukewarm box office in the wake of more grandiose and/or traditional entertainments like APOCALYPSE NOW and PLATOON. But time has been kind to Kubrick's second-to-last film, and to my mind at least, it shines more icily brilliant with each viewing.The film consists of two parts: Marine Corps basic training at Parris Island, South Carolina, where we meet our hero, Private 'Joker' (Modine) and his fellow recruits; and the second, longer section set in Vietnam, chiefly involving the 1968 Tet Offensive.The early scenes are both harrowing and blackly humorous, with a riveting performance by neophyte Lee Ermey (an actual former Marine drill instructor who was originally hired as a technical adviser) as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, who focuses most of his object lessons on the unfortunate Private 'Pyle.' The latter is played by a young Vincent D'Onofrio (of ""Law and Order"").Kubrick's trademark clinical eye is in evidence here, with deep focus compositions that reveal in unflinching detail the dehumanization process of basic training, ostensibly designed to mold from these callow youths the killers desired by the military brass. That the sequence of incidents escalates to a blackly ironic but inevitable conclusion does not diminish its horrific fascination.The story then leaps forward in time to Joker's adventures as a reporter for ""Stars and Stripes"" in Vietnam. Most of the action follows Joker and wet-behind-the-ears colleague 'Rafterman'(Kevyn Major Howard), as they travel ""in country"" with the former's buddy 'Cowboy' (played by Arliss Howard from the opening sequence) and his squad on a reconnaissance mission into the bombed-out city of Hue. There death again rears its head, more randomly this time, and Joker and the other Marines must do what they have to to stay alive.The ending has Joker and his comrades, M-16's at the ready, singing the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" song while marching into the dark and uncertain future. They are alive. They are not afraid.It's a disquieting tale, but its truths seem simple and clear. Kubrick may have had a jaundiced view of the human condition, but there's no doubt he believed in man's ability to survive in dire straits.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"As Deeply Flawed As It Is, I'd Still Take Kubrick's 'Nam Vision Over Stone's","Of all the films spanning Stanley Kubrick's career, 1987's Full Metal Jacket has to be the weakest and most unorthodox of efforts, excluding his feature-length debut Fear and Desire. This was the director's penultimate work, and the one which holds testament to an artist's ability to embrace the fundamental genres of contemporary cinema. Such versatility is surely commendable; nevertheless, Kubrick unwittingly crafted what many would agree to be the worst of his career. In a decade of numerous anti-war features, produced in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, it is hard understanding why someone of Kubrick's calibre actually made this predicament of whimsical proportions. That is not to say this is not something of good intentions, but rather a work which drives its message home to such a degree that it conflicts the nature of its artist.Released seven years following The Shining, Full Metal Jacket marked the second Kubrick picture of the '80s. Twelve years later, Eyes Wide Shut was released posthumously a few months following Kubrick's death. I say this simply to note that Kubrick fortunately avoided finishing on such a questionable feature. The project was first penned in 1980, with the director considering directing a holocaust study, but eventually he opted for something Vietnam based. Two years later, the director stumbled upon The Short-Timers; a retrospective, semi-autobiographical novel written by war veteran Gustav Hasford. Screenwriter Michael Herr (previously famed for his other Vietnam screenplay, Apocalypse Now) was asked to write an adapted screenplay and while originally reluctant to do so, he eventually agreed. The screenplay eventually earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.Prior to filming, Kubrick spent many years researching the entire period of war; pouring over memoirs, documentaries, newspaper cuttings and any related information which could possibly contribute to the overall accuracy of the project. His commitment and dedication to being informed was a tradition Kubrick adopted before embarking on any film-making venture. As with Paths of Glory, it is purportedly claimed that Kubrick was not concerned in shaping a manifestation of anti-war, but instead wanted to matter-of-factly depict the nature of war, i.e. men transformed into killers.Commencing with a montage of young army recruits having their hair shaved off (allegory for the beginnings of dehumanisation), you instantly recognise that you are watching something relatively unique. The sudden cut to the army barracks, the stillness of the blank room and the abrupt barrage of profanity directed at the troops from Sgt. Hartman is both timidly amusing and brusquely alarming. It is the first 45 minutes of Full Metal Jacket which projects a mirage of greatness, with the whole time spent depicting the metamorphosis of young men turned born-again killing machines. This first act is in complete odds with the latter act; when the troops are placed in the combat zone. The film suddenly becomes desperately obnoxious, revolving around grown men making puerile jokes at each other and running around Vietnam aimlessly, with no conscience. I personally believe that the narrative should have remained in the barracks for the duration, simply presenting the viewer with the development of the soldiers, instead of also incorporating their war experiences.It is hard to pinpoint the exact problems with Full Metal Jacket, but I think, for the most part, it comes down to its inconsistencies. For one, very little actually occurs throughout the runtime and there is an icy lack of humanity in many of the scenes, but not in the comprehendible, Kubrickian way. Its ideologies and pathos are concealed by a desire to litter so many scenes with narcissistic humour, and so the audience looses its respect for the characters. On the other hand, the performances are, with all reason, up to scratch; particularly those performances from R. Lee Ermey as the inescapable drill-instructor and Vincent D'Onofrio's role as his pitiful victim. Beyond those two performances lies little else on the acting front, with most of the other performers' roles being compromised of heroic despondency and lashings of misunderstood cynicism. Most of all, the message of the film is entirely jumbled and to such an extent that it is in fact difficult to decipher the underlying crux of the ordeal. One thing is for certain that Kubrick perfectly demonstrates how much of a transformation regular men go through before entering war. Such is perhaps the only way man could cope with such a deathly periphery of mouldering principles.This is very much a work of undermined greatness, a meagre example of something which could have been great, but eventually became a rambling mishap, fuelled by ill-defined notions of grandeur. Throughout the '80s there was a string of hefty and effusive Vietnam pictures, some were good and some were bad. The ironic, tight-fisted Full Metal Jacket lay in the midst of it all and many acknowledged that it contained a concept which could have been so much more.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"kubrick as art, not reportage, still a 10","aside from 'paths of glory' it seems many viewers expect a kubrick film to be 'another movie'---that's not his deal. his goal is always aimed at creating a bit of 'film-art'---not the typical goal. those approaching his work should expect this. how many know this thing was all done outside of London, with tons of palm-trees imported for 'realism'? or that the city of 'Hue' was actually an area slated for demolition to make way for new structures? granted, the 'boot-camp' scenes are authentic---but having 'Gomer' shoot his drill-instructor was hardly believable, as the numerous phony 'jello' splattering from bullet impacts.so why give it a '10'---because it's an 'art-piece', and while anyone familiar with what a .223 American bullet does to one 'hit' by such, and then believes the woman sniper would not be in numerous scattered bits, but alive, begging to be 'sent-on-her-way'? absurd---yet one is transfixed by her pleas for death, and Joker's final compliance---that has no basis in realism---rather dramatic artifice---and well done---you want reality?

"A Delightful Movie, but not the Best take on Vietnam.","Full Metal Jacket is a very well made look at Vietnam, from basic training to fighting combat. In the movie, we are lead by Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine) as he is trained by Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) at a Marine training camp, while recruit Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) finds himself worthless and doesn't think that he can take it from Hartman's pressure. After graduating, Joker goes to Vietnam at a reporter, and meets up with old buddy from boot camp (Arliss Howard). They are pinned down by a sniper and try to find a way out, as Joker realizes the real horrors of war. Full Metal Jacket is terrific but not a perfect war film. It was excellent until Joker went to Vietnam, and then it went a tad downhill but it was still great. Kubrick does a great job of directing once again while Modine is good in the lead role.

And I've never watched a war movie that uses rock and roll music as its soundtrack, as this one does. And I love all the soundtracks.I found it very wired the first time I saw it, but I began to find it so intriguing the second time that I watched it several times. The first half is incredibly phenomenal! So many scenes are iconic! And the second half affords much food for thought. Whether it's the fact that the Joker wears a peace button on his uniform and writes ""Born to kill"" on his helmet, believing that men are of duality, or that the banner reads ""First to go, last to know. We will defend to the death your right to be misinformed"", this half has a sobering taste of irony. Of course, the whole film is full of irony and elements of brainwashing. I think Kubrick was suggesting that the Big tried to convince the public of what it wanted them to believe, by trickery or swindle. Wars dehumanize people and plunge them into a world of h**l.By the way, many of the shots in this film are beautifully photographed. And the final scene is equally impressive.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

From the psychotic redneck gunner who slaughters Vietnamese civilians to the uptight Marine commander who believes the cause of the war is just, the movie is packed with characters that weave and overlap to paint the dark, dryly humorous but ultimately disturbing picture of war, suffering, and most of all, insanity. It shows that the perfect soldier is the perfect killer, and the perfect killer is inevitably a madman. Perhaps the ultimate black comedy.

Overrated.,"Someone wrote exactly what I think and rated it what I did too. I guess I'm not the only one that feels there are two very different parts in this movie.
First is full of character development, great acting, and there was a better and clear direction on what was the point of that act.
On the second part we get action, shootings, explosions, but no direction on where is it going. The journalist is quite superficial, and everyone talking is quite dumb and unidimensional. I didn't feel like everything was being shown in terms of the horrors of a war like that.
After the strong characters on the first part (not many though, really), the second part feels quite shallow and aimless.
I'm guessing the point was to show how horrible is war even from before getting to the front line, so we've got the two halves to portrait that.
I just think they didn't add up as a great story and couldn't care really about the characters that survive throughout. They're all quite basic and crazy triggering freaks thirsty of blood, I honestly (and hopefully) have to believe that in reality not everyone was enjoying killing people.

Kubrick Should Have Stopped While He Was Ahead,"Unfortunately, Metal Jacket shows the brilliant Kubrick in decline, and a long way from his anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory (1958). All in all, and despite some telling episodes, this 2-hours adds up to a rather pointless exercise in wartime experience. Certainly, the first half is undeniable in its powerful expose of Marine Basic Training and the dehumanizing effect. At the same time, contrasting its honest depiction of combat training with the heavily sanitized depictions from such 1950's counterparts as Take the High Ground (1953) or Battle Cry (1955) shows how much truth-telling in the movie industry movie had improved in 30-years. Still and all, the movie halves do not match up well.I see the problem as lying with a script, and its inability to etch its characters strongly enough (excepting the ill-fated Ermey and Pyle) to bridge the gap and pull us into their battlefield predicament. At the same time, we only get a sporadic picture of the one continuing character, Private Joker (Modine). Perhaps, the best Vietnam part is listening to how the head of Stars and Stripes skews journalistic coverage in a propagandistic direction. So, it wasn't just folks at home being misled by their media, but troops in the field by theirs, as well. Anyway, the visuals are hellish in their fiery depiction of the battle for Hue. Then too, it comes as a real surprise that the sniper is a woman, the embodiment, I guess, of what the North meant by their motto ""People's War"". Looks to me, also, that Kubrick and co. had little idea of how to end the 2-hours. So we get a strident male chorus of a children's song, no less, as the platoon stumbles through a twilight world. Whatever else, that imagery does manage to symbolize the war in general.All in all, however, the movie suffers in comparison to such other Vietnam flicks as Platoon (1986) or Apocalypse Now (1979). Too bad Kubrick wasn't 20-years younger when he made this two films in one.",,Anonymous,Drama

Rather empty and meandering exercise that spends about two hours just to tell us that 'the Vietnam War was rather unpleasant'.,"Full Metal Jacket is uneven and oddly uninteresting at the best of times, muddling whatever study of war it wants to make and substituting what should be quality, quality scenes of great drama with iffy bits of 'this and that' action as soldiers sit around, maybe coming under fire, shout a lot and then quite possibly do something stupid enough to get themselves shot. Full Metal Jacket tries to cram in as much as possible to do with the Vietnam War, as it shoots from basic training; to graduation from that; to Vietnam itself; to the battlefield on which the film will conclude whatever documentation, rather than study, it has made. At the be all and end all of it, it's underwhelming at how all this ground and all this distance is covered with not much product at the pinnacle.There are scenes that you feel should work more than you feel they actually do. One such incidence involves a long take of the lead character walking down a muddied Vietnamese road with someone as tanks and trucks drive by beside them. The lead and the other soldier are talking about whereabouts and locations as they glance at a map of some kind. Your attention is drawn to the ongoing number of vehicles rolling on beside them, the dirt road acting as a metaphor for a conveyor belt as a continuous procession of troops are churned out and into their would-be doom as two human beings discuss the would-be whereabouts of a certain location. It captures the Vietnam War as a whole; a place in which a lot of fire power and lot of people kept getting rolled on into as those outranking them desperately tried to figure out what the Hell was going on and where the Hell everyone should be.People say the film is split into two 'parts', but it's not. It's actually one particular 'part', complete with characters and study that materialises into something else that just happens to be set elsewhere. Kubrick introduces his film; sets characters up and in true Hitchcockian style, kills off the one character that drives his opening third. But he is left wanting from there on in ‚Äì with that one, distinct shot that kills a certain someone, I'm tempted to say that the film dies right there in that washroom along with said personnel. What is a pretty brutal, but I would think honestly portrayed, account of what it's like to become a United States Marine, shows various young, drafted Americans being trained to become killing machines for the world of war. But Kubrick is laying a rug under our feet and when the lead character decides it's journalism in which his beck-and-call lies, all this prior show and tell revolving around combat and 'what it's like to be a soldier' was really for not very much, as the lead branches out into another area of expertise. The rug is pulled away and people will say it's clever from Kubrick, I say it's cheating and just a little clumsy.Matthew Modine plays a certain Private Joker, 'Joker' being an alias he is given by his drill instructor Seargent Hartman (Ermey). The use of an alias and avoidance of use of Joker's real name attributes a certain ambiguity as to his identification, a renowned sense that everybody and anybody could 'represent' him as a character or as a real life person. The opening can be read into one of two ways; either you're going to find it a disturbing and very accurate look at the psychological effects of training for warfare or a series of 'fat' jokes that aren't particularly interesting. The fall guy is Leonard Lawrence (D'Onofrio), given the alias 'Private Pyle'. Pyle is the figure of ridicule throughout, with failings to accomplish the physical tasks the army demands consisting of the brunt of events in the opening hour. He is additionally a part of the film's one glaringly annoying scene during which the camera slowly zooms in on him pulling a would-be psychotic face as Hartman talks of Lee Harvey Oswald, himself an ex-marine, when he assassinated a certain person of a higher 'rank' than him. This foreshadows what is to come in regards to Pyle's own actions.The majority of what happens in Vietnam is just stuff strung together. Joker goes from one bombed out location to another; he meets someone he knew from his training; he gets into a daft egotistical confrontation with one of those big, bulky, clich√©d soldiers who exist purely to maim the enemy and enjoy it (think Andy Serkis in Deathwatch). He'll engage in dialogue by some ancient ruins and pay sly reference as to how, deep down, all the people who survive Vietnam will miss it because a little piece of them will remain here given what an ordeal it really is ‚Äì but it feels heartless and a little silly. Kubrick marks his finale with a lot of red tints and smatterings of loose flames here and there, burning up the scenery. It's an obvious visual representation of a decent into some sort of Hell as the final confrontation with a sniper is played out. But when people do get shot, Matthew Modine forgets to react and when other G.I.'s are downed by the Vietcong, there is no real reason to feel for them other than to remember that ""it really happened, thus I must feel bad for those that really suffered this fate"". The film is actually quite a soulless exercise and from what I have seen, is Kubrick's worst work.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The World of Stanley Kubrick; Full Metal Jacket.,"Full Metal Jacket (1987) was Stanley Kubrick's entry into the Vietnam War movie sweepstakes that occurred during the eighties. But to be fair to Stanley Kubrick he planned out this film many moons before the others. But due to his infamous lengthy pre-production schedules, this one took forever to be released. The entire film was shot in England (his new home)and all the sets were built from scratch. Because of the subject matter, he received no military assistance from Uncle Sam. The movie was based upon the shocking novel The Short-timers (a brilliant read I might add that was even more darker and brutal than Full Metal Jacket).The movie was filmed in two parts. The first half takes place in basic training. We follow the lives of a bunch of new marine recruits that are broken down and dehumanized into soldiers. Doctors and Sergents weed out the people who'll either snap or breaks down (those that can't cut the mustard). Part two deals with a soldier's life during the Tet Offensive and the Battle for Hue City.Take a look folks because this will probably the last time you'll see a movie about war (made in the U.S.A. and backed by a major film company) to show war as gritty, nasty and vile. With all of the Patriotism/Nationalism going on today, the lines of free speech and censorship are ever so blurred. Stanley Kubrick pulled another one out of his hat by making an anti-war film that shows the brutality of not only warfare but the dehumanization process that recruits go through. Kubrick's gritty film style and hand held camera work was basically copied and stolen by many film makers today (i.e. Steven Spielberg). It's gotten to the point were you can't even enjoy war films anymore because they're all the same (direction, filming and editing wise).Kudos to Kubrick for taking a chance and making such a non-commercial film. Too bad his cinematic input wasn't more prolific.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The thousand-yard stare.,"A true classic, it is difficult to look away from the screen during a viewing of Full Metal Jacket, hence the review title. Although this is a film about the infamous Vietnamese War, the real war during this production was going on behind the camera. Stanley Kubrick, as he has with his other films, went to extreme lengths to capture the emotion and intensity we see on screen here. From taking upwards of 30 takes for some scenes and tormenting (motivating) his actors, to taking every suggestion from the cast and crew on the direction of the film, Kubrick creates a vivid depiction of life before and during the soldiers' deployment to Vietnam. Although this film isn't perfect in terms of continuity and consistency, this cinematic experience engulfs you, and in my case, provided me with a viewing which you can't help but treasure for life.The film is set over two acts, the first one showing the Marines' experiences during training camp prior to deployment, and the second showing time during the war. Upon writing this review, I'm finding myself tiptoeing around the content of this film, so much like this picture by Kubrick, I will proceed to wrap you in a virtual headlock and not let go until your experience here is over. Raw, unadulterated, and fantastic human emotion, this film has it throughout. From the unbelievable performances in the first act from D'Onofrio (Pvt. Pile) and Ermey (Sergeant Hartman) in the first act, to the conflicted and intriguing performance from Modine (Pvt. Joker) in the second, the emotion portrayed on screen shocks, delights and frightens. Watching this film for the first time as a 6-year-old was quite the adventure. Beautiful cinematography, this film has it. Absolutely perfect music choice, this film has it. True depiction of war, this film has it. Apt and powerful political commentary, this film has it. Examples of the trials and tribulations men (and women) went through during the war, this film has it. I could go on for a while, but ultimately, what this film has is a great element of 'rewatchability'. You'll want to spend hours delving into each detail of this film, the methods used during pre-production, the stunts Kubrick pulled on set, the reasoning behind every single scene and so on. Out of all the films I've ever watched, this has left one of the most penetrating impressions on me and continues to do so whenever I watch it.Cinephiles could debate for eons whether Full Metal Jacket is Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus, and this review does not intend to sway opinions. This is merely a tribute to a profound piece of cinema that has and will further stand the test of time amongst some of the greatest films ever produced.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Full Metal Comments,"I just recently saw this awesome film....I wish I had seen it sooner! I hadn't ever seen full metal jacket until a few weeks ago but finally gave in and watched it. I had heard of it before. I am an incredible stupid *beep* for not watching it sooner. It is an incredibly powerful realistic look at enlisted military service. I think any young people should watch it before they consider enlisting. It gives a nice look at some of the military mindset. Better than Western Front, Platoon, and others. They realistically show that the military does train to kill. That is their job. Indecision and softness physically or mentally on the combat zone gets you killed. Teamwork is survival. Some people just don't make it.It also stars some of my favorite actors. Matthew Modine plays the military journalist lead. I like him on and off screen and most of his work. Vincent D'Norfrio gives one of his best performances. Of course I like most of his work too. Lee Ermy gets it spot on as the drill instructor. He's the real deal folks. Talking about his beloved core. Thats why I rate this movie as so way much higher than Platoon, Apcolypse, and their ilk. It is and feels way realer than them.One minor complaint I have with this movie is that they under represent the number of black marines serving in the unit/war as is usual Hollywood practice in movies and TV. That is why I gave it a nine instead of a ten.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
FMJ is NOT anti-war nor anti-Vietnam War,"M*A*S*H is anti-war. Dr. Strangelove is anti-war. FMJ is more of a documentary about the war experience. There are already enough reviews of FMJ, that I don't need to rehash it here. HOWEVER, people born after 1960/1968 do need a history lesson to understand WHY we were in 'Nam Men will always kill men. That's part of our DNA. Those of us from military families, or those who have served, accept this movie as a true enough account of the military experience, and most service men and women list this movie as a ""top ten"" favorite.The world was different in 1939, different again in 1944/45, different still in 1948/49, and went to hell in a hand basket in 1963/64.It was America's favorite Democrat, JFK who got us into Vietnam after the French were thrown out. LBJ was already committed to Vietnam, by Kennedy, just as Kennedy was already committed to Bay of Pigs by Ike, and Truman inherited WW2, and the A-Bomb by FDR.Beginning with Truman, America and Britain developed the ""Containment Policy"" of stopping Communism where the borders were in 1945. If Truman had lost in 1944 or 1948, and MacArthur had been elected, he would have sent Patton (in 44) into Moscow and ended the cold war before the Soviets got the A bomb in 1949. No Cold War would have meant NO Korea, and NO Vietnam. MacArthur was also extremely AGAINST fighting any war in Asia. During Korea, he wanted to Nuke the Chinese back to the stone age, rather than fight on the ground and lose American and Allied lives. MacArthur warned Ike, JFK, and LBJ to get out of Asia, and none listened.Ho came to Washington in the middle of WW2 to ask FDR to liberate Vietnam from the French. FDR was too busy trying to liberate France from Germany. Ho left Washington angry and changed his colors from democratic to communist.Truman restored Vietnam to France, and refused to allow Patton to advance into Moscow. In 1948, China became communist, and in 1949, the USSR got the bomb. The opportunity to nip communism in the bud was lost.Following success in China, Ho began his CIVIL WAR in Vietnam. Vietnam was two wars at once: Liberate the Vietnamese from France, and change the puppet government in Saigon from democracy to communism.After the French were expelled from Vietnam, IKE sent the first advisers to shore up democratic South Vietnam.Sputnik meant that the USSR could place nuclear bombs into ICBMS and attack the US from space. Ike had lost his opportunity to liberate Russia and Eastern Europe. The Space Race and Apollo project were the civilian face of the nuclear arms race. Rockets strong enough to launch a man to the moon could be used to attack Moscow and Bejing. NOW America and her Allies could only fight the Communists by Proxy.JFK sent more people in and sent troops to protect those advisers, but avoided all out war. THEN JFK was assassinated, and LBJ and the US Congress suspected a communist conspiracy and Vietnam became a ""police action"" then all out war that LBJ was not committed to win. FDR did not care how many civilians were killed in WW2, television made mass murder of civilians impossible. Look up Dresden. Truman dropped fat man and little boy during television's infancy. If CNN had existed before 1945, he could not have done it. Despite carpet bombing by LBJ, Ho Chi Minh would not negotiate. That's the beauty of communism, unaccountability; kill anyone who disagrees with the Chairman. Look up Stalin's purges and Tienamen Square.Truman betrayed the Poles by giving Poland and Eastern Europe to ""Uncle Joe"" Stalin in exchange for Stalin committing Russian troops to Berlin. Poland was a democracy, and ally of Britain and France, and a buffer against the USSR before Hitler invaded. Truman had the world handed to him by FDR and threw it all away.IKE was a democrat but had to run as a Republican because the other Republican candidates wanted to dismantle NATO which IKE had set up to counter the USSR. IKE had to choose hardliner Nixon as his VP. By 1950 MacArthur no longer wanted the Presidency. Mac died in 1964 urging LBJ to get out of Vietnam, but MacNammera constantly urged LBJ to commit more bombing. LBJ should have fired MacNammera, but couldn't since Bobby Kennedy was accusing LBJ of staging a coup. The pressure was on LBJ.Nixon was the wrong man to President in 1968. Perhaps he would have made a better president in 1960, when he was younger, and paranoia had not gotten to him, as it did by 1968 and 1972. Perhaps Nixon would have listened to MacArthur and withdrawn the few American advisers. Kennedy placed more Americans in harm's way. LBJ was committed to protecting Americans already in Vietnam, and was genuinely asleep when the Pueblo was lost to Korea, and someone panicked and shot at a whole bunch of nothing and called it a sneak attack in the Gulf of Tonkin.IF Kennedy had not been killed, or at least not been killed by a Communist sympathizer, then Kennedy or Lyndon could have withdrawn a handful of troops, and Vietnam could have been avoided.American men and women went where they sent. They did what they were ordered to do. We still do.Back to FMJ.I personally do not see anything anti-war about it. FMJ is honest, when other Vietnam War movies were being editorial.R.Lee Ermey as a Vietnam Era DI, is the real deal. His lines about Whitman and Oswald are honest, true, and a little prideful. The USMC wants riflemen like that. That's the job of a Marine, to kill, and that's it. FMJ reflects all of that.""Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar"" - Freud.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A good war movie, brought down by a lack of a center.","Stars: Mathew Modine, Adam Baldwin, R Lee Ermey, Vincent D'Orfornio, Arliss Howard and Kevin Major Howard.Stanley Kubrick had already established that he was a prominent director in Hollywood that made really good films when this came out. This was a good movie. It wasn't great. The film is about the many adventures of Private Joker (Modine) as he goes through boot camp and goes off to the Vietnam War. The first 45 minutes are the intense boot camp program led by R Lee Ermey playing a heartless jerk, doing the best performance in the film. The second half of the film is Joker and his buddies at war, whether it be fighting, or playing around with the dead bodies. My problem with this movie, is there really is no plot or a center to it. It's just a big timeline of somebody's life that ends us wondering, ""Well, what next?""

Perhaps Stanley Kubrick's Best Movie,"I'm a fan of Stanley Kubrick's movies, and ""Full Metal Jacket"" has to rank among his very best - if it's not the best, period. From the very first moment, the viewer is drawn into the film, as we watch young Marine recruits having their heads shaved in preparation for basic training. Then comes - basic training! What a horrific and yet at the same time hilarious thing to watch, as Drill Instructor Sgt. Hartman (played by R. Lee Emery, who was in fact a Gunnery Sargeant in the Marines who served in Vietnam and was told by Kubrick to ""make it real"") hurls ongoing and unrelenting abuse at the men as he prepares them to go to Vietnam. This first half of the movie gives us the character of ""Private Pyle"" (perhaps the most memorable character in the entire movie) - a clumsy Marine recruit at best, who becomes the target of special abuse from both Hartman and his fellow Marines. His ""evolution"" is the most frightening thing in the movie, as he progresses from a kid who obviously shouldn't have been a Marine in the first place to a literal cold-blooded killer. Vincent D'Onofrio was perfect in this part.The second half of the movie shifts abruptly to Vietnam. The movie seems to weaken a little bit in this second half, maybe because it seems that we've seen this before. Movies about combat in Vietnam are hardly rare. Still, there's a great climax revolving around the fate of Eightball (Dorian Harewood) and the final demonstration that Joker (Matthew Modine) - although generally a non-combatant military reporter - has learned his killing lessons well.The odd time, Kubrick (or the writers) throw in what I thought were unnecessary scenes (I think here of the scene in 'Nam where the guys share the prostitute - that's not depicted, but we know what's happening!) That served no purpose in my opinion. The movie also lacks any really organized and consistent plot or story. It's just the experiences of these Marines. Still, it's brilliantly told. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best Vietnam War Movie to date,"""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) is a war drama that accurately displays the hardship of the military, in this case the Marine Corps, during the Vietnam War. The film is through the perspective of Private Joker, played by Matthew Modine, as he navigates basic training and the war. The film is very versatile in that there is obvious drama, but there are moments of comic relief mostly to those who were in the military. I feel the point of this film was to shed light on the actualities of the military during training and war time, which have been improved since Vietnam. According to some veterans I have spoken with in my years, the nail was hit smack on the head.The director, Stanley Kubrick, paced this film perfectly. Even though the pacing was unable to keep my teenage son intrigued, knowing what happens in basic training and having done my time in a war, the pacing couldn't have been better. When the story is being told from the service members point of view, the pacing all revolves around how that member absorbs their surroundings. The payoff is unfortunate, but it is the truth of war. The loss of characters you get attached to during the film is a direct depiction of any war where friends and family are lost, but the end is just as heart warming as it is sad. This is a great film that I would recommend to anyone, especially those interested in the military.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazingly Average,"A movie that's amazingly average. Kind of like the marines (or should I say ""maggots"") ground down by their offices in to becoming autonomous killing machines, audiences seem to lap up conventional opinion likes drones and fail the think for themselves, instead accepting and echoing what everyone has said, or is, saying. The first half of the movie is far better, and feels utterly disjointed and disconnected from the second. By far the most interesting, intense, and grim part of the second half is the section with the hidden sniper, which did draw me out of my state of boredom. The ending was lazy, and the overall the film fall far short of the sum and its parts, failing to develop a coherent narrative, characters, or message. Heck, had it not dragged so badly in parts, and/or seemed so amateurish in its editing, it might not have been so bad. At least 'Full Metal Jacket' is still watchable, but it's not way near as good as the praise that's been lavished upon it. Had this movie been released today, it would have flopped critically and with audiences. But because its an established 'classic', the emperor with no clothes scenario continues ever onwards. Still, it has its merits, unlike that other alleged classic 'The Deer Hunter' (1/10* in my opinion), which is excruciatingly and embarrassingly awful, and similarly lapped up blindly by the masses. Don't view these films by their received accolades, but as a piece of cinema with an impartial eye. It's a pass, just. 6/10*",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Seven-six-two millimeter. Full metal jacket.,"I love Vincent D'Onofrio. I am one of the few that think that ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" is the best of the three because of him. He is an outstanding actor, and I have seen him in many films, but this tops them all for him.The first 45 minutes of this film is a movie unto itself as we watch the interplay between the f*ck-up Pvt. Pyle (D'Onofrio) and the drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey). Ermey played a brilliant over-the-top drill sergeant that would definitely scare anyone out of joining the Marines. His dance with Pvt. Pyle comes to a predictable end as Pyle is transformed into a killing machine. The whole movie is worth this 45 minutes.The Official line: ""Son, all I've ever asked of my marines is that they obey my orders as they would the word of God. We are here to help the Vietnamese, because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out. It's a hardball world, son. We've gotta keep our heads until this peace craze blows over.""After the first 45 minutes, we move into combat. This is where you see real combat soldiers, not some wannabes that look like they are auditioning for Universal Soldier.The soldier's line: ""If I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word, my word is poontang.""""Personally, I think, uh... they don't really want to be involved in this war.

Fails visually,"FMJ is incredible until Pyle goes --understandably-- off the deep end. After that it fails to keep me in the realm of its intended purpose; it's just so obviously not set in Asia, never mind Vietnam; even the helicopters ain't the correct hardware maaan. All that legendary Kubrick meticulous scrutiny to detail simply seems 'absent' in this film's second half: when the theater goes 'Asia'. So because of his other films 'reality' it annoys the crap out of me that he goes 'half-arsed' with this. The palm trees aren't even the native ones to that part of the world and they look planted because they are. The script; however, is simply divine. So, if I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word, my word is reality. It's all in a breath. Should it have been filmed in Asia and not the South East of England? 'Yes'.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Sir, does this mean Ann-Margret's not coming?","This is probably the most accessible of Kubrick's movies, and its also one of the funniest.  The first half, all basic training and all R.

I still can't understand why he was not nominated for an Oscar, but at least he was nominated for a Golden Globe.The second half is not as good as the first.  The movie changes locations and is mostly concentrated on one incident with a sniper.  I still enjoyed it, but the best is over when Ermey is out of the story.Also memorable are Vincent D'Onofrio, Arliss Howard and Matthew Modine, but its Ermey's movie all the way.Great use of music, too - when was the last time you heard Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots are Made For Walking""?",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""I love the commie bastards""","Stanley Kubrick is one of the finest directors to have ever lived. He has made genuine and breath taking works of art in an each and every last genre, from sci-fi, to horror, drama and so forth. Naturally, when Kubrick took on a war film, it was bound to be stunning. The result is just as expected. It's pretty standard for people to distinguish the film as almost two separate movies. To me, that isn't so. The first 'half' is merely to show that the dehumanization starts in training. The inner demons, the act of killing, is brought out to its fullest by their Gny. Sgt. Hartman, played excellently by the awesome R. Lee Ermey. It is also clearly depicts that some men are not as attuned to this natural instinct as others, as seen in Private Pyle who's struggle to become one of these well groomed and structured killers leads to his untimely insanity. Vincent D'Onofrio was just plain psychotic looking, and was so damn good in his role, it frightened me. In a sick but all too true sense, the characters are trained to let go of decency, morality and mercy, as long as they accomplish their mission in the war.In reality though, who am I to say I'd live up to the 'codes of conduct' of war in the field? Who are any of us to say so? Many of us have not been in the heat of battle, had to watch our friends blown to pieces, or the fatal decision to take a life you really don't know. That is the struggle of Joker, who Matthew Modine played excellently by the way. The whole cast portrays this loss of human compassion that savage war has engraved in them. Aliss Howard as Cowboy was pretty good as well, but I loved Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother who has a understandably nihilistic view of it all. I'll never forget his helmet writing, ""I Am Become Death"", from the Bhagavad Gita.It's incredibly hard to name my favorite scene, not just because there are so many to choose from but because of the disturbing content. Sure, there are small jokes here and there, but under lying the whole Vietnam segment is an atmosphere of a strangely accepted brutality which Rafter Man calls ""hardcore"". Whether it to be the scene of Sergeant Crazy Earl's ""best friend's birthday"" or the Alabama black snake scene, it's all just great to watch. Perhaps it's Tim Coleri's scenes as the door gunner. As the bodies fall, all he can do is laugh and accept that war is truly hell. All together a masterpiece of film work and a war film that ranks among the best ever shot.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Pyle's descent, the final scenes with the sniper, etc.etc. It's simply a sublime movie, and no-one questions it.No, what I'd like to add is that this movie looks and feels simply spectacular. Stanley Kubrick's patented long takes, slow zooms and steadicam work, which permeate such wonders as ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"", are in full effect here, as well. The outdoor Vietnam sets are huge, foreboding and 100% real (they were sites in England set for demolition, but put to astoundingly good use as burned-out Vietnamese cities). This really shows how visceral a movie can be - and with not a single CGI shot in the entire movie! That's the coup de grace of this film, which will keep it looking more and more impressive for every passing year.

Best war movie ever?,"I know, that's quite a grandiose statement. But Stanley may have accomplished this with Full Metal Jacket.As many reviewers have pointed out, the film is divided into two distinct parts. The first part of the movie depicts a platoon of marines going through basic training during the 1970's. The second half follows some of those marines as they are deployed to Vietnam.I think Kubrick does a great job depicting both the training and the war sequences. Very realistic. In each part of the movie he does a wonderful job of entertaining the viewer with realistic, intense, thought provoking scenes. There is not constant action, it's not that type of war movie. It is the type of movie, however, that will leave you rethinking the Vietnam war, and war itself, in ways you previously hadn't.In the end, I believe Full Metal Jacket is likely tied for second or third best war movie ever.

The dehumanizing process begins the first day of the training. The drill officer treat the privates literally as ""the lowest piece of life on the planet"", and after eight weeks turn them into violent, resentful, killing machines. By humiliation, yelling, and offending the soldiers are educated to be ""killer machines"". Once in Vietnam, the whole training shown at the beginning makes sense: American soldiers kill with excitement women and children, constant fights and troubles happen between them, instead of being united, and, above all, destruction takes place in the hell known as Due, Vietnam in 1968.

Kubrick came with his Vietnam movie after ""The deer hunter"" (1978, Michael Cimino), ""Apocalypse now"" (1979, Francis Ford Coppola) and ""Platoon"" (1986, Oliver Stone).Just like ""The deer hunter"" ""Full metal jacket"" consists of a part playing in the USA and a part in Vietnam. In ""The deer hunter"" these parts are interwoven, in ""Full metal jacket"" they are sequential. The problem is however not the difference in montage, but the fact that part 2 of ""Full metal jacket"" (the Vietnam part) is very weak.Part 1 is about a Marines training camp. The film starts convincingly enough, showing the shaving of the hair of the recruits. With their hair they lose part of their individuality, and later on we learn that that is exactly the purpose of the training. The training is not so much about acquiring new skills, but more about unlearn existing skills (thinking critically for example). The means to achieve this goal are constantly humiliating all of the recruits, but especially the weakest one (Private Pyle played by Vincent D'Onofrio). At the end of the training drill seargent Hartman (Ronald Lee Ermey) finds out that this method is not without risks. Noteworthy is that the way Kubrick visualizes madness in this segment is very much the same as he visualizes the madness of Jack Torrance in ""The Shining"" (1980).In part 2 one of the recruits has been sent to Vietnam as a military journalist after his graduation from the camp. Operating initially behind the front he finds himself all of a sudden in the heat of the battle during the Tet offensive. Part 2 has no real storyline but is more a collection of individual scenes. The images don't look like Vietnam at all, they look like a dilapidated industrial estate with car tires set on fire (which was not far from the thruth I think). In one of the last scenes of part 2 there is a confrontation with a Vietnamese sniper. I think the intention of Kubrick with this scene was to confront the main character of part 2 with a painful moral dilemma. Already very disappointed in part 2 I didn't feel a thing by watching this scene.As already said, before ""Full metal jacket"" others had made better Vietnam films (especially ""The deer hunter""). I can add that before ""Full metal jacket"" Kubrick had already made a better war film (""Paths of glory"" (1957)).",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fool Mental Jackrabbit,"Since i am quite young, and consequently new to the domain of movies pre-1990 era, IMDb serves as my catalogue for catching up on all the masterpieces. so it was with quite a lot of expectation that i watched FMJ, in-spite of being shockingly disappointed earlier with A clockwork orange and 2001. Kubrick's work to me is...dysfunctional.I am a real admirer of artistic direction and deep, intriguing story lines with philosophical connotations, but i also firmly believe that every movie should be entertaining, be it at a superficial, sensual, intellectual or emotional level. Sadly, FMJ is none; just a collection of distraught, disturbing scenes that display a reptilian, hollow way of movie direction.the first half of the movie, that primarily focuses on the android-like training of the marines, would have been effective had it been juxtaposed with the usual camaraderie and banter of the trainees (like in Band of Brothers). it was creepily unnerving to see and hear joker, pyle and company talk to each other like they were from different solar systems. i've never been to military training camps, but surely soldiers everywhere develop affectionate rapports with their colleagues, right? then we switch over to a make-do Vietnam where the movie gets even shabbier. the fighting scenes look like enacted in a theater (slow motions groans and blood spill), the dialogs seem to have been scripted by arnold, stallone and vin diesel and the storyline seems like a headless chicken, going nowhere and painfully bleeding to death. What kind of a person in his senses would walk onto the war-front, with a peace symbol and a gory message printed on his helmet at the same time, and then expect to justify himself by explaining Jungian philosophy to ticked off soldiers? enough said. time to put a FMJ in the original reels of this nonsense.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Paint It Black,"Stanley Kubrick takes us on a voyage into darkness with this humanity tale of the horrors of the Vietnam war and how it affects the human beings who went through it. This is a story of people, real people and what they must do to survive in the harsh world of military boot camp and, ultimately, in the depths of hell.We see this world of terror through the wide eyes of Matthew Modine. During his stay at Parris Island, he meets his extremely tough sergeant, R. Lee Ermey, and he learns that all of the other recruits are just like he is. Many people believe that boot camp is the highlight of the film and I can see why. I can't think of another movie that makes the viewer feel worried for their own sake when someone is yelling at another character.The first half really sets us up for what's to come. We get to understand our protagonist and end up feeling just like he does. Modine is an everyman type that you can't help but feel for. You know what's going though his head in the bathroom scene because you're thinking the same thing.After boot camp, we're thrust right into the Vietnam scene. Not with combat, but with the way it really was. Prostitutes walking down streets and giving venereal diseases to the soldiers who bring them back home are some of the things you think about when you see the city landscape of where we are.If you've seen and love war movies like I do, you know that after the first combat scene, the feeling of having bullets flying by you just isn't the same. It's different with Full Metal Jacket. The tension in those scenes is drawn out so much that you're hooked into the moment so that even your heart is racing. I believe that these scenes are the best part of the film because there are very few war films that can do that.What makes Full Metal Jacket different from others of its genre is that we know all of the characters. We've met people or are very close friends with characters like Animal, Cowboy, Hartmann, and even Pyle. Very few films do that anymore and to have a war movie do it is something you can't take for granted.The finale sums up everything about the 1950s and '60s. It was the end of an era. When you see the scene, you realize the innocence that was taken away from this country so violently. An entire generation was lost because of this conflict and the world was changed forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Humanizing one the Cold War's worst episodes,"Full Metal Jacket exposes the futility of war - more relevant than ever for the world today given the incessant wars being fought by the US around the world as I write this review.The movie adds a human touch to a war essentially fought in the Cold War chessboard of the 1960s and 1970s. The movie humanizes the suffering of death and raises legitimate questions about the purpose of the war; or indeed most wars.Living in Southeast Asia and having visited Vietnam several times the movie helps one to understand one of the darkest periods in the region's history. No doubt, there were many silent global supporters of the war but still one recognizes the burden of history which contemporary Vietnamese are attempting to shed.The movie is a must watch fictional recreation for anyone interested in understanding the human aspect of war. Stanley Kubrick is a master film maker and Full Metal Jacket will not disappoint even the harshest of Kubrick's critics.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Something about the duality of man,"Kubrick strikes again with a great, fun and genius film about this wild and nightmarish thing called war. Just like with some of his previous films like Paths of Glory or even A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick is not a director that gives a focus on facts but instead empasizes on the effect on human nature. In Full Metal Jacket, we carefully see how war targets at gradually dehumanizing every bit out of a human being. We want killers!The first act is a clear example of that, with a private being the tragic victim of the sickness of war. I have to admit I loved the first act, because it is fun and funny but at th same time it rips my heart and challenged my mind. The characters are brilliant to watch, the humour is so spot-on and there is so much meaning behind everything. The introducton scene is probably my favourite Kubrick intro ever. The clever use of the song, the symbolism behind the idea of it, the first look to our characters who lose a part of themsleves even rom the first scene.Now, the second act might be really slow-paced and kind of all over the place, but it is as meaningful as the first act. Our main character, Joker, though being a soldier, has maintained his morality and personality, he is not cold and still has not become a complete war machine, thuswe have the perfectly placed and written ""something about the duality of man"" scene. He has a heart, he cares for life. And then we see him fail to keep going like that, he has to comromise to the brutality of war and beocme a killer, a man born to kill, a war weapon and completely lose his individuality and character traits and morals.
The second act might be hard to follow, because of the lack of fast-pacing and humour, but it really takes the story to a meaningful finale and we are lead to a realisation about the cruelty of war and how it forcefully transfers a human into a war ultra killing machine. Just take a look at the first and last scene and you can see the transformationPerect camera move, even greater cenmatography, realistic sets and the soundtrack is a blast.One of the most meanigful and important war films ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
10/10,"I like Stanley Kubrick, and I love his films, especially 2001, Barry Lyndon, Paths of Glory, Dr Strangelove and this, his penultimate film. Full Metal Jacket is a harrowing, violent and foul-mouthed film, yet it is superbly done. True, one or two parts may lack tropical realism, but the atmosphere the film creates is extraordinary. The film looks excellent with skillful cinematography. The script is very well crafted and does have a sense of realism, while the story is compelling with the transition from the training at the camp to the bombed Vietamnesse city smoothly done. I am with those who thinks the first half is better than the second, but that is not to say the second half isn't good, it is more than good, but the first half really was outstanding. Kubrick's direction as always is superb, as is the acting especially Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. All in all, one of Kubrick's best and one of the best war movies you will see. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
White Guys (and a Few Black Ones) and Vietnam,"Full Metal Jacket is more a collection of scenes than it is a movie. Ostensibly, it's two parts -- the basic training sequence and then the Vietnam sequence. I say ostensibly because even then it feels fragmented.This is one of those movies that traffics in European nihilism. That is, nothing that happens really means anything except to the people involved, and even then, they're essentially amoral. You know you're in meaningless territory when the most ethical person in the movie is the abusive drill sergeant, Hartman.His job is to make killers and weed out those whose humanity or hesitation would fail them and whatever mission they're on at the battlefield. So he drives them with the brutality of a high school football coach who thinks too highly of himself. He's funny in a psychotic way, spouting off the sorts of insults and racism that gaslighting abusers play off as jokes. But he's not joking. He's the product of the very system he keeps going, the sad irony that the sum total of his life is to be a self-replicating cog.Into this we meet Private Joker, played by pointy-faced, beady-eyed Matthew Modine. He's both a strength and weakness, his strength being his saturnine, overtall looks give him a kind of scarecrow -like presence, his weakness being he brings no real moral center to the film. His participation in helping turn a child-like screw up nicknamed Gomer Pyle (a terrific Vincent D'Onofrio) after a beatdown is never really addressed in the movie. It's just one of those ""Gee, bad things happen"" moments.And this ultimately is what brings Full Metal Jacket down. One could argue that in trying to imitate real life as seen by the people who made the film, random, horrible things happen even to good people. But then the artifice in how such much of the film is made -- with its kooky 60s novelty songs and flippant racism toward the Vietnamese -- constantly remind us this isn't reality but a production. Despite all the technical effort, it's a very 1980s movie, including how easily it denigrates anyone who isn't White while conveniently forgetting not only were the Americans invaders to the land, they lost and had to flee the country in ignominy.This is a movie you enjoy for its parts and not its total. If there's a message in Full Metal Jacket, it's that there is no message. And this doesn't make it bleak so much as irrelevant. Yes, when the movie is over, you'll be able to quote all sorts of lines and recall specific moments. But you won't be able to say what it's about.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
My brief review of the film,"A fascinating, compelling and at times mesmirising depiction of the grueling nature of war and training for war. The film is done in two parts: training and the real thing. The transition makes the film seem confused about its purpose at first, however by the end of the film it ties in fine. The first section of the film is a masterpiece standard portrayal of preparing the troops for war, complete with a commanding performance by R. Lee Ermey. The second chapter is still tautly done ¬ñ the intensity of which can be compared to the second space segment of the director's '2001: A Space Odyssey', however it is not as brilliant. Either way, the movie is always intense and very well shot throughout. However, although being high-powered, the film's condemnation of indoctrination is not very potent. Quite good nevertheless as another entry in Kubrick's collection of films documenting dehumanisation.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very Good Movie,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a good movie that shows the horrors of war and the effects it has on soldiers, but is very shallow in its meaning and message when compared to Kubrick's other films.Great Direction, Good Acting (Good from Matthew Modine, Good from Vincent D'Onofrio, Very Good from Lee Ermey, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Most were pretty good but some were mediocre)), Good to Very Good Story (Very good in the boot camp (first 40%) and Good during the Vietnam War parts), Great Screenplay (Deviates from the source material but is still very whitty and bends the line between comical and serious very well), Cinematography (Very Kubrick in style but still is a bit different as it still has similar tones to traditional war movies), Pacing was generally very slow but consistent to Kubrick style pacing, The build to the climax is not that well done as there are many jumps in the narrative and the resolution does not really exist, Very well choreography war scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

I know I gave it an 8 but it's more like a 7.8 or something. All in all it's a hell of a movie. I say smoke a few bowls, relax and let this movie take you through the life a youngster during the days when boot camp really put you through some snit.

One of my favorites.  Found another error.,"Upon watching this movie for about the tenth time since it came out, I found a goof or error that has not been mentioned. When Hartmann is giving his first speech to the trainees, and the camera pans the barracks, the positions of both Pyle and Joker change. When Hartmann punches Joker, Joker is at the end of the line. In the pan view, Pyle is at the end. They switch places for the punch. After Joker is punched, Hartmann walks up the line of recruits and gets to Pyle. Pyle is in the position previously held by Joker. This movie is great for the emphasis is gives on recruit training. Although I was never in the military, I know several people that were. My son's friend just completed his tour on ""The Island"" and the movie is a little soft compared to the actual training regimen.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Started great but couldn't stay the course,"This is a weird movie on Vietnam war by Stanley Kubrick. It starts as a comedy where the strict training of American Marines are overly dramatized with harsh language which came to me very funny. But later, soldiers get transferred to their troops in Vietnam and at that point, some soldiers happen to develop moralistic thoughts on the meaninglessness of operation. This sharp u-turn is very unrealistic as it is in strong contradiction to their heavily brainwashing training. One of them even wears a peace button on his uniform. I don't believe that in any serious army of the world they would allow soldiers to attach buttons on their uniforms.On the technical side, there is no regular plot just as there is no single protagonist. The story reels around many soldiers at the same time, so you may find it difficult to empathize with them. For this reason, the movie gives a sense of documentary at times. Kubrick tries to impress the viewer with sharp turns from tough soldiers to mourning ones. But through the ending he gets a bit too far. What is that mourning over enemy soldier who had killed several of them a few minutes before?",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very intense war film,"I finally saw the famous Full Metal Jacket. And when the movie was done, I was very disturbed by the film. It's very shocking. I've seen many war films. Some that were pretty accurate, but this was terrifying how accurate it was. I've read many comments about the first half of this film. That that was the best part. I agree, but for different reasons: 1.) It's pretty much on the spot of what boot camp is like. But it is more violent. But they had to ease down for the audience. 2.) The acting is amazing. I actually thought to myself ""I'm not sure if they're actors, or if Stanely Kubrik just decided to go to a boot camp and just ask if they can film what goes on at boot camp for a few weeks. Most points to R. Lee and Vincent. 3.) And it's very intense to watch the pain and humiliation that the recruits put up with.The second half is also disturbing. Espcially the scene with the sniper. Vietnam was one of the bloodiest wars in American history. And this movie proves it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Kubrick gives us a lecture,"I've seen ""Full Metal Jacket"" a bunch of times. I've never been a fan. The boot camp part of the movie doesn't really work. If we are laughing at what the drill sergeant is saying to Private Pyle, then we are laughing at Private Pyle. If we're laughing at Pyle, then we're not going to feel sorry for him. As far as the second part of the movie, it doesn't fair much better. Despite some very effective moments, the non-stop anti-war speechifying takes away much of the dramatic effect. The obvious British locations don't help either. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is not a bad film. It's just not a very satisfying watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
A disappointing and flawed film,"Stanley Kubrick, one of my favorite directors, has made many masterpieces, but this one is really a letdown.  The first half of the movie is great, focusing on the demoralization of the soldiers-in-training that has a tragic ending.  The immensely entertaining Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey) and his barrages of derigatory lines designed to wear out the new recruits adds to the sheer brilliance of the movie's first part.In the second part though, I grew more and more bored.  There weren't enough character development.  I felt nothing for the two soldiers who got slaughtered in an ambush, and at the end when the soldiers shot the girl, as gruesome it may looked, I felt no pain whatsoever.  Also, part two of the movie seemed like a sloppy job on cutting and pasting scenes, and the plot made the soldiers wander around aimlessly.Kubrick may have tried to let the audience feel the no-remorseness and aimlessness that some of the soldiers must have felt in Vietnam war, but this is too cerebral and have left me unengaged emotionally.  Worst of all, the scene where the soldiers were being interviewed by journalists became disgustingly artificial as one by one, the soldiers started to say their one-liners in a perfectly-timed sequence.  The ending where the soldiers march singing the Mickey Mouse Club tune is somewhat a redeeming scene.My advice is, watch the first part of this movie only, turn it off, and watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" as the substitute for part two of Full metal Jacket.  I know no one is perfect, it's just that I expected a lot more from Kubrick.",,Anonymous,Drama

Overrated!,"Full Metal Jacket is an overrated movie but by no means horrible. In fact, the first 45 minutes were fantastic with the marine training led by Lee Ermey. Then once the Vietnam scenes came on, the movie slowed down a bit to the point where I was nodding off.This is about the Vietnam War and the horrors of it. Also, it's about how the soldiers became nobodies to killing machines without no fear.The acting here is solid. I think Lee Ermey steals the show as the drill sergeant. He's the reason why I am not a big fan of boot camps. The other actors were good despite their relatively unknown status at the time.Overall, this is a good movie but I wish the Vietman scenes were better. This is the first Kubrick film I seen, so I should check out his others. I rate this film 7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Almost Like A Documentary,"FULL METAL JACKET is a great movie, but despite what the critics or other fellow users might have written, this is NOT the best Viet Nam movie. FMJ has an almost ""documentary"" like feel to it. You can pretty much cut the movie in halves; the first one being the brutal boot camp training the draftees have to go through. Lee Emrey's role as the brutal D.I. is perhaps the movie's most memorable performance. The second half is basically on-the-field action of some sorts. Don't expect bodies being hacked and maimed in a non-stop barrage of bullets and shrapnel. What we get instead is the camaraderie that exists between the soldiers, what their views are of this war (which are quite disparate!). It is during this last half that FMJ adopts a ""documentary"" feel. True, the very few combat scenes are done with the grace and excellence that Stanley Kubrik is well known for. The eerie orchestral music will remind you of THE SHINING and some ""period"" music (Sixties Pop) is thrown in for good measure.I haven't seen PLATOON, which many say it is THE ultimate Viet Nam War movie, but if you ask me which movie deserves that praise, I'd probably say THE KILLING FIELDS or maybe even THE DEERHUNTER.

"""7.62 millimeter...Full...Metal...Jacket""","One of the most memorable Vietnam movies ever made.Full Metal Jacket is divided into 2 parts: The first half is boot camp, in which the sadistic drill sergeant, Gunnery Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) tortures people like the protagonist, Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine), his good friend Pvt. Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and poor Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). Hartman just mentally rips Pyle to pieces, but it is interesting to watch how he does so and how he runs his camp.The second half deals with Joker being IN the war as a photojournalist. He and Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard) go around the front, interviewing different soldiers until they come across Eightball's (Dorian Harewood) platoon, there they meet Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), a tough killing machine who mainly just follows his superiors.

This film neither blows nor sucks: it punches the viewer right in the gut,"""In Vietnam the wind doesn't blow, it sucks"". This not-so-subtle tag-line (which actually led to some posters being censored in Canada) was used to advertise one of the most brutal war films ever made, one that still resonates with rage and gravitas: Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Based on Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers, the movie can be distinctly divided in two sections. The first one takes place on Perris Island, a boot camp facility where newly recruited Marines are trained before going to fight in Vietnam. It is a brutal training, its aim being solely to turn innocent men into killing machines, and the lifelessness these soldiers are moving towards is evident from the opening sequence, where they all get their heads shaved without as much as blinking. That, however, is nothing compared to how they must put up with their instructor's foul-mouthed orders: Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is one of the scariest film characters of all time, his verbal abuse of every single soldier, especially an obese kid he renames Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), being much worse than anything they could possibly experience in Asia.This point is proved in the movie's second half, entirely set in the 'Nam, where Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine), having completed his training, leads the rest of the unit in a series of bloody missions, behaving in a way that openly contradicts the nickname he was given by Hartman.Kubrick made another war movie at the beginning of his career, and though Paths of Glory (1957) resembles FMJ in its open anti-militaristic position, those two films couldn't be more different: the WWI drama dealt with the injustice of war that takes place outside the battlefield, while Jacket explores the effect of conflicts on the human psyche. In fact, it can be said that the film's analysis of mental distortion is a sort of expansion of themes previously covered in A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, the director's almost morbid passion for humanity's downfall being at its most explicit in those features (there are also echoes of 2001 in the legendary bathroom scene, HAL's actions being mirrored by one of the soldiers).Strangely, though, the build-up turns out to be more shocking and memorable than the pay-off, the Vietnam section clearly suffering from Ermey's absence. The most frightening thing about his performance is of course the fact that he isn't acting: a real Marines instructor who was hired as a consultant for the picture's first half, Ermey was so committed to the job Kubrick hired him on the spot. It is not hard to see why: there aren't that many actors who could be able to shout obscenities the way he does, relentlessly, without ever repeating himself or hesitating (that he also improvised a large part, perhaps even all, of his dialogue adds to the character's iconic status). Thus, how powerful and unflinching it may be, the movie feels a little weak once he's out of the picture (pun not intended). Also impressive is D'Onofrio: best known for Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Men in Black, his portrayal of the miserable, incredibly overweight Pyle (the actor reportedly gained so much weight he actually injured himself during the shoot because he was too heavy) is among the most gripping ever seen in any film, especially when Hartman's violent methods start ripping out his humanity.Apocalypse Now is a great film for its seemingly mythological take on the Vietnam war; Platoon is a milestone because it shows the conflict exactly as it was, unfiltered and brutal; as for Full Metal Jacket, it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath for showing that not all insanity starts in the war zone: sometimes it is woken up earlier, by our very own fellow countrymen.9,5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Yet another Kubrick classic,"After a seven year hiatus following the release of the horror masterpiece The Shining, Kubrick returned with a war film, Full Metal Jacket. The film manages to take a slew of war clich√©s and make them into something wholly original. The movie opens at Marine boot camp, with R. Lee Ermey yelling his head off at all the new recruits. He focuses in particular on Leonard Lawrence, whom he dubs Private Pyle. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a stunning debut, playing Pyle with equal parts lovable simpleton and ticking time bomb. His performance is so unsettling that he (and Ermey's profane Sgt. Hartman) is the most memorable part of the film.The second part of the movie takes place in the Nam, specifically in a fight for Hue City. Pvt. Joker, a Marine reporter, joins his training buddy Cowboy as he documents the battle. While many of the film's fans prefer the first, more comedic half, the second is where the film achieves greatness. The humor here is even darker than in the training segment, and Kubrick uses action sequences for a purpose. Rather than just having explosions to excite the audience, he uses the fight to show the effects of the war on these soldiers. Adam Baldwin's Animal Mother is the most fascinating study.While the two distinct parts of the film divide viewers, the film is truly another triumph for Kubrick. It is the third best Vietnam film I've seen (the first two being Apocalypse Now and Platoon), and like those two films and all great war movies, the conflict is not with the enemy but with oneself and one's allies.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
one of the best anti-war films ever,"'Full Metal Jacket' is structured like a play in two acts, with little connection between the two parts excepting one of the principal characters. The first part describes the brutal basic training that turns young normal kids, just out of their childhood into killing machines. It's sarcastic, tragical funny, with excellent dialogs, pace and logic. The second part looks more like a war movie, which is kind of a paradox because it's a war movie within an anti-war movie. Arrived in Vietman the young people in the America 60s find themselves immersed within the same world of cruelty and immorality as any of their fellows sent to fight the just or the unjust wars of the past and of the present.Kubricks building has an internal balance despite the lack of symmetry of the two parts. The first scene is a typical disconnection between the normal life and the army. The last scenes show our heroes trying to exercise the feelings of human solidarity the real life, but facing the absurd and lack of any logic of the war. The common thread is the strong anti-war message, typical to Kubrick not only in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Probably great then, but slightly timeworn now","I am sure I had seen this movie before, probably after its release, but I had no reminiscences - probably due to being too young. As for Stanley Kubrick, I have ambivalent feelings towards him: I consider him talented and distinctive, but there are two movies being uninteresting to me - Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey... True, all his later films I have found to be at least good, if not more, and the one in question is definitely a good movie.Full Metal Jacket consists of two rather different parts, with only two connecting characters - ""Joker"" and ""Cowboy"". The first part is more intensive and versatile, and many elements have been later used both in other ""serious"" movies and in parodies. R. Lee Ermey (as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman) fills in the screen in total, the roles by Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio could have been more psychological, too much focus on field training and barrack environment. Part 2 - already in Vietnam - is more arid, with many shootings and wrecked buildings resemble battles in Stalingrad, with the exception of climate... The actors are not catchy and scenes depicting one idea or event are too long. The ending could have been more sophisticated as well.Not a bad war movie, but I still like some later ones more, e.g. Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Stalingrad.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Overrated toss,"If you are watching looking for either realism of training or combat, you'll not find much of it. That's ok-you can suspend belief because you're really watching for the incisive political commentary on what was a long and pointless war to save South Viet Nam from the commies. But then you can't find much of that either. This movie is a vehicle for the excellent profanity and vulgarity of R. Lee Ermey in his defining role-well done-in the first half of the film. His abuse results in a predictable outcome, which doesn't have much meaning for the storyline. Toss in some juvenile nicknames and the same Vietnamese prostitute diversion twice and you get the puerile view of ground combat against what proved to be superior enemy to the world's most technologically advanced military force. I can't believe the Marine Corps allowed itself to be featured for this.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
flaws?,"I agree there are some flaws, but the cold inhumanity is one of its core ideas. The inhumanity is what gives it life. It's like another world in there where people don't value life as much and for some reason I took an interest in seeing that aspect. Plus the undecided feeling of it was not a flaw. The who's side are you on deal made it unique. I seriously think that(even though i plan to join the Marines) it is very hard to see the right side of a war. I mean sometimes,yes, it is possible but if someone doesn't know what they're fighting for or doesn't care for that matter makes the war a totally different war and those people are the people that make Full Metal Jacket unique. Basically I think Joker's attitude is like "" I don't care about this war but I guess it's just where I fit"". Plus R Lee Ermey is kick ass in this movie. I laughed my ass off during the first half. Yes the second half wasn't as great but this movie is still one of my top favorites.You can learn more about a person in a hour of play than in a year of conversation ~Plato",,Anonymous,Drama
outstanding film that shows the horror of warfare,"In my opinion, Full Metal Jacket is the best war movie out.  I may be judging prematurely, as I have yet to see Apocalypse Now, but from all the others I have seen, FMJ stands out the most.  The acting is superb from all characters, particularly Modine and Erney, a former Marine Corps Drill Instructor who was originally not supposed to be in the film.  Unlike many other reviewers, I found the second half very powerful and interesting.  I still think the first part is better but the boot camp part is near impossible to beat, excuse the sloppy grammar and wording. Anyway, I highly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Every Recruit for the Marines needs to watch this!,"I had the pleasure of meeting ""Gunny"" Ermey at a Marine Corps Ball.

As we watch Joker progress through his training into live combat we are reminded of how little we knew of Vietnam and what war is really like.The location that the movie was filmed, MCRD Parris Island is as advertised.

Kubrick's Vietnam Opus,"This is the first time I've commented on a Kubrick film on the IMDb. So much has been written about his work, I don't know what I can possibly add, but I'll give it a shot.Of course, the first segment is the best. You get pure, unfiltered boot camp brutality that glues your eyes to the screen. Those scenes are absolutely wonderful. They make you squirm in your seats the same way ""A Clockwork Orange"" did. R. Lee Armey is excellent as the merciless drill sergeant. He deserved an Oscar for his riveting performance.Surprisingly, the rest of the film, set in Vietnam, is more conventional, not what you'd expect from Kubrick. It seems a bit too long and disjointed, with an unnecessarily drawn out ending. Still, there are some good combat scenes, with some especially potent violence later on.It's interesting to notice that Roger Ebert gave it only 2 1/2 stars, but the late Gene Siskel gave it four. I think this is a film that, like most of Kubrick's, really depends on your personal perceptions.Overall, not a masterpiece, but still a worthy effort.Rating: *** (out of ****)116 min/Released by Warner Bros.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fantastic with some poor elements.,"I've been thinking about full metal jacket for about a week now. The more I think about it, the better it gets, but I still have a fair amount of issues that hold me back from really loving this film.There are elements that I absolutely love like the iconic soundtrack and absolutely beautiful cinematography. Private Pyle is an amazing character and private joker is pretty great as well, but they are the only great characters. I don't think Sergeant Hartman is as good as many seem to think he is, I didn't know if I was supposed to laugh or not. This is a problem I have with the film as a whole.I feel tone is conveyed poorly throughout. The translation from very serious scenes, to not so serious scenes wasn't handled well. I didn't know what to feel for so much of the film. There are two moments in particular that suffer from this the most. The first being when Hartman is insulting everyone, and the second is when joker and rafterman meet up with joker's old battalion. During both these scenes I just thought the presentation wasn't very thought-through.Finally I'll just mention some of the themes I thought were quite powerful. Masculinity, the duality of man, transformation and Anti-war is the most prominent. All these themes are presented really well and in a way that, for the most part, doesn't feel preachy.At this stage full metal jacket is probably my least favourite Kubrick film, and I don't even think it's his best war film. I think a huge reason I didn't love it is because of the hype around it, but still, I had a good time and thought it was pretty great.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the worst films EVER,"I am not a big fan of war pics. But I do like some. This is not one of them. I am also  not a big fan of Stanley Kubrick movies. But I do have some favorites. Once again, this is not one of them. The movie starts out really well and I was beginning to think I might actually have a favorite Kubrick film. But I was wrong. Dead wrong. During the film I began to think about two other war movies. The Thin Red Line, and Saving Private Ryan. It reminds me of TTRL because it is so, so, so, very boring. It reminded me of Private Ryan because I needed to think of something else while watching this incredibly boring movie. I have had a ""soon"" to be Marine tell me that FMJ is the best war movie ever made. My friends and I brought him to go see Private Ryan and he said the invasion of Omaha beach was lame. He also said that FMJ was more gory and action packed than Private Ryan. Well now that I have finally seen the film I can judge better.

A masterpiece with Kubrick's ultimate judgment on mankind,"A masterpiece of a great artist is like a universe where one can find uncountable different deep themes and significant ideas. Here I venture my personal interpretation of ""Full Metal Jacket"", a masterpiece of the great artist Stanley Kubrick.In my opinion, Kubrick makes use of this movie to pronounce his ultimate sentence on the human species: an utter condemnation worthy of Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"". Yes, there is a war with people assailing each other like rabid dogs. But this is not a justification. Men are not loathsome assassins because there is a war: war exists because men are this way.Through his own gelid, documentary eye, Kubrick shows us mankind at work, meanwhile ruthlessly judging it, like Gulliver in the land of the wise horses. Are we supposed to hate the satanic drill sergeant? Why? He just does his job, which is to destroy personalities, to turn men into machines. And notice that the consequence of this alienation is not to create better soldiers: all this is done because that's the sergeant's job, because that's human life.Private Joker (Matthew Modine) is the guy who tries to preserve his freedom of conscience and of criticism. Yet the viewer is brought to have an instinctive dislike for the fellow, and in fact the director depicts him with no sympathy. After all, he is a shirker and his continuous jokes are not funny at all. We ask why he doesn't share the sufferings of other soldiers. Perhaps, since he has brain? And who cares intelligence in hell? Indeed, when Joker is (justly) rebuked by a general for his uniform (with pacifist symbols, slogans etc.), he cuts a very poor, ridiculous figure, clumsily showing his dubious academic learning on philosophy, sociology or what is. In conclusion, Joker is a man, the same lousy stuff as others. Of course, women are nothing better: see the two Viet prostitutes, with their exhilarating lines.""Full Metal Jacket"" has enormous merits. The visual effects are fantastic, as always in Kubrick's movies. The escalation of psychological violence in the boot camp and the sense of derangement of soldiers in Vietnam are represented with powerful art. The whole film is pervaded by a grotesque, sardonic humor which is like the sneer of the hell. Which most amazes me is that the director was able to turn obscene talk (which I normally abhor) into true art: in my humble opinion, not even Rabelais succeeded in this exploit.Often the greatest works of art have some minor faults (Dostoewskij's major novels are plenty of defects, for instance). Let me remark a pair of flaws of the film. When the marines are shot by the sniper, we see squids of blood in slow-motion. This is Peckinpah's visionary style of representing violence, which grates much with the cold-blooded documentary-like style, Kubrick's trade-mark, which we find in the remainder of the movie. Moreover: some puns in soldiers' talk, and in fact the most obscene and disgusting, are too brilliantly elaborated to appear authentic: everyone, who has spent a period as a conscript, knows that bright wit is not common goods inside the barracks.""Full Metal Jacket"" is both a terrible and profound masterpiece. It deserves a major place in the history of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Certainly entertaining and polished, but no Apocalypse Now","A film by the legendary Stanley Kubrick is always going to be worth viewing, but by his own standards, this is just nothing more than good.Matthew Modine is Joker, a new recruit in the US marine core. War has broken out in Vietnam and new soldiers are being taken on with more velocity than before. However, rather than just immediately taking us on a trip through the battlefields, Full Metal Jacket starts at the very beginning where new blood is trained and abused, and readied for the harsh realities of war by their gunnary sergeant Hartman. Wickedly played by Lee Ermey, Hartman's dialogue is nothing short of fantastic, almost legendary, and while there's a touch of the overblown drill sergeant stereotype about him, his sheer entertainment value more than compensates.His job is to sort these young men out and train them for battle. Modine's Joker is the one to show a touch of 'spunk' and as such earns his name, not to mention Hartman's respect.Anyway, events take us to Vietnam and where Joker's stationed after induction. As part of a war newspaper, he along with his photographer colleague Rafterman go out to where the action's hotting up. Before too long, war truly breaks out and he finds himself in the thick of it all.That's as much as I can say without entirely ruining the plot, so I'll halt there.The one thing which stands out here is the sheer feel of Kubrick. His movies all have the hallmark of his touch, and it's in absolute evidence here. From the dynamic moving cameras, to the slightly surreal ambiance at times, it has all his trademarks.However, one thing which perhaps is lacking is powerful acting. Modine is pretty staple, and the rest of the players are merely 'there'. Only the gunnary sergeant and Pile are truly impressive and genuinely strong characters.There is also a lack of soundtrack to aid the flow of the story. Perhaps Kubrick felt music wasn't totally suited to this but somehow the empty score detracts slightly.The direction is obviously top class, with some stunning cinematography and amazing shots. Many of the scenes are truly involving such is the clarity and intimacy of how the movie is captured. You really feel part of this one.Furthermore the plot and script is really strong, with an extremely well constructed picture in evidence - it's completely believable and never expects you to suspend your disbelief at all.However, for all its technical mastery and strong narrative, there's an overall lack of genuine punch. Apocalypse Now, for example, leaves you reeling and Full Metal Jacket doesn't really smart like it.While it is a good film, a good war film, it's perhaps not quite the engaging and thought provoking piece of cinema that Kubrick's other efforts were.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Are you kidding me?,"NOT one of Kubricks best works. Rated the same as a Clockwork Orange? What is wrong with you people? Or in the same league as Apocalypse Now or Deer Hunter?

I re-watched it some years later just to make sure my initial impression was correct, if anything it was worse on the second watching. I LOVE much of Kubricks work, like 2001, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange and this was nowhere near those. To reflect that love I have for 2001 for instance, it is rated (here on IMDb) way too low. EASILY, one of the top 5 films of the 20th century, perhaps top 3. Dr. Stangelove is still one of the great underrated films of all time. Kubrick was amazing ""early to mid career"", not so much at the end...",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
two halves make a whole,"This movie is split into two halves. The first gives an excellent depiction of what is done in boot camp. The elimination of the individual. At least a big part of the individual. And it starts with the very first image. The hair cut. Anything that identified you as who you were before you got there is gone. A lot of people have commented on the weaknesses of the 2nd halve of the film. I don't know, maybe it could have been done better. But I think it does a great job of depicting what happens to men who have gone through such training. Men being used as decoys to see if the way is safe for a tank. What normal person would do such a thing. Someone who had been through the Paris Island experience. All the things that happen to them, risking everything as point man for your platoon, risking yourself and others to retrieve one member of your platoon, killing a wounded sniper like you would put a dog to sleep. All this is the result of the training. And to end the film when it did, has the effect of having you wonder - what became of these men- oh, they are your workmates, neighbors, high school teachers, etc.. with such experiences in their memories. and then you think, how are we all, marines or otherwise, conditioned to perceive ourselves and our world. In this respect, the movie has similarities to clockwork orange. perhaps that is why Kubrick chose to do this film.",,Anonymous,Drama

"Military training as a cult initiation. Hilarious, bleak, brilliant.","Full Metal Jacket is one of the best war films ever made. It might be my favourite Kubrick film as well. It shows the dehumanizing effects of war, war as a thing man has created which he cannot control, that then changes decent men into something different, something a bit sinister. Moral corruption seems to be the norm just in the general tone of the way the characters talk to each other. It feels like everyone has accepted their new identities as ""maggots"" even though they're also supposed to be marines. The whole training section shows how one can easily be psychologically broken down and remolded into a weapon for someone else to use. Human life ceases to have any value in such an environment and we see this then play out on the battlefield. But we see the same sorts of behaviours in all sort of religious cults that we call crazy. I'm not saying all soldiers are like this, many are good honorable men but the general mentality of modern militaries and warfare is anything but modern or humanistic. Vietnam saw a visible change in the mentalities of soldiers from what is generally seen and talked about in World War II studies. The men who served in that war seemed to have a sense of heroism about them, as well as the men who commanded them. But the whole tone of Vietnam was different. They counted successes in bodycounts. Pounds of ordinance dropped. Sometimes indiscriminate killing. The commanders in charge are largely responsible. But part of America was lost during Vietnam and never seemed to return. This is echoed wonderfully in how this film ends, with a frightening glimpse into the abyss that is the heart of man, the total and complete loss of a soul and the beginning of a true thousand-yard stare. The key thing though is Hartman and R. Lee Ermey's performance. He's incredibly funny and quotable. He's so wild that you almost don't realize what's actually happening in subtext, it's very easy to just be entertained by him. But his scenes have important things to say about brainwashing and manipulation that we should all take to heart. He sets the stage and tone for everything that happens with the soldiers psychologically. Their own lives cease to matter too as they become more and more attuned to the ""death drive"". Joker talks about the Jungian duality of man even as his own duality remains hidden to him. His Shadow denied even as it lurks behind him. We all need to integrate with that shadow at some point, and we can find truth. Peace and love and darkness all in harmony.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A classic!!...,"This film was on the TV in a pub I was frequenting last week. Being one of my all time favourites I was hopeful there was going to be a repeat showing. Fortunately the same channel obliged and I was able to record it for a viewing today. For me it is one of the three iconic films about the Vietnam War; the others being Apocalypse Now (1979) and Platoon (1986). I'm sure others will be mentioned in dispatches, but these are the three that have served me best. It is a film of two parts.The first part deals with the training of a group of U.S. Marine recruits under the watchful eye of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman. Among the platoon are characters Hartman calls Private Joker, Private Cowboy and, the focus of much of his scorn, Private Pyle. Unfortunately Private Pyle isn't really cut out to be a Marine and keeps making mistakes. It gets so bad that Hartman begins to take it out on the platoon whenever he screws up. This has a rather disastrous effect on Pyle and it doesn't end well for more than one of them.With training over the focus now switches to the theatre of action in Vietnam. We follow Private Joker who has become a journalist working for 'Stars and Stripes' magazine as a combat correspondent. He is sent into the combat zone with his photographer, Rafterman, where he joins up with a platoon that contains his old friend Private Cowboy. They are sent into a built up area to clear out any enemy combatants hiding inside. Having been pinned down by a sniper, it's up to Private Cowboy to figure a way out of the situation. I'll leave you hanging there, if you have seen the film, you'll know what happens, if you haven't well, it's just a little incentive for you to give it a look.Stanley Kubrick had a great eye for detail and looking at this film you can see that every little detail is perfect. I love the look and the feel of it, even though it is of two very distinct and very different parts. Great performances all round; in particular Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker, Vincent D'Onofrio (who some of you may know from TV's Law and Order: Criminal Intent) as Pvt. Pyle and R. Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Hartman. Also worthy of note were; Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother, Dorian Harewood as Eightball, Kevyn Major Howard as Rafterman and Arliss Howard as Pvt. Cowboy.I will admit that I, like most people I know, enjoyed the first part slightly more than the second. I think it's because it has many more memorable, even iconic, scenes in it. But in defence of the second part, it was a hard act to follow! Having said that, the second part does deal with the gritty realities of war and goes some way towards satirising it. I should note there is an excellent soundtrack and the use of various songs throughout is well balanced against the visuals. Over all, a near-perfect war film (IMO) and one which comes very highly recommended.My Score: 9.6/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Pointless cartridge,"Stanley Kubrick only directed a dozen or so feature films over a span of forty plus years and only four in the second half of that period but 'Full Metal Jacket' marks a change from his last few films as it eschews exquisite photography and densely built spacial frames and returns to a more moving and somewhat less formal style. It is however very strictly marked into sections with a Marine corp training part followed by an active service deployment in the late 60's Vietnam War. Within this there is a further break between ""rear with the gear"" and ""ass in the grass"" as the film reaches its zenith in its warzone story.In all the parts of the narrative there are film and media references which suggests that 'Full Metal Jacket' is as much about war media and representation as it is a war film about fictional people in combat and combat units.Released in 1987 this is a Kubrick film that unusually feels like it's following in the footsteps of others and that's because it is. Contrary to his preceding films here Kubrick isn't cutting new ground. This is a chaptered narrative about how war treats people and how people treat war. Its removed enough from the Vietnam War to not be so much about that war, or its geopolitics, or its ideological politics but about war fighting by people in a more general way.I think that this is why it loses focus somewhere along the way and becomes a thematically tied string of military character scenarios about war experience and behaviour. The use of identifiable chapters in the narrative structure certainly reinforce this interpretation.Probably this is also why 'Full Metal Jacket' feels like it's about the media of war, indeed the middle section, or chapter, is centred on a press unit assignment for our protagonist 'Joker'; this sensation is built into the film because it isn't immediately about the Vietnam War: that war is itself a vehicle to reflect - in film making - on war making.The acting is well put forth and Kubrick gets less layered performances from his cast than in his previous two films. Similarly Kubrick directs his cameras more fluidly with less regard to depict spacial forms and more on the humans foregrounding his shots.The sound design and score are quite restrained with an all round audio mix that is again foregrounding the human dialogue.Sets are meticulous but never prominent, they are relegated to the servicemen and their actions just as the cameras frame and audio mix are, and even the film editing follows human beats. Clearly, all parts of Stanley Kubrick's film making here suggest that the characters human war making is front and centre of everything.Ultimately this, combined with the films loss of broader contextual shape and it's lateness to the canon of great American Vietnam War movies, with Kubrick following where others have stepped, means that 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't quite a winning formula for me.Certainly, the first time watching, with little or no prior warning, the opening act, the first part, the first chapter where the Marines are trained is a major feat of film making and makes a strong impression. With repeat viewings the less acclaimed second and third acts, in the field in Vietnam, gather more attention and probably tell the story of this film best: its just people doing war things and military things, that's the whole of it.I rate 7/10 and I recommend to war film fans but if you are unhappy with combat and military people and scenarios be cautious because this film directly deals with war and war machines and how people go along with that.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Some bits of dialog bothered me.,"Kubrick is one of my favorite movie makers, and I agree with most people that, yes, the first part of this movie is great--great dialog and great characters. But, for me, this part and certainly the rest of the movie lacked a personal style--something one definitely looks for and, most of the time, gets from a Kubrick movie. I don't know about you, but I usually come away from his movies realizing I've just experienced things in a new and different way.Something else: in the second part of the movie, it seemed to me that one could ""hear the writers writing"", that is, it sounded like the writers were trying to top one another to see who could come up with best military-style trash talk, catch phrase, or figure of speech. It just seemed to me like they were trying to create characters from dialog, instead of the other way round.Which brings me to the two things that, at lease momentarily, drew my attention away from the story. First, I was born in 1950 and had never heard the phrase ""tear you a new asshole"" in the States until the middle 1980s. Maybe it's been around forever, and I've just lead sheltered life. But I don't remember it being a part of Vietnam-era American guy slang. Second, when I heard Eight Ball (Dorian Harewood) say ""she could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch"" it seemed to me careless writing/editing because this was Willy Nelson's very funny simile in ""Electric Cowboy"". If I had been an editor on this script, I think I would have tossed out this kind of memorable line--certainly if the audience might remember it from another movie.To wrap it up, there were some other things that bothered me about this movie, mostly small but some major. But this is only because it was a Kubrick movie, and I expected a seamless experience. But that's all I have to say here.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Wonderfully Intriguing Look At Vietnam,"I have long loved Kubrick's works, whether it's the post-apocalyptic Dr. Strangelove or the wondrously bewildering A Clockwork Orange, and I have always liked war films. What better than Full Metal Jacket than for me? Answer: nothing. Full Metal Jacket follows the journey of Private Joker and other fellow soldiers as they survive PT (physical training) and then the big one: 'Nam itself. Every character is unique and has been masterfully crafted emotionally by Kubrick. None of the characters ever felt emotionally detached or clich√©', with the exception of Animal Mother, who was your typical tough-as-nails soldier who carries around a machine gun meant to be used as an emplaced turret, but even he feels like he's simply trying to act tough in front of his fellow soldiers. The story is very good as well, and doesn't feel like a clich√©' 'Nam movie, as it constantly throws tiny surprises and plot twists that mix it up and keep it from feeling old and tired. So, despite loving every aspect of the movie, you must be scratching your head wondering, ""Why didn't he give it a 10 if he loved every aspect than?"" Here's why: why the film is artistically a masterpiece and deserves to be watched by anybody and everybody, it doesn't bring anything truly new or revolutionary to the table. So, if your looking for a war movie, this should DEFINITELY be your next pick. I would also recommend picking this movie up along with Across the Universe, so you get a great point of view of both sides of the war, civilian and military. Oh, and while Across the Universe would be alright for any teen to watch, I wouldn't recommend letting the kiddies see Full Metal Jacket, as it has gratuitous language and sexual references. Why are you still reading this? Go watch FMJ!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
War on the go,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket offers a gripping portrayal of the Vietnam War. The film is split into two parts: the first, set in boot camp, features R. Lee Ermey as a brutal drill sergeant and examines the harsh transformation of recruits. The second part follows Private Joker (Matthew Modine) in Vietnam, highlighting the absurdities and horrors of combat. Kubrick's use of intense visuals, sharp dialogue, and dark humor creates a powerful commentary on military life and the dehumanizing effects of war.In summary, Full Metal Jacket stands out as a significant work in the war genre, showcasing Kubrick's skillful direction and his ability to provoke thought about the nature of conflict. The film's powerful performances, striking visuals, and nuanced commentary on military training and combat make it a compelling and thought-provoking experience. While challenging and at times unsettling, Full Metal Jacket remains a testament to Kubrick's cinematic genius and his capacity to engage audiences in a profound examination of war's impact.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Brilliant.,"I just saw this movie a few minutes ago and I am still in shock. Full Metal Jacket is, to be conservative, an extraordinary work of art. The critics who complained about the letdown after the 1st hour do not truly understand the film. Full Metal Jacket is about how the military corrupted and dehumanized a number of innocent men. Boot camp showed how the men were trained into killers. Vietnam showed how the boot camp affected the men. Also, like many Kubrick films, there are a few truely haunting scenes, such as the bathroom scene and the sniper scene (more like a sequence, actually). The 1st hour was excelent, the 2nd was pretty good, and the ending was a masterpiece. I loved how the men wandered off into the woods, singing the ""Mickey Mouse"" song, an innocent yet disturbing scene. I also loved the credits music. Kubrick has really outdone himself. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good but......,"The first half of the movie is very good, showing the reality of the USMC boot camp.  But it did not show the reality of the Vietnam War.  In this movie it makes it look like the only downside to being in the war is getting shot and killed.  They also took away reality of the war like at the part where it shows a camera man filming the soldiers and they all get to say something into the camera like it was planned ahead of time.  And the only good characters was Lennord Larwance nick named Goymer Pyle and Gunnery Srgt. Hartman.  Lennord is a misfit not good at anything then finds out he's an expert marksman and starts improving.  Srgt. Hartman's character is as real as you can get, yelling swear words and insulting the soldiers to get them motivated, he doesn't like Lennord at the beginning but towards the end of boot camp he takes a shine to him.

This ain't no Mickey Mouse s@#!,"I remember when I saw Full Metal Jacket for the first time. I must've been about fourteen or fifteen years old and decided to watch it when it was on late at night of a weekend. I remember being compelled by the first 40 minutes (although finding it slightly repetitive) and finding the rest of it completely boring and aimless. Fast forward five years later to present day and you'll find me currently going through the whole of Stanley Kubrick's filmography and sticking on Full Metal Jacket for a second time. Have my opinions changed? Yes they have.I no longer find the first 40 minutes repetitive. In fact, I think the first 40 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is one of the best things Stanley has ever created. The first 40 minutes are so strong that the rest of the film is unfortunately left in its shadow, but more on that in a bit. This half perfectly illustrates the conversion of human beings into cold, emotionless killers. Right from the off the recruits are stripped of their names and instead given labels. They're all made to have the same hairstyle (or lack of), same clothes and shout only when shouted to. All of them even act like robots when training in unison. All except Private Pyle.The story of Private Pyle's descent into madness is one of the most memorable put on film. At first we find his physical and mental inabilities amusing with the electrifying Lee Ermey shouting hilarious insults at him and Pyle failing miserably at obstacle courses. However, as it progresses the constant bullying becomes incredibly disturbing. There's a fantastically dark moment where all the private's team together to beat Pyle late at night with some soap. In the end you can't help but feel sympathy for him.It all accumulates to the most powerful moment in the film where Pyle goes totally insane in the toilet. Everything in this scene is flawless. The brooding music, Vincent D'Onofrio's haunting performance, the lighting, and the directing. All of this makes for an incredibly atmospheric and frightening scene with a chilling pay-off which is both surprising and unforgettable. The trouble is, how can you follow this scene? The answer is, you can't. So far the centre of the film has been the relationship between Vincent D'Onofrio and R Lee Ermey, thus with these characters gone a new film begins.We're plunged without warning into Vietnam, however unlike my fifteen year-old self, I actually didn't find these parts boring. I just get frustrated because I'm not entirely sure what Stanley is trying to say. We sort of get little snapshots of life in Vietnam with Private Joker bobbing about and meeting folk. The film doesn't really go anywhere, yet it still remains largely interesting, just nowhere near as interesting as the mesmerising first half. I did like the prostitute encounters though and thought they had a lot of interesting things to say about humanity.The film suddenly gets really good again when the team encounter a sniper. For Stanley Kubrick, it's actually a fairly conventional war scene, albeit brilliantly done. It's full of tension, remains gripping and feels very real. It's incredible to think that the whole Vietnam sequences were filmed in London! Stanley then turns to his unusual self when the group encounter who the sniper is. It's a very uncomfortable and haunting moment which results in the famous Mickey Mouse chant at the very end.I'm not entirely sure what Full Metal Jacket is trying to say, but I'm sure that Stanley has popped in a load of horrendously clever hidden metaphors which still haven't fully been worked out yet. The whole film is of course a visual feast with superb directing from Stanley. However, content-wise I don't think it's as strong as his previous Paths of Glory. Full Metal Jacket may be much better in the technical department, but it feels uneven. Joker is nowhere near as interesting as Pyle and so the film begins to sag in comparison. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film farm more than when I first layed eyes upon it and will certainly be giving it some more watches!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

one of Kubrick's best films....,"One of Kubrick's best films....did not like clockwork as so many did, but in this film loved when Sergeant Hartman cites Lee Harvey Oswald as an exemplary US Marine marksman. The scene perfectly illustrates the total reversal of moral standards in modern warfare. Stanley Kubrick has done anti-war before. ""Paths of Glory"" was hardly a recruiting poster for the French army and ""Full Metal Jacket"" doesn't do much for the US Marine corps either. Based on ex-marine Gustav Hasford's book ""The Short-timers"" (which I recommend as a gripping read), ""FMJ"" concentrates on how ordinary American men were moulded into killers then sent to fight in a war that they never understood. Ignore the bad reviews for this film and ignore the good reviews as well. Watch it and make up your own mind. Love it or hate it, you'll definitely remember it for its depiction of human beings forced to take part in acts of pointless savagery.

Kubrick's weakest movie,"If Kubrick has done only masterpieces then this one fails. Here there is no magic touch, no vivid colors, no famous music score, no fancy camera movements in his style. Very little cinema. And the format 1.33:1 doesn't help.The first part is OK with the training camp. Good psychology. Well done. But that is it. The movie ends. It isn't even spectacular. I don't know what message Kubrick wanted to portray but I think Francis Ford Coppola did a far better job with APOCALYPSE NOW. There is no comparison. Coppola really showed us and gave us an idea of the horrors of war.Unlike all war movies where the action takes place on a vast territory, here all the war scenes wheel around a small abandoned manufacture. Besides a couple of gun shooting scenes there is nothing spectacular with the soldiers always talking supposedly saying so many profound things but I don't get their point. During the film did Kubrick run out of money?",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
The first 1/3 is about as good as a movie can get,"The 1980's brought an onslaught of films depicting...and commenting on...the Vietnam War - and Stanley Kubrick wanted to make his own statement. But, instead of commenting on the war (or war in general) he wanted to take a look at the toll turning young people into killers has on those young people.The result was FULL METAL JACKET.Based on the short story THE SHORT TIMERS by Gustav Hasford, Kubrick focuses his attention on the people being trained (and then set loose) in war and the result is 1/3 GREAT picture, 1/3 AVERAGE picture and 1/3 ABOVE AVERAGE picture.Let's start at the beginning - which is the GREAT part of this movie - the Marine Basic Training portion. This part of the film elevates itself above the norm (and above most other films with this setting) because it, basically focuses itself on 2 characters, Gunnery Sgt. Hartmann - who is in command of the training of these raw recruits - and a sadsack, overweight character nicknamed ""Private Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio). The beatdown and, ultimate result of this beatdown of Pyle by Hartmann is viewed by the audience through the eyes of a 3rd participant, ""Private Joker"" (Matthew Modine) and he witnesses a spectacle.Ermey, famously, was a Drill Sargent and heightened his experience to bring to light a ""based in reality"" over-the-top Drill Sargent who is never pleased with his recruits. It is a tour-de-force performance by Ermey (balanced by Kubrick's Direction to keep Ermey from going TOO FAR over the top). It is said that Ermey could have (should have) been nominated for an Oscar for this performance, but since Louis Gossett, Jr. Recently WON an Oscar for playing a Drill Sargent (in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMEN), the Academy decided to take a pass.And...that is understandable. But what is NOT understandable is the Academy's ignorance of the even more tour-de-force performance of D'Onofrio as Private Pyle. He takes his character from big, dumb, galoot to crazed killer in subtle, scary, realistic way and when the end of this 45 minute first part of the movie occurs, the audience is left shell-shocked.Which is why, I think, the next 45 minutes - following Private Joker (Modine) as a wise-cracking, wry commentator of the war as a reporter for Stars and Stripes - feel lifeless and flat. It had a very hard act to follow and it just didn't quite follow that first act all that well.It is only when Private Joker accompanies a friend from Basic Training, ""Private Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard) on a routine patrol that becomes anything but routine when they encounter a sniper that this film finds it's footing again and the ending is tense with solid commentary on the effect of war on the young people forced to be involved.Every young actor in Hollywood lobbied to be in this film and the ones that made it - like Howard, Adam Baldwin and Dorian Harewood - shine in their brief moments on the screen.This film is another strong Directing effort from Kubrick who tempers any""preachiness"" of war lecture. Instead he lets the audience make up it's own mind, while depicting the horrors in a way that mirrors Kubrick's photographic flair. His past films showed an artists' touch to the pictures on the screen, and while this film is no less artistic, Kubrick mutes the colors, so the emotions and the people are at the forefront...and not the visuals.A smart choice from a smart Director.Letter Grade: A- (the middle does bog down a bit)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to theBank (ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Uncany and all too believable.,"For Stanley Kubrick, this material isn't necessarily new ground. He certainly covered the ideas and motivations behind war in Paths of Glory as well in parts of Dr. Strangelove and Barry Lyndon. Here, he took his most modern take on perhaps the most complex and enigmatic war the United States ever took part of. We follow closely a group of Marine trainees as they pass through many tests in order to become one of the Corps. For the first 45 minutes or so, the drama is unparalleled. On an island totally dominated by an unflinching and cruel drill instructor, these young boys quickly are forced to grow up and become the mindless and dehumanized killers the Marines require. It is here Kubrick seems to have much sympathy for all the privates as they gain knowledge, courage and strength but lose all sense of humanity.The second part follows Private Joker and Rafterman, a journalist and photographer on search for a story to up the morale of the US troops. Unfortunately, they discover that what they have trained for is to simply survive and this is the part where you might just be unable to peel your eyes from the action. If you have seen any war film before, you know how realistic and brutal the action scenes can be. Kubrick, perhaps the greatest atmospheric director ever, plunges us into the middle of an attack on Hue City as well as sneak attacks and other very real and very scary situations.I have to say this is a very unique war film in terms of American cinema. Being the most powerful country in the last half century, our position in any war usually affects the outcome. This is certainly the case in movies like Saving Private Ryan or Platoon. Full Metal Jacket, however, is much more personal than any other war film I have seen. These are sympathetic characters despite their attitude to life and the Vietnamese. Perhaps this is Kubrick's point. For the naysayers, I can understand why they would like the first half and not the second. True, they are polar opposites and at times the film feels like it is wandering aimlessly. But that is exactly what Kubrick wanted. Just like the soldiers themselves, we feel like their is no purpose in this foreign wasteland. Why are we here? Have we accomplished anything? Those are questions you can ask about the war today, which makes Full Metal Jacket all the more creepily prophetic.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
My favorite war movie of all time and one of the best movies ever made,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a powerful, original, well crafted masterpiece that is in a class of its own and in my opinion, flawless. Don't get me wrong, there are many great war movies that are also classics. Full Metal Jacket is unique from other Vietnam War movies as no one made movies like Stanley Kubrick. Stanley had a unique take on the subject matter, got the finest performances possible from his cast and made a film that still looks and sounds incredible nearly thirty years later. Lee Ermy, a decorated Marine and Vietnam War veteran serves double duty as technical adviser and as Drill Sgt. Hartman. He brings both authenticity and an unforgettable, intense performance as drill instructor. From what friends of mine who served in the Marines tell me, the training sequences are one hundred percent accurate. The other half of the film may be slightly less intense, but director Stanley Kubrick's story told through Joker's perspective flows smooth and is no less interesting when Joker arrives in the 'Nam. Matthew Modine is exceptional here and shows great range in his performance. He has a lot of charisma as well as great screen presence. In my opinion, Stanley Kubrick made an excellent choice casting him as he did a great job carrying the film. Of course Vincent D'Onfrio was exceptional as the ill fated Private Pyle and Adam Baldwin kills it Alpha male bad ass Animal Mother. The rock n' roll soundtrack compliments the film greatly and gives it a feel for the period. The characters in this story are brutalized and their lives are changed forever by what they go through in the course of the film.

One of the best Vietnam war movies ever,"I absolutely love this movie! Having been in the military, the basic training scenes really spoke to me. I think everyone who's ever been through basic training knew that one guy in their barracks who was just like Private Pyle. And from the many times I've watched this movie, I absolutely love laughing at Pyle's antics while getting chewed out by the D.I.But aside from my personal feelings for this movie, it is a deep, insightful and oftentimes frightening look into the characters going through 1960's Marine basic training & being sent off to Vietnam. The characters, while you never really learn a lot about them, are by no means two-dimensional. You get all the emotion from them and they come off as real people.I could have lived with the movie just dealing with Private Joker going through boot camp, but the second half of the movie portraying his stint in Vietnam is just another window into his character.If you love Vietnam war movies, this is definitely a must see.

"Compelling war drama takes time, but it entertains.","""ACCLAIMED BY CRITICS AROUND THE WORLD AS THE BEST WAR MOVIE EVER MADE!"" Sez who? Wherever you turn to, there's bound to be a different opinion from anybody who sees and tells all there is to FULL METAL JACKET. What begins as a vulgar training exercise becomes a battling bloodbath at the end. It provides a very tight example of being prepared to live or die in wartime. Slowly, the movie builds up to the point of fair interest when the Marines fight at Vietnam, an element of Stanley Kubrick's unique presentation. The story is compelling and provocative from the start, outweighing the further drawbacks. I would almost have to give the entertainment value a strong ""10"", though, if only it weren't for the last few minutes, which was a letdown, although it gave us a clear mystery about what may be predicted to happen next. For this to be the greatest war movie around, it needs PLENTY of hell-raising, heart-gripping war action to create a higher excitement level, and despite some bloody casualties, there should have been more of it badly. It actually will have viewers wondering why our drill sergeant shoved the hell out of young recruits (including ""Pyle"") preparing for the worst time of their lives. That part is really the best thing about the film. Still, it's a fine war story with a style of Kubrick's own.

One of the Greatest War Films.,"War can make monsters out of anybody, but the desensitization of the effects of war may not be from actual combat. This is a horrible film to sit through, but i is intelligent and knows exactly what it is talking about when it comes to the effects of war. This isn't really a war film so much as it's a study of manic insanity and disturbed behavior. Many people will be upset by the fact that the two best developed characters die about fifty minutes in, but I found it to be an effective way of breaking down barriers that all war films are forced into having. Usually in war films, there are characters you know you live and characters you know will die. In this, you don't get that sense. Any of these people could die, and that's what makes FULL METAL JACKET so uncommonly effective.",,Anonymous,Drama
I've never felt so deeply emotional watching any other movie,"A film by an excellent, talented director of the twentieth century, Stanley Kubrick. ""All-metal shell"" is a 1989 painting in which the author talks about the Vietnam War, but not about the war as a whole, but about how the Marines see it in their heads. He tries to show that the real horror of any war is the horror that is happening in the mind of a soldier.The plot of the film is divided into two parts.The first part tells about young guys who are trained in the ""training school"" (who served understands what I'm talking about), where they are taught to fight, kill, harden mentally and physically.

You'll Never Forget R. Lee Ermey's Performance!,"Movies about Vietnam have been commonplace in the late 70's-1980's. More often that not, masterpieces were created about this topic. Of course, we all know about The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Platoon. Let's add another one to the list: Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. This may actually be my favorite out of all the movies I listed. Kubrick's story is told in two sections; the boot camp sequences at Parris Island and the actual fighting in Vietnam. While the Vietnam scenes are harrowing, nailbiting, and features excellent sound/visual choices, the first half of the film is sheer perfection. R. Lee Ermey as the colorful squad leader and Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle deliver exemplary performances. Watching Ermey turn D'Onofrio into an instrument of death is nothing short of terrifying. Kubrick does not have an extensive filmography so when he directs something, you know its something that needs to be seen. After all, Kubrick created one of the best war movies ever made.
Kubrick's original idea for his movie was to be about the holocaust. After conversing with Vietnam expert Michael Herr, Kubrick scrapped that idea and wanted to tackle Vietnam. Both men read a book called ""The Short Timers"" by Gustav Hasford and both felt it was the ideal book to tackle. Kubrick decided to change the name of the title because he felt the original title was too confusing, and good idea too. Together the three men created the screenplay but of course Kubrick was in control as he always was with his films. The actual screenplay itself is fantastic, but it did come with improvisation. Ermey was an actual drill sergeant for the Marines and he ad-libbed about 50% of his colorful insults. So, maybe Ermey should have also gotten a writing credit. Anyhow, critics seem divided when exploring the film's themes. Personally, it did not feel like an anti-war critique. It is just a straightforward war film that describes training and war itself as is. Isn't training supposed to be the drill sergeant dehumanizing recruits so they can become killing machines?
The film starts off with the recruits entering training camp under the watchful eyes of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). The main focus is on Hartman's relationship with Privates Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Joker (Matthew Modine). Hartman turns Pyle into a killing machine through efficient and terrifying means. Pyle receives grief because he is good at nothing but does discover he has excellent marksman skills which that and Joker's unwillingness to interfere leads to a chilling showdown of Part One. Part Two focuses on Joker's experience in Vietnam. Joker wanted to become a killer, but the Tet offensive he was thrown into will ultimately answer that question as he embraces his role as a combat correspondent.
One of the reasons why I found the first 45 minutes to be perfection is because of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. Ermey, being a lifelong military brat, was born for this role. Kubrick originally thought he was not intimidating enough but was proven wrong. He is a beast at slinging insults, since that is pretty much all he does. D'Onofrio was also not Kubrick's first choice, but he eventually won over the director's heart and was told to gain seventy pounds. Watching him get picked on by Ermey made me feel so helpless but it gave his character many memorable scenes. The second half is not perfect, but still very good thanks to Modine's acting and moral questioning.
Like all of Kubrick's films, the technical aspects are in tip-top form. People may have issues with the second half, but there is no denying the technical skills. The sniper sequences worked for me, but I think the ability of sound mixing and editing comes into play. Kubrick is also known for his visuals and interesting camera angles when it comes to characters lacking a sense of morals. What he did with Jack Nicholson in The Shining and Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, he does with Vincent D'Onofrio. That brow down, eyes up hidden in the shadows that signifies evil. I always think about that climatic scene in the barrack's bathroom where that particular scene took place. Can never forget it! Also, Kubrick's daughter, Vivian did a great job putting together a solid list of songs about Vietnam. No CCR, but hello Nancy Sinatra!
When Full Metal Jacket was first released, it was more of a mixed bag (like most of Kubrick's films). Critics lauded the first half but felt the second half undid the movie. The first half is perfection and probably the best you will ever see in terms of basic training sequences, but the second half is still expertly shot and involves some very harrowing sniper action. The central themes are simple, but Kubrick never wanted to go too deep. He wanted to tell a straightforward war movie and that is what we got. He also gave us R. Lee Ermey, who has the best insults. I am not sure how he came up with this vulgarity, but I loved it. In the pantheon of war movies about Vietnam, Kubrick's masterpiece deserves to be near or at the top.

"The movie was excellent, but you really had to read the book first.","I read and loved the book before I heard the movie was to be made and really had my doubts.  Turning a riveting internal monologue into a passable, let alone excellent screen play is a monumental task.  If you read ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" before seeing the movie, you'll immediately know what I mean.I loved this movie and I loved the book, ""Short Timers"".  I think the book was better, as the book ""Cuckoo's Nest"" was better than the movie.But who cares!  Both movies were monumental successes with superbly realized screenplays.  Other authors should be so lucky when their novels are adapted to the screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Harrowing story done right,"Full Metal Jacket is an exploration of the Vietnam War through the eyes of U. S. Marine recruits. The film is divided into two halves: the brutal boot camp training under the relentless Sergeant Hartman and the psychologically intense combat experiences in Vietnam.Kubrick's direction is meticulous, capturing both the dehumanizing effects of military training and the chaos of war. The first half of the film sees the transformation of raw recruits into hardened soldiers. As the story shifts to Vietnam, the tone becomes more somber as the soldiers confront the horrors of battle. The cinematography and sound design excel in creating a tense and immersive atmosphere, highlighting the relentless tension and sudden bursts of violence.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gut wrenching,Not having watched a lot of war movies. Expected this to be in the likes of Saving Private Ryan but this one was surprisingly weird in Kubrick's style. Like his other movies this too was disturbing and ambiguous.It's like two different movies. The first half of the training with the performances of The sergeant and Leonardo was some gripping drama. Second half was a bit down in tone for sometime but gradually rises up to the masterful ending.Set design was so amazing. It's some outstanding production for that time. Imo the movie is about the moral ambiguity of the Vietnam war or any war in general. Ends with more questions than answers.,8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Nice first part but the second one is disappointing,"Full Metal Jacket is divided in two parts, one takes place in South Carolina, the other one in Vietnam. It shows war machines instead of soldiers. The training in South Carolina is managed by a sadistic boss who takes away the innocence and all hopes of the young boys. Kubrick made a satire not only of war, but of all America, through patriotic songs, yells instead of discussions, and constant humiliations. The aim is to make understand people that soldiers learned their lesson : as the famous helmet says, they are now born to kill. Despite the length of a few scenes, I think it was important to point out the psychological evolution of characters, which make the first part a good part of the movie.As for the second part Vietnam; it is much more boring and useless. It is basically a succession of very similar scenes. I think the director wanted to focus on too many elements which are propaganda, soldiers, living conditions etc, it was too ambitious for a two-hours movie. The other issue is that sometimes, Kubrick only focused on music and images without anything else in the script.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
More a Showcase of Kubrick's Powerful Instincts Than a Dramatic Narrative of the War,"Standing alone, Full Metal Jacket is yet another showcase of Stanley Kubrick's powerful instincts with gritty compositions, drawing out disturbing qualities in his actors and creating an atmosphere in which each of your senses are not so much drawn in as intensely experienced when applied to it. As one among the group of films in the 1970s and '80s about the Vietnam War, it is about the subject matter, yet the subject is not even close to being as deeply felt by the filmmaker. Oliver Stone brought his own front-line experiences to Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and even Heaven and Earth, all of which engage an audience in emotional hurricanes. Francis Ford Coppola achieved the nightmarish effect of war in Apocalypse Now because he subjected himself to such hurricanes in his own nightmarish experience of making the film; he made ruthless, often amoral decisions which largely impacted many of that movie's most affecting images. It's a great film that does not want you to like it. Full Metal Jacket suffers at the hand of what makes most of Kubrick's work great, which is his reasonable detachment from, his automatic response to the material.Full Metal Jacket has by many young men been memorialized as a favorite, on account of its vividly foremost performances by R. Lee Ermey, as the drill commander who barks more catchy one-liners than one would imagine truly incites fear, and Vincent D'Onofrio, who with serene innocence reacts understandably to such laughable quips, which makes him a target from day one, a benign, overweight airhead whose metamorphosis is a masterpiece of horror.There are many scenes in the latter half of this chillingly dry film that seem more theatrical than cinematic, or documentary-like. The first act, easily the most popular among the movie's myriad fans, is promising because it intimately follows a select few faces in a ruthlessly strict boot camp. We are seeing an aspect not much before seen, to markedly memorable, not to mention extensively quotable, effect. What comes later, in the combat zones leading toward and during the 1967 Tet Offensive, sees the boot camp segment as a tough first act to follow. Scenes of the focal platoon's reflections on their casualties, sadly ignorant views on the war, lounging banter, are at times robotically scripted, stiffly physicalized.The movie's final arrangement, in which our platoon is trapped in a desolate zone with an unseen sniper, is brilliant, however. They are projecting every American fear generated by the upending preoccupation with not knowing what against which they must defend themselves. When they finally discover the shooter, point blank, the augmentation and diminishment of the characters who've made it thus far depend on whether or not they realize how little they truly did know before that moment. Even the central character, if one could call him that, does not seem to know just how many volumes it speaks.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
