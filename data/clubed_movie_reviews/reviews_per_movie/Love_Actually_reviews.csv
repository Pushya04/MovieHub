Surprisingly Enjoyable,"I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.And the introductory voice-over by Hugh Grant as we watch an airport full of people hugging made me want to commit an act of violence - either against the people who forced me to watch this film or against myself just to end the torture.Then the most unbelievably shocking thing happened. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, ""Love is all Around"" and I found myself getting sucked into the film.By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable. No-one was more shocked than I.Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there's 8 storylines and the biggest cast list I've seen in a long time. Somehow, it works. You'd think it wouldn't, I know I certainly didn't.If you're looking for a full-length story, this is not the film for you. It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I've seen in recent times, however (I'm just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films).It's not trying to be the meaning of life, it's not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it's only trying to do one thing, and that's say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn't end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind.This film isn't perfect, I'll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It's superficially complicated but is really a very simple film.  It makes a statement: ""love actually is all around"" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn't attempt to do or be anything else.And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition.I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I've read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It's like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it.Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A fabric woven of happy and sad threads,"What I appreciated most about Love Actually was that for the most part, it realistically looks at relationships happy and sad, successful and unsuccessful, with a future and without.  It addresses different forms and levels of love, sometimes straightforward and carefree, sometimes complex and contradictory.  There are schmaltzy happy moments and touching sad ones, moments of great strength and moments of foolish weakness.  The movie is made up of many threads, and of course some threads are stronger than others.The most interesting parts of Love Actually are the times when it addresses the tragic situations where love is self-sacrificing, contradictory, or fragile.  One character's unrequited love is revealed as a noble sacrifice made for another's happiness (the method of finally achieving closure and moving on, however, could only work in the movies).  Another character is shown to be caught between conflicting duties that will, we are led to believe, prevent her from ever being truly happy.  And the strength that a third shows when love is shown to be fragile and her world collapses around her is tragically inspiring.These noble, tragic threads are interwoven with lighthearted comedic ones to produce a fabric that holds together well.  While some characters have to fight for their love, others have simple, happy, straightforward relationships, with love (or whatever) falling in their laps like a parcel from Santa Claus.  And the purely comic moments, like Rowan Atkinson's appearances and Hugh Grant's Christmas-caroling bodyguard, are delightful in and of themselves.There are of course plenty of nits to pick.  Hugh Grant doesn't make a very believable Prime Minister, and even his very pointed speech to his American counterpart -- especially relevant in light of Bush's recent state visit to England -- don't redeem the odd casting.  Others in this forum have commented on the number of fat jokes in the film, and while I agree, I feel I should point out that the entire point of the first such joke is that the character who has fallen for the ""fat"" girl clearly doesn't think of her as fat, and doesn't understand at first who the other is talking about. It's true that calling her fat is ridiculous; she's only large in comparison to Keira Knightley, who must be carrying some vital organs around in her handbag because there's certainly not enough room in her torso!  But that one time would have been enough; the ""fat"" theme gets tiresome later on in the movie.  I also agree with those who have said that much of the nudity is completely unnecessary to the plot, and that at least some of the comedic threads in the movie are formulaic and unoriginal.In the end, I feel that Love Actually is for the most part a thoughtful and entertaining look at relationships, which does not shy away from taking the bad with the good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Clever and delightful, actually.","This was a lovely script, and I was surprised I hadn't heard much about this movie before I caught it on HBO. I turned it on to keep myself company while working and ended up glued to the screen. I really enjoyed it.The movie is a series of vignettes about several different people that seemingly have no connection to one another, although by the end the connections are finally all present and accounted for. There's a fair amount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the characters are quite human and often don't do the right thing. I was caught off-guard by the incredibly successful results of the trip to America, but I laughed pretty hard and decided I wouldn't have written the script any other way. Not everyone ends up getting what they want, but then again that's love, er, actually. Nice little film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A deeply loving film rich in character,"It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded.I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is ... what?Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered by language or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all of the above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrific script. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience; not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience the film. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothing more of them left.**** (A)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I will never grow tired of seeing this Christmas classic over...and over...and over...again and again,"I have lost count of how many times I have watched this wonderfully written and acted Christmas romance themed classic film. At least once a year so that would be at least seventeen (17) times now.

Unapologetically British and totally Christmas,"Love actually is all around on Christmas. ""Love, actually"" is a very British comedy about love on Christmas, and the magic of Christmas and the spirit of Christmas. It's a really clever idea of having many small and completely different stories being the focus of this movie because love comes in different kinds. The clever thing is that somehow all these stories do interact woth each other but each and every one of them serves its own purpose. Emma Thompson I think speaks to the hearts of many women around the globe, and her performance is very poignant and raw and real. Hugh Grant's story is here to remind us of Clinton and Lewinsky. And Keira Knightley of course steals the hearts of many once again. Some very iconic scenes, some great pop-culture moments and a ridiculous song and performance by a great Bill Nighy. ""Love, actually"" is unapologetically British and absolutely ridiculous and bonkers and I love it. A perfect holiday movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Simply perfect,"It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me smile, hug everyone, tell everyone how much I loved them!!! I think the music is the true soul of this movie. Cheers for the director!!! So many beautiful films he's been doing for so long!!! There was no need of marvelous photography, neither splendorous costume...but every detail was placed perfectly. Excellent actors and performances. It was a very good combination of experienced ones and some others one had never seen before. I liked very much how the director showed how open minded the English people are, by the way Liam Neeson talked to Sam and some other aspects on other dialogues as well (related to sex) It is remarkable also the way they mention the American society. Not criticizing the people and the culture, buy yes the government. CONGRATULATIONS ENGLAND!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Overrated,"It's dangerous to criticise a film inexplicably loved by so many people. But this mess of mostly unsatisfying storylines is excruciating. When Alan Rickman comes across as completely unlikeable, something is dreadfully wrong. And the film is completely obsessed with fat shaming. Unfunny and a bit odd. Overrated 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Filled with Whimiscal Characters and Heartwarming Stories,","Love Actually is a great movie with several well developed story lines that all come together nicely and a terrific cast that can be both comedic and dramatic. It certainly wasn't an easy film to make and I'm sure the studio must have considered it a huge risk, telling stories from several characters in the space of two hours, with all of them having little to no connection with the others, but it worked, Richard Curtis clearly put hard work in to this script and gathered a very impressive cast to make it a hit. Of course, with the amount of stories there are, some of them felt underdeveloped, I found Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's to be one of the most compelling, but in the great their story dosen't get any proper closure, Colin Firth's story felt very tight, I would like to have seen more of him with Sienna Guillory, but with a film as crowded as this you are going to feel underwhelmed with certain parts. The films cast really is terrific and is the main reason why a story as complicated and messy as this really works, Liam Neeson shines as a step dad hoping to cheer up the son of his deceased wife, Emma Thompson is delightful as a wife questioning her own decisions, Alan Rickman astounds as a confused husband, Hugh Grant is terrific as a prime minister who discovers love for the first time, every actor puts all their heart in to these roles and they are all a delight to watch. However, the best performance for me would have to be Bill Nighy, who shines in every scene as Billy Mack, playing a character in no way similar to any role he has done previously, he plays a straight up pompous musician, and he does it ridiculously well. Always a fun film to watch at Christmas time, Love Actually is funny, emotional and very sweet, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance film.Set one month before Christmas, we follow the lives of several people falling in or out of love.Best Performance: Bill Nighy",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A few wonderful moments,"I guess everyone goes into this movie knowing it's going to be light and sappy, but it was a lot lighter and sappier than I expected. There were too many storylines - each one wasn't explored enough to build any drama. As others have pointed out, the movie was loaded with clichés and predictable attempts at humor. Somehow Emma Thompson managed to insert some power into the film with her few minutes. Those moments still haunt me a few days after seeing the movie. However, all the cute little scenes don't hang together. Most of the time I felt cheated by the movie even if I snickered at many of the scenes. Seeing Hugh Grant as Prime Minister was a hoot. This is a movie to get at the video store when you can't find anything else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Delightfull Homage to Love,"In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month after Christmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and the member of his household, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), her husband Harry (Alam Rickman) and Harry's secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsch); Harry's employees, Sarah (Laura Linney), a woman with a serious problem in her life, and the designer Karl (Rodrigo Santoro); the writer Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz); the grieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his son, Sam; a porn actress and her colleague; the singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) and his manager; the just married couple Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) and their best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln); a British young man that travels to USA, trying to score women in that country.""Love Actually"" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Simplesmente Amor"" (""Simply Love"")",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A Holiday Fantasy Classic (Yes, Fantasy - Negative Reviewers Get Over It ;-)","This movie does come off as a bit shallow, and it contains characters who are one- dimensional caricatures of themselves. But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is ""number one for Christmas"" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to be taken as a ""serious"" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take it for the fantasy that it is.I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught it first in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to back on a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Duplex."" Since I've caught it on HBO, and I've quickly realized it's one of those movies you can watch repeatedly when flipping channels for a quick ""pick me up"" that only fantasy movies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, if that clues you into my argument.The multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes of Magnolia, and the fact that it's a light hearted holiday theme flick place that device in interesting contrast.I see Love Actually as a new holiday classic.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
My Favourite Christmas Movie,I just adore this movie. Every year I watch it multiple times at Christmas. So many stories all woven together seamlessly with highs and lows across the emotional spectrum.There's a nice mix of actors and they all fit their roles so nicely. The exploration of love and what it means to different people along with what it can cause us to do is all covered.Even having watched it so many times I still get lost in the different storylines and even forget some only to suddenly remember them part of the way through.If you haven't already seen it then do yourself a favour and watch it!---------,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Christmas classic,"Heartwarming and enchanting romantic comedyThe film boasts an ensemble cast of talented actors, each portraying interconnected characters whose lives and stories weave together in a delightful tapestry of love and relationships.From the heartwarming romance between Mark and Juliet, played by Andrew Lincoln and Keira Knightley, to the bittersweet and touching tale of David and Natalie, portrayed by Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon, Love Actually captures a range of emotions and experiences in love.The film's charm lies in its ability to showcase various forms of love - from the innocence of young love to the complexities of long-term relationships. It celebrates the power of love to transcend barriers and connect people from different walks of life.Love Actually also benefits from its well-crafted and often witty script, which brings humor and authenticity to the characters' interactions and conversations.The soundtrack of Love Actually is another highlight, featuring iconic songs that perfectly complement the film's emotional moments and add to its heartwarming appeal.While some may argue that the film's interconnected stories may feel a bit contrived, the ensemble cast and the genuine moments of connection and affection between characters more than make up for it.In conclusion, Love Actually is a delightful and heartwarming romantic comedy that captures the essence of love in all its forms. With its talented cast, touching stories, and memorable soundtrack, it has earned its place as a beloved holiday favorite.If you're looking for a feel-good movie that celebrates love and the human spirit, Love Actually is the perfect choice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Real love actually,"""Love actually"" is a nice movie.

Heartwarming festive classic in spite of its flaws,"Love Actually has a few too many plots that means it's a little too long and some of them don't really come to a satisfying conclusion. The overall package though, is a festive delight filled with heartwarming (and the odd heartbreaking) stories that are distinctly British and obviously all about love.This is an immensely stacked cast with some of the best British talent. Keira Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor could've done with more screen time but there's then enough people to make up for that. Hugh Grant is the best Prime Minister, Emma Thompson is flawless and Liam Neeson rules probably because it's so different from the types of roles that follow.Richard Curtis is very briefly misguided in his direction. The opening monologue takes a brave swing and everything after that is much better and gets there very quickly. A film like this wouldn't feel complete without implementing some festive needle drops which are definitely accounted for and employed brilliantly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
To believe again...,"Love Actually is movie that helps you see how life redefine's it self.Common and extraordinary lives are mixed together with such good taste that you tend to believe that you were probably wrong the last time you were angry because of someone else doings.The cast gave us outstanding performances by Hugh Grant, Liam Neesom and Emma Thompson and characters (the rock star and his manager are just persons to love!).Special chapter for the charming Keira Knightley that just have away herself... and that is to say probably a person very similar to the general and popular idea of what angel's are.A movie just perfect to believe in love again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Bravo Richard Curtis,Like most guys I would never have seen this movie on my own or with male friends. However my girlfriend was in town and I thought a romantic comedy would make an ideal movie for us to see together.I had heard about the reference to 9/11 made at the beginning of the movie and was dreading having to sit through that part. However I was pleasantly surprised to note that the reference was very minor and not particularly cringe worthy either so I am not quite sure why it annoyed some people so much.As regards to the movie overall I quite enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it as an ideal date film. A lot of the reviews here have disparaged the movie because they thought it was too glib about love and very unrealistic. But I think you have to accept that the movie was made to make people laugh and bring the spirit of love into the Christmas holiday period. If you watch the film in that context then it does its job admirably well.However for me the best moment in the film was the press conference given (standing side by side) by the American president and the British Prime Minister. I actually felt like standing up and cheering when Hugh Grant (as the Prime Minister) finally tells the American president to his face and in front of the worlds press that Britain will no longer kowtow to American wishes but will have an independent view of its own.Considering that America is the biggest market for movies it was extremely brave of Richard Curtis to write this scene and he deserves a lot of credit for portraying the American president as rather loathsome and putting into context what the `Special Relationship' really is all about.As Richard Curtis must have known the movie had done okay but not great in the States. However it has cleaned up here in the UK and I'm sure will do very well in the rest of the world too.So Bravo Richard Curtis for standing up for your principals; you are a hero!,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Christmas CLASSIC!!,"Ignore the naysayers who say this movie is too 'unpolitically correct' these days, or take issue with certain 'problematic' scenes because they want something to complain about.Love Actually was made at a time when people could ENJOY themselves and have FUN (remember that?) without worrying about offending one of a number of various different groups.Who cares? Just sit back, and immerse yourself in a fantastic Xmas romcom with a great British cast, lots of warmth and laughs along the way and an atmospheric soundtrack, to boot.And I'd still watch it a thousand time over than the likes of Wicked, which came out this year.

Absolutely delightful,"It is very funny and very touching, while at the same time showing also how some relationships fail to take off, and others destroyed or nearly destroyed, so there is food for thought there as well. I get in a good mood every time I see it, and think it is one of the best rom-coms ever (hence the rating).Recently the director have uttered weird stuff about the lack of diversity, and yes, there is no teuton knight for the golden-haired goodess, which would be true diversity in this day and age, and there is not a single actor from Korea, China or Japan, so, fair enough, it lacks in diversity.

A romantic comedy that does not suck,"Love Actually is a British move about eight couples and their struggles with love.Like Valentine's Day, Love Actually features an a-list celebrity cast; Hugh Grant, Liam Neesan and Kiera Knightly to name a few.The plot of Love Actually is more real and down to earth than your typical American romantic comedy. Most of the character's stories are simple and you can see them in everyday life. The common issues some of these people are dealing with makes the characters more likable and makes the movie feel more personal.Grant plays the prime minister of England and falls in love with a member of his maid staff. Neesan is helping his ten-year-old stepson tell the love of his young life how he feels. Colin Firth just found out his girlfriend is cheating on him with his younger brother and moves to the country where he falls for a woman who does not speak a lick of English.At times the movie does feel a little rushed because of all the completely separate plots going on. At times it can get confusing and a lot of times viewers will be wondering why they haven't seen much of a certain characters in what feels like a long time.All the actors in this movie did a good job for how little screen time they had. Only a really talented group of actors could draw an audience into the characters and story as quick as that group did.Love Actually may not be completely realistic but it does what it aims for.

"Charming, though crammed with storylines","Love actually is probably one of the most positively uplifting films of all time. No one should go into this expecting something bold or novel or profound. It is shallow, trite, naive, and confounding. But it is also charming. Indeed The films strength lies entirely with allowing us suspend our disbelief and be absorbed by its charm. When attempting to judge the film with a disinterested eye, many flaws emerge. The film is too long yet too short- there are too many characters vying for screen time in a 2 and one quarter hour long romcom(most romcoms are 1 and a half hours long). I would have much preferred it if the film were less ambitious and stuck with just 3 characters, maybe the Collin Firth, Hugh Grant, and Keira Knightley characters, for I feel these characters' stories were the most charming of them all. The film also has a tendency to veer towards corniness and sentimentality, and much of the dialogue is terribly average. But I don't care. Especially for the first hour or so, Love actually succeeds in persuading the massive cynic that I am in being absorbed by the film. And that for me is an achievement for any romcom.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A film of vignettes - some of them very good,"Director and script writer Richard Curtis has not done more than six films, and LOVE ACTUALLY was - actually - his directorial debut. It might be his best, too.The acting meets a very high standard. As ever, Emma Thompson cranks out a delightfully thoughtful performance as a wife who knows her hubby is cheating but shows her inner strength in sticking around. The ever evil Alan Rickman is the frivolous hubby. For once, Liam Neeson is not TAKEN up with his abducted daughter but tries to build a relationship with his stepson. The exceptionally gorgeous Keira Knightly marries one fellow but is deeply loved by another in possibly the best vignette in the film, and all kinds of love relations float, including a prime minister caught in the act of kissing his assistant in a children's school play.Incidentally, that prime minister is the usually limited pretty boy Hugh Grant, here with a great dancing sequence... as a British PM who refuses to bow to the US President played by a smug Billy Bob Thornton, of all people.Colin Firth and Lúcia Moniz as his Lusitanian maid also have a cute vignette, though the last bit with the entire Portuguese tribe in tow is quite insulting to the Portuguese.In conclusion: all pretty much impossible, but love seems just as impossible in most cases, so there is a ring of truth to this well-meaning film.Bill Nighy was the clear minus in the film, in my view. He cannot act and his expletive-filled language totally unnecessary in a film with plenty of children.Superb cinematography. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A cheeky jab at all the cheesy Christmas Hallmark movies,"It's pretty cool to see London during Christmas. I didn't know they went all out with ice skating rinks and enormous trees. This movie is definitely self aware of it's humor and what it's doing. It's also very much British humor, definitely cheeky. It's crazy how stacked this movie is with so many great actors. Ok, Billy Bob Thornton as the President of the United States? - now I've seen it all lol. I loved Rowan Atkinson's cameo in this movie.It's a funny, feel-good movie with a good heart. It leaves you with a warm cozy feeling inside. The movie is actually really funny at times. It also feels ridiculously campy and romanticized to the point where it feels like a fantasy. But I see it as sort of a cheeky jab at all the cheesy Hallmark movies lol. I noticed not all of the characters had happy rosy-tinted lives which was really refreshing to see. I actually appreciated how it kept things grounded in reality and made things feel a lot less fantasy and cheesy. The best part of the movie is seeing the different couples relationships and the things they're having to deal with.

Perfect Christmas Film,Absolutely perfect film to watch at Christmas. Covers about 8 separate stories with love as the central theme around Christmas. Some scenes are poignant some are hilarious and some wonderfully romantic. The wonderful romance involves Colin Firth playing a character (with a nod to Mr Darcy's pool scene). The poignancy is largely brought to us by a masterclass in acting from Emma Thompson as a betrayed wife. Bill Nighy also plays a poignant character as an aging rock star. The lead story that brings the feel good factor is the romance between Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon somewhat unbelievable but hugely uplifting. All of this against a Christmassy music soundtrack and with A list actors in supporting roles. A film every humbug should watch.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I'll make my own edit and raise it a star.,"Man, we REALLY loved these interwoven epic dramas in the 2000s, didn't we? As with many anthology films, Love Actually is a hit-and-miss outing that is nothing more than the sum of its individual parts. Thankfully, the hits (porn stand-ins, Linney's brother, Rickman and Thompson, Neeson and his son, Nighy) do outweigh the misses (travels to America, Knightley and the best-man, parts of the Grant and Firth stories).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The movie you didn't know you needed,"Love Actually looks at several different types of love and the challenges we may face in each. It's impossible to watch each of the 7 or 8 scenarios we see and not identify with at least one of them, and likely more than one.Rather than look at long, drawn out love stories, the film examines key moments in each, whether that is overcoming a struggle, feeling a spark for the first time, or finally recognizing what love really is.Rom-com's have notoriously cheesy acting, but that's not the case with this one. The jokes are actually pretty funny and well-delivered, and the acting overall is really solid. Specifically, Bill Nighy, Hugh Grant, and Laura Linney took the top 3 spots in my opinion.Shut off your phone, block off 2 hours of your night, and watch this movie in peace, preferably alone. You WILL feel something, and you'll be happy you watched it after the fact.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Curtis directorial debut fails to deliver,"Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth - Few first-time directors can ever have assembled such a formidable British cast. But Richard Curtis is no ordinary first-time director, and Love Actually is no ordinary debut. The writer and producer of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill has given himself the job of helming his most ambitious project yet - A multi-stranded love story following the lives of nine Londoners in the run-up to Christmas.Grant is the newly-elected post-Blair Prime Minister who develops a crush on his Downing Street maid; Rickman's marriage to Thompson is on the rocks after his head is turned by a younger woman; Neeson is a widower coming to grips with his loss by helping his step-son woo his classroom sweetheart; and Firth plays a writer who falls in love with his Portuguese cleaning lady (Lucia Moniz).Some of the plot-threads lend themselves well to this kind of sugar-coated vignette: Martin Freeman (from TV's The Office) and Joanna Page play stand-ins in a pornographic film - the gag being that they are very tentatively trying to ask each other out while simulating sex acts - but others lack gravitas as a result. Emma Thompson gives a typically emotive performance as a wronged wife who keeps up appearances for the sake of her children, but the power of her scenes are diluted by the frivolity and silliness going on elsewhereAnd therein lies the problem: The key to Curtis' previous successes has been his ability to engage audience affection for his characters. Here there is simply not enough time for this to happen. The action shifts clumsily from scene to scene. Further sub-plots are introduced with yet more hapless, lovelorn characters. It is almost as if Curtis has emptied out his 'Ideas Book' and lumped everything together under the flimsy premise that: a) they are all based in London; b) it's nearly Christmas; and c) er. that's it.Well, almost. What really links all the stories (as the Prime Minister solemnly states in a voice-over at the beginning) is that 'Love Actually IS All Around'. Indeed, the soundtrack to the movie is dominated by a bastardised version of the Trogg's 'Love is all Around' with the word 'Love' replaced by 'Christmas' which a washed-up, has-been rock star (Bill Nighy) is promoting to try and get to the coveted Christmas Number One slot - a nod to Wet Wet Wet's cover of the same song which topped the charts for an eternity thanks to the popularity of Four Weddings and a Funeral. There is no disputing the fact that Curtis is a true romantic - his pursuit of lump-in-the-throat cinematic moments is as relentless as ever and there is plenty here to melt even the coldest of hearts. What irks is his tendency to pigeon-hole his characters into white middle-class dreamers. Not content with making Notting Hill look like a suburb of Henley-on-Thames, here he proceeds to do the same with the rest of London - no wonder they elected Hugh Grant Prime Minister. Love may very well be all around, but men who don't have floppy hair, perfect teeth and Etonian accents, and women who don't look like Kiera Knightley need not apply.When he strays from his well-trodden path of frothy romantic comedy, you get a glimpse of something deeper. Laura Linney's character is in love with a co-worker but she is stricken with guilt about her mentally ill brother who is emotionally dependent on her. Her scenes are nicely handled, understated and genuinely moving but it is hard to take them seriously in the context of the rest of the movie. They are also so infrequent as to be rendered meaningless - you can almost hear Curtis saying: 'Cut. Wow, that was a bit intense - quick, let's play an up-beat pop song and show some footage of Hugh Grant dancing'.And in fairness, he's probably right to do so. It is almost impossible to imagine any Curtis vehicle NOT featuring Grant stuttering, grinning bashfully and generally larking about. It is, let's face it, a winning formula. In this case, it really shouldn't work - after all, he is competing for screen-time with eight other stories - and yet he somehow pulls it off. There are some patchy moments: In one preposterous scene he lambastes the US President (a nice, sleazy cameo by Billy-Bob Thornton) in front of a packed press conference after catching him frisking McCutcheon the night before. One wonders what George Bush would have to do to Cherie Blair before Tony jeopardised their 'Special Relationship'. No matter. It is this story that carries the essence of the wider message - love will beat all the odds and win the day. The chemistry between Grant and McCutcheon in surprisingly strong, but it is the chemistry between Grant and Curtis that carries the movie - so much so that the other stories really only serve as padding, which is a shame because there are some nice moments scattered amongst the cloying sentimentality.Love Actually is a hit largely thanks the reputations of it's director and cast (as well as the main players, there are cameos from the likes of Denise Richards, Claudia Schiffer, Ant and Dec and the ubiquitous Rowan Atkinson), but whether it will match the long-term success of Curtis' previous efforts remains to be seen. Personally, I think the film would have benefited from a stronger central plot and fewer story-lines. Romantic comedy does not lend itself well to the subtleties and complexities of inter-connected plot-threads. This style is better suited to more off-beat (and generally less commercial) movies such as Paul Thomas Anderson's excellent Magnolia.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Perfect popcorn, snuggle with someone you love, entertainment.","After a silly intro about terrorism, the rest of the movie features what, if we're being honest, everyone wants to see: people meeting and falling in love. Its the best part of every love story: so instead of dealing with all the unpleasantness that follows (a la Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind), let's just have excerpts from twelve characters who experience only those good bits.I'm not doing it justice by saying its only the good bits - its more like the most vibrant bits. Two or three stories have a more sombre, sour quality. But vibrant highs and lows are not unique to Love Actually - they're a staple of any melodrama: they are the definition of melodrama! In this context, though, as happy ending as was possible considering the premise of each short story, was affixed.I think he's cottoned onto a good idea with this - take the best (or most interesting) bits from many short stories and stitch them together into one movie. I thought the connecting material was sometimes weak, and i often felt we were just bouncing back and forth from story to story, progressing like a cement-mixer across the narrative. A bit to mechanised, not fluid enough, in other words. Also, i never felt like i got to know these characters. There's no time to really delve into any of these stories - which leaves us with something that's fairly superficial. But not as superficial as you might think.This is indubitably popcorn entertainment, and a fitting choice for a couple looking for a romantic night at home, but you didn't need me to tell you that.7/10Highlights: I was glad i saw this for Bill Nighy, who plays the aging has-been pop star.

It's a Feel-Good movie...,"""Love Actually"" is a nice feel-good movie. It's wonderfully made, but it was quite predictable, too. I really liked the elements they put into here, and the strong love message it was sending, but the ending was predictable, and I could read the next upcoming scenes. Still, it isn't that bad, and overall they made it complete and finished, from the technical sides, too. The music soundtrack used some very popular Christmas hits that almost everyone know about, and the instrumental music was decent. The script and dialogues was very good, it didn't include scenes to make the runtime longer, just the opposite: To make the story tighter and more complex. The acting was a very noticeable thing here, but in a good way. My favorite ""duo"" introduced was Liam Neeson as Daniel and Daniel's son, Sam, performed by Thomas Sangster. Their father-son connection felt very organic, and they were the most entertaining part of the film, even if they weren't showed too much. Hugh Grant as the prime minister was a fun addition, and he came out quite well. Something that annoyed me at first was the story composition were multiple perspectives of different people's relationship was showed. I wished at first to focus on one specific person, but by the end it was fixed up when everything was combined together and didn't feel too random. I had a good time, I can't say my favorite Christmas movie, but definitely something fun to watch if you like romance and good humor (because the humor was very good here).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Horrible morals, terrible execution, misused cast","Love Actually is a collage of stories centering around people living their intertwining lives in the weeks leading up to Christmas. It's also something of a Who's Who of British acting at the time of its release. Almost every single British actor worth note is in this pile of droppings. Power of Christmas, I suppose, for I see no other reason for them to debase themselves like this.So what exactly is wrong with this film?Well, the few upsides first. It is a nice looking film. The locations are nice, the stories are varied, some even interesting, and it has that Yuletide feel to it. And the actors are talented. There are some truly nice scenes and good character moments. But that's because the actors are so good, not because the script is worth anything.And the stories are terrible. Some are merely bland, like the one containing Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher. Some are just wrong, but in a funny way, like the one with Kris Marshall. But the vast majority of them are more than a bit cringe-worthy. We have over-sexualized prepubescents, a best man wooing after the bride, an adulterer, an import bride and far far too many dudes lusting after women based solely on their looks. And this is supposed to be a Christmas movie about the concept of love. Give me a break!The only decent story, where I actually bought the chemistry and thought it kind of sweet, was the one containing Martin Freeman and Joanna Page.

I think the film's main strengths are the acting and the well-developed characters. The standout is Bill Nighy, in an unlikely but actually hilarious role. Though Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are very good as well, in one of the more interesting stories. There is also Laura Linney and Liam Neeson, two talented actors, if you see the two of them in Kinsey you'll know what I mean. Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant and Kris Marshall also delight.

"Americans can copy the formula, and it still won't be good.","Love Actually is a phenomenal Christmas movie. My family and I watch it every year several weeks before Christmas and then on Christmas Eve. Due to our traditions, we celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve rather than day yet I digress.

Ambitious?  No.  Perfect? Yes.,"The film most obviously comparable to Love Actually is Paris Je T'Aime. Although LA never scales the heights of its French counterpart, it never attempts to. In doing what it sets out to, Richard Curtis's montage of love at Christmas is every bit as perfect.It is fair to say that this is very much a fantasy film. There are elements which are completely unrealistic and there is definitely a need for suspension of disbelief. The film does not branch out too far from middle class London with almost all of the cast living in very trendy, modern homes. Where it really succeeds though is that each of the nine story arcs has its own charm – there are no duds. For comedy value, the strongest are those involving Hugh Grant's Prime Minister and Martin Freeman's body double. For good, old fashioned schmaltz it's hard to look past Colin Firth's writer and his Portuguese maid. There's also a strong turn from Laura Linney in the film's most serious arc, as the office girl in love with her colleague for two years but with the burden of a sick brother keeping her from her own life.Love Actually has quickly become a Christmas classic.

Overpacked and Underdeveloped- But A Delight Nonetheless.,"I'm a guy and I actually love Love Actually. It used to be one of my favorite movies, but then I realized it's a little flawed. Nevertheless, Love Actually is a delightful movie.The plot centers around numerous London romances, and love in general, around Christmas Time, all in different forms.Liam Neeson is a recently widowed stepfather, who's stepson, played by Thomas Sangster, is in love with a girl with the same name as his Mom.Neeson has a sister played by Emma Thompson, who discovers her husband, played by Alan Rickman, is cheating on her. They are also related to the Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant. He's in love with a new secretary, who is shamed by others for being a little overweight. (This family tree reveals that the little boy with a crush is related to the Prime Minister.)There are more plots, including, but not limited to: A man coming to America to get laid, sex-scene stunt doubles who fall in love, a writer who falls for a foreign maid, and a rock star who falls for his manager, who is also a man.As I said, Love Actually is delightful. It has wonderful acting- from the older actors like Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson, to the younger ones like Thomas Sangster and Olivia Olsen, who play lovers in the Disney cartoon Phineas and Ferb later on in their careers.There are also wonderful moments throughout, like a proposal scene near the end between 2 people who speak different languages, or a scene when Hugh Grant dances around his office, to a scene involving the song All I Want For Christmas, to a funny cameo from Rowan Atkinson.The best part for me, however, is how Love Actually portrays love. In the world, it comes in many forms. We see eros kind of love, but there is sibling love, and stepchild love. We see straight couples and gay couples. And then there are consequences for breaking this kind of love, such as cheating. Some love stories get happy endings, and other ones do not.And that's what LOVE ACTUALLY is. It's not perfect, and it's not always romantic. Note, I am NOT saying that affairs are love, but it is a sad reality within what once was love.My complaint in many romance movies is that couples have sex and suddenly they are in love. Or they barely know each other, and they suddenly must be together.Love Actually has this flaw too, and some romances are too rushed, such as a proposal from a man after a month of meeting his love, (9 plots is apparently too much drama for 135 minutes), but there is so much more real love in this film then I have seen in most movies based on a Nicholas Sparks novel.Love Actually is not a perfect movie, but I have seen it numerous times and it's a delight each time. It has great romance, great characters, and great humor. And it's one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen, despite its flaws. When it comes to romance movies, this is love, actually.NOTE: Unlike most Christmas movies or rom coms, this is Rated R for graphic nudity and profanity.

A very enjoyable movie about Christmas and love,"Just tonight, I went with my dad to a theater to see the romantic comedy Love Actually. And I must say, while I had seen it before, I truly gained a new appreciation for it after watching it through.The movie's narrative consists of nine intertwined stories set at Christmastime that analyze the complexities of the one emotion that connects all people: love. The characters explored include David (played by Hugh Grant), the handsome, newly elected Prime Minister of England, who falls for a young junior staffer, Sarah (Laura Linney), a graphic designer who finds her love life complicated by her devotion to her mentally ill brother, and Harry (Alan Rickman), a married man who finds himself tempted by his attractive new secretary.Now, I know this all sounds sappy. But the movie manages to compensate for it with a clever and funny script, as well as a very charming cast. Along with Hugh Grant, Laura Linney and Alan Rickman, other great actors include Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, and even Rowan Atkinson (best known as Mr. Bean) as Rufus, a very meticulous and clueless jewelry salesman, who only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of both of them. In addition to being very touching (though a tiny bit mushy at times), this movie has terrific comedy, especially any scene with Bill Nighy's character, musician Billy Mack, and the scene of Rufus putting all sorts of embellishments into gift-wrapping a necklace Harry wants to buy for his secretary without his wife noticing.Also, the music is really, really good. Craig Armstrong's score for this movie is very romantic indeed, and even haunting. In addition, this movie makes really good use of songs, especially the scene of David dancing to ""Jump (For My Love)"" by the Pointer Sisters, and ""God Only Knows"" by the Beach Boys playing at the end, and this is coming from someone who is a Beach Boys fan.Everything considered, Love Actually, while not without hints of sappiness, is a very enjoyable romantic Christmas comedy, that really does a good job delving into the depths of love, and holds up impressively well, especially given it was released about the time I was born. Highly recommended!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Among the very best of its kind, a beautiful tribute to love of all sorts","Richard Curtis is a terrific writer. I'm not convinced he can write anything properly dramatic or serious, but he has proved again and again that he has a wonderful knack for comedy, where his television work on the likes of ""Blackadder"" and ""The Vicar of Dibley"" has occasionally outshone his fantastic work on films like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""The Girl in the Cafe"". Curtis is also a good fantasy writer. No, not fantasy in the Lord of the Rings sense, fantasy as done in Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"". ""Love Actually"" is a beautiful, touching, and genuinely affecting romantic fantasy in which the bits of humor work extremely well.""Love Actually"" works so well as a narrative for several reasons, one of them being that it's fairly unique. The easiest way to describe it would be 'interlocking', but that would sadly put it in the company of trash like Paul Haggis' abortion of a movie ""Crash"" and Inarritu's similarly unsuccessful ""Babel"". ""Love Actually"" is best described as a series of vignettes about various varieties of love.The star-studded cast don't exactly have to act their hearts out but they work perfectly together, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy being the most affecting actors in the film. The film is not especially remarkable visually, but it is satisfyingly well-shot. Curtis' script is nothing short of brilliant, at least until the final scenes. If ""Love Actually"" has flaws, they come in those final scenes. They are certainly contrived, but the rest of the movie does such a good job drawing you in that you barely notice it at the end. This is a remarkable film, one that is hard to forget.9/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A benchmark for all comedy and christmas movies,"Love Actually is an almost perfect comedy. It tells many different stories simultaneously and every single one of them is engaging and funny. Because of the multiple plots the spectator doesn't have time to get bored. The different scenarios are quite diverse and depict people of different ages, cultures, wealth. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that the spectator finds at least one of the stories relatable. Every character goes through ups and downs but the movie rewards us with a feel-good ending, which makes it a perfect Christmas and family movie. I truly believe that love actually is a benchmark for all comedies and Christmas movies out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Keeps Getting Better and Better,"Of course this rates a 10. It's been gaining in popularity for 20 years and is now universally accepted as a classic. If you can watch those closing credits without tearing up, you are more hard-hearted than Scrooge himself. It begins the holiday season for so many people and for me, anytime I see that it is available, I'm waiting on the couch. As soon as I finish this review, I will be tuning in to Peacock to see it for about the 15th time. My daughter even bought me the screenplay as a Christmas gift one year.In this age of cynicism and anger, this beautiful movie reminds us that love actually is all around.

Many vignettes with the positive outweighing the negative,"With Christmas 2023 I finally got around to watching Love Actually. And I have to say it's a fun, endearing, silly and a few touchingly sad moments that make for an enjoyable, if somewhat long, movie well worth seeing.Each of the individual storylines moved a long quickly with some being better developed than others. The best developed plot was the one involving Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson. The Hugh Grant one was silly yet fun. Liam Neeson and the kid from so many movies and TV shows back then was good. The Keira Knightley one was poignant yet unbelievable. The Colin Firth one was also unbelievable yet was so sappy and heartwarming. The whole Bill Nighy aging rocker plot line was a hoot. And the two storylines about the movie stand ins and the chav going to America were cute yet forgettable. Best of all was the one about Laura Linney's distant longing for a colleague that eventually comes to pass, yet not as might have been imagined. That one will stick with me as so touching.Addendum 12/26/23. Reading various reviews and critiques of Love Actually, many are trashing it for being superficial and misogynistic. And yes, there are elements of both in a number of the storylines. The Knightley-Lincoln one was the worst for this, especially with the creepy wedding video. Yet, I found the two best storylines and also the most heartfelt to be those with Emma Thompson and Laura Linney. The first a mother f two young children dealing with a straying husband. The second a single woman trying to start a relationship while also dealing with family issues. Could both characters have been more 'empowered'? Of course. And yet, that's not the way relationships and the world actually work most of the time. To me, both storylines and both actresses gave stellar performances showing a side of life that isn't always about a happy ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I Feel It In My Fingers. I Feel It In My.... Toessss,"English actors and movies just have it. I don't know what it is but they got it.'Love Actually' brings a ton of charm and wit. It has those happily ever after stories, the tragic ones, and those that drive you nuts.Eight may be a lot of legs, but so is eight different love stories in one movie! Nine if you include Billy Mack and his fat managers bromance. You may not get as much closure as you'd like in all these stories, but there's still enough with the rest to make it a great film, and a Christmas one at that. Though, at the end I'm left asking, what about Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003, doesn't she deserve love?'Red Nose Day Actually' is a really nice add on 13 years later. It makes you smile and compliments the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Overrated and creepy ""romance""","The actual rating is way too high. Where is the love in Love Actually? The film is a parade of older male predators preying on clueless, mostly much younger women, wrapped in a holiday facade. The characters are shallow, the relationships inapropriate and the writing reeks of misogyny and lazy storytelling. Great actors are wasted on ridiculous, one-dimensional roles, with disturbing dynamics disguised as romance. Every subplot is either creepy, boring or underdeveloped. Fat shaming, unecessary irrelevant nudity and lowering women in general is quite common. It's baffling that such a poorly conceived movie has been so highly rated it's nothing more than a tedious, tone-deaf mess masquerading as a Christmas classic.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
20th anniversary viewing,"Just two dudes in the theatre watching Love, actually 20th anniversary. Only ever watched this once before, and before last year's Violent Night with David Harbour, this was the only Christmas movie I've ever loved. I also appreciate it more when I consider Valentine's Day (2010) which tried to do the same thing, but didn't really click.Cast was great, quite the packed ensemble. The movie was heartwarming and charming; and despite having a lot of characters it's easy to bond with them. And unlike most Christmas movies it's not too very Christmasy. It's more of a romance than Christmas movie and I love romance.Hugh Grant dancing was funny and memorable; also, seeing him go knocking door to door reminded me of Kit Harington in Modern Love s02. Young Thomas Brodie-Sangster stood out as I just recently watched The Artful Dodger. It's crazy how he seems exactly the same. Showing titanic to a kid seems fine at first glance but then I remembered there's nudity in it. I loved how hopelessly in love he was with his classmate.Of course it's several love stories in one movie. Rowan Atkinson showing up was a random surprise. Billie Mack seemed out of sync with the movie, but it adds a different love story, one between bros. Keira Knightley and Harry the husband kinda hurt because they cheated. But Rick grimes will be legendary for what his ""say it's Christmas carol"" stunt. This is niche but it reminds me of someone who shot his shot exactly the same when Keira Knightley starred on The Graham Norton show, but he called her ""MEGABABE"" lol. Back to the movie, another highlight the writer Jaime and Aurelia who were adorable with the most improbable lost-in-translation love story.A technical aspect I loved about the movie was that the music is used to segue scenes into the next ones. This review is just all over the place because there's so many plot lines, but I think they were managed pretty well. Because the movie had several storylines it felt like it had multiple endings and they all still come together wonderfully. It's the only movie that makes me feel Christmassy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A wonderful love story,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, definitely in my Top 10. Richard Curtis has done a wonderful job of writing and directing a very large cast and yet you connect with each character. Their lives, hopes and dreams of finding or keeping the love that so eludes many of us.The cast is superb. I can't single out one out of them all because they are just all terrific. The way that Mr. Curtis has used music is great. The music selection plays a major role for each character and is perfect. From ""Both Sides Now"" by Joni Mitchell to Kelly Clarkson's ""The Trouble With Love Is"" is both moving and haunting and I don't think I'll ever associate these songs with anything else except this movie. They belong here rightfully. Thank you Mr. Curtis, for giving us this wonderful love story that gives me the hope and courage to go out and find my one true love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Worth a second chance,"When I first saw this film I was distinctly unimpressed. I found the number of different story lines made it difficult to relate to any of the characters or to really care about any of their problems. However, recently I gave this film a second chance and I was glad I did.The film essentially contains eight different romantic comedies. The positive side of this is that there should be something for everyone. If you don't enjoy one story the film will skip to another one in no time.The most enjoyable storyline for me was also the most unbelievable one in the whole film. Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister and his love interest the sweet and fluffy South London maid Martine McCutcheon make an odd couple but if you suspend your disbelief they make a charming pair.If you have not seen this film yet you may or may not warm to it. If you have only seen it once and are not a fan I recommend you give it another try. The perfect film for a winter's night in front of the fire.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love this movie,"I don't know what it is about this movie. I love the cast and the incredible acting. I just for some reason need to watch it a few times a year. I love how the pornstar characters are still so nervous about kissing each other even though they have had a visual relationship.and still are so nervous to kiss for t
he first time. And the absolute respect he gives her even though they have seen each other nude,and how he doesn't assume anything about her and sees her for who she is not assuming she is just some girl who gets naked for anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Truly wonderful... recommend it to absolutely everyone,"This film is truly wonderful.  I went to see it at the cinema twice and have watched the DVD 4 times since it was released.  The inter-twining relationships is nothing short of genius and the all-star cast are perfect. Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson without doubt play my favourite characters as the ageing rockstar and the betrayed housewife.  Hugh Grant is superb as the Prime Minister with a fantastic speech I would love Tony Blair to have given!!The opening and closing scenes at Heathrow Airport Arrivals made me cry, infact, I cried and laughed out loud at every viewing and have still not tired of it.I am astonished to see the bad reviews on the IMDB website - what a bunch of grumpy people there are out there!  When there is so much hatred and violence in our modern world, who wouldn't want to see some light-hearted, uplifting humour?I literally have nothing bad to say about it and would recommend it to absolutely everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wild ride of emotions & situations,"How I view this film depends on what mood I'm in when I watch it. The first time I viewed it on DVD was during an extremely lonely holiday break, and I was devastated and drowning in Kleenex before the opening credits were finished. My most recent viewing found my reactions sliding all over the scale as the various story lines unfolded.Each storyline is a different type of romantic genre -- everything from ""Beavis and Butthead"" humor to painfully exquisite, understated drama (perfected by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman).One of the strengths of this approach is that, if you don't like one style, another will be coming along presently. This is also a weakness.Each vignette has its own strengths and weaknesses, but the majority of the threads are strong. All the characters, no matter how outrageous, are likable. Weaving the stories together takes a very deft touch, and this is where the director missteps most often, with forced transitions that are jolting and confusing.For instance, the story opens with a tight focus on a black man; I'm pleasantly surprised to see so many people of color on screen. But it's not until the end of the picture that the character reappears (after a wild ride of story lines and emotions), and the shocking realization that we've been watching white people almost exclusively for the rest of the picture intrudes on the storyline. The opening and ending shots of Heathrow are extremely compelling because they show love manifesting in *people* -- not just trim, glamorous, white 30-40-somethings. It would've been nice to see that theme carried through the film with more diverse casting. Not just to make a more universal story, but to help ease the plot challenge of interweaving the many characters and story lines.As others have commented, the nudity in the picture was often a hindrance. While it did work to contrast our notions of ""sordid porn"" with the downright ""aw, shucks"" innocence of the characters playing it, the clash of vulgarity and innocence was often too powerful to be anything but distracting and sometimes offensive. It was certainly gratuitous.This is not standard ""let's shut off our brains Sunday evening and just veg out to a brainless romantic comedy"" fare. If you've just gone through a break-up, don't watch it. But if you want to contemplate the many manifestations of love, or just have a technical exercise in different forms of romantic genres, enjoy an evening with this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Big, overstuffed and joyful, just like the Holidays.","After attending its premiere, Emma Thompson thought ""Love Actually"" was ""kind of out there"". Hugh Grant said to her,"" Is this the most psychotic thing we've ever been in?"" And explained in later interviews that it was director and screenwriter "" Richard Curtis on steroids."" Grant added that "" When he writes about love, he really means it "". That may be the secret behind the film becoming one of the most unlikely Christmas classics, a status purely created by the viewing audience, which has grown in both size and devotion over the years. I mean, who ever heard of an R-rated Christmas classic? The critics gave it mixed reviews and pointed out many flaws. But what the audience has responded to most is its obvious and authentic goodwill aided by some exceptional acting.The film is guilty of many of the accusations hurled against it. It's long, it's complicated, it's overstuffed with music, situations, jokes, foul language and an enormous cast whose connections to each other are not always clear on first viewing, with nine love stories. There's married love, unrequited love, the love of friends, first love, stymied love, love at first sight and adolescent fantasy love. There's also infidelity, marital difficulties, gigantic shifts in tone and wildly improbable things happening all the time. The film puts you through a dizzying series of emotions. Though it is essentially light and full of funny moments, it also has scenes that are sad and even tragic, moments that will make you cringe and flawed characters making terrible decisions. In other words, it's a lot like humanity and thus a lot like the holiday season.Curtis had a long career as one of Britain's top comic sketch and television writers often working with his friend from Oxford, Rowan Atkinson with whom he co-created the Mr. Bean character. He was the primary writer for some of Britain's most successful comedy series and when he began writing for movies, he broke through with ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", following that with ""Notting Hill""and ""Bridget Jones's Diary"". This is why he was able to attract this amazing cast of mostly British actors, most of whom had a large international following. One of the complaints of some critics was that such a cast should have been in a big, serious film and were wasted here. That seems like the old Hollywood tendency to ignore comedies at award time. It's this cast that makes the film happen and gives it so much emotional power.The many involvements of love are tied together by the story of old rock star Billy Mack, wonderfully realized by Bill Nighy, attempting to make a comeback with the Troggs late 60's song. ""Love Is All Around"" by replacing ""Love: with ""Christmas"". Within minutes of the film's start his release of a string of sailor's expletives tells you this is going to be no ordinary Christmas film. He constantly ruins the usual promotional gigs by speaking his mind about things, driving his manager, Joe (Gregor Fisher), totally crazy. The song's music video is a tribute and funny take on Robert Palmer's ""Addicted To Love"" and ""Simply Irresistible"" with their very 80s models. Billy would have probably been at his peak in the 80s but judging from the album covers and posters in his office and Joe's Motorhead T-shirt, he was a hard rocker. When they are not in a scene, their video and rising popularity on television are in the background.The biggest stars have the most serious story. Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are a happily married couple with two children. He is the head of a design agency and she's devoted herself to the children. She is also the sister of the new Prime Minister, David (Hugh Grant). Troubles arise for them when Rickman's Harry is tempted by new secretary Mia (German film star Heike Makatsch) who makes an overt play for him, seemingly just for a lark. Thompson's scene accompanied by Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now"" (in her later, deep, smoky voiced version), is the most devastating moment in the film and one of Thompson's greatest as well.Hugh Grant famously dancing around 10 Downing Street may have seemed an unlikely Prime Minister, but this was before Boris Johnson. Grant really didn't want to do that scene, thinking it unlikely for a P. M. but it turned out to be one of his most iconic and one still imitated by people all over the world. His search through Wandsworth for staff member Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) is one of the funniest extended scenes in the movie. Colin Firth is a writer who flees to France when his girlfriend is unfaithful, and falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper, Amelia (Lucia Moniz) though there is a total language barrier between them. This was going to be a film as its own as was Hugh Grant's story and the merging of the two was the genesis of ""Love Actually"".Daniel (Liam Neeson) and stepson Sam (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) are left alone after the death of Daniel's wife, and Daniel must try to connect with Sam, who seems to have totally withdrawn to his room. This turns into a romantic story for Sam, and provides one of the two entwined, orchestrated climaxes near the end of the film. I have some trouble with the story, largely because Sangster, though thirteen when he made the film, looks eight or nine to me (I mean, he was still playing a thirteen-year-old convincingly eight years later on ""Game of Thrones""). He's a good actor and his seriousness as the character won me over in the end. Here, I also found the conversations between them a bit precocious, but perhaps that's just me. (Pay attention to who David mentions in his wife's eulogy).A hidden love triangle exists between Juliet (Keira Knightly, Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mark (Andrew Lincoln). One of the biggest of the establishing scenes is Peter and Juliet's wedding with Mark casually filming the proceedings. It includes a big musical moment that's one of the most totally fun parts of the film. (Look for director Curtis as one of the trombone players). Mark has been secretly in love with Juliet and has acted cold and unwelcoming so as not to complicate matters. This story also created a problem for me because though I believe Curtis intended Mark's actions to be sympathetic with some pathos, they instead make him look somewhat creepy. The front door scene, which is one of the best known,is not exempt from this but that's not what bothers me. If he brings his boombox and tells her to tell Paul ""It's just carolers"", shouldn't he be playing something that sounds like carolers? ""Silent Night"" is well sung but it doesn't sound at all like a group of acapella carolers. Maybe Peter is too far away to hear them.Those are just some of the characters and stories, but I still have to comment on two of the lighter ones. Colin (Kris Marshall) is an unloved redheaded fellow having no luck finding a girl and gets a harebrained idea that if he flies to America, the girls will love his English accent. This develops in such an unreal way that you have to take it as a comic sketch based on adolescent boys' fantasies. It has no reasonable possibility in reality. John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) are something else, however, as they provide completely unexpected nudity. It only exists to set up a joke, yet more than the infidelity and language in the rest of the film, it is unsuitable for some of the potential audience. First of all, they are stand-ins, not actors, who take the actors' spots and positions so the lighting and cameras can be set up in advance. This takes hours and actors won't do it, but as long as the stand-ins are around the same size and skin tone it works well. But what kind of film is this? It's very unlike the early 2000s and is more like the early 70s, when it seemed every film had to have scenes like this. I finally found an answer in an interview Curtis did. He said as a teenager, he often went to films to see the nude scenes and wanted to include it for that reason. And when was he a teenager? In the early to mid 70's. Its sketch-like nature allows it to be excerpted for some markets and though generally opposed to censorship, I prefer that more people be able to see the film.In the whole it's no wonder that ""Love Actually"" has become such a hit with audiences and a Christmas classic in spite of itself. The film is epic in its way, drawing you into so many stories and situations and pulling your emotions this way and that. If you really get into it, it can be an exhausting experience. The Heathrow Airport scenes that open and close the film illustrate that love is, in fact, all around.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I'm a guy and this is one of the top 10 best movies I have ever seen!,"I got Love Actually for $1 at a garage sale in 2017 I waited until January 2018 to see it, and I fell in love with it as I watched it! I've seen it about half a dozen times since!Love Actually has 9 plots that go back and forth about love in London at Christmastime. Usually I would sit down and summarize each one, but instead I will suggest Googling Daily Dot's ranking of the plots and immediately discuss what I enjoy about the movie as a whole.Romantic comedies are hit or slight miss for me. Religious convictions aside, I think it's stupid for sex to advance the romances in these movies.People fall in love because of who they are, their character, their beauty-inner and outer, likes, interests, etc. and NOT BECAUSE THEY BANG EACH OTHER AFTER BARELY KNOWING EACH OTHER!Love Actually does have some sex in it(Hence it's R rating), but there are all kinds of love in the movie. For example, a stepfather named Daniel gives his stepson advice about how to get to know his love, showing a father-son bond. Daniel also asks if the crush is a boy, hinting that he loves his son no matter his sexual orientation.One woman has a boyfriend AND a mentally unstable brother, and she sacrificed her dating life for her brother. She could have done the cognitive and gave up her brother, but she knew family came first and her brother mattered more.There is also some homosexual love, pointing out that romantic love comes in multiple forms as well.Aside from the love aspect, other things make Love Actually fantastic. The movie's no Citizen Kane, but every moment is so entertaining and well written.Ignoring a pointless plot with sex scene stand ins, there's not a thing I'd change about the movie. (I don't love that plot but I've been less annoyed by that overtime.) To me, Love Actually is perfect. (You'll get that later.)By definition, Love Actualy isn't a masterpiece, but it is a masterpiece to me. It's so fun and endearing, no words can satisfy my admiration for it. When it comes to it's subject matter, this is love....actually!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
All dressed up...,"Oh dear, oh dear...I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But...I'm afraid I thought it was dire. A bad, bad movie...despite the fact that Colin Firth is in it. I should really have learned by now...don't go to see the movie just because you fancy the star!For me, this film falls into the ""All dressed up, and nowhere to go"" category. It's very brightly packaged, even the poster of the film had a bright red bow on it. But it's all packaging, and no substance. It's lazy, manipulative film-making. The situations are, for the most part, completely unbelievable. Prime Minister falls for tea-lady? Nope, no can do. Beautiful young woman fancies Alan Rickman? Please. Then you have some nerdy guy who decides to go to Wisconsin believing that his ""British accent"" will make him irresistible to women. And guess what happens? Yeah, you're right...he ends up having what looks like group sex with three (or is it four) hot babes. Sigh.There were plenty of other things that annoyed me as well. The Colin Firth storyline was promising, but not nearly enough time was spent on it. And the storyline with Laura Linney and her mentally ill brother was very interesting but was left hanging in mid-air, with no resolution. And there was also a precocious kid, who was ""in love""(?) with another precocious kid (who must have been about 12 but was absolutely caked in make-up). Liam Neeson is a great actor but he was totally wasted in this. So much of the film was just incredibly cheesy.The only storyline which brought a smile to my lips was the Bill Nighy-Gregor Fisher one. But then again...there wasn't nearly enough of it! Just when I was getting interested, off it would go to another daft storyline.The trouble is, Richard Curtis & co can put out stuff like this and the public will eat it up with a spoon.

One Of The Few Good Rom-Coms,"Pros:
1. The comedy is laugh-out-loud hilarious and produces copious memorable moments.
2. The contemporary soundtrack not only contains multiple great songs, but also adds a modern feel to the movie, in addition to encompassing all of the relevant emotions.
3. There are fantastic performances by Colin Firth (Jamie), Andrew Lincoln (Mark), Hugh Grant (The Prime Minister), Alan Rickman (Harry), and Emma Thompson (Karen).
4. The love-making scenes, and the romantic scenes in general, are intimate and intense in their shooting and execution.
5. The film does a brilliant job at showcasing different types of love, how they can come about, as well as how you can fall out of love.Cons:
1. The movie is a little over-edited at certain points with needless cuts added here and there.
2. The film jumps about with too much incoherency which is slightly jarring, and difficult to follow at some points.
3. There are a couple illogical moments that are clearly just written in for forced cheesy romance, for example, when Jamie and Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz) jump into the lake to save pages of the draft of Jamies' book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Shouldn't be nearly as good as it is,"In some respects, ""Love Actually"" is every bit the gift-wrapped box of sentiment you'd think just looking at the DVD cover. Some of this rings unbelievable, and I tend to be the person who finds that a turnoff. Maybe that's the cynicism talking. But there was a point when all the moving pieces clicked (right around when Colin Firth is bidding adieu to his Portuguese maid, and soon after, the Norah Jones song kicks in) and I really got sucked into the interwoven subplots . And it's not all love and treacle; there a sizable amount of heartache also built in. This is a hell of a cast (with Neeson, Firth, Rickman and Thompson as standouts) and if you're looking for a Christmas movie, short on commercialism and long on warmth, you really could do a lot worse than this.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the best holiday movies and romance movies ever,"I have to say I love this movie.

First of all, Hugh Grant as the prime minister was just wonderful and did a great performance being quirky, romantic, and political, Bill Nighy gives one of his best performances as the former rock star and he really shines, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson were very believable as a married couple going through motions, Colin Firth does it well being a man falling in love with a woman who doesn't speak the same language as him, Liam Neeson gives one of his best performances as a father helping his step son make an impression on a girl he likes at school, and the rest of the cast did great as well delivering a comedy that anyone would enjoy.

Cute Romance 7/10,"""Love Actually"" is a cute, funny and mostly emotional love story. With an ensemble cast that appears in eight different tales. Each of the following love stories are unique and tell a different kind of romance between the characters. There are all kinds of different romances between them: young people, old people, adults, kids, people who seek to be in a relationship, people who want to shagg. All kinds of romances. I Think this is where the movie succeeds, by giving plenty of stories with a lot of interactions between the characters. How they feel towards each other, how they end up together. Even the fact that the setting happens in Christmas is made on purpose, because Christmas is a special holiday that has a lot of vibes of romance. So there is a perfect connection between the holidays and the emotion the film delivers. I love how simple the movie may seem and yet I enjoyed it very much, I wouldn't bother watching it again. The cast is impressing and I love the performance of every one of the actors, from Thomas Brodie Sangster to Bill Nighy. Overall a really great movie and a beautiful one, absolutely worth it and highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Misogynistic, actually.  Smarmy too","Well now I know it's true. And I'm sad about it. British people aren't smarter or funnier than Americans. Although a higher percentage of them might be able to spell the word ""p...a...n...d...e...r"".But who were they trying to pander to? It really ticks me off to market a film as a ""women's movie"" when every female character over 30 ends up sad, alone, or dead.Where to begin: Well, the Liam Niessen story was unseemly. An eleven year old boy's mother has just died, and he's left alone with his step dad, and the boy's biggest concern is ""falling in love"" with a classmate? I know life goes on and all that, but honestly, life doesn't go on in this way, and I don't find the practice of projecting adult thoughts into eleven year old bodies humorous or poignant.And the bereaved husband, who is so torn up about losing his perfect wife that he can't complete her eulogy, ends the movie by falling in love with Claudia Schiffer. Perhaps this is realistic, if your wife dies, you should expect to end up with a Claudia Schiffer supermodel or her look-alike. But I don't find it charming. I find it smarmy.And Colin Firth (40 something) is going to meet and fall in love with a beautiful Portugese cleaning woman (20 something) with whom he's never had a conversation, but first, the filmmakers have to get rid of his wife, while turning Firth into a ""sympathetic"" victim.How will the filmmakers get rid of his wife so he can fall in love with a much younger woman without the audience realizing he's really just a cad? They accomplish this by having Colin Firth's British wife sleep around on him for no apparent reason in a really callous way. Then she leaves him and he's so so depressed, for about a week. He wonders why all the women he marries betray him. Perhaps, I thought to myself, it's because he falls in love with women who don't speak English and marries them?I confess I found the actress who plays the cleaning woman to be the most charismatic in the movie. And if the rest of the movie wasn't so godawful, I might have let this storyline pass, but then, the filmmakers have to stick in cheap shots at her oh so comically peasant-like father and her horrible fat sister. Incredibly, the fat girl's own father seems to hate her, and the filmmaker seems to expect the audience to sympathize with him while he is nasty to her. Wonderful chick flick, huh?. Clearly, Love is All Around.And Keira Knightley is so beautiful and she's all of 19 or something and she's going to marry a black man who is perfect and handsome and rich and completely incidental to the storyline. In fact, the perfect black man isn't important at all, except to signify that Keira Knightley is funky and liberal and has something to her besides her looks. Because we neither know nor care about anything else about her. She's young, she's beautiful, she has an overbite, she's going to be married. She might as well be Elizabeth Taylor in Father of the Bride.Laura Linney's story is actually touching. And she acts it well. She's got to care for her brother, who's mentally ill. But he lives in a HOME! Why should this prevent her from having a relationship? Probably, because she's over 30. Again, if this were the only story about a 30 something woman ending up alone, through her own fault, I'd buy it. But it's the confluence of all these anti-women story lines that I just can't take.Poor Emma Thomson and Alan Rickman work to save this movie. It's not unrealistic to think of an older bossman bonking the young female help. I don't mind this storyline, but...again...it's a little hard to see the witty and wise Emma ending up in a compromise of a marriage, while Liam Niesan's character ends up with Claudia Schiffer.Bill Nighy does best with his role as a star performer who puts out a cheesy single, promotes it shamelessly, and has the grace to prove his loyalty to his manager, rather than going out to a fashionable party. Good thing his manager was a fat 40 something man instead of a slim 30 something female, or he'd have been left alone in the cold too.I am a fan of Four Weddings and a Funeral despite the fact that Andie MacDowell couldn't keep up with the British cast, but with this new effort I am officially giving up on light British ""romantic"" comedies. I prefer the boys in the American Pie series to the cads in this movie, and the caddish screenwriters and producers who dared to market this film as a feel good fantasy for women.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

One of my all time favorites!,"This is absolutely one of my favorite movie of all time and whenever I'm feeling nostalgic and want to see a bit of London, then this is the film I watch. All the characters and stories are intricate and in a light heart funny way. I am just simply stunned by the performance and stories and how every lasting they are, I can watch this every year and it never gets old. I love the plot, the London scenes, the whole comical story and message behind it all and how it blends into one that has become a favorite with our family. This movie packs a lot in two hours but it works. It hits hard and I would consider it a Christmas classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
worst movie ever,"This wasn't just bad, it was despicable. The most sexist movie I've ever seen. Even in the heyday of sexism, movies seemed to at least like women, these movie makers don't. Women are derided for looking like women (they're FAT!)and depicted as pathetic if they are over 30 or have careers or are not bimbos. The only successful pairings are between men and subservient younger women (sluts or servants) Anti-American in the most obnoxious way, no discussion of meaningful issues, just American women are sluts and our president is an overtly sinister sleaze who gropes the help (why Americans are posting positive reviews is beyond me. A super slimy Billy Bob Thornton as the president!) I haven't seen this movie in two years, I'm actually just remembering how much I hated this from reading these user comments. I'm shocked at the good ones. It wasn't at all funny, the story lines would have been trite for an old American sitcom like Love, American Style or The Love Boat. Scenes the movie makers apparently thought were funny: juxtaposing a funeral with pornography; having a very young boy whose mother has just died spout four letter words; denigrating the religious traditions of Christmas. Corny, lame, predictable, unfunny, insulting, and calculated in the most stupid, base way. This movie has it all. Why do I have to give it a 1, why no 0 score or negative numbers? I'd give this a -10. I felt sorry for some of the cast, like Laura Linney, going topless for this dreck and Hugh Grant who announced his semi-retirement, I think, around then. I don't blame him.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny and Charming,"Pros:I loved how the film explored the different aspects of loveIt was a unique romantic-comedy - not the typical cheesy rom-comHugh Grant's performance and his story with Martine McCutcheon was my favourite - funny and charming at the same timeFunny parts throughout - particularly involving Colin Firth trying to speak PortugueseThe message of the film is so important - The final moments of the film show the power of thisLaura Linney!!! (I'm a massive Ozark fan)The Cast... wowCons:There were some cheesy moments, which I cringed at slightly!Too many stories meant I did sometimes forget who was whoBill Nighy's character was irritating...Overall, Love Actually is a heart-warming Christmas tale that delightfully explores the many forms of love that can make or break people. Hugh Grant's charming performance was, for me, a personal standout, while the cast all performed well. The only issues I had with the film was that with so many stories involving all the characters, that did become confusing for me, but I would recommend Love Actually to anyone who hasn't seen it, mostly because of the message it gives.

An Instant Romantic Classic: Without the Cheese,"Whenever I see previews for a romantic-comedy involving Hugh Grant, usually I automatically make a mental note to not see that film. But this movie just felt different than the usual sappy smooch flick. That, combined with a high IMDb rating, provoked me to see this one.Love Actually is a romantic comedy that thoughtfully shows different people (of different race, age, etc.) that are all involved in some predicament with love during the time around Christmas (unofficially Valentine's Day's long, lost brother). Love throws so many twists and curve balls at every individual in this movie. Yet each character attempts to rebound and step up to get what they can.For one, it was fortunate to be blessed with a great cast with great direction. Even Hugh Grant (to an extent) is believable. There's some great character development which is brilliantly pulled off, considering the amount of characters. They all wonderfully demonstrate so many natural emotions that are a result of love- whether they are successful or not. There's bound to be at least one character that you'll find yourself relating to by the end of the movie.The writing is great. It lacks all that sappy cheesiness usually found in these movies. It's very sincere and true. Even clever, at times. It all seems to mesh perfectly with the acting- the mark of a good film.Music adds so much to a movie- and this movie got a huge help from the great audio selections. Everything from a in-movie cover of ""All You Need is Love"" to occasional Beach Boys tracks. These feel-good songs really put a lot of emphasis on how great love can really can be.This movie is a true gem and a must-see. I wish there could be more movies like this one; a movie that really finds a solid, pleasant subject-matter (in this case, love) and sticks to it. It never deviates from it. I usually stray away from most romantic-comedies because I'm single and get irritated at how much most movies from that genre rub romance in your face. But this movie does it in a way which leaves you hopeful and satisfied. You feel good about yourself. And therefore, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I feel terrible for avoiding this movie. It's a masterpiece!,"For months on end, I've had this movie recommended to me on numerous occasions. Why? Well, I like romcoms. Why did I avoid it? Dunno. I felt like it had too many characters and stuff and I guess I just avoided it because it feels weird for a romcoms to have multiple love stories going on at once.Was it good? Hell yes. Oh, lord yes.There were so many heartfelt stories in here. Each character had their own problems or aims which drove the plot forward. There were moments to laugh at, moments you'd look at and just say aww, and moments that tugged at your heartstrings till you'd tear up just a little but not an embarrassing amount. Moderate amount of tears. Totally not a lot. Totally not.The narratives were intricately woven and they flowed perfectly. The character's simple emotions drove their complex and incredibly deep decisions. Seriously, the depth of some of the characters' choices in this movie is astounding. Everything was driven by love and nothing else.Another interesting thing about this film is that love in this context isn't just romantic love. It's all sorts of love. There's love between friends, family, etc. It's a marvelous movie and I can't put everything about my feelings towards this film into words.I'd love to give it a 10, but there's one glaring issue with this film. Not everyone gets a happy ending. Is that bad? No. Not at all. It's realistic and it gives the movie a bit of a grounded touch. I'm just too much of a romantic to see that as a pro rather than a con.9/10. Could not recommend it more. Its a one of a kind film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Not amazing, but still delightful","This film is about eight different couples that are going through struggles in there love life and somehow they intertwine with each other near the end. When I first found out how this film is going to be about 8 different couples I thought it was going to be a long movie, but it only show short segments of each and gets straight to the point on most parts. The ensemble case is mainly British actors and actresses and they all work pretty well. And the lives of the characters are all in good taste although most of it is more feminine ideals of romance, but I guess that is okay because of the flurry of very unrealistic romance movies out there. Although it wasn't a amazing film in my opinion it was still delightful and somewhat heartwarming.7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A great display of Richard Curtis feel good rom com heaven- although there is such a thing as too much of a good thing,"Richard Curtis, one of Britain's most successful screenwriters, turns his hand to directing and virtually every successful British A list actor falls in love in Love Actually, a rom com of epic proportions. 10 stories unfold across the film in the weeks leading up to Christmas, with a one month later epilogue. Love Actually starts off superbly but then fails to sustain itself across its full 2 hour runtime. The cast charms throughout, with Liam Neeson giving a touching and likable performance far away from his recent action typecast role and Bill Nighy stealing the show as an aging rock star. The film is sweeter than a box of Lindt chocolate and often feels like an extended sugar rush. It's sentimental, but its' difficult not to be genuinely charmed by it. Richard Curtis, with his razor sharp humour and wonderfully British writing, gives us laughs galore, and for the first hour the film is more often than not hysterical. Although the movie devolves as it goes along, it remains funny throughout, and Curtis proves himself a good director as well.The problem with Curtis is that his films are feel good, but they don't offer enough conflict and can just feel like syrupy fantasies. Without actors like Hugh Grant, these romances might not work at all. The stories in LA don't have enough conflict and at times I found myself wondering where it was headed, as the film's only real message, love is all around, is one we've all heard hundreds of times before. It's quite sweet and there is one effective sad scene in the second half of the movie, but overall the emotional grip slackens as it all just gets a bit too much in terms of the sentimentality. Since it's all fantasy, it doesn't always feel that romantic. With good direction, an irresistible sense of charm, strong acting and Richard Curtis' sharp humour complete with his typical fine use of profanity, LA is an entertaining and likable rom com with admirable ambition, but on the storytelling side there are definite shortcomings. The Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth and Kris Marshall story lines should perhaps have made up the film with the other story lines (Which either don't go anywhere or are just a bit weaker) dropped.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Terrible,"This is one of the worst British films ever made and I'm staggered it has such a good rating here - no accounting for taste I guess. Why is it so bad? It's cloyingly sentimental to the point of being vomit-inducing: the characters are all middle-class and boring, wrapped up in their own self-obsessed tedium. London is re-imagined as a heavenly place which it isn't. Hugh Grant plays himself yet again - ah the tedium. The jokes are unfunny. The direction is patronizing and condescending. It's also too ambitious for its own good. Director Richard Curtis has attempted (attempted being the operative word) a romantic comedy that apes the multi-narrative structure of Altman's Short Cuts. It fails miserably to weave the stories together as Altman did; instead some stories such as the Laura Linney one remain unresolved as if they don't matter to the overall naffness of this terrifyingly awful film. The musical segments are also cringe-inducingly bad. I wish Curtis would have shown some restraint.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

flawed but entertaining romantic comedy,"The half dozen or so love stories that comprise 'Love Actually' are neither highly dramatic nor emotionally earth-shattering in nature - and I suspect that this is exactly how writer/directer Richard Curtis intended it to be. This epic paean to the glory of romance involves, for the most part, run-of-the-mill (albeit middle or upper middle class) Londoners just trying to find a little happiness for themselves in the arms of that one true love.Hugh Grant, as the newly elected Prime Minister of England, unskilled in the ways of romance, leads a large and gifted cast through this roundelay of love, actors of no less a stature than Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson, just to name a few. They all portray characters in various states of romantic upheaval. Some are headed towards blissful, happily-ever-after endings, while others suffer the pangs of jealousy, infidelity and unrequited love. The best thing about 'Love Actually' is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and it isn't afraid to take its time introducing and developing its large roster of characters. The film, as a whole, has the kind of unhurried, laidback charm that one expects from a movie with Grant in the lead. The worst thing about the film is its over reliance on those fairy tale 'only in the movies' moments that seem to be an integral part of virtually every romantic comedy that comes down the pike these days (there's a scene set in Wisconsin that is so lacking in basic credibility that I was absolutely positive it would turn out to be a dream of one of the characters. It didn't). The film culminates in a jaw-droppingly bad scene near the end in which a young boy crashes through airport security with full approval of his beaming stepfather so that the tyke can tell a little classmate of his who is boarding a plane that he loves her. The sequence is a bit tough to take in this post-9/11 world, especially when the violins start swelling, cuing our tear ducts to well up in approval for this horrific stunt. There's also a bit of gratuitous America-bashing in Thornton's portrayal of the President of the United States, a rather mean spirited diversion in a film whose tone is otherwise all sweetness-and-light. It's perfectly fine for American films to portray the president as a venal, lecherous bully, but it takes a certain amount of gall for a British film to do so.'Love Actually' suffers the fate of many films that attempt to write large on too broad a canvas; some of the characters and stories inevitably turn out to be more involving and compelling than others. That is simply the nature of the beast. I certainly wish that the troubled marriage of Rickman and Thompson could have been explored in more depth, since Thompson provides the few moments of genuine feeling and heartbreak in the movie. And certainly one or two of the other lesser stories could have been dropped from the lineup with little or no harm done to the film overall. Given that limitation, however, it must be stated that 'Love Actually' succeeds more often than it fails. This is partly because the cast is so appealing and partly because much of the writing is really very funny. The choice of background music is occasionally obvious, though the songs frequently make wry and witty commentary on the action taking place on screen.'Love Actually' is definitely a long movie (135 minutes to be exact) and it does leave a few loose ends untied at the closing credits. But that, perhaps, is as it should be. Life, after all, leaves some loose ends untied as well.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love Actually,"It takes us until the end of this film to realise what the connection is between these people who, with Christmas fast approaching, are having troubles with love lives they have had for ages, have only just started - or just didn't know they wanted at all! Hugh Grant is the Blair-esque British Prime Minister who takes a shine to his assistant ""Natalie"" (Martine McCutcheon); recently widowed Liam Neeson (""Daniel"") has to come to terms with the adoration his drum-learning eleven year old son 'Sam"" has for a girl at school who is soon to head back to her American home; Colin Firth's rather wimpish ""Jamie"" finds that his relationship maybe just takes the concept of keeping things in the family a bit too far - but perhaps hope is on the horizon in Portugal? Meantime, an on-form Bill Nighy is hoping a re-versioned, shockingly tacky, seasonal version of the Trogs' ""Love is All Around"" will put him and long-suffering manager ""Joe"" (Gregor Fisher) back on the top of the chart; Emma Thompson is facing a crisis of confidence in her marriage to Alan Rickman - a man who seems to be having a crisis of his own with his office assistant/temptress ""Mia"" (Heike Makatsch); Martin Freeman and Joanna Page are gradually bonding while acting out an increasingly detailed series of sex scenes for a movie rehearsal and, well you get the drift. The story is peppered with pithy, observational humour that illustrates quite potently the various stages of love and relationships from loved-up ascendency through routine mundanity with all the concomitant tribulations that make us laugh, cringe and occasionally want to weep a bit. I always had a bit of a crush on Andrew Lincoln ever since he was in the BBC's ""This Life"" (1996) and so his storyline here with newly-wed best friend Chiwetel Ejiofor and Keira Knightley was a bit sad - there are two ways it can go, possibly even three? Laura Linney also features as the overworked ""Sarah"" who has her own crush on colleague ""Karl"" (Rodrigo Santoro) but who also brings some seriousness to the proceedings as she is constantly on her phone, at the most inappropriate of moments, but for anything but frivolous reasons (though this story does rather peter out). This is an amalgam that spins the threads together cleverly and entertainingly, whilst still keeping our eyes open to the realities of so many people who find Christmas a joy and/or a pain. Some storylines work better than others, but I suspect we'd never all agree on which we liked best - and that's a testament to the innovative writing and consistent pacing of this drama. I don't know about the Prime Minister's experiences at Heathrow Airport, but I came through there yesterday and can assure you - there were few feelings of love and affection as everyone battled just to get out - with trolley fights that wouldn't have looked out of place in ""Ben Hur""",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Like very much actors, we have many famous names (hugh grant, bill nighly, colin firth, laura linney) as well as new leading actresses (keira knightley, martine mcchucteon) and not very known people (lucia moniz, rodrigo santoro, abraham lincoln) presenting us that love can be in life always, in many ways, and that you dont need neccesarily to have a boyfriend or girlfriend to be happy.

painfully bad,"Where to start on this superficial, overly-sentimental piece of garbage?The blatant sexism? The total lack of any developed characters? Hugh Grant as prime minister?The flaws are too many to count, but I'll just go over some of my biggest problems with this piece of junk ...1. There is not one single character that is even moderately developed. We are flooded with all these situations in which these humanoids are supposedly falling in love, or already in love, with each other yet we have absolutely no idea why, nor in most cases do the characters seem to know either.Writer falls in love with maid. Let's not bother with the fact they've never spoken a single word to each other (they don't speak a common tongue) and don't know each other at all. She looks good in a bathing suit. Apparently that's all that's necessary for a guy to ask a girl to marry him (and for her to say yes). Superficial garbage relationship #1.Prime minister falls in love with his secretary. Do any of us know why, other than the fact she likes to swear in inappropriate places? No, of course not. That would require writing and actual ... you know ... story. Superficial garbage relationship #2.Office-worker lady is in love with a co-worker. Do we know why? Do we get to know either of these characters at all? Of course not. That would once again involve actually developing a story. All we know is the guy looks like an abercrombie and fitch model. If there's any other reason to love the guy, we sure don't know about it. Superficial garbage relationship #3.Dude is in love with his best friend's wife. Sure, she's Keira Knightley and therefore hot as hell. Do we have any other idea why this guy is in love with her, and willing to hit on his friend's wife behind his back? No, of course not. Once again, apparently all we need to know to is that she's hot ... the end. Superficial garbage relationship #4.2. Bizarre misogyny. Almost all the relationships in this movie involve some extreme power differential b/w the male and female. The guys want the hot chicks because they're hot, the hot chicks want the old fart guys because ... because ... I'm not sure. Because they have good jobs I guess. There's also an inordinate amount of time where one of the hot chicks is bagged on repeatedly for being ""fat"". Note this is a girl that could only be considered ""fat"" in the movie-make-believe world. Even in that world it still doesn't make any sense. The term ""fat"" is one of the last that would come to mind when describing her and I spent more than a couple minutes scratching my head trying to figure out why characters were making fun of her physical appearance. On any other universe she's a solid ""9"". If this girl is lucky to have a relationship because she's ""fat"", all I can say to the rest of you women out there is you might as well shoot yourselves, cause she's hotter than 98% of you.3. You know how in a good romance movie there is often that one point where the characters finally have their big connection which fulfills the build-up of the movie over the first couple acts? This movie just skips all the stuff involved in actually telling the story of relationships and just has the sappy payoff ... in every scene of the movie ... over and over again. While watching this wreck I couldn't help but feeling that the writer just took the payoff scene in his top 50 favorite romance movies and just wrote them all into one movie. Too bad he left out all the stuff leading up to the payoffs (character, plot, theme, etc) that made them work in the first place.Pure junk.

LOVE TRULY IS ALL AROUND US,"Love Actually is a film much like an Island paradise, set in an ocean of pitifully tepid romantic comedies.(It's not my style to negatively criticize any form of art so you won't see any examples or bad reviews here. But you likely can surmise which ones I'm obliquely referencing).Love Actually comprises a dozen or so examples of couples who are either in love, falling in love, or have recently lost love. Therefore, if the subject matter of love, heartache, humor and Christmas aren't your cup of tea (although ironically this is a decidedly British film), then you're better off watching The Holly and the Ivy (1952) or White Christmas (1954).I won't bother summarizing Love Actually. There's hardly anything I can add to this splendid film that hasn't been said before. But I will reiterate that Love Actually is generously filled to overflowing with a miraculously diverse, talented cast. The lineup is humbling: Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, the late Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, Martine McCutcheon, the incomparable Bill Nighy, and a brief flicker of screen time for Billy Bob Thornton.Although Love Actually takes place in London during Christmas, it's not a genuine holiday-themed film. The plot isn't difficult to follow: Love is everywhere, and often lurking where and when you least expect it. The message here is that love is blind, and I pray it stays that way.Love Actually was originally released in the United States on November 24, 2003, and a week later in the United Kingdom. Surprisingly, it received mixed reviews among fans and critics even though it earned a respectable $246 million US dollars worldwide against a modest budget of $45 million US.No spoilers here as usual, but I will reveal: Look extra closely at the Barbie dolls that Elizabeth wraps up as gifts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Best Christmas Movie,"Love Actually is one of my absolute favorite movies. It's one of the few movies I watch with friends and older family members every year for the holidays. We all love the music, acting, and the story lines. It's nice to have a holiday movie where the story isn't directed toward children (Although we like those too- we just get tired of seeing them over and over again!). The cast is amazing and the roles were perfectly casted. I highly recommend it for any hopeless romantic or anyone just looking for a more non-traditional holiday movie. It's a perfect date-night movie and also great for a girls-nights. It will leave you humming the music and reviewing the lines and scenes in your head long after the movie ends.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Dickensian Love Fairy Tale,"Love Actually is one of the most mawkish, treacly, sugary romantic comedies out there - as has been noted, there are a tonne of different plots, so you have basically eight times the amount of upbeat treacle you would normally get. The movie tosses an incredible ensemble cast in your face, flaunting well-known celebrities in almost unremarkable cameos. Yet, incredibly, the movie works - it makes you feel good about yourself and about love.The critics can say what they will, but Love Actually actually defies all these things working against it, and for inexplicable reasons, tells eight uplifting love stories. It would be difficult for someone not to be touched by at least one of them, seeing as how the movie takes pains to cover almost every type of love imaginable, from romantic to platonic.The important thing to bear in mind is that you can't take the movie too seriously. Most romantic comedies flirt with the barrier between reality and fantasy, but by the end of Love Actually, it's pretty unquestionable that this is a modern day fairy tale - it's not just implausible, it's impossible.Love Actually reminds me of something Dickens would write, because it adheres to Dickens' style. The denouement of the movie ties together all the subplots, bringing the characters together at the airport - a definite Dickensian move.Dickens dealt with mawkish fairy tales, and he has found popular acclaim, both among the masses and among the critics. If the critics would let their guard down and accept Love Actually as a fairy tale, I think they'd find it's a very Dickensian story at heart.If you loved reading Charles Dickens's improbable stories, and didn't mind the exciting but improbable happy endings he almost inevitably produced, you will like Love Actually.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Love Actually's ensemble brings warmth and laughs, you stay because of Richard Curtis' heartful stories","What I love most about Love Actually is how grounded and human the storylines feel, how there aren't any big spectacles, only human drama and well written characters with actors who cares. You see the passion in Richard Curtis' writing and direction, he delves into different aspects of love as shown through the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England.With an ensemble cast, composed predominantly of British actors, many of whom had worked with Curtis in previous film and television projects. There are so many well known actors in this film, I'll bring up my favorites. Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Thomas Sangster, Bill Nighy, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Andrew Lincoln and Laura Linney. They are some of the actors in this large ensemble. Everyone gives a terrific performance, truly. The cast executed the dialogue and jokes perfectly, bringing warmth and laughs to us.Love Actually was a box-office success, grossing $246 million worldwide on a budget of $40-45 million. It received two nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay. In the BAFTA award, Bill Nighy took home the award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, whilst the film was also nominated for Outstanding British Film and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Emma Thompson). The film has proved more popular with audiences than critics, becoming a modern classic and well known in pop culture. In my opinion, the cinematography and editing needs some extra praise, truly fantastic work.I rewatched this film with my girlfriend just a day ago and actually liked it more this second time than my first viewing which was back in 2014 I believe. Richard Curtis have created a film with such heart, showing us so many forms of love, what love ultimately means to people. Some of the characters struggle of falling out of love and some fall in love, you could also say the film is about fate and especially true love. My girlfriend ended up loving the film, afterwards, it made me think of romantic films in general and how most Romantic-Christmas themed movies are unoriginal and too cheesy (which works at times) but Love Actually is so much more. In the hands of a different director/writer, it could have been a failure. But instead, Richard Curtis created a brilliant romantic-drama and a film worth watching each Christmas. There's not much of a Christmas spirit, it's just set during the weeks prior to Christmas Eve, and that's why it works so well. It's about these people we get to follow for 136 minutes, who could easily be anyone you meet on the street.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Taking it a little too serious, actually","The sheer number of ""best-movie-ever"" and ""total-crap"" comments left me somewhat surprised, as I never imagined this movie to be polarizing. Myself, I find it to be an extremely charming romantic comedy with a fair amount of flaws, which did not destroy my viewing (and, dare i say, re-viewing) experience. I believe the mistake made my most people who hated the movie was thinking it's a movie about Love or Relationships, while it's clearly not. It's about Falling in love, Dreaming of love, Imagining love. And it does a pretty good job at it. I mean, comments like ""he hardly knows her"", ""it won't work"" completely miss the point: it's not about whether it'll work or not, it's just th falling-in-love part - although I could do without the wedding scenes in the end. The sexism criticism is way exaggerated: the movie IS about superficiality, and the powerful man - hot young woman pattern is the most common one, and one based on superficiality. The movie doesn't glorify it, it just uses it (eg. in the Alan Rickman - Emma Thompson story). The Hugh Grant story, however, really bombed. Grant is terribly cast, the Britain-America thing is awfully cheesy, and it goes too far to convince us it's a great thing that a Prime Minister's first priority is falling in love with his assistant. It totally lacks the simplicity and charming everyday-quality the other stories have. Btw, the Claudia schiffer thing: it's a joke, people! It's not insinuated that you should treat grief with dating a supermodel. Geez... Clearly not the best joke in the movie, but relax... And enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Also I had this feeling of realizing some deep truth or message when the narrator said that when the twin towers were attacked nobody in their final moments sent messages of hate - but all messages sent were messages of love.

"Yes, it's manipulative - delightfully manipulative","This quilt of a romantic comedy has all the elements of a modern classic, and knows very well how to pile them on. Richard Curtis' script is clever without trying to be too clever, and he manages to rein in his abundance of characters and relations in a satisfactory manner, at least when taking into account that this after all is a genre-movie. It's possible to get some interesting and perhaps even heartfelt perspectives on life and love out of this, but most of all Love Actually is about good old-fashioned British comedy. Self-mockery, awkward situations and shortcomings. Ingredients that make you feel better about yourself afterwards, and perhaps even willing to accept some cheesy, sentimental romance to boot.

Ridiculous,"I cannot believe that anyone who likes movies enough to post or even vote on IMDb would actually like Love Actually. After peeling my mangled body from the floor of my apartment I crawled to the phone and called every movie buff I know and warned them about this foul-smelling debacle. Expecting at least good acting in a movie I knew would be a sappy British comedy, after the sixty-minute mark I begged my girlfriend to let me turn it off. I didn't even notice the misogyny until after the smoke had cleared from my head after watching two hours of bad lines, worse plot, and disastrous humor. I felt like I had been drug all over London watching stupid people doing stupider (sic) things, and drugged on a never-ending storyline that, at rare intervals, might have required a teaspoon of creativity. The portrayal of women was also completely inappropriate. It was a class struggle throughout: authoritative and powerful men and the lowly enamored women acting like they're at a Beatles concert. If you haven't seen a poorly made movie in a while, see this film. Even my girlfriend agreed that it was not at all good, and was as surprised as I was that it averaged above a 2 on the voting.

More Than a Christmas Movie,"Follows the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England.This movie tries to pass itself off as a Christmas movie.

This is a great script with characters who cross paths in unexpected ways. Yes, it is a story of love, but it is also just a good story.What was most interesting was waiting until now (2016) to see it. At the time it came out, Andrew Lincoln was (I believe) largely unknown.

Actually a fine piece of movie-making....!,"(This comment has been written by a Swedish guy suffering from a serious hangover. So I hope you will excuse the poor English...) Firstly, for me as a common guy the genre ""romantic comedies"" doesn't rank high. Fairer to say, I try avoid them as much as is humanly possible. However, when my girlfriend brought home Love Actually and threatened with a sex-free relationship the coming weeks if I didn't watch the film with her left me without much of a choice.So I sat down with her and muttered something about ""pathetic chick-flicks"", but almost as soon as the film started I found myself mesmerized by it. And believe me, no one was more surprised by this than me! It was really that kind of film you don't want to end and which you find yourself to think about long after you have picked out the DVD from the DVD-player (the opposite to mindless, branded Hollywood action-movies). The film is really funny, highly romantic (in the best sense of the world), has a great soundtrack and very well-acted by the many famous British actors.The film portrays the many various aspects of love and how it affect people's life and destinies. The story follows a bunch of people living in London the weeks before Christmas whose life's are intertwined in different ways, with the common nominator being love, and a Christmas play at the end of the film...The film has many peaks but I would like to especially mention the scene where Keira Knightly's character discovers her husbands best friends feelings towards her. The expression on her face together with the guys inability to stay in the same room as her as he leaves his apartment to the tones of Dido is really heart-breaking. At this point of the film I was having serious problems not the let my girlfriend see how much the film was affecting me... And even though Keira Knightley has a face to die for (I can't imagine a guy who wouldn't describe her as extremely gorgeous in this film) the strength of this scene is that the feeling of unrequited love is something most people can relate to.Finally, this is a film I can highly recommend, both to guys and girls. However, if your notion of great film-making is the latest Van Diesel-movie you might get disappointed. But on the other hand, then you either have passed the point of no return when it comes to good taste in movies or you're 15 years old....",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Definitely not the ""ultimate romantic comedy""","Oftentimes, movies with intersecting storylines don't work well, and this is no exception. There are way too many storylines, and some of them just feel cliched beyond belief. If I had to cut any of them, one would definitely be the storyline with the caterer who tries to meet American girls.This movie unfortunately also suffers from another issue of movies of its type: romantic comedies usually suck when it comes to the comedy. The laughs are very rare in this movie, and they usually only occur in the Bill Nighy storyline. It makes sense why critics say he stole the show: his character is one of the few good things about this movie.Also the tagline of this being the ultimate romantic comedy? How pretentious. The tagline seems true if you want ultimate to mean average. I don't think that this movie should be a flat 6.0, but I definitely didn't want to give it a 7.

Actually...excellent,"Well this movie is actually...excellent. It includes lots of characters who are all in love in their own special way and the whole story is set in London five weeks before Christmas. We meet Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), old singer who tries to get back on top with help of his loyal manager Joe (Gregor Fisher); David (Hugh Grant) has just become the new Prime Minister and he instantly falls in love with his new personal assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); Karen (Emma Thompson) and Harry (Alan Rickman) are married couple with their own problems; Sarah (Laura Linney) is women torn between a man she loves and her sick brother; Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) are fresh married, but Peter's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with Juliet; John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) met on shooting of porn movie; Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) moves to France after he found out that his girl is cheating him with his brother and there he meets Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz), young Portuguese woman; Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) hopes that he'll find 'normal' girl(s) in America; and finally there is Sam (Thomas Sangster), who is young boy and also in love, which makes a problem to his stepfather Daniel (Liam Neeson).So many characters and so many actors that are beautifully composed in this movie. All that is achieved Richard Curtis in his directorial debut. His story is for everyone. I think that lots of people could find themselves in this characters that are full of life and very real. Maybe the only characters that are little stretched are the ones of John and Judy. It's hard to believe that porn actors are so shy like they are both presented. But here Curtis makes fun with everything. That's why I love Britons so much. They smile to others equally as they smile to themselves. ""Love Actually"" rises above many romantic movies because it has great story, capable direction, top class actors and magnificent soundtrack mixed with some old and some new songs. I really can't talk about all the actors in this movies cause it would last for days; instead I'll mention only two: Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson. Nighy brings breath of fresh air to his character while he's making fun with his manager, his own hit song and Britney Spears. Emma Thompson, ah Emma Thompson. She makes acting so easy, makes you feel that anyone could act. She's so natural and believable, such extraordinary actress. There is also lots of cameo roles (Billy Bob Thornton, Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, Sienna Guillory...) and one hilarious appearance of Rowan Atkinson as jewelery salesman (he's like Christmas ghost, you know when he helps young Sam).Well, I almost forgot to say what is this movie about (at least how I understand it). It gives us a message; that we must search and struggle for love, we must make sacrifice, just like Jamie and Sam for example did, while Sarah choose the other way (her brother) and she gave up. Actually everything is said in the beginning; there is enough love on this world (great idea with airport arrivals). Actually, I advice you to watch this movie. Actually, I gave 10 to it, cause it's so much better then any other romantic movie I've ever watched. Or I could just say, love actually.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
turn off your brain and enjoy the show.,"Usually, as a feminist film student with severe arthouse tendencies, I tend to avoid 'romantic comedies'' like the plague. BUT this isn't just a romance movie and that is what saves it. Yes its sacharine sweet, and overwhelmingly white  (the few black characters barely get a word in, let alone their own storyline).  And heterosexual - which I was a little confused about- they managed to get in friendship and sibling type love between the same sexes but stopped short at romantic love? Surely society's come further than that in the last little while? And refuses to discuss England's heavy class segregation (although that's kinda become a trademark of Richard Curtis's created universe I guess). Having said all that I actually enjoyed this movie, it's cute, it's a little subversive (an 11 year old kid doing the run through the airport at the last minute thing is pretty funny) and its surprisingly bitter sweet. And really it's the stories where love doesn't conquer all that place this movie a little above the rest of the rom coms, that and the superb acting from the superstar cast (especially Laura Linney and Emma Thompson). Curtis manages to blend all the stories together without being too confusing, which is quite an art considering there's more than 8 stories to fit into one movie. So basically, if you turn off your brain and relax about it you'll get a good ride. And you get to see Hugh Grant shake his booty- what's cooler than that?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

My favorite movie,"I'm a guy, an old, straight guy, which means I like movies where stuff gets blown up, and this is quite simply my favorite movie.It's not for everyone as the writing is clever and will probably go over the heads of some, but what an amazing film this is.If you don't feel good after watching this movie, you're probably an ignorant schmutz. This is as good as it gets. I never get emotional watching a movie, but the Green Mile and this one get to me every time. Amazing acting and an intricate series of subplots cleverly woven together. My favorites are the author and the Portugese girl, Colin the Love God and the little boy.If you like to be entertained and moved, and every movie doesn't have to have people and property blown to bits, this is the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Always charming... and profound,"I have watched this lovely film every Christmas since I was sixteen years old. Its enduring message regarding the profoundness of ordinary love never grows old.Every time I hear Hugh Grant's narration about the Heathrow arrivals gate, I tear up. To be sure, the world is a hateful place nowadays. Any informed person would agree. Death and destruction everywhere you turn. But then you think about your mother and father, your siblings, your friends, your partner, the incredible love that is so tangible everyday.I am a healthcare worker, who sees love and loss constantly and I can tell you, with undying certainty, that love is the prevailing daily sentiment in every society. It doesn't necessarily make the news, but it's there...And this is why I watch this movie every year. To give me hope, to give me courage. Richard Curtis's casual film has become a resolute beacon in my life. A film that is not only worth watching, but will change anyone for the better who sees it. Happy watching!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It's Not Without Its Charm,"I can see why this is a holiday classic. There's certainly something to like about it. It's got a great spirit and feeling for the holiday. There are some truly cute and funny scenes, and some endearing characters. Hell, Billy Mack shoulda had his own sequel. Funny and well-written character, really plays the whole ""rock star"" bit to the hilt. But overall I honestly thought the movie was a big ""Meh"" for me.This film is just too long, too much plot, and the screenplay is clunky and uneven because of it. Hell, Colin just seems to disappear until you see him again an hour later. ""Oh yeah, you're supposed to care about him."" Then the Harry and Karen subplot I simply felt didn't get a proper resolution, and it's a pretty major subplot. I found myself asking ""When's this movie gonna end?"", and there was still like 25 minutes left. Films like this should clock in at 2 hours or less. Cut a character or two if needed, better focus the screenplay on the rest of them.It's awfully saccharine and contrived. Most of the subplots end on a happy note, but they're so syrupy, sentimental, and over the top as to how they all play out. It's cute, but very unrealistic. Again with Colin, his subplot was definitely the most contrived one. And the concept was fine, but it should have been written in a much more realistic way. Maybe it was going for the irony of the whole thing, so...Woozle Wuzzle?Sadly, Rowan Atkinson's character didn't have as much of a presence as they originally intended. He was supposed to be a Christmas angel looking out for several of the characters, and that would have been pretty enjoyable. As it stands he was still a good character, but this idea should have been fully realized.It wasn't the worst way to spend a night with my girlfriend. There's definitely something to like about it. But it's deserving of its mixed reception, being too long with a somewhat clunky plot, and too contrived and saccharine. It makes up for it with some funny and pretty cute scenes, and so I understand the appeal. If you enjoy it, there's no shame in making it one of your Christmas classics.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love Everywhere,"Driver Stu from ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" once said, ""When love comes, you better pull over to the side of the road and open your doors, cause nothing in this life matters more."" The strange and funny thing about love is how it can just happen when we least expect it to, when we feel very little to no control over our lives, when it seems at almost the most inconvenient time it just simply happens. Just like the seasons of nature it is an element vitally needed so not just can the world be nurtured to continue to grow and thrive but our own spirits.This film is one of my favorite romance films but also an honorable mention in favorite Christmas movies. The film is sort of an anthology by its nature as the stories are focused on multiple individuals whom all somewhat are in the same place and sometimes connect and intersect with each other, but the theme is the same which is about love.To me this is one of those romance films done right for one thing each of the stories like in any anthology are short which means there's no filler and sub plot nonsense which is what plagues a lot of bad rom coms and make them forget what movie they are.Most importantly though they each keep their eye on the ball, each of the stories knows who they are and what they want to say and be which is part of why the stories and characters in them to this day are endearing and timeless. Ok, not everyone of them one or two I can leave out but like with all anthologies it's all a matter of your preference.The cast consists of an all star cast which most of the time isn't always a good mix as it's been known when most films which consist of all-star casts don't always equal good movies. But fortunately, this film is one of those case where it does, personally I feel an all-star cast film can work where you use each of them right and well but also have a good story.Though believe or not, this film didn't consist of an all star cast as only half of them were major leaguers and most others we're either unknowns or minor league players, this film was sort of a launch point for them. It makes watching the film even more interesting seeing a face or two getting their start, and anyone that has seen it before at the time thinking who knew.I'll just say a few of the stories I really like as there are a lot of them.Jamie and Aurelia: Colin Firth is just great as Jamie, I like how in the film he sort of looks like Richard Castle, ok not really but from his haircut and the way he's dressed, even a little of his character is a bit similar to that character.
Here he's a guy a bit on the introverted side, he's a little down on his luck as he has writers block or on a losing streak as he's had one bad book after another.It's also funny how his a bit of a slob as his desk are always in disarray as we see papers are dis or unorganized but also a bit of a caffeine addict as he has a series of coffee mugs pileing up his desk, this sort of reflects his whole life and even love life is in total disarray.But of course, his luck is just about to change when Aurelia comes into his life. She is played by a lovely actress, Lucia Moniz whom hasn't really done any other movies outside of her region afterward. Anyway, I really like the chemistry between the two is just beautiful as both are from two different worlds.The relationship is somewhat ironic as his profession part of what it's about is communicating with everyone around you by putting your ideas out there. We see that Aurelia really is good for him from not just making his house more livable but helping him become more assertive, do what he must do.One interesting moment is when he visits his family which I'll admit was something that came completely out of the blue. This scene works well in two ways, I really liked that look on his face which is exactly what we're all thinking, and it says, ""Wait a minute what am I doing here."" He realizes he's not where he should be that his place is with Aurelia. But also, it was sort of the broken fourth wall joke as that look is someone that suddenly walked into the wrong Christmas movie, like a scene that was just inserted at the last minute which was the point and joke. What he does at the last minutes are beautiful, I won't say anything else about this except it show both truly are on the same page.Mark and Juliet: This is another which is a small one, which involves Juliet and Mark played well by one of my favorite actress Kira Knightly and Andrew Lincoln whom weren't stars at the time. This one is simply about unrequited love; we see in one scene where Mark inadvertently fudges up a wedding video for Juliet and her husband Peter played by Chiwetel Ejiofor before he was a star.We see Mark is a guy that has always harbored feelings for Juliet but never said anything as he was too afraid to. Which is understandable for some people it's really doesn't come easy and it's not so much fear of being shot down but being misunderstood. Or even simply the fact in life you let certain things get in your way which is an easy thing for all of us to do because hey life happens and dilemmas don't solve themselves; but also, simply not believing in oneself enough. It can also be a painful dilemma and cross to harbor as it leaves people wondering what could have happened if they did make a move.Though we know it might not have made much difference as Juliet doesn't feel the same way about him as she'll always see him as a friend which is also understandable too because that's also part of life as one doesn't always feel the same way or anything more about the other, it's just simply not in the cards.But the final minutes of the story result in a timeless scene which has been parodied a lot over the years. But this scene was obviously an homage to ""A Hard Day's Night"" which of course is the cue card scene. It's just really sweet because he never says a word and he doesn't need to because in each of the cards he presents he is expressing his feelings for her but also shows how he's begun to become more assertive and find love of his own. This also goes with another quote from ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" which is ""If love is true, really true it doesn't need an answer.""Prime Minister and Natalie: This one of course involves Hugh Grant whom at the time was somewhat the king of romance movies. Here he plays a prime minister of the UK, it's that simple story of the man that has everything except love. And there is his secretary Natalie played by Martine McCutcheon whom I think is cute and hot, it's too bad this actress didn't have a little more afterward as she's a capable one.The interplay between both Prime Minister and Natalie is just sweet as we see both are struggling to maintain a professional relationship, but we see that cracks are forming. Both already know what they feel for one another but have not just been unassertive about those feelings but have never felt or made time for them, as we see both are too busy maintaining and living a lifestyle but not a life, hence the fact Prime Minister's real name isn't known because he has no life outside of office. This makes both sympathetic as we see it's can be a very lonely and two-dimensional existence, sure you have success but as they say what good is it without happiness, to me that can be a waste of life too.I really like it when we see the Prime Minister finally being assertive or has been given the push to it when a high ranking political member sexually harasses Natalie and the Prime Minister in a speech defends her which shows he not just shows the strength of his integrity but also how strong his feelings for Natalie really are. When the payoff happens it's just sweet because it shows how the one you love is closer than you think but also putting your feelings out there for the other isn't as hard as it seems.Love can happen everywhere to anyone, throughout the holidays.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sickly sweet but without the honey,"There's no real surprise in the fayre served up by this movie. It's a movie of the feel good variety, but there's at least a few of the characters that don't have everything their own way.The film would have been more interesting if it would have focussed on a smaller number of relationships. We don't ever really get a deep understanding of any of the relationships which is a shame, since it would have been nice to get to know some of them a bit better.Alan Rickman is excellent as the grumpy Harry and his relationship with his wife Karen (Emma Thompson) and secretary Mia is the most complex and interesting  of the relationships. In terms of laughs Bill Nighy steels the show and the rest of the cast all contribute exactly what you would expect of them. There isn't anything outstanding in the movie, but it's a fairly pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.

"""Smug, Actually"" would have been a better title","One of the worst films its been my misfortune to see - I saw it for free and still wanted my money back. Smug middle class trash and one of the most manipulative films it's been my misfortune to sit through. The opening 9/11 reference was unbelievably crass and offensive and it was downhill from there. The saving grace was Laura Linney but her character just seemed to be discarded when Richard Curtis couldn't seem to contrive a way to get her back into the plot. Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson have both shown how multiple storylines can be handled to amazing effect - evoking a genuine emotional response from the audience. Richard Curtis just strings together a few popular scenes from his other scripts, desperately trying to squeeze a laugh or tear from the audience. Depressingly this is one of the most successful UK films ever - despite having little or no resemblance to any London that actually exists. I think the audience's reaction will be different in hindsight when, on a second viewing, they realise they've been had.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

nobody does it better,"This review written 12 years after the release.The nice thing about belated reviews is that we the reviewers can stop all the pretence and coyness.By now we realize that our views -- over a decade after the fact -- matter not a whit or a jot, so we can say what we feel without worrying about offending another IMDb member or the producers or any of the stars.So I will just say it: BRILLIANT.Possibly the best anthology Rom-Com ever done.

Life is full of interruptions and complications but true love lasts a lifetime.,"Love, Christmas, London, EnglandRichard Curtis, the talented writer of the very successful Four Weddings and Funeral, Nottting Hill, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and one of Mr. Bean's the creators, wrote and directed Love Actually, and what a directing debut it is. The ultimate romantic dramedy, the film that is not ashamed to be sweet, heartwarming, and outrage romantic. Love Actually talks about love, romances, break-ups, moving on, and does it admirably. This is the film I can watch over and over - during Christmas time or spring time, or summer, and it always brings warmth, humor, laughs, sadness, and yes, Love that is everywhere, just look a little closer. This is the film that makes me smile and even brings the tears to my eyes - all at once. Love Actually gives romantic comedy its good name back. It is a very good movie - sometimes, close to perfect, gorgeous, sweet in the good sense of the word and always lovely.First, and foremost, I admire the film for outstanding (and I mean it) cast. Some of the best British and American and European actors (and there is also simply gorgeous Rodrigo Santoro who deserves a special mention) play twenty or even more Londoners who were hit by the Cupid's arrow during the Christmas season of 2003 in absolutely stunningly looking, lively and bright London. I won't be original if I say that the funniest character belongs to Bill Nighy as once super-famous rock star (in Keith Richard's type) who is making his comeback with an old love song that he is turning in the Christmas super hit. Another outstanding performance belongs to divine Emma Thompson. She brings depth and real emotions into her and Alan Rickman's story of the marriage in crisis. Laura Linney's story of love that was so close and possible but not meant to be was also very well told and acted.This time, Liam Neeson's story as a newly widower with the young step-son who is desperately in love with the most popular girl in school, touched me the most. After recent untimely tragic death of Neeson's wife, the mother of his two sons, Natasha Richardson, the story feels the most poignant and sweetest. The scene during Daniel's wife funeral, his speech celebrating Joanna's life, moved me almost to tears.Yes, it is a long movie and it tells the stories of 20 people or so who all happen to live, work, fell in love, sometimes have their hearts broke in London that I've never seen so bright and lovely as in this picture - perhaps, because the stories start five weeks prior to Christmas and end on Christmas night. With so many intertwining stories, not all of them are equally good. Some could be dropped, leaving the movie shorter, leaner, and perhaps better but even the way it is, Love Actually deserves its place on such top lists as Best of 2003, Favorites, and Favorite Romance. It is beautiful and magical - just like the season during which it takes place.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I'm amazed at the high ratings,"This is a pretty good movie considering that the director took a meat axe to his original creation because he had made it 80 minutes too long. Apparently, almost all of the scenes that were to introduce us to the characters were chopped leaving a very disconnected beginning. In addition, the ending was supposed to bring everything neatly together (rather than just having everyone show up at Heathrow) with Rowan Atkinson portraying an angel who brought all of the couples together (didn't it look strange that Atkinson just happened to be in line where Liam Neeson needed him?). Not only was the angel dropped, everything the angel did (which was supposed to make it all make sense) went with it. It is hard to believe that a director could leave himself in the position of having to chop one-third of his film. It is even harder to believe that fans would give the pasted-together two-thirds such high marks. The acting, which was almost uniformly top notch, and the outstanding music made the movie look much better than the director deserved, and perhaps the story he ended up with was better than the one he wanted to make. I guess it truly is better to be lucky than good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

If you can make it through this movie without laughing aloud a few times, or shedding a few tears, then you are inhuman, much like the Grinch before his heart grew.

A Reminder That We Are All Looking For Love,"When it comes to love, we find it comes in many forms and in mysterious ways. Showcasing the truest bits of love found in everyday life, Love Actually gives us multiple stories of a human struggle. Starting off a bit slow, the individual relationships are all fleshed out distinctly and create a very unique and charming tale. While each story is fairly entertaining, some of them are worth more emotional investment, leaving others feeling like perfect bathroom breaks. Although it isn't perfect, it all comes together in a beautiful ensemble in the end. Complete with an all star cast, this film is an English 'Who's Who' of celebrities, each adding a cute and fun performance to their story. It is fun getting to see these big actors interacting in such quirky ways and taking on roles that are delightfully unexpected. Love Actually takes us on a very real and human journey through the love and lives of different individuals, reminding us that it comes we are all just people, in need of love.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Holiday Reminder,"Some feel that this perennial favorite film, LOVE ACTUALLY, is a response to the global devastation and fear that the September 11, 2001 created - a deeply felt longing for a return to peace and for acknowledging love. That may have influenced writer/director Richard Curtis to create this series of stories, but whether that is the case or not, this cinematic miracle has become a holiday must see and relive-experience for many of us.The stories - and there are many of them - are set in England the month before Christmas and are as varied as the feeling of love itself: a has-been rock star ultimately discovers his true love is his male manager (Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher), the Prime Minister finds attraction to a feisty employee (Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon), a desiring female longs for a fellow employee but owns her love for her ill brother (Laura Linney and Rodrigo Santoro), a married couple deals with adultery (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson), a writer discovers true love in a Portuguese maid (Colin Firth and Sienna Guilory), a newly married couple cope with an ambiguous friend's attraction (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln), a father advises his young son about going for love (Liam Neeson and Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and more.Not only is the story well written and directed and full of Christmas spirit, but it also is superbly acted by an outstanding cast. Get the feeling of love that we need to embrace: try LOVE ACTUALLY. Highly recommended for repeated viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Facile and muddled, yet pleasant and amusing enough","The DVD analysis and out-takes make a few things clear.  The writer-director had a great many ideas, some brilliant, many overblown, but far too many to be contained in a two-hour-and-eight-minute-and-at-that-still-too-long commercially aimed holiday movie.  One of the sad results is that the five out-takes included on the DVD would have been five of the best 8 scenes in the movie.  apparently, nearly three-and-a-half hours were filmed and the editing obviously turned into a ""team effort"" in the absolute worst sense of the term.One theme, almost a mantra to the people involved with the film, is that these were all conceptually variations on one basic story, with common threads from the global tapestry of love.  This is great stuff for film school, but in direct conflict with what studio executives think there audiences want to see when they come out to see a romantic comedy at holiday time.  And, this time, the execs are probably closer to what's best for the film than the creative geniuses who can no longer see the forest -- but they are hooked totally on commercial viability.With 20-20 hindsight, the problems are easy to see. Most simply, eight-plus stories are at least two-plus too many.  Unfortunately, the two weakest and most peripheral stories also had the hottest and most marquee-worthy names. Somewhere there may be a brilliant movie waiting to be made with UK Prime Minister Hugh Grant refusing to continue being a lap dog for US President Billy Bob Thornton after the latter puts the make on an office girl that the former had his eye on.  But, it would require much more emphasis on governmental and global issues that did not belong in this movie -- with the result that, really, none of this belonged in the movie.  But, how can you cut out Hugh Grant's character and keep the film commercially viable?  You can't -- but since the format allows for no expansion of the complications of such a romance for a Prime Minister, you are left with a subplot with little to offer beyond the charm of the two principals portraying the actors.   Similarly, the Colin Firth character was supposed to connect somehow to Alan Rickman's character's mistress -- who in turn -- would have supplied some important insights.  Without them, we have the ugly Briton in the South of France trying to write a novel with a Portuguese ""beauty"" who speaks no English and is as shallow as a wading pool. So, we get Colin Firth's considerable panache, a bunch of forgettable slapstick and even more forgettable wistfulness, an enjoyably choreographed --if overblown -- march through a Portuguese village, and a waste of 25-or-so all-too-valuable minutes of the movie's run-time.  There's a bittersweet subplot with a wedding photographer that doesn't quite belong in the pastiche in the manner intended. The subplot with the overdependent brother ruining a love-life via cellphone falls flat quickly as well.   The shame is that stripping these excess threads out would have allowed the film's true gems and interesting vignettes (Liam Neeson & son, Rickman & Thompson's entire family, the sex doubles, the singer-manager duo, and the stud with the American dream and his nay-saying friend) to keep their more memorable scenes and weave more seamlessly into the director's intended tapestry.Okay, so much for the movie that did not get to be released.  I believe that one that did get released did retain the writer-director's pervasive message of the delightful incongruities of the ""family holiday"" aspects of Christmas contrasted against all the commercial selling of sex concurrently airing during the period whilst adult sex-party games are in full force.  Too bad these messages are not nearly as insightful or revelatory as intended. Worse, including all these smutty references -- irrespective of motivation -- limits its accessibility to an 8-to-14-year-old holiday audience that would have otherwise found much to enjoy.In summary, Love Actually is full of flaws and misfires.  The closer you get to the movie, the more you'll see them.  But, if your looking for a pleasant enough pastiche of attractive people delivering witty and urbane dialog in a pleasant setting with a great soundtrack -- then put down your critic's pencil, check your brains, grab someone you love, and enjoy Love Actually.My score: 7/10.  By the way, if you enjoyed Hugh Grant in this film, make certain you see the far-better About A Boy from 2002.  He's terrific in the comedy, and the film is quite a bit of fun for all but the most extremely hypercritical or for avid haters of Mr. Grant.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

One of the best romantic comedies,"This is a great movie to see. I think that it couldn't arrive in a better moment, just when we need that exact amount of laugh, love and relax.

The stories are all great, they are funny, touching, emotional, but above all real...perhaps they don't all end happily, but thats life, and in a way, they do end happy if you see behind them. The performances are great, everybody shines in their way, you will laugh with all of them because stories are treated equally and none outcasts the others.Sometimes I think its unbelievable that such a simple movie can show the best of humanity, which is love in every way, not only couples, but friends, parents, children, partners, brothers. This is the kind of movie I really enjoy because apart from the fact that is really really  well done, and makes you laugh a lot, it leaves you a brilliant sensation and, as I said, its message its so simple, but yet so true and so necessary these days.Please, go see it!!

But the ones who stand out are Liam Neeson (Fabulous), Hugh Grant (Charming, as ever), Colin Firth (Restrained), Emma Thompson (Top-Notch), Bill Nighy (Flawless) & The Late/Great Alan Rickman (Superb).On the whole, 'Love Actually' works from start to end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

One of the best romantic comedies ever,"Its totally different to most others in the genre, it stereotypes the clichés and then mocks them beautifully, it explores different types of love, couples, married couples, kinship, business relationships, etc. There's actually eight stories in this film, some cross over, some blend together and some stand alone, but they all play wonderfully; and the humour is consistent from start to finish.Littered with top names, and scripted by the brilliant Richard Curtis -Love Actually breaks the mould of the romantic comedy genre while remaining totally appealing to the fans of the tradition.10/10 Brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Infatuation, Actually","Well, I finally saw Love, Actually. I hadn't planned to. I've read a number of articles on why it's awful - most notably Lindy West's hilariously savage takedown - so I figured I could skip it. But I was with my girlfriend's family and it was on so there you are.It's hard to be objective after so much anti-anticipation, but I'm inclined to say that, if you accept that this is manipulative and nonsensical, it's a reasonably effective bit of Hollywood Christmas entertainment. Just ignore that romance is reserved for young women without a lot to say and that this movie is not about love at all but instead is about becoming infatuated with people you don't know and may have nothing in common with and it's all fine.The structure is unusual, in that's it's a series of little intertwined vignettes about a group of interconnected people. A little boy is in love with a girl he hasn't spoken to, a guy falls in love with a woman who doesn't speak English, a Prime Minister has the hots for an attractive woman everyone in the movie inexplicably describes as fat (as though the part was written for a heavier woman and then some producer shouted ""WE CAN'T HAVE A FAT CHICK IN THIS MOVIE!"").Many of the characters are likable in general, and some of the scenes, taken by themselves, are kind of brilliant. Yes, that guy putting his emotional baggage on a newlywed is screwed up, but IT'S DONE IN SIGNS! No, it makes no sense those two people who couldn't converse and barely interacted fell in love, but the culminating scene is funny and rather touching. There is no movie that requires stand ins for a series of nothing but sex scenes, but those scenes are funny and the low-key relationship that develops is the most likable and believable thing in the movie.What Love, Actually is, above all else, is *clever.* The exhausting, sometimes annoying structure is clever. There are ingenious scenes and situations and some sharp dialogue. But the cleverness seems to exist for its own sake rather than in the service of saying something about love or lust or the human condition, so the whole thing is kind of empty.Would I have rated this movie higher if I had no information going in? Probably. I probably would have given it a 7 and said it was dumb but entertaining even though I found jumping from story to story a little annoying. I can't imagine rating it higher than 7, though, and definitely don't see this as a particularly good example of the romantic comedy.It's not really as bad as I thought it might be. If you're curious to see what all the fuss is about, go ahead and take a look.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The most heart warming movie ever!,"The entire movie was so amazing, absolutely the best film on love ever made! I absolutely love John the sex double! ""I'm really quite shy about this sort of thing..."" Love it!!! I really thought that the message of love and its many forms was conveyed so beautifully! It was NOT by any means just ANOTHER LOVE movie. In fact, the idea and concept were startlingly original. One would think, ""Oh, rubbish! It's only a movie about love, C'mon now!"" This however, is heart warming, sensational, emotional... I was actually jumping up and down cheering for love to prevail. It's truly astounding and I suggest you watch it.

Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.7
Overall, an enjoyable Christmas movie that is carried by its writing and performances as we get to see the unique concept of multiple storylines happening in parallel with their common goal of finding love, though it is a bit bloated from having too many subplots and suffers from many Rom-Com and early 2000s cliches.Pretty Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is pretty good as he connects the different storylines into one overarching plot (though the world-building felt very typical to other Rom-Coms); the direction on a microscale was pretty typical to other Rom-Coms (though executed well); the direction of actors was good as it felt like everyone was connected and gave a performance that helped move the movie forward; the storytelling was pretty unique as it juggles multiple different subplots that converge to a giant ending), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good from Hugh Grant (Uses his charm, charisma, and experience in romantic movies to aid his performance), Good from Liam Neeson (My favorite performance in the cast as he develops a strong chemistry with his son and effectively displays grief from the loss of his wife), Pretty Good from Colin Firth (Uses his experience in romantic movies to propel this performance forward), Pretty Good from Laura Linney (Felt a bit out of place, but does well in the scenes she is in), Good from Emma Thompson (Shows betrayal well and has a good range of emotion throughout the movie), Pretty Good to Good from Alan Rickman (A surprisingly comedic performance from Rickman, but he holds his own well and shows some range of emotion (at least however much he can with his mundane voice)), Pretty Good from Keira Knightley (Really just a name as she isn't given that much screen time (but still does a pretty good job with the scenes she is in)), Pretty Good from Martine McCutcheon (Works well off of Grant), Pretty Good from Bill Nighy (A very over-the-top performance that provides humor in his non-sequitur scenes), Pretty Good from Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean), Pretty Good from Lúcia Moniz (Has chemistry with Colin Firth), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone plays their role well as this movie is more about an ensemble cast than a singular performance)), Good Story (The concept was very unique as the different storylines converging to one was a pretty new idea at the time (though it was heavily exploited after), there are a little too many stories (maybe could have cut the 1-2 of them to make the movie a bit tighter); the plot structure was very unique as it was multiple storylines converging to one climax (though there are some other climaxes as not all the storylines converge to the same point); flow between sequences was surprisingly good as the transitions between the different stories were seamless at times (using music and characters); character writing was good as you get a sense of what each character's struggle was and what they are looking for during the holiday season), Good Screenplay (The dialogue was pretty good and flowed well (but did have cliche Rom-Com lines); the movie has some very iconic scenes that were parodied/referenced in other forms of media; the humor was good (though did feel very 00s); the symbolism was kinda light (but its a Rom-Com so I cannot complain that much); the foreshadowing was very good as it was used effectively to help connect the different storylines together), Pretty Good Score/Pretty Good Soundtrack (Helps set the Christmas tone), Decent Cinematography, Decent Sound, Good Editing (Helps with transitioning between the different stories), Pacing was pretty good as it did not feel very slow or fast, Climax was executed well as it converges many of the storylines to one singular event (and the climaxes of the other storylines were also handled well), Tone felt exactly was the genre was (A Christmas, Rom-Com)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Its a very pleasing film, but it does stay true to its name as well as a movie could anyway, it is more like Love Actually. The question is who will be lucky enough to find it this time around.

"A disappointing film, potentially offensive","This film promised so much, a warm and sincere study of the enduring force of love. Yet what it delivered was insincere, badly presented, scatty and unfulfilling.If I had been a fat person I would have found the constant references to obesity deeply offensive. This film tragically reinforces the message to more impressionable viewers that there are two basic classes of people - the thin, attractive ones and the fat ugly ones. I found the film divisive, shallow and empty as a result. It's a sad fact that if the negative references were about race or height, there would have been an outcry, and the film would never have made it to the big screen.Fortunately, this film will be forgotten, not least of all because it is incoherent. It is impossible to have 40 main characters and expect to deliver a punchy, memorable film. There are some good performances, some funny scenes, but basically it is a poor film that did so little with so much.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Something new,Many stories on the big screen at the same time does not leave you bored.(even though I watched it on a small screen) The only problem with these is that I didn't have a close relationship with any of the characters.

Quite beautiful,"I had seen this film some time ago, but not watched properly. It is schmaltzy, and corny, - true. It is also a beautiful, actual portrayal of love's twists, and should include a few threads that everyone can relate to. So I am sitting here at 4am, wanting to share the moment that I've just had with you all.One of the questions in the list was what was everyone's favourite love story. Mine is the one shared by Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman, - though of course this is not one of the nicer threads. But I have just watched a particular scene (will not mention it in case those reading have not yet seen the film) and I am sitting here weeping... that's really one of the finest moments I have ever witnessed on screen... and not a single word is said.This is a stunning little film.

"Not that good, actually.","Love Actually is a cute romantic comedy. But just ""cute"" as I said. Nothing like a masterpiece, not even close. Quite superficial indeed. This much of romance is simply plasma state, i.e. does not occur on planet earth. The Hollywoodish screenplay surely doesn't add much to the quality. It's designed to be a feel happy movie, and that's pretty much the only thing it's good for.A few nice jokes, a hell load of beautiful women, an extremely unrealistic plot, overexaggeration of the love concept, a Hollywood movie shot by Brits. That's what Love Actually is. Not rubbish, but just not good enough.I recommend it to anyone who can't stand watching movies with subtitles. That's the level of superficiality this movie matches. For anyone else, go find yourself a lover, and watch this movie when you both are drunk. Either way, you won't remember a trace of it half an hour after it ends, but you'll enjoy it while it lasts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Brilliant, non-stop, dazzling network of relationships, very British, very fun","Love Actually (2003)This huge network of feel good stories could have been sloppy and sappy. Oh, heck, it is sloppy and sappy, and that's why it's so lovable. And great, in its own way. A whole slew of top notch actors give really sincerely spot on performances--all of them rather brief in terms of screen time because there are so many stories here, but still satisfying.What is there not to like about a movie where almost everyone succeeds in overcoming something, mostly loneliness? The point of love actually is actually just love, and falling in love, and making what love they already have meaningful. There are relationships that makes sense, like Laura Linney's heartbreaking nurturing of her mentally challenged brother to the detriment of her own love life. There is the painfully realistic and mature marriage between two sophisticated educated professionals, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, with their varying levels of sincerity. And there is the Prime Minister of Britain himself, played by Hugh Grant, who falls in love, and resists falling in love, with his secretary. Throw in a more drab if pretty-ish Keira Knightley, a wonderfully love-sick Andrew Lincoln, and the oddly adult relationship between Liam Neeson and his cute cute stepson and it gets more and more layered up and fun.While certainly the film is well known here in the U.S., it is practically a national treasure, from what I gather, amongst rank and file Brits. This is a thoroughly British movie, to be sure, and more lovable for it. For one thing, they have removed all the pomp and security machinations around the Prime Minister, so he seems just like a regular lonely guy who goes to work and gets coffee. Then there is the key scene where this Hugh Grant P.M. stands up to the visiting American President, and it's a great rah-rah moment.While not all the actors are British, most are, and some very much so, such as Bill Nighy who plays so dazzlingly well the aging rock star on the comeback. The terrific British comedian Rowan Atkinson has a couple of key roles that are brilliant. And so on. Of course the President is Billy Bob Thornton (Arkansas) and Linney is a good old New Yorker (bless her) and there is Claudia Schiffer who is international somehow, but born in Germany.All of these people are interconnected in ways that really don't strain the plot. (A wonderfully excessive chart of all these, with French text, oddly, is clickable on the Love Actually wikipedia page.) The writing and directing are both the work of one man, Richard Curtis, who has directed only one other film but has written a slew of them (and who is only British by means of the Empire--he's from New Zealand). But if the direction is solid, the writing is sublime. Yes, it doesn't strive for Shakespeare level profundity, and it doesn't reach it, either, but it's really smart, snappy, believable, funny stuff. That will also get you in the gut if you let it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A more adult Christmas movie that's not for younger viewers!,"Since I watched this film by myself on a Thursday night for Christmas time here's my spoiler-free review of Love Actually! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, my early Christmas memories of listening to the music from the soundtrack when I was younger and my conclusion/rating! This Christmas flick has more adult themes than family-friendly Christmas movies & I watched it 20 years later! I always remember when my brother Jordy and I listened to the songs from the film; Christmas Is All Around by Billy Mack & All I Want For Christmas Is You by Olivia Olson my Dad would always play those songs when it got closer to Christmas or drive around to see the Christmas lights! Overall I enjoyed this movie as an older viewer and I do believe you should check out & listen to the 2 songs of the soundtrack (like I mentioned before). That's why I'm giving this a 7/10!

One of the worst films ever made,"After seeing this I wanted to inflict actual bodily harm on Richard Curtis. I'm not joking. I really, really did. Love Actually is the vilest, most ghastly, most putrid film I have ever seen. It is appalling. The nadir of Curtis's output, it is a toe-curling abomination. Where to start? What about the pure, undiluted cynicism of the enterprise, evident in everything from the music to the manipulative sentimentality to the use of children to the Christmas setting. It's a film with no heart, no structure, no sense, just a series of orchestrated, contrived scenes, augmented by the odd stale comic line (eg 'Now I can only get into dresses that belonged to Pavarotti') and utterly stupid improbabilities. To go through those would take way, way too long. And what's with the use of bad language in the most inappropriate of situations? Do not see this vomit-inducing turkey of a movie, especially in a couple if you're a man because it may well end your relationship, which would actually be quite ironic, eh Mr Curtis?",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Romantic comedy with something for everyone,"I like the thinking behind Richard Curtis' concept for ""Love Actually."" Why tell one Christmas love story when you can tell eight? Everyone loves Christmas, everyone loves love, and if you can tell eight stories that are all related but about something different, you're bound to have everyone who sees the film relate to at least one of the story lines. It sounds sort of gimmicky when put in those terms, but with good writing and some great actors, ""Love Actually"" works and is surprisingly enjoyable despite a high cheese factor.""Love Actually"" is sort of the ultimate British-American romantic comedy. When you put Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thorton (and then some) all in the same billing, it's ridiculously impressive. You almost can't fail. I mean, at one point there is a scene featuring a sort of negotiation between Grant, the prime minister of the U.K. and Thorton, the president of the U.S. If the demographic for this film isn't overstated with Christmas and romance already, that certainly ices the cake.The story lines are for the most part all good, but with eight of them, they all don't have to be. You pick the ones that you like and you stomach the ones you don't as much because you know they won't last long enough to bore or annoy you. Some people will like the more comedic ones like Bill Nighy as a recording artist trying to re-ignite his career with a hit Christmas single and some will like the more straight up romance like when Firth, an author, tries to communicate his feelings for a Portuguese woman who doesn't speak English. Fortunately, it's not disjointed either, so you don't feel you're watching several different films. Christmas time helps set that tone, but in general the mood the film is consistent in all the story lines.Like most romantic comedies, there's always a cheese factor, but the better ones make you forgive the cheese. For the most part, ""Love Actually""'s cheese is very forgivable. Towards the end it gets a little out of hand, but you are so immersed in the story lines that you let it go. The humor of the film is also so strong that it also earns your appreciation regardless of how much you like romance.As far as film concepts that seem like romantic comedy sell-outs are concerned, ""Love Actually"" is probably one of the best. It's diverse but cohesive and funny to all senses of humor. It has a killer cast and of course good heart and strong themes. So as much as you might think you're watching just another romantic comedy about Christmas, ""Love Actually"" at least convinces you that for the time you're wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Stand out moments make this worth revisiting,"I like aspects of this film very much. Every Christmas, I watch this because my sister loves it and she wants me to watch it with her. Sometimes I think ""oh no, not again"" but then I remember the brilliant moments in the various sub-plots that make this a memorable film worth seeing again. For my taste, there is too much unnecessary bad language, and sexual references directed at children, which seems inappropriate to me even if it's a mature treatment of the subject. But I can usually forgive these lapses. It's well-acted and the performances that stand out for me are Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. All are doing what they do best, playing English people struggling with their emotions.It is a very British film and the reason why it may not have done so well in the US may not just be down to the PM's speech (referred to in earlier comments). There are a lot of subtle and not-so subtle jokes, and overall, it's a feel-good movie with some realism thrown in.I have read the other reviews on this site and it's interesting to see how polarised the opinions are. I'm tending to agree more with the negative comments and I think the problem with the film is that it's very unrealistic, and simplistic, and there are too many stories covered in a superficial way. Romantics might love it, but anyone who has a strong cringe reflex will probably dislike it. My previous comments still stand, but I'm not a big fan of it. I also think it does a dis-service to the image of Britain and the jokes are on the whole not very funny, unfortunately.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Comedy is all around,Richard Curtis creates movie magic with this romantic comedy set at Christmas. He combines at least seven stories beautifully and introduces us to the same sort of manic and lovable people that we have become accustomed to in his other films.From ageing rock stars to the Prime Minister this film has it all. As with all of Curtis' comedies there is enough sap and sentiment to sink a ship but really at Christmas we want to be made to feel warm inside and this film certainly does that.Not all the stories work but the majority do in order to make this film an instant classic that can be watched every year at Christmas time.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Somehow, it manages to overkill with the cutesy humor and the sappy plot lines about relationships.

Charming Christmas classic,"Who doesn't love Love Actually? I know I do. It's such a sentimental, goofy, overblown pile of mush and I love it even more for all those reasons. Not to sound sappy, but a lot of the situations and character interactions it entails are blunt, awkward truths made even more hilarious by an even more awkward cast, and encapsulate the true meaning of Christmas. Not all the couples work out, not all of the individual stories end well or in satisfaction for themselves or the audience. But you know what? That's life, and they make the best out of what they have at this special time of year, which is what it's really about. To balance it out, not all of them end like that; some turn out splendidly for the characters, leaving them beaming. Some learn tough lessons that are necessary for growth, some find love in storybook fashion and others are simply there for coming relief. And what comedy we get, tearful drama as well, delivered by an astoundingly massive cast of British legends, speckled by a few familiar Yankee faces as well. Liam Neeson plays a grieving father whose son (Thomas Bodie Sangster) is sick with love. Neeson's sister (Emma Watson, grounded, real, heartbreaking) deals with her irresponsible husband (Alan Rickman, incapable of a false note). The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant in flustered, fumbling glory) is attracted to his cute secretary (Martine Mcutcheon) and aloof writer Colin Firth feels pangs for his Portuguese housekeeper who speaks not a word of English. Laura Linney has a steamy office romance with Rodrigo Santoro whilst dealing with an ill sibling, Bill Nighy is hysterical as a cynical pop star learning what old age means, Keira Knightely, Chiwetel Efjor and Andrew Lincoln are involved in a subtle love triangle, and there's all kinds of interwoven people including Martin Freeman, Desmond Askew, Elisha Cuthbert, Ivana Milicevic, January Jones, Claudia Schiffer, Shannon Elizabeth, Denise Richards, Sienna Guillory, Billy Bob Thornton as the sleazy US President and a priceless Rowan Atkinson as the world's weirdest jewelry salesman. It's a big old circus of Christmas spirit with all kinds of different motivations, desires and relationships, which reach a festive fever pitch of a finale as all the stories escalate into giddy yuletide melodrama and cathartic god times that are impossible to not smile at.

Sweet and honest,"This movie, about the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love who lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England, is a good holiday comedy movie!I think it is slower and more dragging than I remember. The movie is stacked with characters and stories and has therefore much to pack in. Anyway, I think it somewhat manages to convey its sweetness, sadness, love, and much more. The actors do great and the scenes are mostly captivating. The movie does not take itself too seriously, so there is much to laugh at because of its satire. It fits as a Christmas movie, and while it probably is not for all ages, it is a light popcorn flick that can entertain without full attention.In conclusion, this is a charming holiday movie with humor, emotion, and festive spirit.

made me appreciate romantic comedy,"A long time ago i went to see Love Actually only to indulge a certain lady. It turned out it's been one of those romantic comedies that captured the essence of the genre. Not only that i went out of the theater in good spirits, i've seen it several times since with repeated satisfaction.So what is this movie about? Obviously, the title explains it all and might even summarize the plot. It tells several love stories and covers more or less all variations. Yet the best thing with Love actually is that it vibrates with positive energy without becoming cheesy, stupid or vulgar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Rubbish, actually","This film would have been a lot better had the number of stories been cut and each plot allowed to develop a little further. Often this film was cringing, the PM dancing to 'Jump' (sadly not Van Halen either) and the school boy who has fallen in love. There were some redeeming features, particularly involving Alan Rickman's relationship with his PA(?), Andrew Lincoln's with Keira Knightley and the story of Colin Firth's relationship, but apart from the latter, these stories were not allowed to develop. As with all Richard Curtis films the characters are so bloody British and upper middle-class that frankly it gets rather tiring and the formula of sticking Hugh Grant as a main character and having Rowan Atkinson in a small role is wearing rather thin.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"You wanna watch an excellent, touching Brit com, featuring a load of Brit stars? Something along the lines of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral?"" Then you wanna watch THIS ONE!","This movie has MANY plot strings, connected to the prime actors, the STARS of this movie, as in Liam Neeson, the bereaved husband with his very young son who falls in love with a girl and asks his dad:Son: Daniel! I have a plan!Father (LIam Neeson): Thank the Lord! Tell me!Son: Well, girls love musicians, don't they?Liam: ""Uh-huh.""
Son: Even the really weird ones get girlfriends.Liam: That's right. Even Meatloaf definitely got laid at least once. For God's sake, Ringo Starr married a Bond girl!""
Son: Whatever.

Of course, she falls in love with him.Oh, my God, did I forget Colin Firth and his Portuguese maid, who while serving him a fresh cup of tea removes the empty cup that is holding down some 100 pages of his finished script that then fly away in the wind into the nearby lake, where both of them jump in, in the middle of winter, trying to retrieve the pages before they're getting soaked and sinking to the bottom?And how would you duplicate the ending credits, with the Beach Boys' ""God Only knows""???",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

One wedding and one funeral.,"This is a minor Richard Curtis' film, but if one is in the mood for something light, this is the movie to watch. Director Curtis has assembled an incredible array of British stars to create a film where everyone is about 6 degrees separated from the next person all the time.We have to congratulate Mr. Curtis for his musical ear, as he has selected great songs for the soundtrack. No other recent movie can flaunt a better array of love melodies to accompany the action in the film.Being this an ensemble piece, no one actor has a bigger role than another, but Hugh Grant certainly steals the film as the befuddled P.M. at the center of the action.

Watch Out For Alan Rickman!!,"I admit I watched this film mainly because Alan Rickman is in it and being his huge fan, I'd watch anything he's in.It's a decent film but there are too many characters and not much screen time for each character to have a particular strong impact to me. Some parts are quite silly. I like the soundtrack more than the movie.Alan Rickman looks real handsome especially when he dances at the party! He's the only character that strikes me.

"Bringing together several plots, the film is not about love, but about Love in its most diverse facets... and not always happy.","Unlike most romantic movies, which stick to a sugary story and follow it to the end, with the invariable marriage at the end, and everything in rosy, this movie seems to care more about love itself. , as a feeling. In fact, there are nine sub-plots involved and each one explores a different facet of love: we have teenage love, we have illicit loves, we have unlikely romances, we have love triangles, we even have a love that blossoms without one or the other. Speak the same language... and all during the pre-Christmas times! So I won't waste time sifting through each plot, maybe it's for the best.The movie could have gone terribly wrong, but the truth is that it works reasonably well. It's not a film where we can like all the characters, obviously many of them are making mistakes in the name of love, but the truth is that the film brings, with all this, a much more human and realistic tone than others of its genre. : who has never made a mistake because they fell in love, or found themselves in love with the wrong person and with full awareness of it? Even so, and despite the merits, there are indeed some subplots that seem underwritten and poorly developed, and others that I just don't understand why they were added. And I'm not in favor of some of the jokes that were being made, there's some humor that doesn't work, even though the dialogue is good and well written.I lost count of the number of great actors that went into this film. It seems that all the good British actors of the decade decided to book a coffee and show up. Some are more prominent, others not so much. Hugh Grant is one of the highlights of the film and he is really good in the role he has been given, and he plays very well with Martine McCutcheon, who also does well in her role. I also enjoyed the performances by Liam Neeson and his teenage stepson, Thomas Brodie-Sangster (who would later break out as an actor in Maze Runner). It is still beautiful to see the way their characters relate to each other and the intimacy that is created between them. Bill Nighy is funny and irreverent, but I didn't understand his subplot here, and Laura Linney is good at what she does, but I wasn't captivated by the character. The same can be said of Keira Knightley (I never particularly liked this actress). Emma Thompson is better, and she does a good job here. Finally, a small word of praise to Colin Firth, and also to my compatriot Lúcia Moniz. It feels good to see someone from our country shining abroad, and to hear our mother tongue in a foreign film.The film is not brilliant on a technical level. Betting everything, or almost, on the script, on the performance of the actors and on the very competent direction by Richard Curtis, the film is not particularly remarkable in these points, assuming a standard aesthetic and having almost nothing at the visual level that surpasses the average. There are, however, some good aspects, related to the scenarios and the choice of filming locations, very well selected and used.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A 'Feel bad about being Fat' movie,"There seemed to be a real theme going on in this film...that one has to be thin to be loved.

A romantic comedy that's ACTUALLY funny,"My sister brought the DVD of Love Actually home for Christmas, claiming she had seen it somewhere and that it was fantastic.

Shrugging it off, I didn't pay much attention. Well, this New Year's Eve 2006 on the eve of 2007, we had lots of people over and we all sat down and watched it. Now before I continue, anybody who knows me well enough knows that I am an absolute complete SUCKER for romantic comedies. It's just that, well, I haven't found a good one in a long time! Well, let's just leave it at the fact that I found it, and I hit the jackpot to be honest. Mix the movie ""Crash"" with ""The Breakup"" with ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" with ""The Terminal"" with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" with ""The Family Stone"" and you get LOVE ACTUALLY, the ultimate romantic comedy as the DVD cover boasts. A multi-plot storyline simply about a group of unique individuals trying to find love in foggy Londontown at Christmas time, Love Actually features a stellar all-star cast that includes many, many well-known actors and actresses. In the movie, you get to experience all kinds of love from a different point of view: love between two hardcore porn stars, a young boy hitting on the most popular girl in school, the British Prime Minister and his secretary, an English author and his Portuguese maid, and a million and one other unlikely combos. The result is clear: a funny, feel-good, heartwarming, and above all romantic movie that all can enjoy...not just the romantic comedy suckers like me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Ambitious movie with lots of authentic Richard Curtis moments,"After ""Four Weddings"" and ""Notting Hill"" Richard Curtis's next foray into the RomCom genre was ""Love Actually"" which, for the first time, he directed as well as wrote. It's a very ambitious movie with multiple plots and sub plots and fast cut switching between them. The cast is strong and it has the gloss of a high budget film. I suspect that like me not everyone will like all the plot lines but overall it's a satisfying Christmas movie.The romance between the jilted Jamie (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese housekeeper Aurélia (Lúcia Monica) is delightful. Set in Southern France it is an ""odd couple"" story - they have no common language but clearly strong mutual feelings. The scene where Jamie flies into France intent on proposing to Aurélia is cleverly written and very well set and directed.The premise of the developing affection between John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) is that despite acting together naked as stand ins for a porn movie they are personally shy with one another away from the set is rather preposterous. I found these scenes rather repellent but others might not. Personal choice I suppose.The best performances in the film come from Alan Rickman, as Harry, and especially Emma Thompson as Karen whose apparently happy marriage is threatened by the arrival in Harry's office of the uber-sexy Heike Makatsch as Mia. Whilst there may not have been infidelity (it's unclear) Harry's expensive gift to Mia suggests intent. When Karen finds out Thompson plays a scene of genuine pathos.The Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) story is a fairytale relating how the spectacularly unsuccessful in love Frissel decides to try his luck in America where three gorgeous girls immediately take him on and invite him to move into their apartment , and beds. It's very silly but very funny as well.Sarah (Laura Linney) has a passion, unconsummated, for the handsome Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) in her office. They do finally ""connect"" and are getting down to some love-making when Sarah's mentally disturbed brother interrupts with a phone call. I found this improbable as well as sad and slightly pointless.David (Hugh Grant) is the handsome but single new Prime Minister. He falls for the Number 10 tea lady Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) and another improbable fairy tale romance story begins to be told.There are side plots and other characters in what is essentially a feel good movie and a showcase for cameos from actors of quality. The tour de force is Bill Nighy's portrayal of the fading rock star Billy Mack - this alone justifies seeing the film.""Love Actually "" is a bit over complex and very variable in the quality and believability of the storylines. But it's a clever potpourri around the subjects of sex, love, friendship, obsession and the rest. It's hits its mark most of the time and will make you smile much more than it makes you cringe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Fresh & Fun, The best movie of the 21st century (so far)","""Love Actually"" is fresh, exciting, and utterly brilliant. It could be considered a Christmas movie, as it takes place during the Christmas holidays, however I find it to be a refreshing movie to watch at any time. What's so great about this movie is the complexity of the story, and yet the simplicity of the overall message of the film- which is given right up front for all of those who miss it- ""Love actually IS everywhere"". I personally think the filmmakers did an excellent job in making the story come to life, and the actors a superb job at giving each character life. Favorite actors in this film, for me, were Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, and most especially Emma Thompson & Alan Rickman. I must also sing praises for the production company this comes out of- Working Title has come out with some of the best films in the past few years, and they continue to seem light-years ahead of the major studios, perhaps because they are willing to take more chances. The only recent movie that ranks near ""Love Actually"" in my book is ""Last Holiday"", starring Queen Latifah. I think that romantic comedies like these two are what we need as a society- an escape from the everyday into something that seems sweet & more innocent. As time goes by, I think ""love actually"" will tunnel it way up from the recesses of film and become one of the most outstanding films of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Charming and inspiring,"What a charming movie this is. It's not perfect or anything, and probably gets a little too syrupy towards the end, but it's romantic, funny, and the star-studded cast is outstanding. Weaving through so many story lines could have left the viewer confused and unsatisfied with any of them, but director Richard Curtis pulls the right strings and keeps us entertained from beginning to end. There are just so many wonderful scenes and lines. Andrew Lincoln's card scene with Keira Knightley. Colin Firth watching Lúcia Moniz walk out of his life, and then later both of them learning each other's language. Thomas Sangster, the little boy, talking to Liam Neeson about the ""total agony of being in love"". Hugh Grant the Prime Minister going door to door to find the sweet and sometimes foul- mouthed Martine McCutcheon. And on and on.The movie is filled with all those little moments we can identify with – secret longings, flirtation, and first kisses – but also those that are bittersweet, and those that disappoint us. The overall theme of the movie, that ""love actually is all around"", even though we often focus on the incidents of hate in the world, is inspiring. The shots in London are gorgeous, and the comic relief provided by the aging rocker Bill Nighy is funny. It is a feel- good movie and bound to be criticized, but it's OK to feel good once in awhile :), and this is certainly one of the better done romantic comedies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Open Hearts, Merry Christmas","This movie is incredible, with a heart as big as Cinemascope. All the characters are constantly opening themselves up (sometimes in spite of themselves) to the possibilities and heartbreak of actual love.

It is a wonderful fable, with great music, acting, comedy and pathos. Great cameos, also, from surprising folks like Claudia Schiffer (a Christmas angel if there ever was one) and Rowan Atkinson. The last act of this movie always leaves me a puddle on the floor, and when the Beach Boys start singing, well, it's almost too much. This movie is more than about romantic love, in fact the movie itself is a tremendous gesture of generosity.

"""Love American Style"" knockoff is notable for its cast, not its content","When I heard about this film's box office success and ""who's who"" of British talent, I expected something that was sharp, funny, and romantic. What I got was a string of celebrity vignettes in ordinary situation comedy skits. It's easy to take and has enough laughs and romance for its running time, but fell short of my expectations. Take away the A-list cast and some of the sexual content and there is nothing that you haven't seen before. It could have easily been called ""Love British Style."" Liam Neeson's role as a recently widowed man was the most moving, but because it happened to him in real life, not because of anything that happens in this film. Laura Linney is given a reasonably compelling role, but the story hits a dead end, as if the writers didn't know what to do with her character. Hugh Grant is cast as the Prime Minister, but the role is written to suit his on-screen persona so his performance here seems generic and his pursuit of a member of his staff member seems far-fetched. Emma Thompson does well, but her role is pure soap opera.

Loathe Actually,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Absolute mush with no hint of a backbone in the slightest. It churns on and on and on and on, meandering from one lame contrived story to the next.

Thinking all along that there would be a point to it all, that there would be some sort of resolution, something to make sense of all the lamo, supposedly varied, love stories that are just simply awful.The writing was so bad too, as if it was written by spoilt eleven year old girl who has been sheltered from everything in life and handed anything she wanted by rich over protective and adoring parents.This film is like a big gooey sugary sweet mess of contrived and packaged imitation sugar, sprinkled with crap and delivered on a big plastic pink conveyor belt at the hope of tugging at people's heart strings.They should have handed out vomit bags in the cinemas.That this film was made is like an insult to anyone who has lived life for more than a day in their lives.The people who liked this movie are the people that open spam e mails, they're the people that vote in the Eurovision song contest, the people that stupid signs are made for, the people that don't know anything about the world, who read supermarket shelf magazines, the happy to be stupid people.

Good film,"The film is too long yet too short- there are too many characters vying for screen time in a 2 and one quarter hour long romcom(most romcoms are 1 and a half hours long). I would have much preferred it if the film were less ambitious and stuck with just 3 characters, maybe the Collin Firth, Hugh Grant, and Keira Knightley characters, for I feel these characters' stories were the most charming of them all. The film also has a tendency to veer towards corniness and sentimentality, and much of the dialogue is terribly average. But I don't care. Especially for the first hour or so, Love actually succeeds in persuading the massive cynic that I am in being absorbed by the film. And that for me is an achievement for any romcom.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Favorite Christmas Film,"""Love Actually"" is a belly-flop into the sea of romantic comedy. It contains about a dozen couples who are in love; that's an approximate figure because some of them fall out of love and others double up or change partners. There's also one hopeful soloist who believes that if he flies to Milwaukee and walks into a bar he'll find a friendly Wisconsin girl who thinks his British accent is so cute she'll want to sleep with him. This turns out to be true. The movie is written and directed by Richard Curtis, the same man who wrote three landmarks in recent romantic comedy: ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Notting Hill"" and ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" His screenplay for ""Love Actually"" is bursting enough material for the next three. The movie's only flaw is also a virtue: It's jammed with characters, stories, warmth and laughs, until at times Curtis seems to be working from a checklist of obligatory movie love situations and doesn't want to leave anything out. At 129 minutes, it feels a little like a gourmet meal that turns into a hot-dog eating contest. The romantic comedy stars, led by Hugh Grant, and you know what? Little by little, a movie at a time, Grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian. Emma Thompson plays his sister, with that wry way she has with normality, and Alan Rickman plays her potentially cheating husband with the air of a lawyer who hates to point out the escape clause he's just discovered. Laura Linney plays his assistant, who is shy to admit she loves her co-worker Karl (Rodrigo Santoro), who is also shy to admit he loves her, and so you see how the stories go round and round. Wandering past these lovable couples is the film's ancient mariner, a broken-down rock star named Billy Mack, who is played by Bill Nighy as if Keith Richards had never recorded anything but crap. Love Actually is casted so well, you recognize all the actors and actresses in other films. Alan Rickman is in this film, and now as I watch as a 19 year old, I remember when he passed away in 2016, and still cry watching this film.For Alan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Could have been so much better and is flawed in so many ways but it just about works as a sweet `date' movie but no more than that,"It's a matter of weeks until Christmas in London and despite the claims by Billy Mack's song that `Christmas is all around' really it is love that seems to be everywhere.  Some of it is flirting, some of it is infatuation, some of it is lust, some of it is loss, some of it is dedication, some of it is failing, some of it is adulterous, some of it is longing and some of it is unrequited.  In a thinly connected collection of lives, we see men and women involved in all the various types of love as the festive season approaches.Despite the hype and critical fawning over this film, I didn't bother going to the cinema to see this film as love, actually, pretty much sucked at that moment in my life!  Things hadn't really changed when I got round to seeing it on DVD but I didn't feel that I could allow myself to miss the `best British film ever' for any more time.  The film starts with one of the most morally abhorrent openings I have seen in quite some time - I put it right up there with Doberman for having the opening that made me think about stopping the film a matter of seconds into the movie.  Curtis is a successful writer, but using the memory of the murdered families of 9/11 and cashing in on their dying sentiments is tasteless in the extreme and I was shocked that he had done it.  Despite this, I stuck with the film (hell - I'd paid for it!) and was glad to find that he didn't misfire this badly again.  However the film is not as good as the hype would suggest it to be although it is amusing enough to watch once and to keep you involved.The film does well to just about keep control of so many different strands and special mention should probably go to the editors for keeping it together.  However, this does not meant that the plot is any good - just that it hangs together well despite the difficulties it presented.  It is not that good; the majority of the strands are underdeveloped and very superficial.  The `love' and relationships here do not engage and never really seem real - only the marriage damaged by flirting struck me as being a good shot at reality for many people.  The rest of the relationship are the ones you get in film - where it doesn't matter if they are based on physical attraction (like Jamie's cleaner), or on flirting or the thinnest of reasons because all that matters is that they are sweet and romantic for the duration of the film.  In this regard it manages to be just about amusing enough without ever really being funny and enjoyable without ever really being charming.  I doubt that, for me, it would hold up to repeat viewings though - the substance is just too lacking for that.What surprised me about the film most was just how very focused the characters were in terms of relationships.  With so many different characters I was surprised that each and every relationship was a) straight and b) white.  OK - Juliet's husband was black, but he was not the romantic focus of her strand.  This is not a claim of racism or anything so stupid, I was just surprised that Curtis didn't at least try to write in an `alternative' relationship to what is admittedly the `norm'.  This didn't spoil the film for me but I would have liked to see such an ensemble piece include a spread of relationships (without just making it a token thing).The cast is stellar and it is just as well as their `familiarity' helps to cover the fact that the script doesn't really help us to get to know any of the characters.  Nighy has a good time in his role and his `love' would actually have been the sweetest and most touching one of the film had it not been handled as a joke.  Firth is charming but his character is paper-thin - we see no emotion from him considering the situation at the start and his `love' is out of nothing.  Grant is OK in the most comic of the relationships but his dance is the worst scene in the film and the `anti-American' bit just seems to come out of nowhere and go nowhere. Neeson is good, but again I never felt his loss as a real thing.  Rickman and Thompson's thread is the strongest of the film and the only problem I had with them was that the film had a scene with Rickman talking about `Karl' and I couldn't stop laughing!  The remainder are mixed - Linney's relationship is interesting but not expanded on, while Freeman's stuff could easily have been lost.  Special mention from me for Sosanya - she has little to do here but she is a very good actress who still does stage work (and also happens to be gorgeous!).  The star cameos are OK - they don't add a great deal but they don't detract either - all seem to be beautiful women so I can't complain for the inclusion of Richards, Cuthbert and Schiffer. However add Wes Butters, Jo Wiley, Atkinson (pointless), Ant & Dec (funny - `Ant or Dec'!), Thornton, Parkinson and so many others and you begin to wonder why the film had to cram in so many.  To be honest with you I truly believe that this film could have been so much more touching, romantic and involving if it had lost half of these stories and just developed the remaining ones to be realer and more involving.Overall this isn't a very good film but it is so damn `busy' that it manages to make you miss the fact that it could have been so much better than it was.  The sheer amount of stuff going on means that very few of the relationship get beyond the superficial level of unrealistic romance, plus the fact that too few of the relationship bare any relation to reality (especially as more and more gorgeous cameos are wheeled out).  It may not be funny or charming but it does just enough so that it leaves you with a sweet feeling.  I quite liked it but found it hard to overlook these weaknesses - why it was so highly regarded by critics is quite beyond me but if you're after a typically romantic comedy that gives you a warm feeling with no sense of reality then this will probably do you.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Excellent America's Favourite Romantic British Christmas Movie from the year 2003,"I find Love Actually (2003) is very lovely, Because the stories are very heartwarming, and the British Christmas movie itself is very popular in the USA.

The Billy Mack's festive cover version of Love Is All Around is called Christmas Is All Around is rather witty, clever, catchy, awesome and it's sets in during Christmas time.

Christmas actually is the only time you'd get away with this,"Way back in the mid-90s it was impossible in Britain to avoid Wet Wet Wet's saccharine cover of The Troggs' Love is All Around. Thanks to its appearance in Four Weddings and a Funeral, the breakthrough movie for writer Richard Curtis, the song spent an agonising 15 weeks at Number 1 on the UK singles chart. It's a piece of baggage that Curtis seems well aware is forever attached to his name, judging by how the song's opening bars are also the backing for the opening to his directorial debut here (a film whose title appears to be a shortening of the phrase ""love actually is all around"").Here the song is repurposed as a clunky festive single for Bill Nighy's over-the-hill rocker, now titled ""Christmas is All Around"" (the torturous need to cram in extra syllables is part of the joke). It's tempting, then, to see this opening as a slightly knowing metonym for the movie as a whole: an artist whose best work may be behind him, repackaging a past hit with new Christmas wrapping in the hope that the spirit of the season of goodwill will mean giving the laziness of the whole enterprise a pass in a way audiences might not at other times of the year. And, you know what? That would both be pretty accurate and something that Love Actually for the most part does manage to pull off.The film's ensemble is impressively starry (all the more so in hindsight, given stories such as that involving Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln and Chiwetel Ejiofor were made before those actors hit major mainstream blockbuster success), which is good because the very slight narratives in which many of them are placed rely heavily on the actors' charm and established screen personas to sell them.Top thesps Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are given the only storyline requiring any meaty acting in a tale of
emotional infidelity and a poignant use of Joni Mitchell's downbeat Christmas folk classic River. Curtis's Four Weddings star Hugh Grant is on autopilot in the formulaic but relatively effective story of a Blair-esque prime minister whose romance with the girl who brings his tea inspires him to give a darn good telling off to the US president (Billy Bob Thornton, playing the part as an unholy melange of Clinton and the younger Bush). Meanwhile, Colin Firth, so perfectly cast as the repressed but romantic love interest in the Curtis-penned Bridget Jones, is stuck in a plot where he doesn't share a single conversation with his Portuguese maid before proposing marriage, something the movie does not successfully sell as romantic. (And, hey, don't a lot of these stories involve older men and younger female subordinates? Weird, huh?)Laura Linney has a storyline that's potentially emotionally complex, with no easy answers, so the film just kind of forgets about it in the third act and doesn't give it any answers at all. The film is, to be honest, actually better at the kind of one-joke storylines where it really can provide an answer in a couple of scenes. Kris Marshall's plot basically has him declare that he could score with women in America in a way he can't in Britain because they'd find his accent sexy (no doubt primed to do so by years of Richard Curtis romcoms!) And then he just does. It's just one scene of setup and one of pay-off, complete with cameos from hot-in-the-2000s American starlets Elisha Cuthbert and Denise Richards. It's a simplistic gag, but at least it manages to work as intended and quickly.When it comes right down to it, though, the best thread turns out all along to have been Billy Mack and his novelty single. Nighy is full of leathery old rock star charm in an utterly winning performance. And it's not hard to buy that, in a country that has more than once propelled a sausage roll-themed novelty cover version to the top of the festive charts on sentiment and underdog spirit alone, the dreadful Christmas is All Around really could steal the coveted Christmas Number 1 slot. In a film whose love stories are mostly romantic, it's the more platonic one between Mack and Gregor Fisher as his long-suffering manager that really lands.And, just like rooting for Christmas is All Around to make it to Number 1, real world audiences will probably forgive a lot of the crassly manipulative material in Love Actually because of the charm of the performers and the fact that, hey, it's Christmas and if ever there's a time for sentimentality it's now.At the end of the day the film's biggest sin is not in itself but in inspiring a whole genre of holiday-themed multi-stranded romantic ensemble pieces, from Valentine's Day to New Year's Eve, all of them uniformly terrible (unlike the hit and miss Love Actually).",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Fell through the cracks,"9.0 stars.Oh boy, I'm on a roll this year. All I did was start searching every movie that exists on any platform that I am currently subscribed, and behold, the audacious 'Love Actually' is available. I recall some years back a good friend of mine said this was his favorite film of all time, at least his favorite romance movie, whether serious drama romance or rom com, it is undisputedly his all time #1. I said ""fine, I guess I'll see it, I loved 'Notting Hill', why not?"" And so I started to watch 'Love Actually' sometime in 2018. I was not impressed...mind you I only got 20 minutes into it, and for some reason I was really not in the mood. I remember that day, thinking my friend's tastes were so far in left field...I would keep silent and hope he never brought up the subject again. He never did. I now ponder what ailment I was suffering in 2018 when this movie left me immensely disappointed (I'm a hopeless romantic, we share that quality). I rationalized that I hadn't missed out anyways, this was an awful excuse for a film (full of pretentious British actors).In retrospect I simply direct a vital question to my bygone self: what was wrong with you good sir?

uneven,"Incredibly uneven movie! I really like good romantic comedies. Four Weddings was brilliant, but Curtis seems to need a kill -your-darlings assistant badly these days. About the characters and the stories, I have these comments: It's nice that there is love between races, social classes and nationalities in this film but why 1. are almost all the women servants or assistants and almost all of the men more powerful (bosses, prime ministers, authors etc)? Women serve lots of coffee in this film! And the more ambition they tend to show (sexual or work-wise), the more villainous they seem. Rickman's secretary is the obvious case. Very old-fashioned view of the sexes. 2. Why are there no gay couples? Curtis has used minority groups (also disabled people) in romantic situations before in his films, and to their advantage, so it's a pity he didn't this time when there are so many couples present. 3. Speaking of that, why so many couples? Four would have been sufficient. We don't get to know any of them well enough as it is. About the principal roles: Billy Mack - fun character who interpunctuates the film, and it's nice that Curtis dares satirize himself with the song chosen. Sarah - Laura Linney is a great actress and very touching, but this is a situation that obviously needed more screen time. Harry and Karen - Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are great actors, but Thompson is so good she belongs in another film. Her outburst ""you have made my life ridiculous"" rings so true and is so painful it's weird to see it followed by a lot of haphazard happy conclusions. I want another movie, just about Karen and her world. Hugh Grant's part is fun as usual, he is turning into a modern Cary Grant in the sense that he does one thing to perfection and if you like that he will always deliver. If you don't, it's best to stay away. His love story is sweet, not very credible at all but OK in a romantic comedy sort of way.Liam Neeson is good as always as the widower but the boy who plays his son has stuffy lines and delivers them like an American TV sitcom kid - you know, robot actor kid style with ""timing"". The situation about him learning to play the drums to impress a girl is credible but he is not. Colin Firth's writer falling in love with the Portugese cleaning girl is not a very developed character, so Curtis depends entirely on the fact that Firth, like Grant, works so well in romantic scenes. The scene where he meets her family and is offered the supposedly fat and homely daughter is insulting to her and to the Portugese. ""The rest of Europe"" is here seen as ""charmingly"" old-fashioned (which oddly enough the film itself is, most irritably). Keira Knightley's character has never realized that her husband's best friend (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with her. I can believe that as she is not perceptive at all about other people in the film, just full of herself, what she wants and how she looks. That story goes to prove that displeasant people can also make others fall madly in love, depressing but at least credible. Lincoln is sweet in the part, he makes the segment work although you root for him to quickly find a worthier object of his affections. Rowan Atkinson and Billy Bob Thornton are good but a bit under-used, but in this film, who isn't. The story about the British guy getting hot US girls is below anyone's dignity. What the ??? was that all about? The story of the porn actors behaving like blushing teenagers even during faked sex is totally strange and forced. Why wold these obviously painfully shy and easily embarrassed people have picked that sort of job at all?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

God only knows what I'd be without you.,"London, England, and it's the run up to Christmas, and we are in the company of a number of couples dealing with the joys and problems that love can bring.We open with a narration from Hugh Grant who tells us that when he is troubled by the hate in the world, he thinks of the arrivals area of Heathrow airport. A place where loved ones greet returning loved ones, a place that indeed showcases a strand of love in its joyous form. He further ventures that when the aeroplanes hit the twin towers on 9/11, as far as he knows, all those phone calls from those sadly involved were messages of love, not hate. Pertinent musings that although somewhat sombre for an opening, sets it up nicely for what Richard Curtis (writer and director) wants to say.A roll call of fine British and Irish actors, and American Laura Linney, lend their considerable talents to Curtis' ensemble piece. The structure is surprisingly simple considering the number of stories being woven together, the result being that there is sure to be a story in there to either love, or, yes, even hate. Is it sentimental? Of course. Is it as stuffed as a turkey on Xmas day? Naturally. Does it stretch credibility in some strands? For sure. But only the coldest of hearts could truly decry that Love Actually is all around. Very often it's funny too. Curtis, following on from writing credits such as Four Weddings And A Funeral, continues to show himself to be a very fine writer of comedy. None more so than with Bill Nighy's past his sell by date pop star, Billy Mack. There's something for everyone in here, indeed there's likely to be something that many can associate with.It's a lovely affecting film that should hopefully perk up those that get blue around the holiday season. With perceptive writing, some excellent acting (Nighy, Emma Thomson, Colin Firth et al) and a soundtrack of some worth, Love Actually is a winner. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Tremendously Pleasant And Enjoyable Movie About Love,"There really aren't a lot of movies about love. There are a lot of romances, but the focus is always on the star-crossed lovers. There are star-crossed lovers in this, but the focus here is less on the characters than it is simply on the power of love as it sometimes appears in unexpected places, and as it sometimes rekindles itself after lying dormant. Sometimes we're recovering from love, sometimes love is from afar and unrequited; sometimes it's just a true and sincere friendship. But it's there. As Hugh Grant says in the opening narration: ""love, actually, is all around us.""I have to confess that I'm generally not a fan of these movies that feature separate story lines that eventually intertwine. I like my movies to have a little more focus, and these movies often seem blurry instead, as you wait (often impatiently) for what you know is the inevitable moment when the various stories will intersect, and everything will be revealed. This movie, however, I enjoyed. There were, in fact, several story lines: an old rocker trying to make a comeback; a recent widower dealing with grief and his young stepson who's head over heels for a classmate; the newly elected and single British Prime Minister who's smitten with a member of the household staff; two porn actors who fall for each other on the set; a recent divorcée who falls for his maid with whom he can't even communicate with because she speaks Portuguese; a newly married couple - and the man who secretly adores the new bride; an older man being pursued by a co-worker who wonders whether to pursue her or stick with his marriage. There might have been others. Usually I would say that's way too much to include, but somehow it all worked here; the stories blended together well and complemented each other. It's a very diverse group of people, all connected by being essentially from the same town. No one relationship really dominated in the story, although the three that really stood out for me were Hugh Grant's role as the Prime Minister (the slightly confused by love character being perfect for him), Liam Neeson as the recent widower dealing with grief and helping his stepson with love and Bill Nighy as rocker Billy Mack, who adds the most comedy to the movie as he releases a Christmas album that he knows is terrible - which he tells everyone, much to the chagrin of his manager. Other lovers in this included Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney and Alan Rickman. There are also small (and non- romantic) parts for Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson.The characters are basically all likable and pleasant, and you really find yourself hoping that love works out for all of them. It's not really a tug at your heartstrings type of movie, and while it's about love it's not what I would call a ""chick flick"" - there are too many situations faced by the respective male characters that I could relate to for it to be that. I suppose it's a bit too sappy at times, but that's in keeping with the subject matter. It's a pleasant movie - and at times it's very funny as we watch the various relationships work themselves out.

"Uncontrollable rage, if you must.","I've always known I'm out of step with most of the people I meet, but can I be the only person who not only detests this film with an intensity bordering on the psychotic, but who finds it utterly offensive, on every level, from first frame to last? Never have I experienced such strong emotions about a film, and it leaves me almost speechless with anger just to hear its title. To hear someone actually praise the thing causes me to weep with frustration and I often have to bite my tongue to prevent myself from delivering a tirade of erudite criticism to complete strangers. Why should this be? Could it be the well documented, revolting (and believe it or not, largely unnoticed, among UK cinema goers I have asked at least!)reference to 9/11? The illogical behaviour of characters for the sake of a cheap laugh? The gratuitous use of pornography, in a stomach-churningly smug 'hey, porn is just harmless fun' middle class liberal unthinking kind of a way? The casual anti-Americanism, the embarrassing dialogue given to 'salt of the earth' working class stereotypes, the utter, utter complete nonsense of the plot in every single one of the 'stories'? Don't get me started. I thought Notting Hill was bad enough, with its brave cripple and her eternally patient husband. Here we had Emma Thomson looking balefully noble as she endured not only her husband's infidelity, but the sound of Joni Mitchell cruelly betraying one of her own children.

There is no visible conclusion to the scenario with Rickman's character's marriage and with all the talk about deleted scenes I hope there was some sort of close, but I would rather have my eyeballs sucked out than sit through any of the 80 minutes of director's cut.When it comes to the anti-American stuff  who cares? We're portrayed as a country of lust filled vixens and an over sexed president, that's not so bad, but I would hope to think someone as nasty as Billy Bob never gets elected.For the reviewer who wrote 'For romantics only'  get over it. If you think this is romantic then you probably still live with your parents and attend junior high. Yes, we go to the movies for the escape, but not for lobotomies.

Was it really necessary to have yet another 'I just want to thumb my nose in the face of the US' segment? Thanks so much Richard Curtis for your brief and all too transparent 'I've-got-the-power-to-show-how-big-a-bully-that-rotten- stinking-America-is' moment...it really served no purpose in the movie at all...except, perhaps, to make you feel better. It wasn't the attempt at expressing politics that I found annoying...just how childishly it was thrown out there; that, and the fact that you used Billy Bob Thornton to represent the Chief Executive...could you have picked a smarmier persona? The whole bit seemed mean and unnecessary.Oh, but wait: then there were the stereotypes of the American women being bubble headed nymphets that live this side of porno land, and the whole story surrounding the weight of the adorable Natalie, who didn't look fat at all. Now, unless there was some sort of subtlety I missed in that storyline, I thought it was tiresome to hear everyone talk about how heavy she was...none of that made any sense to me as she looked fine...sure she was shapely, but fat? Whaaaaaa? Those were pesky smudges on an otherwise perfect little movie.I know that sounds like a great deal of negative about the film, but in all honesty it was a fine piece of entertainment...thankfully, I now have the ability to fast forward through the parts that most irritate me, which truthfully, aren't many.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nice,"After watching love actually I have to say it was great. The characters all had their own individual struggles or love interests and it came together beautifully in the end. I would rank this among the best romantic comedies I have watched. The one deleted scene in which the young boy and his father listen to the song Joanna and the boy has the love movies on his wall would have been a good addition to the movie and should not have been deleted in my opinion. This scene not only showed the relationship between the father and son, it also showed the boys love interest and the mutual love for the mom. This movie showed that love can cross the barriers of language and regardless of the circumstances true love can find a way. There were many different stories which allowed the viewer to feel anger, happiness, joy, sadness, etc. Certain characters incorporated comedy into the movie which was a nice touch but the movie is not only about love in a relationship sense. Love is also shown between families and friends. Certain characters are very loyal to the ones they love, while others betray the trust of those which they love. This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies and portrays the importance of love in our world as well as what relationships are most important.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The perfect date movie,"I've had numerous surprises this year as far as how good a film is, but they've all been a bad surprise. Movies like Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, Underworld, and Jeepers Creepers 2 and some others that I can't think of off the top of my head have all been movies that I expected to be good, but they all turned out to be pieces of crap. Now, there's finally a good surprise. I came into this movie thinking it was just going to be another chick flick that I would deeply regret seeing, but it wasn't, it was surprisingly good! Usually though, I know exactly why I like or hate a film, but I can't seem to describe what I like about it. There's way too much going on with all the characters for me to give a damn about any character, but I did. I really understood them. There's one couple in Love Actually where we're not even sure if they're going to be together at all. So why was it good? I guess it was good because it made you feel good about yourself (as cheesy as it sounds). Who cares about any of the damn characters?! The movie as a whole puts a smile on your face. If you hate romance no matter what form it's in or how it's told, the movie does offer some funny moments. One of the funniest characters is an old rockstar who would probably be the last person you want to sing any Christmas song at all and there's a little kid in there that definitely takes some of the grown-up feel out of the movie (to me, that's a good thing).

Favourite Christmas Movie Ever,"The best Christmas movie ever for me. I watch it every single year during the holiday season without fail. Doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. Just a really good feel good movie to lift up your spirits! I see it as the original movie to try and intertwine multiple multiple stories- an increasingly popular idea today, and it does it so well. Reinforcing the 'it's a small world' ideal. It really restores my faith in both humanity and the true meaning of Christmas. Such fabulous use of an abundance of awesome actors.

"Unique , Good Parts, Perhaps a Bit Overly Scattered","Another movie that is well situated for the Christmas time. The theme of the movie it spells out in the first two minutes of the film where despite all that is wrong in the world there are always moments of love mixed in with them.The strongest and weakest aspects of the film are almost one and that. What's excellent about the movie is that it shows that love is not some uniform process or feeling but can be expressed in felt in many ways. A very strong message because the usual theme is of 2 people coming together in a very sort of set way of going on dates which eventually leads to more. This movie in order to illustrate that has the viewer follow endless tales of love all expressed and grown through different channels. It shows childly love, love lost, love hidden, love across language, love with missed opportunity, loves ups and downs, love missed, messy love, sensual love , loves ups and downs, family love (there might be more but this is all I can remember for now).While it is neat to see how different it can be expressed, with having so many back stories it can be hard to get really invested in any one set of scenes as they bounce around. Naturally some characters are much less interesting and you are caught waiting to get back to the ones you actually want to see.Overall the ending ties quite well together that puts it on the Christmas good list for this movie reviewer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sexist nonsense actually,"I have never felt it necessary to write a review before. However I feel compelled to do so having watched this film last night. My wife and I looked on utterly flabbergasted as sexist stereotypes and 'awkward English' clichés spewed forth before our eyes. It's the sort of film I will be actively encouraging everyone I ever meet for the rest of my life to never watch, even for 'a bit of fun' - it really is that bad. Why? Several reasons, not least of which is the despicable misrepresentation of women throughout the film. For some reason all women are in a subservient role, for example secretaries, cleaners, housewives etc. while all men are powerful: writers, creative directors, photographers, Prime Ministers(!) etc. We witness many men lustfully pursuing women and manipulating them to their own end. Lessons to be learned here are for example that being a man and not being able to form a relationship in your own country is not a problem because you can go to another and women will throw themselves at you; a dad advises his son to take up drums because Ringo Starr has a beautiful girlfriend he's a drummer in a band; also, we are to look out for attractive 'femme-fatale' secretaries who will try to lead us astray from our middle- class English family unit. This movie is not a 'bit of fun' - it is a dangerous mix of off-the-shelf, ill-considered, misogynist fantasy which confuses love with sex, all from a disturbingly predatory male- centric viewpoint. When I give it 1 star, I mean it - it is utterly awful. Free-thinkers - avoid this movie and encourage others to follow.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A must see,"Movie was an emotional rollercoaster.  Each story was well played, and like in life, not all had ""happy"" endings.  I had no problem following the stories and unlike most people, I seem to have understood the manner in which the Rickman/Thompson relationship moved on - they stayed together, but ""life was a little worse.""  If anything, they stayed together because they loved their children, nothing more.Yeah, I think it could have done without the pair of porn movie stand-ins. And while I thought the guy going to Wisconsin (yeah!) to find women was humorous, the movie could have done fine without it.While I don't expect everyone to be as enamored with the movie as me, I simply cannot comprehend the loathsome responses I've read here.

Love ...?,"I have to say that I did not like this movie ... the first time I saw it. I found the plot lackluster and and too simplistic, while at the same time too chaotic. If you have seen this movie one time and agree with me, I suggest you see it again. The second time I saw the movie I'm afraid I have to admit it was for Keira Knightly. The girl's a good actress and has a sweet, yet subtle, smile, and her eyes portray a good amount. One should watch for such things in her movies. So I began the movie again, anticipating seeing the same things I saw the first time. To my utter delight, the movie changed. Like I said, the first time I saw it I thought it was too simplistic, and I realized upon a second look my detrimental and arrogant opinion was wrong:This movie is for those who want to look a bit deeper to find meaning in a movie. If you're just looking for a good love story without substance, you'll have to continue looking, but for those of you who want to look deeper inside yourself to find your own definition of love, this one's for you. I believe that everyone who sees this film will walk away from it with a totally different opinion than all the others that have seen it. It's a movie to relate to, a movie to relate to in such a way that it can only be seen in a personal way. The concept is hard to grasp, unless of course your concept of love is easy to come to.Although each person will walk away with a different idea of what this movie is about, I shall nonetheless offer you what my opinion was. Love is not a simple thing to uncover. It's not something that will just happen and it's not something that, once found, will continually stay the same. The movie strings facts together, and since everyone has some concept of what love is we give that value to what each character feels. Love is something that everyone understands, but no one can explain, more so than any other emotion. This movie demonstrates that.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Light entertainment at its best,Love Actually is such great light entertainment. If you feel like a bit of a light night out it is the perfect film.

Tries a Bit Too Hard to Be Quirky,"Overall this movie works, though there is much about it that is awkward. It helps greatly that the director, Richard Curtis, keeps his movie self-aware and old fashioned on purpose--when it becomes just too cute and quirky to tolerate, it at least has the decency to know it.As happens all too frequently with these episodic ensemble films, there are some story lines that are simply more interesting than others, so the movie feels unbalanced. On a second viewing, it was much more difficult to have patience with the English-lad-in-Wisconsin sequences, or those involving the adult movie stand-ins -- which could have been left on the cutting room floor -- when there were such rich and affecting moments delivered by, for example, Emma Thompson, when she realizes the necklace her husband bought and wrapped as a Christmas present isn't for her, or by Laura Linney, in a brief scene of her visiting her mentally ill brother for the holiday. Bill Nighy, as an aging musician fed up with just about everything, is also a standout, and gets many of the movie's choicest and funniest lines.I very much liked this movie when I saw it in the theatre, but liked it somewhat less when I watched it again after it came out on DVD. I suspect it may be one of those movies that doesn't in the end hold up very well, though it's harmless enough. And it's got a great soundtrack.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"How reassuring that love IS actually all around us -- unabashedly optimistic ""Love Actually"" is.","British writer Richard Curtis' directorial debut of his own script ""Love Actually"" is an ambitious endeavour -- a big heart packaged to encompass the world. It could very well be as grand a scale as ""The Last Samurai"" with cast of extras just as plenty (imagine the airport scenes) besides managing nine concurrent stories about love. He pulled it off successfully with a stellar casting by Mary Selway and Fiona Weir. Bill Nighy's Billy Mack rock singer story is used as the staple timeline the other stories revolve -- it's countdown with 5 weeks to Christmas. Here, Hugh Grant's Prime Minister role is not exactly the main one, each of the other stories share its sum of on-screen time. Some of the characters do cross each other's path. For example: Emma Thompson's Karen is sister to Grant's PM, her husband (Alan Rickman) Harry's secretary Mia turns out to be neighbor of Natalie's (Martine McCutcheon).The story of Liam Neeson's Daniel and his 11 year old stepson Sam is a hit. Thomas Sangster played Sam (his sixth acting endeavour and first feature in 2 years) certainly tugs at our hearts by his innocent love pursuit. You'll find satisfactory rationale to all this in Curtis' genuinely thoughtful dialogue. He's never flippant about any aspect of the subject at hand. Not even when he showed us John and Just Judy -- just the right restrained dosage of comedic pairing of Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as stand-in actors on set. There's the 'triangle' of Keira Knightly (shines in both ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") as Juliet, Chiwetel Ejiofor (the intriguing Nigerian doctor in Stephen Frears ""Dirty Pretty Things"") briefly as Peter her newly wedded husband, and Andrew Lincoln as Peter's best man Mark secretly, hopelessly in love with Juliet.Life is not all roses, and Curtis is not coy about uncomfortable aspects of love. Karen's (Thompson) suspicion about Harry, the sentiment though sad is eased by the chosen song played at the time. Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now"" rings true.  Harry's employee Sarah (Laura Linney from U.S.), her crush on colleague Mark (Rodrigo Santoro) is like a painful fairytale, time may generate hope. Kris Marshall's Colin is certainly the most happy go lucky one: 'coming to America,' meeting dream girls like Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth and returning home with him -- such satisfied faces at the airport.I'm most akin to the story of Colin Firth's writer Jamie and his Portuguese-speaking only housekeeper Aurelia played by Lúcia Moniz. I like it already when Firth sat down at his writing hide-out in the French suburb and said, ""Alone Again, Naturally"" -- the title of a popular 1970 song by Gilbert O'Sullivan. The comic yet tender language barrier scenes with subtitles remind me of the Russian/Finnish film ""The Cuckoo"" (Kukushka). There are dashes of references to other movies or songs, e.g., Grant doing a 'Tom Cruise Risky Business' singing pose as he starts a gig of a song; Daniel and Sam watching 'Kate & Leo in Titanic' for motivation.To w-d Curtis' credit, following the 9 stories was not at all confusing. I saw the movie on its opening weekend and the packed audience thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hrs. 15 mins. of laughter and tears. The story scenes intercut each other in an assured pace, like movements of a symphony -- overture, interlude, yes, the finale is well-crafted to the cadence of love IS actually all around -- visual camera at play.   If you're interested in behind the scenes, visit the official Web site of ""Love Actually"" -- there are generous production notes including excerpt dialogues and how each story came to be.

The Definition of Pap,"This movie represents everything I despise about modern film, and many things I despise about the modern world. What the creators would have us believe is that ""love actually"" is a series of short, shallow vignettes that reveal how hopelessly obsessed with sex and vulgarity we as a culture have become. ""All you need is love,"" the closing refrain begins, and I heartily agree. Try finding it in this film, and you'll be miserably disappointed to the degree you'll begin to question whether or not true love, the love of Shakespearean sonnets and classic tragedies, even exists at all.So bleak is this film's representation of human existence that at times I wondered whether or not the film was made as an intentional, existential mockery of our lives. Alas, I don't think it was.

"Subtle and funny, but no cigar...","A patchwork of narratives about the love that is found in every corner of the world is, indeed, a beautiful plot. Thus, the outset of this movie is simple but meaningful, and the result is for the better part fine, humorous, and even touching at times.A few of the stories are devised in an exceptionally ingenious manner. One example: The whole movie is set in Britain, where an ordinary young man babbles away about going to the States, because there, he claims, he'll find girls who are willing to sleep with him. His friend is very skeptical about the likelihood of success in this project. The young man buys a ticket anyway, and the outcome of that trip is skillfully staged, though it should not be revealed here.There are a few major flaws in the movie too: (1) You just don't choose Hugh Grant for the role as PM of Great Britain - unless, of course, your POINT is to avoid credible characters; (2) The fine understanding of everyday situations is generally ruined towards the end of the movie, when all the subtle portraits of everyday 'love situations' is hastily merged into a paradisiac mass hysteria.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A brilliant film with a brilliant ensemble cast,"Love Actually is an amazing romantic-comedy about all of the different aspects of love. It engages with unrequited love, lost love, parental love and family love. It does this through a number of different narratives and characters, which all, for the most part, work very well off each other. Mostly, none of these narratives are under or over- represented. This is partly due to the great ensemble cast consisting of Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightly and Rowan Actkinson amongst many others.

The Best (and Frustrating)Romantic Comedy I've Seen In Years,"When I think back on the genres that consistently let me down romantic comedies and teen flicks are at the top of the list.  Why do I still go and see them? That's easy, one cinematic gem out of 50 flops is why I, you're humble (or egomaniacal, you pick) reviewer, likes movies in the first place. I love to wallow in the muck until I find the small treasures of cinema.  I love movies that transform their genre. Films that are above average in quality and that are not at all conventional.  Movies like that make me joyful again.That is the spirit in which I can approach a film like Richard Curtis's LOVE ACTUALLY.  It is so close to being my favorite romantic comedy I almost wished that my own stupid sense of right and wrong didn't mess it up for me. This is a movie that's so good that it's flaws are doubly illuminated.Love is everywhere or at least that's the premise that Hugh Grant's (About a Boy) opening narration claims.  Then the movie goes on to prove just that. We watch as 10 or 15 delightful and charming people fall in love.  And in the end each of these people is also connected either directly or indirectly to the other characters in the movie and so in the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a small microcosm of British society.The film has charming written all over it.  Hugh Grant again plays that charming and debonair lady-killer he's gotten so good at playing.  Colin Firth (Bridget Jones's Dairy) plays this charming writer who falls for his maid, who doesn't speak English.  Emma Thompson (Junior) plays a mother and wife trying to come to grips with a tragedy in her own mind.  Liam Neeson (Schindler's List) play a widower who's young son has fallen `desperately' in love.  And While all this is going on, Alan Rickman (Dogma) and Laura Linney falls people in their office and Keira Knightly (Bend It Like Beckham) marries the man of her dreams, only to discover a little secret about his best friend.  As you can see a lot is going on here.  I can best be described as if you took a hundred romantic comedies and jammed them together.  Kind of a silly and romantic version of Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS.Thankfully most of the major characters are fun, charming, and bring their own little piece of life to the film.  There is scene after scene of inventive fun.  I also liked how the film was full of silly cameo's that didn't destroy the overall structure.  Sure I saw Billy Bob Thorton, but the film didn't try to jam him down my throat.  I found my self momentarily going there's Billy Bob, but he embodies his character (The US President, think George W. Bush with Clinton's Libido), he's not playing Billy Bob.The most interesting story arc follows Grant and his secretary (Martine McCutcheon, TV's Eastenders).  It's pitch perfect.  Every scene of him and McCutcheon made me smile.  I wanted to the see the outcome. I truly wanted these two people to fall in love.  It's hard for me to want to think that about characters in a more vapid rom-com.It's scenes and characters like Grant and McCutcheon that make the weaker moments of the film fail miserably.  Most notably the stupid segments involving the stand-in's on the porno movie set and the dumb scenes involving the annoying British boy who goes to Wisconsin.  I wanted to watch characters that were involving.  These two story arcs were built on cartoon premises.  They're both weaker, like two bad jokes in an utterly flawless comedy routine.  They were both to silly, and did not have enough development to warrant their inclusion in this film.The film also suffers from an overload of characters.  With so many interesting people to follow, it was difficult to dwell on one set of characters.  In the end you wind up getting the Cliff's Notes view of all these people. This hurts the Laura Linney (Maze) story most notably, because Curtis's screenplay tries to introduce dramatic scenes that are barely touched upon.  This makes at least one heart-wrenching scene in a mental hospital feel a little out of place.  Like it was tacked on cause every comedy needs a dramatic moment.I also hated that the screenplay glossed over much of the Rickman's characters humanity.  Leaving the final outcome of his story arc vague, cause god forbid we leave the movie hating one of the main characters.  If you're going to waste time creating tension only to keep us in the dark in the end don't waste my time.In the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a wholly frustrating and equally a great film. It's chock full of funny characters, silly romance, tragic stories, and in the end it delivers a movie that is mostly worth watching.I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Bill Nighy's (Underworld) wonderfully silly Billy Mack, a character that is really funny if a tad bit unnecessary. He plays an aging rock musician who's re-written one of his classic tunes into a Christmas song.  Sure he's sold out, but he sure won't promote it as if he did.  If Oscar has a funny bone, this performance is worth a supporting actor nomination.Listen if you can shut out the flaws, LOVE ACTUALLY will leave you satisfied.  If you're like me, then you like the movie with maybe a few too many reservations.  LOVE ACUTALLY is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a long time, and one of the best (if frustrating) movies of the year.****1/2 (out of 5)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Charming ""Love Actually""","This is the definitive romance film and its not just about one couple but about twelve! This film runs about 2 hours and 10 minutes and it crams a lot of characters and events into that span of time. Emma Thompson is Karen and she is married to Harry (Alan Rickman) and things seem to be fine but she notices the obvious flirting between him and his secretary. Things get worse when she finds out that he bought an expensive piece of jewelry for her. Liam Neeson plays a recently widowed man named Daniel and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) is in love with an American girl at school and together they try and figure out how he can get her to notice him. Hugh Grant is The Prime Minister and on his first day in office he meets Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) who works for him and he is attracted to her. We watch an aging rock star named Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) who has put out a bad Christmas CD and he has come to realize that he has no one in his life after all these years. Harry works with Sarah (Laura Linney) who is in love with  Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) but is too shy to tell him. Colin Firth is a writer named Jamie and he falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) but there is a language barrier keeping them from communicating they're feelings. A young bride named Juliet (Keira Knightley) finds out that her husbands best friend has been secretly in love with her since the beginning and she is stunned. A young man named Colin (Kris Marshall) can't find a girl and thinks that its because they're British so he decides to travel to Wisconsin where he can find an American girl.This film is directed by Richard Curtis who is the great writer of such films as ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" as well as ""Notting Hill"". Romantic stories are his forte and he possesses a real knack for creating romantic scenarios for characters. This is the first time Curtis has directed a film and he manages to juggle a plethora of events and characters and he does pull it off for the most part. Some of the stories work better than others like the Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman crisis and Bill Nighy practically steals the film as an aging rock star. Hugh Grant also fairs pretty well as The Prime Minister in love and he seems to be cut out of the same mold as Cary Grant. Others don't come off very well and I think Kris Marshall as Colin going to Wisconsin is totally ridiculous and contrived. Nothing seems to come of Linney and her infatuation with a co-worker. It was never resolved and just seems to fade away without any closure. But this is a genuinely charming film and has so many romantic moments in them that I'm sure any viewer can find one or two that work best for them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fluffy and good-hearted,"A calculatedly cutesy affair from across the pond, Love Actually benefits greatly from this impressive ensemble cast featuring some of England's most popular brand names. A first length feature directorial debut from the extremely popular British writer Richard Curtis finds ease in delivering heartfelt and accessible warmth in spades throughout the two + hours of multiple character acts, though fails to tie all these inter-connected and pleasant enough relationship threads into a more emotionally cohesive whole.Feeling wildly uneven at times, Curtis lets a few of his characters breathe, while restricting others as mere wallpaper. All in all though Love Actually remains the lighthearted romantic holiday epic that it sets out to be by appeasing as many sappy-hearted Brits and Americans as possible and by cutting out the middleman known as subtlety.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Original and charming film with good songs...,"To begin with, I have to confess that I found the movie a little bit strange the very first time I watched it. Too many characters, too many stories, too many relationships to follow... and then, I watched the movie for second time and I can appreciate the details, enjoy the songs, the performances, the interesting mixture of happiness, sadness and comedy... I like some stories more than others... maybe the goal is too ambitious, the theme too extensive and difficult to determine. However, the result, the film, is quite nice and the rhythm appropriate.It's not the best movie that I have seen, but, you know, it is extremely difficult to not be moving by this beautiful picture, a faithful reflection of the society in which we live in.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Blue-Print,"There are some romantic comedies that could be used as a blueprint. Or maybe some directors should just watch them, before they bring out their bog standard version of ""man loves woman"" and vice versa. This episodic tale of ... well ""Love actually"", has great actors in it (Bill Nighy, Keira Nightly and so forth), that make the most of even small stories and screen time.While this set around Christmas time, this is also a hint, that you shouldn't take the movie too seriously. The romantic factor in the stories works and every kind of love gets a stab at. It is a feel-good movie, a movie that speaks to the heart and actually achieves to send this message (again, too many shallow rom-coms, not here/this one though!)! I'm cynical too, but sometimes it's nice to have movie, that shows you what different meanings love can have and how love is perceived by different individuals!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Hit-and-miss, but the last 30 minutes are PERFECT (***)","Richard Curtis, the guy who wrote the screenplays for several classic British comedies (""Four Weddings And A Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Bridget Jones's Diary"") wrote and also directed ""Love Actually"", and with it, has set out to make the Ultimate Romantic Comedy. It even says so on the poster.It's over 2 hours long, it's crammed with several different storylines, well over a dozen main characters (most of whom know each other in some way), and has numerous subplots, some of which add depth and others that take it away. Yes, it definitely wants to be the ""Magnolia"" of romantic comedies. And...it doesn't really succeed. But it's a valiant effort.Although I do have to say that it certainly does LOOK like the Ultimate Romantic Comedy. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.I'm not even going to try to summarize all those storylines, so I'll just say that it has an all-star cast including Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley and many others.Some of the storylines are very enjoyable, but others could have been cut completely and wouldn't have been missed. And it's that kind of constant teetering, between the interesting stories and the not-so-interesting stories that makes this ambitious film fall far, far short of being the ""Ultimate Romantic Comedy"". Not to mention the many dry spots and flat jokes.That said, the last half hour or so of ""Love Actually"" is about as perfect as a movie of this kind can get. All the stories are drawn together and concluded in a way that is very moving and satisfying. And I fell for it, what can I say? Sometimes, you just gotta surrender to the warm-fuzzies.It's nothing too special, and it certainly doesn't compare to some other recent British comedies, like ""About A Boy"" or ""Bend It Like Beckham"", but it's pretty enjoyable, has wonderful cinematography, a good soundtrack, and some nice Christmas spirit. So there ya go. It's more or less worth it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The best the best the best,This is a much watch every Christmas for me and is by far my favourite Christmas movie. Brilliant cast and brilliantly written. Great film with so many great stories in one film.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Too much love... but still works,"Score:- 7/10Well I'm not actually a romantic movie lover but I watched this one. Main cause :- Laura Linney was in it. I must say I got more than I bargained for, Linney had very brief part but what I got is 7-8 parallel good stories with a less short of convincing acting by a few. The movie starts off with a common but effective and forgotten adage that despite of all the killing, hate, anguish there is still love somewhere. Maybe I sound too much of an optimistic but lately I have been watching or re-watching a lot of crime movies so this movie was a real satisfaction.Bottom-line if it is Christmas an if you have a true heart you will get what you want (or mostly you do). But this stupid quixotic idea was quite beautifully screen-played and it makes you believe for a few moments that you live in a perfect world (at least it made me almost believe for a moment).One main thing  you will see a lot of familiar faces around here. Severus Snape(forgot his real name, but his accent is awesome), Laura Linney, Kiera Knightly, Jedi Master QuiGon or Raaz A Gul(whatever you prefer) and of course Denise Richard and Hugh Grant(not convincing though as prime minister of England).These 6-7 parallel stories are merely related and while watching sometimes you forget who was with whom but again you don't have put strain to watch this movie. What actually amazes me most that how come a jerk got so many girls when he went to America. Jesus I always wanted to go to America but I think now I will go to London first, pick up a fake but charming accent and then go for girls in America. Christ that's so bullshit but it's Christmas who gives a damn, believe whatever you want to believe. But I never thought that prime minister of England will actually fall for a girl in that manner, that's really silly of the story writer but it's Christmas again.Overall LOVE ACTUALLY is a movie with poor acting performances braced and hushed by a good screenplay and directing with some help of Santa. If you are looking for a change and want to watch a movie just because you have nothing else to do I suggest you ACTUALLY watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A good movie that was badly named and marketed,"I only saw Love, Actually because it was shown on a commercial flight and I was bored. From the TV commercials I had seen for it when it was in theatres, I expected it to be a lightweight, goofy romance almost in a slapstick vein, all set at a sappy time of year (Christmas).Well, it is set at a sappy time of year, and milks it. But the various storylines involved (following different couples at various stages of relationships) were far more realistic, thoughtful and serious than I had expected.The movie should have been called ""Four Stories,"" or something that made it less slapstick and more a view of different aspects of relationships. True, some of the relationships were slapstick, but that had a place among the more serious tales. And the way various characters were connected was interesting.If you are a guy, this movie is better than you think it will be. I gave it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I don't like that sort of music so I found it detracting from the stories.If they had cut about 30 minutes from the film it would have been better. There is quite a bit of good stuff here but also a lot of junk. Overall, I gave it a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very Kitsch,"Please be indulgent with my English. My first comment here.First time I saw this movie, I was enthused. This idea to show the exit at the airport arrival and show the love behind all these people and at the end the same picture of people cuddling and kissing themselves is really moving: love is everywhere! A nice message! So I understood the enthusiastic reviews out here on IMDb.com quite well.But now I watched this film for a second time, it is part of my DVD collection, and I was really shocked. Some films win, watching them more times. Some lose. ""Love Actually"" is one of the biggest Hollywood crap and pretentious kitsch I have in my collection.Some reasons: the music is just terrible. It is like ketchup in every dish. The light is producing artificial studio atmosphere. To the figures of the film: Hugh Grant is charming, but always the same Hugh Grant in every film. This time as a English Prime Minister, and sorry, such a character with his mannerism in this position is only ridiculous. And these jokes about Natalie's (Martine McCutcheon) elephant thighs are very cheap and even not true. But the most terrible in this film is this sort of little adult in the body of a 13? years old boy. He is sitting there on papa's sofa, mother just died and he has nothing better to do, than to wine about a beautiful comrade in school, to whom he does not dare to declare his ""love"". He is speaking with the words of a Hollywood film scenarist, and father desperately wants to enter his children room, but does not venture it, because there is written with chalk ""keep out!"" on a slate. Is it like that, filmmakers are raising their children in Hollywood? Poor children! Poor America! And when the girlfriend - sixteen years old? - is singing in the school ""Christmas!""-celebration, imitating eroticism from show biz in television she grew up with, it is the summit of embarrassment in this film.OK, there are really good actors: first of all Emma Thompson. Great artist, great personality! I liked also the couple of writer and the housekeeper lady from Portugal. The English-Portuguese Dialogs are witty. Lúcia Moniz (playing Aurelia) would merit a carrier, but looking on IMDb.com she is not doing well. What a pity! Also the old Rocker was a great pleasure to watch. I love films in mosaic technique. My answer to this film would be the films of Cédric Klapisch, which use mostly this technique. Watch out for ""Paris"", 2008 and ""L'Auberge espagnole"", 2002. And one of my favorite films in this technique is from Danièle Thompson: ""Fauteuils d'orchestre"", 2007.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Impossible Movie,"The perfect movie is not a huge, earth-swaddling epic. It is a simple thing, a small story, one that fits in a 1 1/2 to 2-hour span. ""Casablanca"" is the greatest, a perfectly polished little gem, the story of two former lovers who bump into each other again in the shadow of World War II. ""The problems of two people doesn't matter a hill of beans..."" But they make amazing movies. More is not better in movies. More is simply more.In other words, to try to interweave more than a couple of stories together in one movie is idiotic.Let's see. There's the new Prime Minister who gets a crush on a cute girl who works in 10 Downing Street. There's his sister and her husband, a respectable middle-aged couple with fairly typical behavior- problem kids, and a wicked secretary waiting in the wings to try and destroy it all. There is the writer whose lover jilts him with his brother, who goes to Portugal to write his next novel and becomes enchanted with his housekeeper. There's the cute couple who meet on the job--their stand-ins for a porn movie. There's the man whose wife has died recently and left him with a stepson going through his first crush. There's the aging rock star with the intoxicated leer who is looking for lasting love. There's the lovely young woman with the mentally ill brother. How many is that so far? That's not all the stories.But not only do they work together in one movie, THEY WORK TOGETHER BRILLIANTLY!My standing joke is somebody has to have sold his/her soul to the devil. In this case, it's writer/director Richard Curtis, who also gave us ""Mr. Bean"", ""Notting Hill"", and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", to name a few.If I haven't convinced you, maybe this will: Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman (as the male porn movie stand-in!), Laura Linney, and (in a support role!)

Love Actually? More like Rubbish Actually!,"I'd heard a lot about this film before I saw it, and knowing it had some of the cast/producers from Notting Hill and Four Weddings, which were both very entertaining films along a similar theme, it bode well for this one, which is why I wanted to see it.I have to admit to massive disappointment, this film is not a patch on those first two films and I have to say, qualifies for the 'one of the worst films I've ever seen' category. Being the cynic I am, I can only assume this film was made purely with financial rewards in mind - trying to cash in on the success of previous successful films in the same genre.The film is a collection of stories centered around the them of love, none of which really work. It's meant to be a romantic comedy - I didn't see any of the humour I'm afraid. Hugh Grant who is usually good in these kinds of films just looked ridiculous as the prime minister parodying Tony Blair.My disappointment with this film was just made worse because I'd recently seen 'A Beautiful Mind' which is a superb movie in every way, and if you want a real love story - watch that instead - it's in a different league to this sappy, commercial rubbish.If you want to watch a good romantic comedy - watch 'When Harry Met Sally', 'Notting Hill, 'Jack and Sarah' or Four Weddings and a Funeral all of which are light years away from this film.Alan Rickman is about the only saving grace for this movie as he's a superb actor and for his performance it gets a point.Avoid this one - it's rubbish I'm afraid. 1/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Too ambitious for its own good, but the cast charms","Love Actually is a film that thinks that it is trying to defy conventions and other generic plot points to tell a poignant and comically rich storyline with memorable characters and various other elements that will make it a Christmas classic. That is a very audacious attempt for a romantic comedy. Regardless, director Richard Curtis is talented, but everything he touches doesn't turn to gold... or silver. The question is: can this film succeed? There are parts when it does and there are parts when it doesn't. It does not mean it does it poorly, but it dwells into the clichés of its genre. Curtis tries to be an overachiever and sets up too many story lines and characters thinking that they will eventually (and cleverly) cross over and meet up at the very end. Like I said, his strategy is very hit and miss. However there are parts where I felt he did things perfectly: the beginning and the ending. These were the parts where it was original, especially the last three minutes of the movie. In my opinion, that was probably one of the best endings Curtis could have thought of given the circumstances. The performances are even better. Richard Curtis has assembled the best character actors in England to make this film. There was really no performance I could complain about, it was done practically. The main payoff for me is that, at the end, Curtis prioritizes. He picks the stories that actually mean something to us and develops them to the best of his ability.

Is Love Actually all around Us?,"I heard a lot of good things about this movie and since I'm a sucker for holiday films I decided to check it out for myself. The story revolves around several love stories and the movie goes back and forth to show what's going on with each character. There is the Prime Minister(Hugh Grant) who slowly starts falling in  love with his pretty maid Natalie(Martine McCutcheon). A married father and husband(Alan Rickman) who has a thing for his younger secretary Mia(Heike Hakatsch). A young man Mark(Andrew Lincoln) who has always liked his best friend's wife Juliet(Keira Knightley) but has always been afraid to tell her how he really feels about her. A young boy Sam(Thomas Sangster) tries to win the heart of his classmate Joanna(Olivia Olson) with the help of his father(Liam Neeson). A young rather unattractive man(Kris Marshall) is sick of snobby British gals and decides to go to America to find the right girl for him. A lonely woman named Sarah(Laura Linney) who has always had a thing for her sexy coworker Karl(Rodrigo Santoro). An old drugged out rocker(Bill Nigghy) who realizes that his fat manager is the only real friend he has ever had. A man(Colin Firth) working on a novel in his cabin in the middle of nowhere falls in love with his foreign caretaker Aurelia(Lúcia Moniz). And last but not least, a couple who fall in love while shooting a porno. At first I thought of this movie to be overrated and I didn't see what all the fuss was about but I have learned to appreciate it. It is rather long and sometimes it feels like everything is just thrown and mushed together with no directions and it makes you wonder if it will ever come to an end. However, it is touching in it's own way and it's interesting to see how each love story turns out.

Great Rom-Com.,"Review:
'Love Actually' is a Christmas-romantic-comedy film directed by Richard Curtis.
This is another film that has been a long time coming, when it comes to my first viewing. When the film first started, I was a bit nervous because it seemed very clustered trying to introduce all the characters in the story, but by the end I was thoroughly entertained.
The plot follows seemingly unrelated people as their lives begin to intertwine while they fall in - and out - of love. Affections languish and develop as Christmas draws near.
Everybody in this movie does a brilliant job. Some were more utilized then others given the amount of story telling this movie has, but my two favorite performances came from Hugh Grant and Liam Neeson. It may be do to the fact that they are fairly type-cast in todays world and being able to see them out of their element before they were stuck in it.
I like movies where characters are all connected in some way and we slowly find out how throughout the film. I think this movie pulls it off nicely and stories don't stop making sense. I do find however; some stories get lost while others are the main focus. Not every story is told equally, and this makes it hard to care about some of the characters.
Overall, aside from some of the characters getting a bit lost, the story about love is beautiful. It's funny, sad and heartfelt at the right times, and just the right amount of holiday cheer.

"A ""Feel Good"" movie that makes me feel bad!","I only watched this film because it was the in-flight movie on a long trip to South Africa, and I have a fear of flying. I tried to use it take my mind off the terror. I have never had to use the sick bag on an airliner before, but I very nearly did here, on account of this overwhelmingly schmaltzy, vomit-inducing, more awful than awful, drivel. I don't know what has happened to Richard Curtis. Once upon a time he was one half of the writing team that brought us the brilliant, the very clever and imaginative BlackAdder series. And now he appears only able to produce harmless, clichéd, politically correct humdrum stuff, vaguely funny if you've been hiding in a hole for the last 80 years.This is the man who has brought us such not-funny turkeys as Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. And now he's gone a step further backwards and written and directed something that is so sentimental, so nice and cuddly that it's downright offensive! It insults it's audience, especially when they are forced to watch it in a metal tube 20,000 feet in the air.Bill Nighy plays a mature rock star who uses expletives a lot. That's an example of the highly intellectual comedic content. That's funny? Then there's the nonsense. Stuff that has no roots in the real world, no link with an intelligent audience. For instance there's a pre-teen kid, who's supposedly in love. We're supposed to believe in him? We're supposed to care about the deluded little tyke? Then there's a Prime Minister, who's attractive, single, and a really nice guy!! Ahhh, how lovely! Arrgghh, I can't stand it! Open the doors! Let me out!Get me away from this unbelievable Schmaltz!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Heartwarming and endearing,"Not being a huge fan of romantic comedies, I felt somewhat dubious about watching Love Actually, but I was enrolled almost immediately after the film began. With all the hatred going on in the world today, it was gratifying to see a film that is all about love - falling in love, being in love, and falling out of love. Written and directed by Richard Curtis, the film is not only about the ecstasy of young love but about love in all forms, between brothers and sisters, parents and children, and even best friends. Performed by a great ensemble cast that includes Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Marlene McCutcheon, and others, It is often silly and over-the-top but its British laid back humor keeps it from being sappy and the film has a freshness and vitality that makes you think (at least for a moment) about going out and seeking to find or renew the experience one more time.Of course, Love Actually is primarily a comedy but it has enough moments of genuine heartfelt emotion in which tears are not inappropriate. The story takes place in the weeks before Christmas which is a season where love and peace are supposed to be more than just New Age clichés. While there are a lot of characters to keep track of, several relationships stand out. There's the love between the widowed Daniel (Neeson) and his 11-year-old stepson, Sam (Thomas Sangster) who provides advice to the boy who has ""fallen in love"" with a girl at school who does not even know that Sam is on the planet. We also look in on the life of Britain's new Prime Minister (Grant) who bears a strong resemblance to Tony Blair. Grant plays the PM in the suave sophisticated British manner of another Grant – Cary, as he pursues his secretary Natalie with some significant reservation.In another, the PMs sister, Karen (Thompson) is afraid her husband Harry (Rickman) will leave her for an attractive coworker, Mia (Heike Makatsch). The office also knows that two of their coworkers, Sarah (Laura Linney) and Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) are in love but are too inhibited to let the other know. One of the best realized segments is about Billy Mack (Nighy), a washed-up rock singer who is trying to save his career by promoting what he acknowledges to be an awful pop-song remodeled for Christmas. Yes, there is more, perhaps too much more, but for me it was so heartwarming and endearing that it could have kept going until it covered all the romances in the world. Can I say that I loved it? Yes - actually.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Actually, love, this film is warm and funny...but do note the R rating","It is nearing Christmastime in England. The new bachelor prime minister (Hugh Grant) is meeting his appointed staff, including a lovely aid named Natalie. His sister (Emma Thompson) is making a lobster costume for the Christmas play and wondering about the fidelity of her husband (Alan Rickman). Meanwhile, a writer (Colin Firth) has come home to find his wife having an affair with his brother. He takes off for a holiday in France and meets a lovely housekeeper. Elsewhere, a young couple have just been married, an aging rock star is attempting a comeback, a nerdy young man is going to off to find love in Wisconsin, a recent widower is dealing with a confused stepson, and a radio network employee (Laura Linney) is smitten with a coworker. Will this be a happy holiday for everyone? Well, just about! This lovely film has many, many story lines but they all work and they all receive enough attention to satisfy the viewers. The film is quite humorous and humane, giving out smiles and sighs with aplomb. All of the actors do their jobs very well and should be commended for making what will probably be a classic in holiday films and in British film-making. One caveat, however. The film got a deserved R rating for language and for one plot line that involves body doubles doing sexual situations for the film industry. Alas, if these two things were eliminated, the film could be recommended for viewing without hesitation. As it is, the film is not suitable for anyone under 18, without extreme guidance. Or, wait. Doesn't the film show up on television from time to time, with some scenes edited? Instead of getting the movie at the local video store, this viewer recommends taping it right from network television. The movie will still retain its funny and sweet story but will be the cleaner, more suitable family version. For, in truth, the film has so many wonderful moments, it would be a shame for anyone to miss seeing the film, actually.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Movie perfection,"Unapologetically sentimental and romantic, Love Actually is a movie to put on your Must-Watch list. In fact, don't stop to write the list - just watch it. You can thank me later.I rarely watch a movie more than once - even ones I consider masterpieces like Inception or The Godfather. But this movie has something about it that makes it a decadent pleasure every year. I've watched it at least 10 times and enjoyed it every time. It's a movie with real heart, positive sentiment throughout, oozing with love stories, laugh out loud humour and so many sub-plots and interesting characters that you're constantly swept along trying to keep up with the action. When these stories all become intertwined as the movie progresses, it's brilliant storytelling. Looking forward to watching it again next year - definitely my favourite Christmas flick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"love pleasantly, not actually.","This movie starts off with a bad Hugh Grant voice over, but a good idea. That being the Heathrow airport, and comings and goings, welcomings and goodbyes, of course, just as this moment forgets the time oriented indiscretions of the airport, it forgets reality for a good portion of the film.I have to admit that I'm ok with the irreality of this film.  We've chosen a Richard Curtis, we know what we're in for.  despite my penchant for subplots, this was a few too many.  Some of the more interesting points are left undeveloped while we are brought to others that would be better dropped: for instance the adult film performers.  Prime Minister is a stretch, too.Bill Nighy is great, and the film despite it's romanticness does sustain a fairly good level of humor.  Colin Firth is at his great uncomfortable best as usual.The ending is a bit long winded and demanding on the viewer, but if you're in a sentimental frame of mind, this film won't fit you too poorly.

However, as usual, Emma Thompson steals the show with her demanding presence.Second, it is full of wit, brilliantly directed, written and edited.

Humm? I expect to use my mind a bit, as formula is hollow, but I truly believe at least the director should know the answer to this issue. The commentary leaves it a real issue. Maybe he shouldn't have cut the hour out; then again maybe he should have cut another hour out.

Worst movie ever created by humanity,"Alright, so here's the real deal about ""Love Actually."" It's a mess, mate. I mean, they chucked in a boatload of big-name actors, thinking that's all it takes to make a killer rom-com, but nah, it's like they just threw a bunch of random love stories into a blender and hoped for the best.First off, the plot is all over the place. You've got like, what, a million different stories going on? It's like the filmmakers couldn't decide on one good story, so they just went, ""Ah, let's do 'em all!"" The result? A confusing mishmash that's hard to follow. You barely get to know one couple, and whoosh, it's onto the next.The characters, man, they're like cardboard cutouts. There's little depth, and most of 'em are walking clichés. You've got your typical lovesick puppy, the guy who's pining for his best mate's wife (creepy, much?), and don't get me started on the whole American girls falling for the bumbling Brit thing. It's like they picked the most stereotypical traits and ran with it.And the humor? It tries way too hard. Some of the jokes are just cringey. It's like, we get it, you're trying to be funny and quirky, but it falls flat most of the time. Feels like they're trying to shove the laughs down your throat.The thing about ""Love Actually"" is, it's trying to sell this fairy-tale version of love, but it's so out of touch. It's like a bunch of unrealistic, soppy stories mashed together. And don't get me started on how it handles serious stuff like cheating. It's all glossed over with a cutesy bow.Visually, it's nothing special either. The whole thing just screams average. Sure, there are a couple of catchy songs, but that's not enough to save this trainwreck.So, in a nutshell, ""Love Actually"" is a hot mess. It's trying to be this big, warm-fuzzy, feel-good movie, but it's more like a cheesy, try-hard flick that's bitten off more than it can chew.

How Richard could have made a Bucketful...,"This film was 2 hours and 9 minutes long. There were eight (count 'em!) different love stories to follow. In some films, there are four stories to follow, and they all come together rather neatly packaged in the end. See Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Go etc. In a romantic comedy, more than one love story can be an interesting idea, if pulled off correctly. Otherwise it can just be vomit-inducing fluff. There were some great ideas here, great comic set pieces, an underused Rowan Atkinson and a helluvalotta stars from British TV (Teachers, anyone?) and film. The theme of the film is, of course, love is all around. I myself certainly felt like every female I saw after the film was a potential mate. This film will do that to you.It's a good idea, in the long run, but, as a writer, this is what I would have done: With a Niagara Falls sized stream of ideas flowing out of my head, such as these, I would have made 3, 4 or 5 different films out of this. Curtis could have easily done that and made a packet load out of it. Of course it defeats the idea of mass story lines and mass stars, but for a directorial debut, Curtis seems too eager to please. And why? After Notting Hill, Four Weddings, penning Bridget Jones 1 (and 2!) this would have been a sure thing for him however he played it.Each story strand is a work of well-crafted fiction, each character more or less three dimensional, even though a few story strands have split ends (in layman's terms, they don't work and they don't end.)One major problem is that he doesn't stick with certain story lines long enough for them to develop, and some just develop too quickly and are quickly thrown away. Oh well. Still a good film, but I would feel more comfortable watching it on DVD in instalments rather than sitting through 2 hours and 9 minutes of waiting for this to end. So all in all, a good first effort, if a little cheesy. One more thing though; the sombre sad part of a romantic comedy comes in around about the mid to last quarter of the film, where the two leads argue about something or other, making the final payoff a more desperate sight for the viewer. However, with eight couples going through angst, a rather sombre mid section drags into a soggy, bittersweet tear-fest and doesn't churn out many laughs. A shame, but worth watching for the sheer spectacle of the ensemble cast.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Like Actually,"It's a darned shame that Love Actually is only just okay, I like it; but the film's title is misleading for the most part. It definitely has likability, which when it comes to Romantic Comedies is somewhat of a miracle. Yet I have no capacity to love it, which the film wants me to, so frequently throughout the runtime that it can be a little unnerving. At certain moments it feels like the director is nudging the audience to chuckle, which when you are aiming for laughs in a film that has a high concept as much as this, is a little odd. The laughs for scenes with particular couples feel forced and unnatural; when I did laugh felt sorry for the film trying to hint that the certain scene or gag is in fact amusing.The film involves about eight couples in the weeks leading up to Christmas at London. It follows their antics and what they do in the countdown to Christmas, whether it is trying to get the Prime Minister's attention or one of the school teachers to like you. The characters themselves range from porn doubles to one guy who has fallen very deeply for his best friend's fiancée; so I cannot fault the film for its ambition or scale which is no mean feat upon Richard Curtis's part in particular, him being the director and the writer I am sure that most of the film was under careful consideration. Other parts I feel are not; it is really annoying that the flaws sometimes overlook the positive elements of the film.It is however, an exceedingly charming film that has infrequent laughs which can sometimes make the whole affair seem a bit dull, especially when it comes to the segments that have little humour, charm or even an actual point for that matter. In particular a scene with one of the characters trying to get girls to like him and repeatedly have sex. Fortunately the best moment comes from Bill Nighy as a singer who does not realise how bad his record is. Nighy can always make a film that is middle of the road, much better than it has any right to be and this is the case with Love Actually.Thankfully, the ending is fulfilling, much more so than some of the other elements that just feel there to add to the already unwieldy length. I cannot help but feel disappointed what with the amount of potential it had and most of which is wasted or lost amid all the different sub plots. It can be hard to get your head around a film like this, and it is certainly much more complex than it needed to be.A more appropriate title would be Like Actually. There are key elements that light up the whole affair and others that just crave the attention they feel, but in no way do they actually deserve. With many gaping flaws through the film; some that run fairly deeply, I cannot see why people adore Love Actually as much as they do.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Drowned in sugar,"Just saw it. This movie is a Christmas fantasy. Everyone is beautiful and pretty much only good thing happen to them. Even the most unlikely things happen.

Having said that, the optimism of the film is contagious and, despite the flaws, at the end you're kinda happy.The best of the movie was it's message of love, it's really heart warming. However, the way it was done could have been better. There's too much cheese. It's gets kinda corny at times, especially at the end. Mostly, i think it should have been more serious and drama-like. Like someone said in the boards, i think it should have been more realistic. It goes way to much over the top and it almost ruins the movie.There's some really good ""serious"" scenes though. My favorite story lines were the friend of the just married couple (the scene when she sees the wedding video-- so sad, so perfect--, the cards scene, again, so sad, so heart breaking); the stand ins (the contrast between the way they are and the job they do-- too funny). The scene with the kid running through the airport to get to his love was the best one. That's what love is all about.I ended up liking some things, disliking others.

I went to this movie with no great expectations about it being an exceptional or original comedy, but ""Love Actually"" was so horrible that I left the theater mid-way through it. And I don't think I've ever left a movie before that I actually paid to see in a theater. I know what you're thinking--It can't be THAT bad can it?? My answer to that is--Yes, it is THAT bad and then some! On the surface, it appeared this would be a likable enough comedy, and it featured an extensive cast of talented actors. And generally these are actors I enjoy seeing on screen, but the characters were so inane and the intertwining plot lines so ridiculous, I couldn't hold back from whispering several times to my husband, and not so quietly, as the show went on""this movie really sucks"" I kept waiting to find something to laugh atand I just found myself laughing at how stupid the whole thing was.It was a lame enough idea to have Hugh Grant play the British Prime Minister in the moviebut a SINGLE Prime Minister who happens to fall in love with a caterer (or whatever she was)? And then he stands up to the bullying US President because the guy supposedly tried to grope his love interest? (And the US Pres. was some sort of bizarre cross between GWBush and an ultra-sleazy version of President Clintonyeah, whatever!) Then there was the sappy story about the widower (Liam) and his supposedly cute (but actually just freaky-looking) son who is so hopelessly in love? First of all, this kid looked like he was about 8 years old. Second, he's so in love that he's in ""total agony"" over it? Didn't buy it!

To demonstrate that porn movie stand-ins are really just regular people like you and me who might happen to fall in love while on the jobor was the whole thing just a really poor attempt at kitschy humor? I still don't know. Might I also add that Laura Linney's talent was completely wasted here toothat plot was just forgettable.I left the theater ACTUALLY upset that I'd paid money to see this thingand I only paid $3 at a second-run movie theater.

Funnier than I expected,"I watched this because there was a special offer at the video shop, so it only cost me £1.

I have to say, some of the developments are wildly implausible, and Hugh Grant does not convince as a bachelor Prime Minister, who must, to judge from a remark by his sister in the story, be a lot older than he looks (and would either party actually have a leader in his forties who was not merely a bachelor but without any kind of female partner at all?

The film itself was mostly over sentimentalised and predictable claptrap but it didn't take itself seriously and it easily passed both the 6 and 10 laugh test, although I did often laugh at how ridiculous it all was. I hated the Bill Nighy song but maybe I'm just being overly grumpy. The ending was so sickly that I felt I needed to purify myself with a Ken Loach drama. But hey, Christmas really is all around us so I'll give it a humourous 6 out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sweet comedy perfect not only for the Christmas holidays,"I had never been interested that much in this movie as I thought it would have been sickly sweet (and I personally hate this sort of movies). However last March I finally got around to it and I saw it. My opinion suddenly changed as I thought this movie had some funny moments and some serious ones. And I don't think of it as an holidays movie.The plot is a bit complicated as it follows many different people that prepare themselves before Christmas. What ties all together is that the various stories all relate to each other. In substance this film is about the people in the posters and their friends have also stories that diverge. And it all works so well.Since there are already 1,190 reviews to date for this movie I won't talk about those stories as it's one of those movies that is aired lots of times on TV.I liked most of the performances, expecially those by Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson (in a different sort of role), Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and even Rowan Atkinson in a small supporting role. And it gives also a nice message of hope (especially in this dark period) and also that love is all around even in the smallest things.Overall, a very well made Christmas movie. And this is one of those rare cases where an overplayed movie is still loved after all these years and it's easy to see why.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Ambitious attempt above-averagely achieved (aaaaa),"The only thing I am not happy about is the cut of John and Judy censored footage!  Why did they do that in Asian release!  Because of those bed scenes?  I feel that I was cheated.  I love the movie, I enjoyed every moment so I want to enjoy ALL its moment.  Now, I am patiently waiting for the director's cut DVD.  When will it be out?  Anyway, I am not sure if R. Curtis has carefully calculated everything or not, undoubtedly it's a 100% ""money collecting"" commercial movie, one ticket for 10 love stories played by so many world-renowned actors, what do you ask more for?Good stuff for Christmas especially when so many Brit soldiers are still in Iraq.  Hugh Grant's words to BB Thornton, ""We may be a small country but a great one."" are truly the thought of most Brits in unity to both Tony Blair and GW Bush!  More love stories, more and more to the Brit troops.  At this time of the year, they need over-sweetened nectar plus positive messages like, ""Love actually is all around (you and I).""What a huge tank of top-notch actors not only from the UK, but also portuguese speaking countries like Portugal (Lúcia Moniz) and Brazil (Rodrigo Santoro), USA (Laura Linney) and astronomical-figured German model. Amongst all the male actors, Santoro should be the sexiest even without taking his clothes off, the Latin virility is filling the air... hmm... unforgettable.  Colin Firth's part can be cut away, it's not really attached to the main line.  Why such a development?  Poor Firth, he has to struggle with the Portuguese.  Actually this language is not for the mouth development of the Brits.  Perhaps Curtis finds that Firth's wife is an Italian, and Italian is so similar to Portuguese so he think this tall guy should be the one for Jamie because he listens to the language everyday at home!I don't exactly remember many of the actresses in the film but Laura Linney for her episode should be the one of the greatest love amongst all the subplots.  I gather that nowadays not many sisters would sacrifice her time, love, even career to take care of a mentally-challenged brother.Curtis can make lots of sequels:1) Alan Rickman should give a clear account of his dubious office affair with his secretary.  E Thompson is seeing him at the airport with the children and so what? (Another Kramer vs Kramer)2) How about Linney and Santoro?  Many possibilities.  Married? Living together and taking care of Michael?  Killed Michael (so it can turn to be a thriller)?3) Neeson and Schiffer's new life.4) See 3) N and S's boys' come-of-age movie5) Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln triangular relationship, add some racial elements...

One of the best of it's kind,"Sometimes it's not easy to put your finger on why you feel the way you do, but the fact that you feel it is undisputed. The fact that i almost always like British comedy is one of those facts. I can't always say why but it more or less never fails.Light British romantic comedy is a genre that seems to have grown considerably these last few years. Add Hugh Grant and you have a winning formula. And why not? Even though movies like ""Love Actually"" are often quite corny and never really surprising they are nevertheless enjoyable. Mostly because of two things really. First of all the comedy is very British, meaning that it's usually quite subtle and often a little peculiar. Second there is almost always great actors involved. Here we have a big part of the British acting elite. Aforementioned Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman... The one that stands out most in this movie though is without a doubt Bill Nighy as the washed-up rock singer who gets one last chance with a Christmas song.This is very much a Christmas movie. Not only because it's set at Christmas but also because it's warm, funny and very cozy. And i say that in the best sense of the words, not in the vomit-inducing way that sugar-sweet TV-movies are cozy. It does have problems. Some of the episodes are less necessary really and it does get overly long before the end. But still it's one of the best of it's kind, and i have to admit i play ""Christmas all around"" every Christmas since...7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A trusty cast and some good jokes make it an OK holiday time-filler...,"Richard Curtis, from my perspective, deserves both panning and praise for his first film as a writer/director, Love Actually- it's loaded to the brim with nearly every kind of relationship/romance/infidelity convention you can think of, wedged into eight different couples intertwined together in merry old England.  However, having said that, I can't say I didn't have a bad time during Love Actually, and I didn't feel compelled to walk out or leave to go to the bathroom for a long stretch of time either.  What works about the movie are two things- the characters Curtis sets up and unfolds, to one degree or another in this definitely movie-movie universe, are believable, and surprisingly there is some interestingly dramatic elements thrown in here and there (particularly with Laura Linney, Liam Neeson- early on, and Emma Thompson).  The other thing is the cast, which includes the known likes of Linney, Neeson, Thompson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and some charming work thrown in by lessor known actors like Kiera Knightly (who got a break during the summer with Curse of the Black Pearl), Martine McCutcheon, Lucia Moniz, Rodrigo Santoro, Thomas Sangster as the boy in love, and nice little cameos for Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thornton, Shannon Elizabeth, etc.The drawback to some of the performances and stories is that since the story jumps from one place to another, and since we can predict more or less where each character's destiny lies on Christmas Eve, there is maybe a little too much emphasis on the paths instead of a little more depth (outside of the dramatic input of course).  Plus, you can tell the film was not the kind of film released first in America and sold later to Europe.  Yet, like I said, the flaws may be moot to most movie-goers, because Curtis is just out to get the audience into having a good, escapist experience with these people, and the main and supporting players do what they can.  Also, as some other reviewers and commentators have noted, the show stopper is indeed Bill Nighy as Billy Mack, the aging, cynical rock star recording and selling a Christmas single on TV and Radio as the sort of background in the film. Along with being the funniest character of the lot, he ends up garnering some heartedness too by the climax.  I wouldn't bother seeing it again for a while, but I was glad I saw it in a packed audience-type of atmosphere. Grade: (strong) B",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It's like they suddenly realized they were out of time, so let's just throw everybody into the airport.

A funny yet sentimental and touching film exploring love in all its aspects,"When you think of the word ""love"", what words come to your mind? Maybe it is lust, attraction and sex? Maybe it is sharing sweet and romantic moments together? Or maybe it is unbridled faithfulness and devotion over time? This movie explores all of these aspects of love and more.Interwoven within this movie are stories of people from all walks of life from the young to the old. Each person explores a facet of love like a diamond glistening brightly reflecting its light and beauty in various different ways. E.g. We see those pure moments where time seemingly slows down as a person is enraptured by someone else for the first time. We also see how power can influence and potentially corrupt the dynamic of people in romantic relationships e.g. Superiors and subordinates. The film showcases the joy of couples getting married whilst also showing the sorrows of unrequited love. The film also examines the themes of dating, casual relationships, and temptation in the face of faithfulness.Love Actually is an enjoyable film that is funny, lighthearted, sentimental, and romantic. It will appeal to people of all ages who want to experience vicariously what it means to be in love. This film will surely bring you and your loved one into a romantic mood by the end. It is an instant classic rom-com and well worth the watch! Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Richard Curtis Actually Isn't a Cockeyed Optimist,"""Love Actually"" deserves a good review.  It's a fine example of ensemble acting directed by a master of the winsome/wistful genre of romantic comedy. Comedy with a dash, and a strong one at that, of drama centering on issues of commitment that are strongly played amid the sometimes madcap humor.Director Richard Curtis may not own the Hugh Grant franchise in boyish innocence hitched to almost palpable virility but the two of them have done rather well together on the screen.  Here, a fine cast (too many for me to list-check the film's page on IMDb) play characters loosely or closely related in one way or another, all sharing a need for love with commitment. Whether they realize that or not.Fantasy abounds.  Grant plays a young British prime minister who reviewers seem to feel is tenuously modeled on George W. Bush's loyal servitor, Tony Blair.  For the record, it's nonsense.  Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about English history will recognize Grant's portrayal as based on his solid study of William Ewart Gladstone.  Putting that aside he is a prime minister with more of a personal than an official life and it's all in good fun.Comments on both sides of the pond have ascribed a political message in the P.M.'s strong stand when bullied by the U.S. president played by Billy Bob Thornton (he's everywhere these days, isn't he?).  Some folks can't see a joke when it's on the big screen in front of them.  Curtis has created a fantasy character - can anyone imagine a lecherous president going after a prime minister's lovely but slightly plump house maid on two minutes acquaintance?  And on a STATE VISIT? Please.Some of the characters are more finely developed than others, especially the roles inhabited by Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Liam Neeson.  All contribute to a fairly well put together story.In Curtis's ""Love Absolutely"" not everyone finds even ""Love Marginally."" Decisions are made, risks are taken, happiness is doled out and its permanence isn't assured.I don't doubt the director's genuine belief that he was making a positive statement in the first minute with Grant, in a voice over, characterizing the last, terribly tragic phone calls from trapped victims in the World Trade Center but, frankly, it's an unnecessary and jarring comment.So just enjoy it and await, I'm sure, Hugh Grant's next exasperated trolling for love under Mr. Curtis's benevolent but not Pollyannish direction.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

pants actually,"There are directors who can hold together a film containing several narratives (Robert Altman, Woody Allen, Ron Howard, to name but three) but Richard Curtis fails miserably. There's a good film in there somewhere struggling to get out but Richard Curtis the director has employed Richard Curtis as writer and his partner Emma Freud as script editor, so there's no one to tell him that actually so many strands don't work. The Hugh Grant/Martine McCutcheon story is charming if implausible, but didn't Rob Reiner do it so much better in The American President? And Curtis seems convinced that swearing itself is funny. The Colin Firth story works much better and provides the film's best laughs. Emma Thompson is brilliant as the wife discovering her husband is at least contemplating an affair, but Alan Rickman isn't convincing. Surely such an intelligent man wouldn't really be interested in an affair with the cheap as chips office girl. Keira Knightley is beautiful and charming in the touching segment involving a nicely understated performance from Andrew Lincoln as the doting unspoken admirer. Bill Nighy camps it up in fine style as the ageing rocker, but the comedy is laid on with a trowel. The worst strands of the film involve the bereaved Liam Neeson and his stepson - the airport scene is particularly emetic, the out-of-place simulated sex scenes featuring Martin Freeman and the ludicrous section that implies that any English nerd would be viewed as a sex god in America.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A rare and astounding ensemble performance of true artists. Inspires love, uplifts our 'human-ness'","The premise, which you must know by now, is the romantic trajectories of 8 couples. Even critics who praise it have remarked that the filmmakers were a tad bit rushed to find satisfactory conclusions to each couple's romantic potential. I disagree! The premise, that 'love is, actually, all around', is a delightful and uplifting tale. Following the characters through from promising beginnings, to uncertain middles, all the way to emotionally resonant ends is a legitimate and worthy enterprise.There are no spoilers here, although I would say that it does not stretch the imagination too much to anticipate certain types of outcomes in a romantic comedy. All of the story lines, even those with a bit of sadness, feel true- to me, anyway. I was, at all times, able to identify with the scenes on the screen (a TV screen for me, because I had only gotten to watching 'Love Actually' recently, on DVD).The cast of 'Love Actually', is, duh, an amazing constellation of superb actors. Some 'star vehicles' contain only stars, seemingly not really portraying anything meaningful, but merely being their own famous selves. The assemblage of stars here, however, is that rarest of things--- an assembly of world-class artists and 'presences'. Each was perfectly cast, each gives a natural and astounding performance.I loved this movie! I found it a rich and delightful source of inspiration and upliftment. Hurray for all involved.

Love in England,"Good material for relax with a refreshing plot and a good cast of actors and actresses, among them Hugh Grant as a new Tony Blair, more critic and independent from USA; Billy Bob Thornton as the invasive US president who even wanted to steal the love of the primer Minister of UK; the always effective Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson, and many others. The plot consists of lives and behavior of various people in UK, from the head of the government to simple persons in this society and the ways each tries to celebrate Christmas. Not all is positive, a couple is also shown having a husband with false values always looking for other ladies and fun. For me the best of the film is the romance of Hugh Grant with his maid/secretary, it is funny the way they met for Christmas, and how he as Prime Minister was caught together with her.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Another feel-good offering from Curtis.  I actually like Four Weddings and a Funeral' and Bridget Jones' Diary' more,"The film is set in the five weeks leading up to Christmas and consists of a number of love stories affecting people who are related to characters in the other stories: a best man (Andrew Lincoln) is inexplicably hostile to his friend's new wife; the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls in love with his tea lady (Martine McCutcheon); his sister (Emma Thomson) is faced with her husband (Alan Rickman) having an affair at work; Alan Rickman's colleague (Laura Linney) finds her long term crush and love for another colleague requited; a widowed father (Liam Neeson) helps his son cope with falling in love for the first time; a writer (Colin Firth) escapes to France after being cheated on by his wife and finds new love; and an aging rocker (Bill Nighy) aims to make Christmas Number One in the pop charts with a cover of Love Is All Around' only the lyrics have been changed to Christmas Is All Around'.  (Astonishingly, this song has been released for real in the UK and made the top 40!)If you enjoyed Richard Curtis's previous offerings Four Weddings And A Funeral' and Notting Hill', you will not be disappointed by Love Actually' which is fun, likeable and romantic, if a little formulaic.  Hugh Grant gets another starring role in a Curtis movie and gives an endearing performance as the British Prime Minister.  I like him a lot but I am sure that there are some people out there who will be irritated to find him in typical bumbling mode (yet again!)It is a joy to see the abundance of British stars on the screen and it is fun to spot the additional television stars including British television presenters of the moment Ant and Dec!  My favourite moment is one I'm sure many of the British public have been faced with at some point in their lives when Bill Nighy refers to one of the presenters as Ant or Dec' as he has no idea which is which!  Other comic highlights include Hugh Grant dancing in the hallway at Number Ten and the language barrier between Colin Firth and his maid in France even though they are unable to speak each other's language, the subtitles on the screen show that they are communicating even if they are not aware of it.  The chemistry between these two is irresistible but is let down by the silly way that their story is resolved.While the film is filled with likeable performances, there is one piece of casting which let Liam Neeson's story down.  His son is cute but he sounds far too posh and well spoken for me to feel sympathy for his situation!Alongside the humour, there are some unexpected serious moments which I think over tip the balance and sit uncomfortably in a mostly lighthearted comedy.  One of these is the discovery that Laura Linney's new love is jeopardised by her commitment to her mentally ill brother.  Emma Thomson's realisation that her husband is cheating on her is also heartbreaking.  You have these serious undercurrents on the one hand and on the other you have a couple of silly stories: one featuring Kris Marshall leaving his life in London for Wisconsin in search of beautiful girls and rampant sex and another featuring Martin Freeman (Tim from The Office') as a porn body double having getting to know you' conversations while engaging in various sexual positions with his naked co-star.Love Actually' is like a book of short stories and suffers in the same way: by the time you get into the stories and you are just starting to get to know the main character, it is time to move on to a completely new story which is sometimes less interesting.  However, it makes for an enjoyable and romantic enough date movie and is Christmassy enough to warrant repeat viewings on DVD and television over festive seasons to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Nice use of music too like ""All You Need is Love"" being performed at a wedding, ""Both Sides Now"" while Emma Thompson is crying, or ""God Only Knows"" at the ending scene.

Love Comes to Everyone,"The Richard Curtis I like is the man behind the big belly-laughs in TV's ""Black Adder"" and ""Vicar Of Dibley"". Quite how he morphed into the purveyor of ludicrous, over-sentimental tosh like this I'll never know, although I think the lure of the mighty dollar might have had something to do with it.Mixing the supposed ""feel-good"" factor of a latter-day Christmas film to an overblown hymn to love, while meant no doubt to induce a warm feeling inside, instead turned my insides out. Here in a Britain about a million miles detached from reality, Cupid's little arrows strike out at everyone from the prime minister himself to porn actors and even, God bless, the little children. It's all set to a corny soundtrack, a new song on every two minutes or so it seems, usually consisting of poor cover versions of standards.I don't know which set of cooing couples I thought the least of, but for sheer sickliness, the exchanges between Liam Neeson and his 10 going on 40 year old son take some beating. Worst scene though, in an overcrowded category, has to be Emma Thompson silently over-emoting as she realises her husband is thinking of having an affair. I wish Dorothy Parker hadn't already coined the phrase about running the gamut of acting emotions from A to B, although I'm not sure Miss Thompson even got past A, so toe-curlingly embarrassing is her ""big"" scene.Honestly, to these eyes and ears, not one actor shines, although as I think I've made clear, I believe the fault is in the writing. There's also some unnecessary vulgarity, loads of ham acting and a direction style which tries to lead you by the nose to Christmas nirvana. No, this Christmas turkey can go and get stuffed as far as I'm concerned, its one small saving grace being that it singularly failed to launch former soap star Martine McCutcheon to movie stardom. Well, that would certainly be high up on my Christmas wish-list any old year.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Wanted to embrace it, but couldn't","'Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think of the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere.'With this monologue by the British Prime Minister (played by Hugh Grant), that wouldn't have been misplaced in The Great Dictator (I mean that as about the highest honour I can give), Love Actually begins. It's the story of about a dozen people (all somehow linked to each other), who are in relationships of some sort. Some fall in love, some cheat, some just don't know what to do with themselves.Obviously, one story is better than another. For instance, there's this guy going to the USA to 'score some babes', and he actually does, but we couldn't care less. Then there are two 'actors' who hit it off, but that's not really that interesting neither, nor is the romance between a woman (Laura Linney) and a co-worker, with a mentally ill brother standing in the way of things.Other stories work better, with the Prime Minister falling for a servant of his, and a widowed step-dad (Liam Neeson) explaining his 'new' son how to act towards the most popular girl in school.The two really interesting stories that remain are that of cheating husband Harry, and how his wife is dealing with that and the romance between writer Jamie (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese cleaning lady. There's a wonderfull scene where Jamie is asking her father for her hand, and the whole town following them to where she works.But overall, the movie was a bit disappointing. The love-stories were too simple, too flat and one-dimensional. Also, the 'red line' between things (no. 1 hit by 'Billy Mack') turned a bit boring near the end. Too bad as I really wanted to love this movie for it's bright and upbeat message.Final score: 5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Possibly my favourite movie of all time.,"My male friends would instinctively say 'Of course you love it, you're a woman. It's just another Rom-com...' That was until I forced them to watch it. They were all deeply touched by it and one even shed tears at the end because he was just so happy that so many people had had their lives enriched by that strange emotion called love. (Bless...) 'Love Actually' isn't just yet another romantic comedy which is along the same lines as all the others: two people meet, one is already taken or shortly will be, the other goes through severe emotional turmoil and they finally realise they're made for each other. (Although I must admit, I still love them...) Many different people, all connected in some way either through family or friends, are making their way through life as you do when along it comes: love. It smacks some in the face, it sneaks along beside others, slowly creeping out until it's fully emerged.I challenge you to name an actor or actress who did not pleasantly surprise us all by delivering a stunning performance in this movie.

Love Boat Actually,"While watching Love Actually, I was struck how closely the formula followed the formula of the ABC network's Love Boat series. Over a restricted space of time, you cut between several stories of love in different phases, allotting each story about 15 minutes apiece.

In the IMDb trivia entry, it is noted that some of the dialog was taken from unused scenes from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", which falls nicely in line with the Love Boat's habit of recycling plots over its lengthy run.To give credit to Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, they threw themselves into this movie and probably gave it more effort than the material deserved. I found myself not being as involved with the characters as I did feeling sorry for the actors.Still, if The Love Boat is your cup of tea - by all means, pick this up in the video store. You may miss Julie, Gopher and the rest of the gang, and London sure isn't Cabo San Lucas, but you will find the story lines familiarly comforting and Ted McGinley (Your Ship's Photographer) is nowhere to be seen.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Thought-Provoking and Enjoyable Film in Disguise,"When I first heard about ""Love Actually,"" I didn't want to see it because of the reasons for which it was rated R.  Yet when it was nominated for a Golden Globe and I saw it was playing at the ""$1.50 Theater,"" I decided to give it a try.  What I got was much more than my money's worth: a truly delightful, thoughtful film.""Love Actually"" is advertised as a romantic comedy, but I believe the movie was much more than that.  Richard Curtis' story is complex, yet believable, showing the ties between between several different people with the common factor of love.  Also, the love portrayed is not only romantic love, but also love for friends and love for family.  The love in the movie is often unexpected, sometimes not, but always enjoyable.  The movie was simply hilarious, seemingly without much effort.  Also, Craig Armstrong's score is simply immaculate, portraying the themes of the movie through both uplifting and dramatic pieces.  The score succeeds in not only showing the ups and downs of love, but also how little events can seem over-dramatic to those involved, especially those ""in love.""Complaints: I have very few for this movie, because of how extremely enjoyable it is, but I must say two things.  First, the beginning, maybe, fifteen minutes of the movie seem chaotic,as Richard Curtis switches from one story to the next.  Yet the movie quickly warms up as the characters in the movie are developed.  Second, those who read my reviews probably get tired of me saying this, but there was a little too much nudity for my tastes.  However, I will say this, I liked the point that the director makes through his use of sex scenes.  Nevertheless, the film still could've been even better if the scenes had been implied instead of shown.See ""Love Actually,"" not to see a mindless comedy, but to see possibly the most enjoyable Golden Globe-nominated movie of 2003.Final Grade: A-.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Go watch it; Enjoy the love that's spread everywhere!!,"When I decided to watch this movie, it was quite late in the night and I was feeling sleepy. When the movie starts rolling, I was actually waking up to the movie, and when it ended I was fully awake, filled with overwhelming feelings of love and I just didn't want the movie to end. It was that good.The movie has been carefully made to convey different dimensions of love. Some of the plots are so realistic that you can easily connect with the character.

So artistic, realistic and warm.If you are a people's person, you sure would enjoy the movie as I did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Lovely English humour, Notting Hill part 2","This is one of those movies to cuddle with someone and watch with. There is that atmosphere of ordinary people leaving ordinary lives, yet being extraordinary in their take of things (and in their accent, of course). All those people that enjoyed Notting Hill will enjoy this one, maybe even more.The cast is full with good actors, starting with Alan Rickman and ending with Liam Neeson. You have celebs like Claudia Schiffer showing unexpectedly. You have personal drama and bliss (sometimes put together). But what is delightful is the humour of it all. Perhaps the Brits will do a dozen films like this one and I'll get fed up with their joking style and I'll write different reviews, but for me it was funny. Really funny. And not in the ""Ha Ha"" sense that we see on the Hollywood conveyor belt.I think that the attack on the British Premier was not that subtle, but then again, I doubt he gets anything else.

It's all about love!,"What is love, really? This movie is all about exploring the various aspects of love in our daily lives.

I first watched this movie on cable here in my country some time back and so this is my review...It's kind of fun and interesting to see how the cast celebrate love in many different ways leading up to Christmas in London. Hugh Grant as the prime minister, it's kind of funny and cute. Rowan Atkinson's appearance also brought some laughs.Love between friends, lovers, couples, siblings...most of it were being dealt with in the movie.

Severely disappointed,"I went to see this movie on a rainy day in an attempt to cheer myself up. Judging by the trailers and reviews, I was expecting a great, feel-good film. What I got was a different story.I got a mangled plot, abandoned storylines, unnecessary sex jokes and swearing, boring one-dimensional characters... And only two people managed to make me laugh- UK TV presenters Ant and Dec. I cared nothing for any of the characters or storylines, save Hugh Grant, but he is wonderful at romantic comedy (pah! this film was not so much romcom as boringblurb) and I enjoy watching him. What of the porn-stars, who had plenty of time spent on them at the beginning, only to be abandoned for what must have been at least an hour? Kris Marshall, who is brilliant in the UK series ""My Family"", was given a plot and dialogue so ridiculous I had to shut my eyes and pretend it wasn't happening. Keira Knightley was wooden, as usual, but add that to a messy story and it was bordering on painful. Even the usually wonderful Alan Rickman was dull.This story seemed to be entirely about sex jokes, swearing and being unfaithful. After nearly 2 hours, I couldn't bear it any more and left the cinema.Love Actually would've been much better off with half the stories- in fact, no, it would've been better if this diabolical mess had never been made. Atrocious and outstandingly disappointing.2/10 (just for Hugh Grant's ""Jump"" sequence and Ant + Dec)",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Actually Left Me Cold...,"I seldom write a poor review of a movie, but I had to comment on this one. I really felt cheated by the writer and director of this film, Richard Curtis, who previously has done such intelligent and splendid work.  This was just ridiculous...and cheap!!  First, the storyline of the Hugh Grant piece was a clear rip off of the American President, a film that was so charmingly and intelligently written and casted several years ago. The plot was just dumbed down and changed to an English prime minister and his tea lady.  I was appalled by the casting of Billy Bob as the American President.The storyline involving the little boy who lost his mother and is in love with a girl at school was downright creepy.  No sense at all that the boy had lost his mother... and the Claudia Schiffer look a like at the end...pleeeeeease!!  Or maybe it was the real Claudia. I wasn't interested enough to stick around for the credits.Another creepy storyline...the best man who videotapes his friend's wedding obviously obsessed with the groom's wife. Some best friend. If this is love than the writer has a very disturbed view about what love actually is. I won't tell you what the best friend does after this.The fat jokes in the movie.  Again, very thoughtless and cheap and seemed to pervade the movie thus clearly not supporting the tagline ""love actually is all around.""I could go on and on but let's not. I guess when you are Richard Curtis you can do what you want without really possessing a cohesive, quality piece of work.Give me Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman any day. Colin Firth...why do you agree to do such drivel??  Hugh Grant, I really do not care for you in any regard, but you saved the film mainly because you took poor material and made it funny and endearing. I have new found respect for you as an actor.  Enough said.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Great Holiday Flick,"Boy did I come to this party late. A great holiday surprise. Full of crass humor, mistaken intentions, international jibes and...well love.Love, this movie will have you believe, is everywhere if you look. If you're a cynical person this film really will not work for you. Especially in the opening scene where it's EXACTLY stated that love is everywhere, if you look.It's a statement alright. And now it has to prove that love does and will come in many forms. I love the interconnectivity of these seemingly disconnected people. This type of movie is what Garry Marshall wishes he could do with those stupid holiday movies. This one clearly defines the relationship. This guy loves this girl but can't follow through because of this reason. That's it. Simple. Drama. Comedy. It's all here. They want you to love this movie so much that they have a tough ex-rocker (played by Bill Nighy) promise to strip naked and play his hit song, if it goes to number one. The issue being, HE doesn't believe in his Christmas song. Delightful! There's also a heart-wrenching moment, when this old codger realizes the real meaning of love, through a mist of groupies, drugs and alcohol. What prevails is the heart. A wonderful moment for all those with troubled pasts.Well, you've more than likely have seen this movie by now.

Actually Very Bad,"Two romantic comedy / Hugh Grant fans were disappointed last night. After we saw Love Actually, my wife and I both thought it was a waste of money but more importantly we thought it was a waste of our minds and an insult to our humanity.The movie, although acted well, takes the premise that love is erotic sentimentalism. Everyone has an animalistic sexual urge that they can't control. And that superficial, physical attraction is lifted up and sold to us as the best kind of Love. Very little about commitment or making good choices or putting family first. Of course we rarely find that in Hollywood, but what we also don't often find is such over-the-top, blatant distortion of loving relationships. Every storyline in the movie glorifies a dysfunctional relationship: sleeping with your brother's wife, adultery in the office a couple of times, a couple who gets together because they do nude scenes in the movies, getting together with your housekeeper, best-man in the wedding falls for the bride, etc.Another aspect of the movie that keeps me wondering why I continue to send money to Hollywood is the obvious anti-Americanism and liberal agenda that comes through. A small role by the American president (played by Billy Bob Thornton) portrays a sexual doof who bullies the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant). One of the supposedly most rousing scenes in the movie is when the Prime Minister stands next to the American president and shames him for not being nice to England.Also, subtley, several of the characters work at an organization called Fair Trade, and the poster backdrops in the office herald the plight of the 3rd World and how we should ""help shoulder their burden"". Liberals always seem to love globalist organizations like these that decry our capitalist system as exploitative when it is this very system that gives them the economic freedom to make movies such as this. Why do we often have these political ideas injected into movies that should just be good romantic comedy?All in all a very disappointing movie. The gratuitous nudity, ubiquitous foul language, and lack of any sense of real love instead of the erotic urges that is passed to us as Love, keeps me from recommending this movie to anyone, actually.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love is Actually quite good!,"Great movie, and well deserving of the 7.7/10 rating on IMDb. There is no main character in this, but every story still feels like it is in one big combined story. I actually was hoping I would agree with the critics on Rotten Tomatoes, because I don't like to be accused of liking bad films. But, I really enjoyed this film, besides the flaws. Maybe I am too dumb to understand, but I felt the critics were overreacting. This movie, was a really good movie, that blends romance, British humour and (some) Christmas spirit. Well, okay, maybe not much, but it spreads cheer for sure. There are some jokes that may offend sensitive viewers in this movie, but if you can put up with them, you will find a really good movie. Love Actually, SHOULD be all around us, on every single television screen at Christmas time. Great movie. Overall, the IMDb rating is best suited. Go watch it, you will not regret it. Plus, the last ten minutes...that was pure delightful movie making. I think I fell in love with Love Actually.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Wonderful film, very British but the comedy is universal.","First of all this film has to be one of the best feel good movies ever in my opinion. All of the characters are realistic enough to be believable. You will find all of these characters or a double of them in UK. The comedy does not flow all the way through continuously and there are scenes of deep realistic and sad scenes. All of the scenes flow well into one another which is difficult when you are dealing with many characters and in many different locations. They couldn't have put the scenes in a better line-up and all the actors were well chosen for each role. The Christmas Office party, the unrequited love, the office vamp, the infidelity, the love, the childhood crush, many of the things that bring this film together. A true masterpiece, unlike Valentine's Day, which seemed to be an American stab at trying to make a US version of Love Actually that didn't quite hit the mark. That's because you need some British actors to play all the American parts, that way you get the humor and the accent.It is always hard to mold many pieces of film footage together to get a marvel like this film but the beginning and the end which I believe was filmed in the arrivals lounge in Heathrow epitomizes the act of Love, Love of a lover, love of a husband, a wife, love of a son and daughter, grandparents, friends, love actually live and real and not at all faked.The film will make your Christmas feel more special, make you feel more love in yourself and the world. We are all of the human race and love is a difficult and sometimes heart wrenching business but we all have the capacity to love and although the film is a comedy with tinges of sadness, I hope people who watch this film realize, ""Love is all around"". I am not usually like this about films with love in them, so I will now retreat to a quiet place and find myself a big bucket. But you guys feel free to love this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A charming first-time watch,"Love Actually is an out-and-out feel-good movie. It does not try to portray highly believable characters or an intense storyline.....however, it delineates the lives of people from various walks of life searching for love in their own ways, in a sweet, light-hearted and I must say,very enjoyable manner. The opening credits featuring Billy Mack's Christmas song sets the tone for the film.......sweet and funny. And throughout, it never loses that touch.......often producing surprisingly touching moments like the scene where Mark (Andrew Lincoln) expresses his love for Juliet (Keira Knightley) or when Billy Mack acknowledges his feeling for his 'chubby' manager. If you are in a mood for a light-hearted, funny, sweet and romantic musical, in my opinion, not many films can get better. I would not like to speak about the blemishes, because in the end, I believe these kind of movies want you to come out with a good feeling inside you, which this film accomplishes gracefully. Maybe I would never want to watch the entire movie again, but the first time watch was certainly charming and enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Delightful Holiday Film - If You Suspend Your Disbelief (And Please Try),"Touching, moving and yet a movie that leaves you feeling good - even if you shed a tear in the process. Yes, it's imperfect but it's so good in its better aspects that it's easy to sit back and just enjoy this good-time holiday pic. And helping us forget the few corny moments of the film are the many wonderful vignettes put in by a wide variety of fine actors. Also making this an 8-star movie are the touches of real life that ring true on a deeper level and speak to serious issues we all have to deal with - all the while providing comic relief in most cases (not all). I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Grant but he provides some wonderful comic moments here, as the British Prime Minister - including a somewhat Scrooge-like transformation that warms your heart near the end of this film. Bill Nighy is brilliant - and if you're not aware of his work, you will admire him after seeing this film. But perhaps Emma Thompson is the one who most gives this movie its greatest depth. It is her role that demanded the most acting skills and she rises to the challenge - as she always does. What a great actress - and even in this light comedy she impresses. There are aspects of the ending that are cliché and could have been better but slog through the final concert scene and the airport scene because the final video statement will really get you, summing up all the disparate stories in one neat heart-warming visual commentary. You'll need a handkerchief - even though it's mostly laughs you'll enjoy. Because Love Actually does have its ""aw!"" moments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love Actually Is All Around,"Love Actually is one of the few ensemble cast, multiple storyline films that seems to have pervaded popular culture in recent years that actually--pardon the pun--works. Unlike Valentine's Day or New Years Eve (just to name a few), Love Actually manages to create a cohesive film with an all-star cast and just enough story lines for watchers to be invested in each characters hardships and happiness. Perhaps the greatest success that Love Actually can boast is the expert use of the multiple storyline structure to bring more than one kind of relationship to the forefront of this romantic comedy. Liam Neeson portrays a recently widowed stepdad, coming to terms with the loss of his wife while learning to care for his love-lorn stepson; Laura Linney plays a lonely ex-pat, unable to invest in her own romantic life because her responsibilities to her mentally ill brother; Bill Nighy demonstrates the love a washed up rockstar has for his manager and his constant and only companion throughout his career; Andrew Lincoln, who plays Mark, shows us the bittersweet side of an unrequited love with his best friend's wife. All these relationships--father to son, sister to brother, friend to friend, and lover to almost lover--come together to create a beautiful collage of varying human relationships. Of course more typical love interested are also included with Colin Firth's cross-cultural relationship with his portuguese employee or Prime Minister Hugh Grant's love for a member of his household staff. However, the inclusion of these varying types of love all echo the very opening lines of this movie, that ""love actually is all around"" in the form of ""fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends and old friends"". Love Actually is truly a tribute to the human experience, as it honors all the different forms that love comes in. 
It's easy to categorize Love Actually as an overdone, overly sugary and cliched film, but this would ignore all the complications that the movie tackles. The heartbreak, sadness, unrequitedness, and grief that inevitably come with loving--with being so invested in another human--are not only included, but heavily considered through out this film. Emma Thompson, a dedicated friend and devoted mother and wife, discover that her husband, Alan Rickman, has gifted another woman jewelry for Christmas. The scene that ensues is impossible to forget as she stands in the bedroom she shares with said husband, her children and husband just on the other side of the wall. The scene is so touching and so evocative because her dilemma is so clear; she's been betrayed but as she stands in the home that she's built with her husband, with the family they share together, she cannot let go of their life together. She still loves and it's because she loves that she was able to be so broken. Laura Linney's character, mentioned above, is perhaps an even sadder tale. She sacrifices her love for her coworker Carl, for the love and wellbeing of her mentally ill brother. Love Actually is full of moments, like Laura's stuggle between her own interest and her brothers, or Emma Thompson disillusionment with her marriage, that grapple with real problems, real emotions and real struggles. Death, infidelity, mental illness, sexual harassment in the workplace and unrequited love are all serious issues dealt with in Love Actually that one would not typically associate with a movie that markets itself as ""the ultimate romantic comedy"". However, despite these darker issues, a talented cast manages to create comedic moments even in the face of more serious issues. Of course, there also moments purely created for comedic effect, seemlessly woven in as a result of the multiple storyline structure. Rowan Atkinson's cameo as a store clerk allows for a lighthearted break from heavier material while the sex-driven Colin's search for love in America also provides comedic moments. 
So many ensemble cast films fall flat in their execution despite being littered with classic tropes and ample star power. Love Actually avoids this failing by making use of a talented cast, evocative emotional scenes, comedic relief and the mulitple story line structure that highlights all the kinds of love that exist.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very very VERY good.,"I was actually very surprised of how good this movie was. A friend of mine dragged me into it and I had a very pesimistic mindset going in.

It was funny without being ridiculous. And it had a message without waving a finger in my face. Of course it is not the greatest movie of all time, and the  storyline is not really imaginative, but when all is said and done it will entertain  you and make you feel real good and remind you what's important in life.

As it was contents of Christmas, I was able to be excited even more. The theme song of a movie is ""All You Need Is Love"". This is so good and I think it match this movie. My favorite scene is the scene that Sarah is pleased with. I thought that time when Sarah sent Carl of the unrequited love partner to the room was very pretty.

Hate actually........,"This movie is such tripe that I now understand why a movie that was supposed to be so good did so poorly at the box office. Because the general public knows an over-hyped, shallow, vulgar, piece of crap masking as 'romantic comedy' when it sees it.I should have known that something was up when the credits were barely over & Hugh Grant is narrating about love and how there really is so much love in the world and that we just don't notice it and then he remarks on how the victims of the World Trade Center when they were making their last phone calls to family had nothing but love in their hearts not hatred which is probably true but seemed a very strange choice to use in the beginning of a romantic comedy. Apparently it was a portent of things to come.The movie shoves characters and story lines into our faces without any story development and then expects us to care as every clichéd trick in the book is used to squeeze an emotion out of us. My primary emotion throughout the movie was disgust.On top of this was coarse language totally out of place in a quote un quote light romantic comedy.So many story lines throwing so much out at us and we're supposed to be amused and engaged by all of this.As usual with ""multi"" story lines, after the first story is presented, the rest only serve to interrupt and distract or force the audience no matter how unwillingly to choose which storyline they prefer.It's a shame about the movie. There are some good story lines, some fine performances, Laura Linney in particular but again, the movie just jumps in without warming up it's audience so that by the time starts reaching it's dramatic peaks, you're too p***ed to care.And now we get to really bad part of the movie. Hugh Grant practically doing a parody of his on screen self is absolutely, atrociously bad as none other than the Prime Minster of England.He's totally unbelievable in the role.Billy Bob Thorton as President of the United States in a cameo role gives another great performance as a sleazy Clinton-esqe type.Unfortunately the film also includes a rather silly scene where Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister at a press conference with Billy Bob's President makes a rather dumb statement to the press about how the UK is although a small country, a great one and the US has been a big bully so the UK is going to be tough too. Seriously.This is presented as a serious political ""moment"" in the film. Besides the fact that the political statement is totally out of place in the film and besides the fact that UK's Prime Minister is standing strong and tall as an ally of the US despite criticism in his own country, besides all this, it's just another incredibly stupid moment in the film.This is one very strange movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Romcom perfected,"Love Actually is just about an excellent Romcom which balances that Romance and Comedy perfectly to be one of the highest rated ever. A great film with some great actors and cameos with a great writer ,director and story which well just goes together perfectly. In my review I'll tell you why overall I found this to be a great piece of cinema and why you should watch it too if you haven't.The story is intertwined and lot's of things go on at once, this makes for one interesting piece which I am sure you find delightful and heart warming at the same time. It is more romantic than funny but the humour flows at times and you can feel yourself laughing a lot and then feeling sorry for someone because there sad too, it has it's moments. Another thing with the story is that the intertwining doesn't confuse you and the characters always know each other but not too much to bother them in there side of the love mega triangle.I loved the acting of the various actors on show with such people as Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman among the fantastic people on show. Liam Neeson I think stays with you with an emotionless performance that suddenly becomes emotional because of his son's problems in the story and your heart strings are pulled by the end in part well, you will see or know what I mean with Neeson's sweet little son. A great cameo from Rowan Atkinson as the jewellery store owner is one of the funniest bits of the film and annoys Alan Rickman so well, it great.Richard Curtis who directs and writes this is just superb and one the best ever with Romantic Comedies. His idea is brilliant and comes to life not just with the great acting but also his great script and I feel he deserves even more acclaim for his work than he already does so. The script is gold and ever so smartly done by Curtis and Curtis is just the mastermind of the entire project as a whole.The film is not without slight criticisms and I guess it is in the sense that it is not laugh out loud funny and sometimes the laughter can be cut short by an emotional scene which doesn't quite work so well in parts. Although the film hardly suffers from these tiny things and all together it is just Great so not much to write here in a critical sense of the film.I think people who like RomComs should love this film as it isn't poor in that area although people looking for hilarious jokes are going to bore themselves here. The story is soppy and for those who hate loved up feel good films then please don't watch this or you will hate it, because that is the entire film in a nutshell. All kind of people should like it but some won't, it just what happens with film, not every film can pleasure everyone.Overall it is great, it is only just there and just about steers clear of just being a very good movie. If you dislike it I would think it would still be an OK film so it worth a watch of course, sit back and if you have a lover then this is perfect for you because if anything it can make you near fall more in love than you were before.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Excellent,"This was an excellent romantic comedy.  Most people who are complaining seem to think that it should of had some sort of deep symbolic meaning/overtone. In reality, it's just a simple fun movie, and in that regard it succeeds admirably.  If I have any complaint, it was that after so many grand romantic gestures I started to get a little overwhelmed by all of them.  But again you can't expect to see a romantic comedy without some sort of grand romantic gesture. Overall an excellent example of the genre, and a pretty good film in its own right.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The ending is worth it!,"This is a cute, silly movie with some really good intentions. But is hits home with a feel good ending and then to hear KELLY CLARKSON sing THE TROUBLE WITH LOVE as the credits roll gives you a warm feeling inside. No, this is not a deep film but it does depict that you can live without love sometimes, yet you certainly live so much better with love in your life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Christmas classic,"Love this movie actually.
My favourite Christmas movie bar none.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not even funny to the British,"This had to be one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. From the totally ridiculous wedding, to the God awful funerals scene. First of all they tried to cram too many subplots into this movie. You can never get a good handle on any of the characters because of the bouncing from one character to the other.This movie also had too many old cliché's that it tried to use for comedy and none of them worked. The acting was just awful. It was as if the actors were going through a rehearsal. And the part about the Prime Minister and the way he was acting towards American president was just ignorant.Don't waste your time or money on this piece of garbage that would even make the late-night TV market.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Christmas Is All Around Again,"Love Actually is too long. Love Actually has too many stories going on for it all to gel properly. Love Actually is also weirdly brilliant in ways i didn't expect.Bill Nighy's Rocker is great and him and Gregor Fisher play off of each other perfectly. Their scene towards the end when Nighy goes to spend Christmas with him is done wonderfully and is a great pay off to their story.Liam Neeson's story is ok and gets maybe a bit too much attention but wins you over by the end. It's rather sad to watch it back to know what would happen to Natasha Richardson a few years later.The Keira Knightley story isn't given much time and the passing of time hasn't been kind to Andrew Lincoln's pursue of her either, rather cretinous actually.Laura Linney isn't given much to do for the first half of the film but in the second half it becomes a bit of a heartbreaker. Her last scenes, first with her brother and then at the office with Rodrigo Santoro are deeply moving and Laura Linney pulls these off amazingly, one of the best actresses around.The worst story of the bunch is Colin Firth's which is basically just fodder and ends a bit over the top with the whole village following him to propose to Lucia Moniz.Kris Marshall's Story & Martin Freeman & Joanna Page's are just there for a few chuckles not much to see, both mildly amusing.Hugh Grant's Prime Minister grew on me as the story progressed and it was good to see Martine McCutcheon again, it was a sweet story with a nice ending to top it off.The showpiece of the whole movie however is Alan Rickman & Emma Thompson. Revolving around whether or not Rickman is going to/or has had an affair, it is a powerful story and with 2 heavyweight actors portraying it, it is a marvellous tale, the best of the bunch by far. All it takes is a glance or a nod from either of them to perfectly portray how they are feeling at any given moment. Such a shame Alan Rickman passed away as it would be great to see what became of their characters.Understandably, a christmas classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love Actually has become my favorite Christmas Movie!!!!,"This movie is funny, sad, and full of wonderful music. The actors are the best Britain has to offer. Some American actors also, but the British guys are gorgeous...Liam Neeson...OMG....Hugh Gran!!! Colin Firth...can it get any better than that!!!The movie begins at an airport then goes out to several couples and their troubles/happiness. The acting and music is awesome, puts you in a good mood.I can't get enough of it. Its so well made, the Director did a BRILLIANT job and I would like to than him personally...THANK YOU!!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Sometimes good but too many insipid stories,"It's a multi-storyline movie about love. It opens on an airport arrival. It's a promising start. At least, it's a rare place to start, and it's a great place for love and reunion. Then it goes on to talk about 9-11. The calls from the people are almost always one of love rather than hate. It's a heighten call to action for a simple rom-com. They want to show that love is most powerful emotion.I like some of the stories. Mostly I found them formulaic and nothing original. However I am profoundly distracted by Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister. He is still playing the same character as his other movies which makes the Prime Minister too silly. For a movie with such a vast cast, there must be somebody more fitting to be the PM.The saddest thing about this movie is that it may have inspired more of these multi-storyline love stories. Only they are getting more and more insipid. If a love story is good enough, it should be able to fill a whole movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You cannot not love it,"I mean, this isn't the greatest movie of all time, sure. But it has that certain something. I love it. This film has made me cry hundreds of times now, and I've only seen it about 2 dozen or so times, and I plan to watch a hundred times more. This is real life love. It's unexpected, hard, innocent... I strongly recommend watching this film when feeling happy, feeling low, feeling desperate and feeling alone, overcrowded, sinking and exhausted, joyous, merry and ... actually, whenever. I like movies that seem so effortless and natural, and this is it.The cast is brilliant and the story is great. I don't think you won't be able to connect to it because it is relatable as hell. We've all been through it. Such a sweet, sweet movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love is all around,"this is the best film of love after the titanic which I have ever seen every single minute of this movie teaches about love and all the love stories are fantastic to watchwell as we know that love is blind and this movie tells us that love can be everywhere for no reason ,sometime is wrong or right but we can say that everything is fair in love....my favorite love story is the Portugal one,love has no language to explain,second favorite is the workers of making film they doing all the thing but after that they will fall in love,third favorite is the video recording friend of peter as we can't predict that he can love his friend's wife...and we can't miss that the prime minister can dancei see this movie on every Christmas eve....because Christmas is all around and love is all around..cheers...",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
connection of the life with others,"Is it only me realising every Christmas how good Love Actually actually is? I believe not. nowadays, its hard to see a film which has more than a story worth mentioning and more than a few character. That what i do love about this film, you've got all those people and backgrounds and classes and visions; also such emotions like hate, fun, friendship, trust, lust, lost and love melted within a cleverly simplified story telling. And it has the great choice of cast , (well except a few of them )i believe this film should be listed in modern times classics, it's over the time, congrats everyone who participated this such a lovely film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The movie makes you feel all cosy and cuddly from the inside. Love Actually is one movie you'll actually love!,"With charming cast, beautiful selection of songs, sweet romantic stories of five couples, perfect background scenery, the movie makes you feel like any romantic movie is supposed to make you feel- cosy and cuddly from the inside. It's a story about different kinds of love, and how the lives of ten people move forward because of the spirit of Christmas, for it is the time to be with the people you love.It is a fun, cute and emotional movie. Love Actually (2003), directed and written by Richard Curtis, has a mix of feelings at places unexpected and all sorts of love explored. Love of companionship of a famous singer for his chubby manager, a craze of American girls for boys with an English accent, unrequited love for one's best friends' wife, agony of innocent love of a six or seven year old for his classmate, love of a caring sister for his unwell brother, the love between two people who do not understand each other's language, the movie is a great watch at Christmas time, or otherwise!The movie has a lot going on from the moment it begins, but manages to give time to and capture each story without making it seem hurried or cluttered, like New Year's Eve (2011) with a similar plot by Garry Marshall.Soothing and at the right pace, the background music keeps the romance, tension, urgency, love or fun alive at appropriate moments. Olivia Olson's ""All I want For Christmas is You"", ""God Only Knows"" by The Beach Boys at the very end, and ""Both Sides Now"" by Joni Mitchell are a few of the many perfectly-suited-to-the-scene songs in the movie. Also, when The Silent Night plays in the background, the movie reaches an epiphany, heartening moment. Another movie with an absolutely amazing playlist selection is Morning Glory.Any and every scene is no less than a picture-postcard picture. Beautiful scenery, Christmas décor and celebrations and the royal houses, etc would remind you of the picturesque scenes of Serendipity.One of the airport scenes at almost the end reminds me of the ending of Chalte Chalte, though there are more than a dozen movies with a cliché-d airport ending. But not to spoil it for you, this one is much different, and definitely better and comic, at the very least.The cast selection is profound. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, the couple who reminds everyone of the most romantic and girly movies of all times, based on Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary raises the expectations from them even higher. Keira Knightley portrays beautifully a character of a girl unaware of her husband's best friend's love for her. Emma Thompson comes across as a very believable character and Rowan Atkinson as Rufus, is remembered despite just his two, but very important to the plot, scenes. Thomas Sangster as a small kid of just 6 or 7 years old plays the character beautifully and stays in our hearts.This one, in high resolutions, is definitely worth occupying a large chunk of your hard drive.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I'm grateful to Richard Curtis,"I would consider myself a lifelong fan of Richard Curtis, from Not the Nine O'clock News and Blackadder to Four Weddings & a Funeral and, of course, without a doubt his greatest work IMO, the 1991 telefeature Bernard & the Genie. So naturally, his next feature is always eagerly anticipated by yours truly, especially when he finally makes the big step from writing to directing. All I can say is, I am extremely grateful for this film.I'm grateful to him because he has produced another gem. A funny and touching, sentimental film that really puts one in the Christmas mood. The difference between this and his other films is that it contains numerous different stories (I haven't had time to count them all), rather than just the simple love story between two main protagonists with several supporting characters and subplots. They're all intertwined, very loosely it has to be said, but it doesn't really matter, since they're all sweet tales and I loved all of the characters in one way or another. Despite the limited time spent on each one, we get a fair insight into the characters and their lives.The cast is wonderful, and Curtis does wonderful things with them. Neeson, Rickman, Thompson, Grant, and Firth all give very fine and sympathetic performances. Bill Nighy is hilarious as an ageing rock star out to grab publicity for his awful new song. And of course, a special personal mention must go to the short but sweet Martin Freeman/Joanna Page story, since for me it's wonderful to see Martin finally get the girl and be happy after seeing him strike out in love in two series of ""The Office"".I'm also grateful to Richard Curtis simply because the film is predictable. Like so many other romantic comedies, it just wouldn't work if it weren't. If he tried to stretch the boundaries, cross borders and experiment; If, for example, every story didn't end on a high note with everyone falling in love and hugging and kissing, we'd feel ripped off, surely? It does what it's supposed and what it promises to do, and not only that, but it does that many times over, in the same film.Plus I'm grateful that he didn't resort to hackneyed ideas; every story has its own journey, and although we know the direction it will eventually take, there is enough winding in the path along the way to keep us interested. There are also no cheap laughs; towards the end of the film there is a scene where a character looks through a glass pane at another character below. I was terrified that Curtis may ruin the film by inserting yet another cheap sendup of the church scene from ""The Graduate"" but he didn't. For that I'm grateful.So basically, I'm grateful because he's given us yet another brilliant film. One to amuse and one to touch us. If you're a fan of 'warm' then this is definitely a film for you. It may be just like every other romantic comedy, but with one important factor; it's undoubtably one of the best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"good, actually","Here is a rare bird in my cinema landscape. I really am no great fan of good-feeling movies or romantic comedies, but this Christmas film really succeeded to make me feel good, and romantic. Sure, Richard Curtis is one of the best directors in this genre, certainly the best British one, but it takes a pound of courage to engage in such a deprecated genre and a bunch of talent to get out with a cued piece of work like this one.Multiple stories movies are often brought to screen in the last few years. To be successful you need not only for each story to be simple and credible, but you also need a script that gives enough individuality and weight for each of the segments, and a good director that brings everything to look like one piece of work, more like a good composer combines different orchestra sections in a symphony. Al these are present here, and moreover, a brilliant cast, including half of the who's who list of romantic comedy actors, and still allowing a few of them to do memorable creations, especially Bill Nighty in the aged rock star role. Hugh Grant is the only one who seems slightly mis-cast, and this is not because he is not a good romantic actor, but because he looks too young and unsure for a British Prime Minister to be believed.'Love actually' will be on the holidays seasons TV schedules for many years, and for a change will be the one movie on the list that will not cause me switch channels.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of my favorites,"I watched this once on DVD and later bought my own copy because I liked it so much. I love that there are so many different relationships in the film with so many people interconnected. There are relationships you can relate to, ones you can't understand and others that make you cry. The movie explores all facets of love, physical, emotional, unrequited love, unending love, young love, forbidden love, etc. etc. Set around a background of Christmas, and some might call it a holiday movie, but I find it something to watch any time of year. It does have a R rating because of language and nudity, it does have a massive star filled cast. It is not a romantic movie, nor is it even close to reality. It is a Hollywood, over the top, almost everyone gets their happily-ever-after production. But for a small period of time, I can sit back, watch people blunder around like we do in real life, and then without all the normal life stuff that gets in your way, live happily ever after(mostly.) And since I like the ability to escape every now and then, this fits the bill.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Have you ever just been drawn into a movie?,"Every now and then one comes across a movie which just enthralls. It doesn't particularly have to be the greatest movie, it really doesn't need to have the best plot, it may have actors you don't relate to in any way, but for some unknown reason you just can't seem to drag yourself away from it.Love Actually is a great movie at drawing in people. I've seen it a number of times, and at various locations from the cinema to DVD to commercial television, I've watched it with various people and alone and it just seems to have a certain charm which is hard to put a finger on.The stories are laced together through a number of various scenes and they all seem to come together perfectly in the end. Not every story has a happy ending, but then again life isn't always about a happy ending is it? I don't know what people expect from this movie that has an amazing cast and a number of cameo appearances from equally talented stars but take it for what it is, a clever insight into life and all its quirks......I won't give away any plot lines but just keep an eye out for Keira Knightley who in a particularly revealing moment has the most amazing facial expressions that in an instant show what makes this movie so special. :) R.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Missing scenes of  Bernard (William Wadham) in DVD version are a disappointment,"I loved this movie when it came out and I recently viewed it on DVD and laughed all over again. Each actor is excellent in his role. Bill Nighy still stands out. And to see Martin Freeman (the Hobbit, Sherlock's Dr. Watson) in an early role is delightful. I was so impressed with the younger actors too. They have certainly matured in the last 12 years. ONE DISAPPOINTING FACT: I simply adored the scenes with young Bernard (William Wadham). This little guy can ACT. He and his 'mom' Karen (Emma Thompson) cover a young man's need to fit into society, and overcome his insecurities at home and at school.But in the DVD version his scenes had been deleted. What a disappointment! Please put them back.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very appropriate for these days,"My god! What a wonderful movie! Very nice and charming and well edited.  The material closed perfect. Well acted.  I hated Hugh Grant but in this movie, he acted wonderfully.  Very good Alan Rickman!! But the 10 year old boy, you know, touched my heart.  Well Christmas is coming in 10 days and I will be waiting.  Of course, could be a fairy tale.  But I believe, I believe in love.  So does this movie.  Wonderful!  9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
