A simple yet thrilling adventure film,"The unique plot combined with the great acting skills of John Krasinski and Emily Blunt that creates a mysterious atmosphere and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Actor, co-writer and director John Krasinski seems to understand this thoroughly, and the result is an unnerving film. The premise is intriguing - in the near future, humans are viciously hunted down by mysterious creatures equipped with a heightened sense of sound. Their only known weakness is that they are blind.Krasinski uses this to create a dreadful sense of atmosphere throughout the film. The rules that exist in this universe are established early on with minimal exposition. After all, the characters can't communicate with each other openly. Additionally, since very little is known about these creatures, this film smartly implements one of the fundamental rules of the genre - the fear of the unknown. This setup pushes the family to invent creative ways to survive. The cast is minimal - besides Krasinski, Emily Blunt plays his wife, and their real-life chemistry translates brilliantly. Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds play two of their children. Being a deaf actress, Millicent is the perfect choice to star in this mostly silent film, and her authentic performance stands out along with Blunt who showcases her impressive acting range. Horror, in particular, only works if you're invested in the characters, and this cast absorbs you into their terrifying world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Don't chew loud.,"In a few words: smart, entertaining, novel and intense thriller movie. Beautiful cinematography and excellent acting from the kids and Emily Blunt. Nice one for John Krasinksi directing and writing.Overall, throughout the film there's excellent timing in deploying tropes. All the tropes are classic 101 cinematic thriller tropes, so there's nothing really new or anything you haven't seen before BUT the build up to each of these scenes, which gets supported greatly by the combination of the sound editing and the camera work, creates excellent tension.Its predictable and unpredictable at the same time. And I guess that's the novelty in this film.Add to all that great photography, cinematography and good acting and you can have an amazing cinematic experience.Try eating popcorn while watching this...The hype was right, this is a thrilling film.10/10 for the fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Not so much a horror movie as an edge of your seat thriller,"I rarely write a review, but when I saw the negative reviews claiming the positive reviews must be bots I felt it was time. Yes, there is a lot of sub-titling. The folks often had to be silent. How else are you going to convey what's going on? Do the complainers never see a foreign language film?Granted, we don't know why the creatures are there, but is that necessary for the story? I didn't walk away unsatisfied without that answer. It really didn't seem to be that important. This was a story about a family's struggle to survive in circumstances very few would make it through.The tension in this movie was incredible. I felt a kinship with the family I don't often feel. I see 30-40 movies a year. This was one of the best I've seen in a few months. I'll be going to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Welcome to the most overrated horror movie of the last years...,"First, and with justice, the best horror movie for me, in years and in my opinion still is 2014 ""It follows"" .The movie is too short , the story is too fast, like others wrote here it has too many plot holes, it lacks intensity,atmosphere,sound editing and cinematography..it lacks a great Director...John Krasinski is only an average actor
and a inexperienced and basic Director, the rest is only hype and marketing..Save your money, you can save it by seeing it outside movie theaters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Tense!,"A Quiet Place starts with racking up the tension which doesn't let up in a nerve shredding 1hr 25. The premise is simple, we get no back story as to why the family have to stay silent, but within 5 minutes with an unexpected moment we can see what the consequence of making noise is. From then on our focus is on this one family as they strive to stay safe in what seems like a helpless situation. 
I enjoyed this film immensely. I found it to be nerve shredding and so tense to watch i had to try catch my breath a few occasions as i had been holding it so long. It is the silence for a majority of the film that makes this work and i was grateful for a silent cinema hall (this i will go back to) I found myself caring for the characters (rare in horror) and hoping for a positive outcome. It also doesn't suffer from an overlong run time and imo is not for the mostpart predictable.Those who like a decent movie monster i feel will be pleasantly surprised i believe as well.
Those who are looking for gory in your face horror may struggle to engage and i think coming back to my point earlier if you end up in a hall full of restless noisy people filling the silence the tension will somewhat be lost. 
A solid 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Quiet Place: As good as they say,"A Quiet Place was critically acclaimed and for some reason that tends to mean I won't like it. No idea why I just don't tend to follow the unwashed masses when it comes to movies, I am however mistaken sometimes.Starring real life married couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, also directed by the latter this highly original horror got my attention from the get go and held it throughout.It tells the story of a post apocalyptic world that has been torn apart by mysterious creatures that find their prey exclusively through sound. It follows one family as they try to survive in absolute silence.The fact there is such little dialogue or really any form of audio is how A Quiet Place finds its identity. I'm not saying it hasn't been done before but it hasn't on quite this scale and it works considerably better than you'd imagine.The cast are great, the cinematography is fantastic and the story is really well put together. To add to this I think A Quiet Place is genuinely one of the most tension filled movies I've ever seen, I squinted, I cringed, I clenched my fist, on sat on the edge of my seat multiple times throughout.A Quiet Place deserves the critical acclaim, though it's not perfect it is however an absolute triumph and a real spectacle. Certainly one of those ""Movies to see before you die"" types.If you haven't seen it yet, do something about that.The Good:Very engrossingWell actedHighly originalSo incredibly tense in placesThe Bad:Just a couple of poorly thought out momentsThings I Learnt From This Movie:Kids are a liabilityKids shouldn't be trusted with anything everKids suck",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Incredibly effective despite small problems,"Im a huge John Kasinski fan so I may be slightly biased, but in his directorial debut I believe him to have constructed one of the most tense and effective movies I've seen in a long time.This movie is not without its flaws in logic and plot, but in what it attempts to do, it's incredibly successful.From start to end I was on edge of my seat. There were very few moments where I wasn't guessing what was going to come next or what could potentially happen to one of the characters.In a sea of horror films this day and age that rely on setup, gimmicky jump-scares, this movie stands out, much like Don't Breathe, as an exercise of your patience and nerves. It slightly peels away and shreds your emotions as the film progresses.This attempt makes me truly excited for John's potential future in filmmaking because of his ability to play the audience and draw reactions from them. It was truly nearly a masterful performance by both he and Emily and should not go unappreciated by the niche horror audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Overrated,"I wanted to watch this because of all the hype, but I think this movie is a bit overrated. The first half is quite boring and a bit over dramatic (they're making nominal noise so why can't they whisper?). The second half is much better, once the action hyped up. But overall I didn't think the characters were well developed, the storyline was dull and lacked flow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Too many plot holes,"There were too many plot holes. The answer was too easy to figure out. Also, it's pretty damn obvious how to confuse, defeat these creatures in a multiple of ways.

However, if you're looking for a scary adventure and you don't care much about the science then you may enjoy this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Shadows Suppressed & Muted...,"There's a world where those with voices can't be heard, where noises remove choices - summon the sword, that comes down against dissent, filled with anger and ferment, culling all upon detection, once they're stirred. It's a battle that has raged throughout our time, when upper hands, take their advantage, as they've climbed - despots, tyrants and dictators, oppress , control, remove contesters, against the minds who'd seek to challenge, their fixed line.A wonderful piece of filmmaking that parallels the persecution suffered by so many over the years, and the ways the oppressed have found to stay concealed and fight for what they believe is worth fighting for. Great performances all round.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
An Eternally Tense Thriller,"I'll be honest, when I saw the trailer, I felt like it showed the whole movie, assuming that the birth scene would be the finale of the film, but it happens less than half way through the film and the film had so much more to offer. It was eternally intense thriller that kept me and everyone else in the theater on the edge of their seats. I was also worried that the film wouldn't effectively portray the silence and intensity, boy was I wrong, the films quietness and also the way it was filmed gave a true sense of uncertainty and fear. I'll be honest not all the scares got me, but several of them did, and did very effectively, especially considered I am a horror veteran. I found the pacing and intensity to be very effect and kept me on the edge of my seat. And reacting to the audience reactions, everyone else was more scared than I am.Not only the horror aspect was good, but the dynamic between the family is also very well done. You truly feel like this was a family that love each other and John Krazinski and Emily Blunt do a wonderful job portraying not only the love between mother and father as well as the true love between parents and their children. The bad and good dynamic of children on their parents is on full display as well as the constant fear of protecting our children. The cinematography was great, it only added to the tense feeling in scenes, I found many of the shots to be unique and well shot. The monsters were bad ass as hell and are definitely scary, not only what they do but what they look like.I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Unrealistic nonsense,"This movie tries to be suspense horror, but it's impossible to relate to anyone or take anything seriously because nothing in the movie is realistic and it's not even internally consistent with its own rules. The monsters themselves are not consistent - in the beginning they snatch they boy faster than a speeding bullet, but at the end of the movie they turn into slow, bumbling idiots who spend most of the time just growling at humans.The monsters are sensitive to sound, and this one family are the only ones in the entire city who figured it out. They are also the only ones who figured out that you can kill monsters by shooting them. But they weren't smart enough to put some noise generator in their house to silence their own sounds. Whatever. And they're still planning their next child during a monster apocalypse.The birth scene while a monster was walking nearby was one of the most stupid and cringeworthy scenes I ever seen, it almost felt like a parody of a horror movie. Are you trying to tell me the monster didn't hear THAT? And they can hear a toy from some miles away? I could go on and on about the nonsense in this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining,"Do not listen to cynical reviews it is from people who are so egotistical that they can't watch a movie and just live in the fantasy and story that your watching.Shade aside this film was absolutely fantastic my girlfriend loves horror films and 9 out 10 times I refuse to watch it because it looks so terrible or I do watch it and it is indeed terrible but on the odd occasion I'll see a trailer for something that looks like it could be a pretty cool story line, this was so much more than that! Way better than I had expected. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time with my jaw hanging from the suspense.Reminded me of 'hush' from Netflix but it has si-fi monsters which usually puts me off but it's not super wacky so you can kind of go along with it. Deserves 10/10 because the actors were great it was cool to watch and a bit different with the lack of dialogue made the room feel empty and so easy to imerse in there suspense, I left the cinema feeling totally satisfied.

Unnerving silence,"'A Quiet Place' very quickly became one of my most anticipated films of the year. Have liked Emily Blunt a lot in other things, have a lot of appreciation for the genre and absolutely adored the concept. One of the year's best concepts and one of the most brilliant and unique for any film.Seeing it, 'A Quiet Place' turned out to be one of my favourites of the year too, its positive critical reception more than deserved. Can understand though if it doesn't work for others, it is not a film that everybody will enjoy with its deliberate pace, very sparse use of music and dialogue and heavy reliance on atmosphere. Have seen many films recently that have wasted good potential and ideas or not quite fulfilling them. So it was refreshing and a blessing to have such a brilliant and unique concept executed in a way that was equally brilliant and as a film unlike any other seen by me.Was far too transfixed by the atmosphere and mood to criticise 'A Quiet Place' for lack of logic, plot holes (have never criticised a film for plot holes, find it a lazy and unfair criticism especially when it's the only thing mentioned in reviews that list them and say nothing about the film's overall quality) or not making complete sense. When a film doesn't transfix or engage me it is less forgivable, but 'A Quiet Place' was utterly transfixing from start to finish from personal view.It's a beautifully made film with a lot of style and atmosphere. Not everybody will like that the use of dialogue and music is sparse. That wasn't a problem for me, in fact it was appreciated and it worked really well. Actually think it was the right thing to do. Without constant music, the concept and atmosphere came through stronger, if the music was intrusive, obvious or repetitive they would not have worked anywhere near as well.Without constant dialogue, it let the actors' expressions and body language do all the talking, have seen horror/sci-fi films, and films in general actually, recently that have suffered from too much talk and exposition that it bogs the pace down and it's even more of a problem when the dialogue isn't good or interesting. Appreciated hugely that 'A Quiet Place' didn't go down that route.Luckily the acting benefits from having little dialogue, here it's a masterclass of expressions speaking louder than words. Emily Blunt is simply sensational in a very moving and expressive performance that is among her best. Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe also impress in beyond their years performances that one doesn't actually expect from actors so young. So does John Krasinki in a performance just as expressive, in a subtle way, and charismatic. In the director's chair, he shows a lot of confidence and great talent for mood and storytelling.Especially good about 'A Quiet Place' is the atmosphere, which smoulders from every frame and shapes every part of the story. The pace is a deliberate slow-burn but for me it was never dull. Parts of 'A Quiet Place' are heartfelt, others are quirky. But above all it's genuinely scary and unnerving, enhanced by tremendous use of sound design that generates unbearable tension. The monsters are incredibly nightmarish, actually takes a lot for me to feel unsettled after watching a film since getting older, 'A Quiet Place' did that for me.Overall, a superb film and one of my favourites of the year so far. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Great movie. amazing acted & made,"'A Quiet Place' is a somewhat post-apocalyptic thriller co-written, directed, and starring John Krasinski with his real-life wife Emily Blunt. The pair and their three kids (not-real life) are up against a villain who really doesn't like noise. The sound design is some of the best in recent time. The sound and sometimes (often) lack there of make this movie. Krasinski shoots to precision with a pretty good story to match. Are there a few inconsistencies? Yes, but there is never a time this movie lost my attention. Your nerve will be challenged and your skin may crawl, but don't let that stop you from watching this riveting feature. Final Score: 9/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Predictable, but interesting",I probably would have given this movie an 8 or a 9 if it weren't for the story. There were some predictable moments as well as some stupid and unrealistic moments involving the main characters.However the visual acting was really good and the directing was great for someone with little to no directing experience.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"After reading reviews here, I'm convinced some sad people watch a movie with a notepad!!","Yes, a notepad, so they can write down all of the plot holes and things to get on this website and chew up a movie....(sigh and shake my head)....gees, this world is becoming such a depressing place when folks don't even know how to watch a movie and be entertained anymore. 
My family and I watched this movie last night. It was scary and the tension was unbearable. We had chocolate chip cookies and sit in the dark and watched and enjoyed the suspense and was entertained..yes, it was entertaining! 
It was not the best I've ever seen. It had some things that even me and my family wondered outloud...'Hey, why did they..??' 
But gees people, quit taking freakun notes and watch the dadgum movie and be entertained. If you are so caught up in plot holes and unrealistic elements, you will never be entertained by a movie until someone manages to come up with a movie on the same level as Aliens or Shawshank Redemption or Lord of the Rings or A Few Good Men, etc. etc. 
So, forget all of the poor ol negative people in the world that doesn't have a clue about how to stop being a stinkin critic and watch a movie and be entertained and enjoy this movie for what it is. And what it is...is a real scary movie with tension and suspense that will have you tied in knots! Emily Blunt is one of the best actresses of our time and she is stellar. The rest of the cast, there are only 6 or 7 folks in the entire movie, do a good job. Special effects are great and it's a very original idea. So, thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Great movie - if you can just get passed the concept,"This is a tense scifi movie about a family trying to survive against sound tracking monsters.The film feels quite high-brow there is quite a lot going on with the characters as they try to survive against a relentless foe and the monotony of an existence where you can't even shoot the breeze.The acting, production, effects are all amazing!The aliens are ferocious, scary and look feasible.It really is a great film.There is a but coming.The concept is so out-there that it is hard to get passed it.I watched this with my girlfriend, when we should have been concerned for the characters we found ourselves having discussions about how the aliens work:Why don't the aliens run into the trees?Why don't they spend all day chasing rabbits and pigeons around?Couldn't you just throw a ringing phone in to a pit of spikes and watch them jump after it?How, if they can't see, did they overcome the worlds' armies, navies and air forces?Etc. Etc. Etc.Rather than entertaining all these questions were a bit distracting.There are some clues laying around about the aliens in the back of some shots but they just made it more confusing if anything.I recommend this, I think the concept is too strange to ""work"" but if you can get passed it then this is a great watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Very Well-Made Film that is Scary & Affecting!,"'A Quiet Place', the recent box-office & critical smash, is an achievement to envy. Especially for horror filmmakers & also the buffs. I am NOT a horror movie buff, but 'A Quiet Place' left me very impressed. This is A Very Well-Made Film that is Scary & Affecting, that is terrifying in parts & also emotionally rich in totality.'A Quiet Place' Synopsis: A family is forced to live in silence while hiding from creatures that hunt by sound.John Krasinski is in very good form. The superb actor, who helmed the very underrated 'The Hollars' sometime back, returns to the director's chair with a superlative horror offering. Krasinski along-with Bryan Woods & Scott Beck, has penned a story that's actually more about family than fear/dread. While 'A Quiet Place' is a horror film, with fear as its trump card, the Writers here, add a tremendous heft of emotions. Watching the family of Abbott's trying to survive in a world where creatures destroy humans at the tip of a sound, is heartbreaking & heart-pounding. This is a brave horror film, that remains silent for most part & creates fear in its silence. While there is some repetition here that takes away some of its glory, there's still not denying its rock-solid merit.Krasinski's Direction, also, is top-notch. He directs a scary atmosphere with genuine dread & also uses silence as one of the aces of the film. 
Cinematography by Charlotte Bruus Christensen is fantastic. Christopher Tellefsen's Editing is razor-crisp, culminating the film in 90-minutes. Art & Sound Design are marvelous. Graphics are superb. Costume Design adds authenticity to the intense proceedings.Performance-Wise: Emily Blunt & Krasinski excel. Blunt, one of the finest actresses of our times, expresses fear, grief & courage, with complexity & remarkable conviction. Krasinski is wonderfully restrained & portrays his part admirably. Millicent Simmonds & Noah Jupe are top-notch.On the whole, 'A Quiet Place' is a really good horror film, that is also affecting. Go, get spooked!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Quiet Place (2018),"I think the trailer for this film interested a mass majority of movie goers. The film looked like it took place in a post apocalyptic future where humans have to go through a lot just for survival. the most remarkable thing was how quiet the trailer was, the use of silence seemed effective. I was also interested in seeing John Krasinski handle a major studio horror film. I watched The Hollars but I felt like this was Krasinski's time to make a big wave.The film is about a family who live in solitude with their son and their deaf daughter. They must be careful to be absolutely quiet as there is something that lurks in the shadows and waits to hear sound to prey and attack. They must find a way to not only survive but work on a way to defeat what they are being hunted by. The film stars and is directed John Krasinski and real life wife. The great Millicend Simmonds (who is deaf in real life and also wonderful in Wonderstruck) is also in it.The film uses silence so excellently. The film is dead quiet at many times and all you hear is the effective score or natural surroundings. It creates a wonderful atmosphere. The film also packs a real emotional bunch in its short duration length which was surprising. The performances are spot on. I can't help but point out (as many people already have) how stupid it is to have a baby in this type of environment. Makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from that, the film is worth your time.The film manages to live up to expectations and also exceeds them in other ways. The film is fairly original and interesting, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. You want to know so much; not all the questions are answered but I really appreciate Krasinski and company's ambition to go a different route with a horror film and deliver a really solid film that is fun, absorbing, and even has heart. I think John Krasinski finally has something good in his hands.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Not worth the hype.,"I went into 'A Quiet Place' expecting to leave absolutely terrified, but quite frankly, I left a little disappointed.AQP, like any film, has its good moments, it's creepy, it's emotional, it's dramatic and the acting is incredible (especially Emily Blunt).

Acting papers over plot holes.,"I came away from ""A Quiet Place"" thinking that I wished I'd found the film on my own, and not gone to see it following the glowing reviews it's received. It's not that it's not good, it's just that my expectation for it were too high.In the near future, the Planet has been invaded by vicious armoured creatures, who cannot see, but have acute hearing. The film takes place several months after the initial attack, and when the majority of the population has been lost. Lee Abbot (debut director John Krasinski), his wife (Emily Blunt) and their three children are surviving in near silence, in a remote farm.For his debut feature film, John Krasinski has crafted a subtle, interesting, if a little derivative science fiction horror film that reminded me of ""Signs"" and ""Pitch Black"". Tone and performance are extremely good, especially, as you might expect, from Emily Blunt, who undergoes most of the physical suffering in this story. But Millicent Simmonds deserves heaps of praise too.It's just a bit of a shame then, that in reflection it felt anticlimactical relative to the notices that it's received elsewhere. Though the need for the family to remain quiet is a fresh twist, it's a fairly straightforward story, even a little clichéd at times and as numerous others have pointed out, there are plot holes you could push a corn silo through.I wish I'd found it on my own, it would be a brilliant cult movie... but as a mainstream hit, it's a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A silent masterpiece,"This review of A Quiet Place is spoiler free**** (4/5)JUST TO THINK, it was only as recent as last year when a person would emerge from an extensive comedy background to direct a horror film - it was, of course, writer-director Jordan Peele who before his box-office breaking, Best Picture nominated debut Get Out he was known for his eccentric comedy outbursts with his co-worker and best friend Keegan-Michael Key on the Emmy winning show Key and Peele. Now - just over a year later we get John Krasinski who like Peele is known for various comedy shows (most notably The Office USA) and his latest film A Quiet Place - which, in short, is a spine-tingling, nerve-shredding horror that ultimately refuses to let up from start to finish.The premise is pure monster horror - the cataclysm after these monsters have invaded is on a global scale, it's a high-concept monster movie works by simply narrowing it's focus...survival. And just as the human characters (what about the monsters? We'll get to them) try to muffle out the sound by shuffling sand along the floor and making their own home quiet enough to walk around, director Krasinski (who also co-stars and writes) with writers Bryan Woods and Scott Beck keep a tight-knit, all-frills locked specifically on tension that just keeps on building up and up until the ladder just can't be seen any more. Krasinski however isn't afraid to assume you already know an outcome by opening the film on the 90th day of the invasion clearly avoiding the manic-day-one tactic (where we can probably guess a lot of bad stuff happened), no, he approaches the subject with experienced characters. Paths have been set with sand, cars have been abandoned, and his house has been completely sound proofed, with carpets, sand set like stepping stones and the family only communicates by sign language.
 
Krasinski plays a competent, intelligent, desperate family man who tries to keep things together in his little kingdom (an abandoned farm house) instantly knowing that even the most negligible dropped clanger will attract terrifying toothsome, long-armed creatures with avocado -shaped skulls which are entirely composed by inner-ear architecture and teeth morphing their heads to hear even the slightest of sounds. Are they aliens? Are they vampires? Or possibly alien vampires (if you want to go creepy)? If indeed the characters had abstract conversations, maybe they'd wonder what they're being hunted by but instead they can only express the barest essential dialogue in order to survive as long as possible. While he pays off as the caring rather rugged survivalist keeping a slight fire ready for a beacon signifying survival, meanwhile his pregnant wife (Emily Blunt) is a rather obvious symbolism of hope for the future she also tries her hardest to keep the rest of her family in check. There's a slight everyday quality to this family that happily allows for you to invest more so in their journey for survival. Though their vulnerability is heightened just that little bit more and also enriched at the fact that there's a child on the way (a newborn that doesn't quite understand the importance of staying quiet) and what they must do in the situation when Blunt is just about to have it.Happily even during those moments Krasinski still keeps A Quiet Place original for example what do you do if you don't hear the monsters coming? Well, there's an answer for that here as the eldest daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds) is deaf so she can't hear the monsters coming and for that it's intensity is heightened. It's a film that just refuses to let up, and why should it? In short, Krasinski is already a well-known comedian and who knows it may even end up being like Get Out.
 
VERDICT Originally nightmarish and a genuinely tense horror which just doesn't let up and by removing the sound it genuinely makes things that bump in the night so much louder. Horror at its best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Wanting to nitpic at every little thing just takes away from the true feeling the story is meant to envoke.

"A Perfect Marriage of Silence, Drama and Monsters.","While most post-apocalyptic horror is very familiar about people trying to survive in a bleak setting, A Quiet Place brings a refreshing twist to it. After 89 days, the last remnants of humanity, particularly a single family, have survived by living a literal quiet existence. If a single word is said or the slightest noise is made, mysterious blind creatures will hear it even from a distance and will come to slaughter them. They are near indestructible, and impossible to outrun so hiding with sign language in the place of talking is the absolute means of survival.Similar with Jordan Peele's directing debut in Get Out, John Krasinski uses his comedic experiences in timing to nail the build-up to suspenseful moments and well-used jump scares. By excluding dialogue mostly from the story, the quietness of the scenes leaves you in fear of any sound being made. Krasinski uses his sharp focus with the camera and the amazing sound design to turn everyday objects into instruments of chaos when they draw the attention of the creature's effective hearing. Not since 2016's Don't Breathe and Hush has a horror movie been this effective with idea of sound. Along with Bryan Woods and Scott Beck that he co-wrote with, Krasinski does not let what little verbal dialogue there is to be wasted on exposition. Instead he uses certain visuals to allow the audience to understand the history and rules of the world made effective with the haunting cinematography by Charlotte Hans Christensen (Molly's Game). The limited conversations that do happen are based around characters connecting and rebuilding relationships.The part of the movie that affected me the most was actually the family drama. From the very start, the film establishes this is a loving and caring family that is negatively impacted by the lack of speaking about their problems that is reinforced by a recent tragedy. While casting your wife in your movie may seem lazy, the fact Krasinski's wife is Emily Blunt makes it justified. The performance Blunt gives as the mother Evelyn is truly astounding with the range of emotion she gives to her character especially with the situation she is in. Complimenting her is Krasinski's own performance as the protective and well-planned father Lee struggling to connect with his kid. When you get these two together in a scene, you feel their real connection as a married couple and parents bring emotional weight to this very bleak and sad story. 
The beating heart of this story though really is Milicient Simmonds as the deaf oldest daughter Reagan. Being deaf in real life, Simmonds uses that experience to bring this tremendous arc to her character. While the creatures have a heightened sense of hearing, Reagan lives the opposite unfortunately. The inability to hear without a working hearing aid puts a strain on the relationship with her family, particularly with her father for other certain reasons. Noah Jupe as the younger son Marcus also stands out by bringing a sense of fear that feels real for a child living in a very threatening world. When the two children are separated from their parents due to a domino effect of catastrophic events, they learn to take matters into their own hands to keep their family alive.While the design of the creatures (made by ILM) feels a bit familiar, Krasinski's execution is what makes them truly terrifying in a very unique way. The Jaws method of holding back the creature's full reveal allows the use of sound and flashes of their blinding speed to build their presence. When creatures come out in full view within the third act they are used effectively in many great Jurassic Park-inspired set pieces especially when they show the giant ear canals hidden within their eye-less heads. But what makes the creatures impactful is what their unknown origin represents; the fear of the unknown taking away those you love. Krasinski has stated his reasons for taking on this project were driven by the responsibility he feels as a parent in real life. And A Quiet Place's monster element reinforces those themes he as a father connects to such as mentoring, protecting your child and making the sacrifices needed to ensure their own future.A Quiet Place is a perfect marriage of family drama and creature survival horror that creates a brilliant thriller that truly embraces its original concept from beginning to end. While it is not immune to some characters making a few predictable horror movie decisions they are easily forgiven for what it achieves in the end. A Quiet Place will fill you with fear and sadness but by the conclusion you will feel awarded with an excellent sense of satisfaction from the experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The Silence gets you! The Acting captivates you!,"A Quiet Place Review: As genres go, horror is particularly challenging to crack. It's easy to resort to cheap scares to get audiences jumping out of their seats. On the other hand, it takes an evolved set of storytelling skills to make them genuinely uncomfortable and fearful for the events unfolding onscreen. Actor, co-writer and director John Krasinski seems to understand this thoroughly, and the result is an unnerving film. The premise is intriguing",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Shame it wasn't better,"What a shame. This film could have been so much more, a short film that throws you straight in at the deepend then just drops off, the threat is not really explained wel enough for me & some of the choices are farcical! It was okay, maybe I should have seen I'm the cinema to get full affect but Birdbox was better for me 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Very Enjoyable!,"The premise of this film was very unique in the fact that the characters involved in the movie were forced to live life in constant fear of making noise in the high possibility that seemingly unstoppable, unknown creatures would kill them. In fact, the driving force of the movie was silence in general; almost making it an actual character in its own right.The movie also focuses on the characters and their interactions with each other throughout this dangerous post-apocalyptic world of theirs. They had to change their daily routines like walking barefoot everywhere, and using sand to muffle their movements as they move throughout the environments around them. And since they are unable to speak, the actors rely primarily on facial expressions and body posture to tell their stories, and I feel that they greatly succeeded in this.Some aspects of the film did seem to be unexplained like how they were able to provide electricity for themselves (whether or not they used a generator or not, and if so, was it being stored in a sound proof area?), how the creatures were able to get to the characters within a minute of making a noise (they lived in a large wooded area with miles of foliage around them, but the creatures would always be within a few hundred yards of them to get their so quickly), and where the creatures came from. The last one I did not mind at all though however since it was left for audience speculation and it forced the movie to focus on the characters instead of the creatures.One thing I would hear from people coming out from the theaters was, ""why didn't they just sound proof the entire home or have shelters made for that purpose?"" Where that would be beneficial, having creatures of that caliber where they can hear noises from football field lengths away, any amount of loud sound could attract them to that position and put the people working on the project in immediate danger. The film worked on that idea well where they were able to create a sound proof room, but it took them a while of painstaking cautiousness and care so they would be safe from danger.The biggest thing I enjoyed though was the films expert usage of suspense. Good horror/thriller films will use suspense to build tension in an audience member and give a release of that tension in the form of a scare. But this film would demonstrate scenes where tension would be built, but then nothing, or barely anything, would happen. But then soon afterword there would be an immediate action that would occur, and the movie used this technique infrequently. This made it more difficult to tell when something would happen, and it ensured there was not a traditional formula being used.Overall, A Quiet Place was a lot of fun to watch and the entire time throughout I and everyone around me would be very tense to the point where you could hear the slightest cough or whisper from a few rows away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

It's NOT a MOVIE. It's an EXPERIENCE.,"While watching the movie, I heard a gush of air and it took me a moment to realize its not coming from the movie. It was indeed coming me.

That's what I thought when I walked into the Movies, that I had ""Seen It All"" and I couldn't have been more wrong. Its sucks you in as its and doesn't let go until the credits roll.I could throw around phrases/words like ""nothing like anything"", ""classic masterpiece"", ""mind blowing"", ""mesmerizing"" etc..etc.. But nothing I could say or write is going to do this movie justice. As awesome the story was, the performances from all the casts, especially Emily Blunt, made it even more captivating. And I won't even start about the background music...one word ""FANTASTIC"".There are many reviews out there calling this ""A great movie"" or ""an amazing movie"" and so and so. But for me ""A Quiet Place"" is not a movie. Its an EXPERIENCE. Particularly one every movie lover should have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The most original and special horror movie in years,"A must see experience. I already knew that the movie was getting excellent reviews, so my expectations were high for this movie, and I was shaking at the end of it. The movie is really tense and really (and surprisingly emotional) Some would argue that this is a suspenseful movie, but is actually a horror movie, but a lot of people wont se this movie like that because at this days were not used to this type of movie. The thing is that, the movie presents this family, and we care for them, and the things that they´re going through are really terrifying, so to us is terrifying as well. The performances are excellent, with the acting there is nothing more to say than incredible. Emily Blunt is the one that gives the best performance, but everyone is brilliant. Her husband (the director, co writer and star in the movie) proves that he is capable enough to take a project as interesting as this and not leave it just in interesting. The work that he does is fantastic, specially with the sound of the movie that is one of the main protagonist in the movie. I have two issues with the movie. The first is that, (this is not a spoiler) Emily Blunt´s character is pregnant, and that is not believable, not considering the situation that the characters are living, it´s true that the pregnancy stuff adds something to the movie, but still is not believable. And the second flaw that I found was the last twenty seconds of the movie. That is when you notice that the movie was produced by Michael Bay. At the end, A Quiet Place is one of the most intense and scary movies that I have seen, and I highly recommend this movie, I can say that the movie was an experience. And please, stay as quiet as possible in the movie, because it will not be the same if you're eating popcorn very loud, or if you're cellphone rings in the middle of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Its mission statement is suspense and it achieves that in spades.,"To say there's essentially no spoken dialogue (or very little, at least), 'A Quiet Place (2018)' tends to rely far more on telling and not showing when it comes to its non-suspense sequences, with the family using sign-language to say how they feel far more often than the flick actually shows it visually. This is probably a product of Krasinski's pass on the script, which added to the original's single line of dialogue, but this admittedly makes for a more commercial movie that keeps its heart, smarts and scares in tact while still reaching as wide an audience as possible. It's just a shame some segments seem ever so slightly 'dumbed down.' It's a good thing, then, that the suspense sequences truly are some of the best, most suspenseful and, incidentally, most visual of recent years. Each set-piece plays the audience like a fiddle and expertly ratchets up the tension using the piece's phenomenal core conceit and brilliantly restrained central techniques. The mission statement clearly is suspense, over overt gore or unearnt scares, and the piece achieves this tenfold. It just feels like some of the surrounding material is slightly lacking, like there's something missing that would compound the experience as something greater than it is. However, this is an extremely confident, competent and compelling effort that will put you on the edge of your seat and keep you there, even during some of its more conventional genre moments or slower segments. It makes you care for its focal family and always keeps them at the centre of its unique world. This makes the scares all the more impactful, and the affair is a focused and powerful one because of it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Fun Film,"Anxiety building film which causes you at some point in the film to decide if you should leave because of all the harsh breathing you are doing.

The cast was great, especially the older daughter. My only downfall to his is the lack of horror. The creature we see throughout the film did not terrify me to the extreme of horror. The sound effects did terrify me but not so much the monster. I feel as the monster should be more horrifying, it reminded me of a dinosaur that went bad.

10th best movie,"A Quiet place is my number tenth best movie, and number two horror movie, from my twelve years on earth. A Quiet Place is similar to Signs, but instead of being a good movie A Quiet Place is a fantastic one.The suspense is super good as it builds up from the beginning. The horror/thriller from A Quiet Place had me on the edge of my seat, the jump-scares definitely scared me, and is what made A Quiet Place incredible. The physiological drama from this movie definitely fit what was going on. And while I didn't cry from the emotion (I've only cried in two movies) It would have been amazing if I did actually cry in A Quiet Place. The action is amazing and so is the acting. Plus the idea for the movie makes for a great plot. Also I was fine with the ending because there is a number two out. Did a Quiet place have a couple mistakes: yes. But in my opinion only five movies I've ever watched didn't have mistakes and A Quiet Place is my number ten movie from my twelve years on earth.All in all A Quiet Place is a fantastic movie that I definitely recommend.

Unforgettable horror movie that also has its tender moments.,"I haven't been to a movie in over a year, mostly because of the utter lack of creativity in the film industry today. It seems the majority of movies produced are remakes, rehashes, roboots, redos, or sequels. Every movie produced is the same as all the others. The unique premise of A Quiet Place intrigued me, and the film did not disappoint. The movie kept me at the edge of my seat almost the entire time and there were surprises throughout. The fact that most of the movie was quiet or nearly so added to its power. The acting was superb.In many horror movies, there are one or a few actors who are vastly superior to the others. The poor actors are wooden, fake, and flat in their motions and dialogue. With so little dialogue in this film, the actors had to rely only on the power of their facial expressions and purposeful movements to convey their message to the viewer, and they did an excellent job of that. The movie is not a gory one. It uses psychological suspense to capture the viewer's attention. I found myself tearing up during sad moments more than once as well.If there is one point I would nitpick (and it's a minor one), I would have liked to know how these sound detecting creatures came to be. Where did they come from? For that I deducted a star, because at the end of the movie, that question remained unanswered. Other than that, it's a great film overall, and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys thrillers, good acting, and a film about the power of family.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Brilliant, intense and credible horror","How important is the sound in our lives? Well very much, we use it and more often than not abuse, just see the data growing on noise pollution that now prevails in large cities.
Even in the cinema, not even to say, the importance of sound is enormous and since it appeared in this field, during the first decades of the last century, it immediately made it clear how much it was to sweep away the silent cinema in the lap a few years.
And if there is a genre in which the appropriate use of sound is crucial, this is precisely the horror that between sudden explosions of sounds and music and shouts of all kinds, has also produced most of the soundtracks since its birth more iconic than ever. 
If the sound is important it is also the opposite, or the absence of noise, the more or less total silence, it is also a sound, paradoxically perhaps the most noisy and deafening of all.
Precisely this aspect is exploited more by ""A Quite Place"", as it did in 2007 ""Dead Silence"", but if in the second it is the silence to be scary in the first one this is used to focus the attention on every smaller sound, or rather noise so as to create an increasingly high and constant anxiety and tension, in short brilliant.
Naturally, in order to achieve this goal without the use of many sounds, we need an excellent technical department that takes care of the sound and its mix in the smallest detail, and of this ""A Quiet Place"" can boast, it is also fundamental a soundtrack quite convincing and incisive, and here Marco Beltrami does a great job realizing a disturbing and well balanced one that manages to create an atmosphere equally disturbing and in perfect harmony with the story and the timbre that the director decided to give the film .
Speaking of directing John Krasinski directs everything in an almost minimalist and certainly simplistic way: many still, clear shots, attentive to the smallest detail, to the smallest movement, particular attention is given to the environments and objects that come into contact with the family protagonist, because every contact can generate a sound and every sound here makes the difference between life and death.
Impossible not to become attached immediately and get in tune with the family protagonist, despite some stupid moves by the children, and this is due to the strong chemistry that binds each character and makes them very credible; the same couple Blunt-Krasinski works a lot, are a perfect couple, moreover their interpretations, especially that of Emily Blunt, are really remarkable and both succeed with great skill to enter the breads of his character that among other things combines very much, this also greatly influences the extreme credibility of the film.
So in ""A Quiet Place"" everything works perfectly, everything is in the right place, despite being a film extremely difficult to achieve, the result is a triumph of the genre that combines the best of today's horror with apocalyptic background with the family drama.
There are some small inconsistencies but just because small it is negligible and does not affect the film that manages to be intense until the last minute, to leave the audience with bated breath and to surprise him several times with thrilling twists.
Beautiful ending that if it had been different probably the film would have become too detached from its nature and its initial spirit; the relatively short duration proves another point in favor because if it had lasted longer it would have risked falling into repetitiveness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Relatively tame,"Since I'm not a horror movie fan, I was reluctant to watch A Quiet Place, even though I knew it was a huge hit. My best friend, however, reassured me that it was pretty tame. It was more like a thriller, and she said I could handle it. Thanks, pal! It was a pretty fun movie, and I didn't even have to hide my eyes once. To my fellow squeamish viewers, if you like Emily Blunt, you can totally handle A Quiet Place. In fact, I enjoyed it so much, I even watched the sequel.In this futuristic world, creepy aliens with gigantic internal ears attack anything that makes noise. If you talk, scream, drop a hammer, play music, or run with shoes, you'll only have a few seconds left to live before the aliens come and eviscerate you. For Emily Blunt's family, which includes her real-life husband John Krasinksi (who directed and co-wrote the film), they walk around barefoot and communicate in American Sign Language. Get ready to read a lot of subtitles. And also get ready for the worst problem ever: Emily is pregnant. How will she go into labor without screaming, and how will she coax her newborn into keeping quiet?You'll have to watch this thriller to find out. It has an interesting premise, a unique survival plan, and great camaraderie between the actors. This really isn't so much of a horror movie as it is suspenseful. The majority of the film is silent, with just breathing or slight tip-toe noises - and then all of a sudden, there will be a scream or a gunshot. If jump-scares are particularly frightening to you, though, you might need to hide behind a pillow.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

However, the movie strays from this path, and instead uses action sequences to progress the plot. The action feels out of place in what could be an incredible ""survivor horror"" movie as it ruins the tone that the first half of the film sets up. Along with the action, the movie also starts to use tried and tested cliches, which damper the unique world Krasinski was trying to create. The switch of tone causes the movie to crash and burn, as what could have been a unique movie, was instead plagued by mistakes and cliche, and don't even get me started on that end shot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
90 minutes of extreme suspense,"The opening scene in 'A Quiet Place' is one of the best I can remember in recent memory. It is perfectly crafted in every way. It would actually make a terrific little 5 minute short film all on its own. What it does so perfectly is that it sets the tone for the entire movie. The situation is made clear to the audience and then the reason for that situation is presented in brutal and compelling fashion. I was actually left with goosebumps as the title appeared on the screen. Luckily that was only the beginning of good things from what is a terrific horror movie.There's a whole bunch of early M Night. Shyamalan being channeled in this movie. In fact if you'd told me he'd written and directed it I would have had no doubt you were telling the truth. The suspense most of all. You are literally on edge from minute one and until the credits roll. Not many films can achieve that. In fact not many films can achieve any suspense these days so that just shows how impressive it is to have it there for an entire run time.The jump-scares in the movie are terrific for two reasons. First of all, they are almost all to do with the story and are genuinely things you should be jumping from. This isn't always the case, but near enough. Secondly, because of the concept of the whole movie needing to be quiet, when a sound rips across the screen it gives you much more a jolt than usual. It's something you really have to experience to know what I mean, but trust me when I say it works.I loved almost everything about this movie. It was masterfully shot (especially for such an inexperienced director), the creatures looked great and I genuinely cared about each and every character. I love films like this that work because they are proof that there is still hope for the horror genre yet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Thriller Elements, Drama and Characters All Expertly Crafted","I guess I was the odd man out in that I saw the trailers for A Quiet Place and it just didn't turn my crank. It seemed like an idea that would be tough to translate into a good movie, but the buzz was great for this and I ended up going to see it with a friend. What surprised me about A Quiet Place is how fully realized the concept was and that I couldn't find any obvious holes in the plot. Even movies I love don't always accomplish this and in a world where any form of moderate noise leads predators to you, I thought there would be the inevitable point where something would happen and I would be tempted to yell BULL$#!*. But that point never came, it just showed me the care they took in writing this script and how careful they were in making this movie work.A Quiet Place has a plot that can be summed up quickly. Aliens have invaded and wiped out a large portion of humanity. They are essentially blind, but their sense of hearing is incredibly acute, and they can hear any noise over large distances. So, the Abbott family are trying to get along in the year 2020 and are trying to rebound off the loss of a loved one. But the focus isn't on the plot, its on the characters and I thought they did an excellent job building them into people you could feel for. Lee (John Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) are good parents that do an excellent job trying to protect their kids and maintain a loving relationship with them. Regan (Millicent Simmonds) is the oldest kid who's dealing with a lot and although she's a little temperamental, you can certainly understand why. The same goes for Marcus (Noah Jupe) who is trying to get over a traumatic experience and Lee is having trouble getting him to participate in the tricky life they lead. They get you to care about these characters and I thought the dramatic parts of A Quiet Place were very emotional. The loss, pain and fear the Abbott family faces is intense and there were more than a few times I got wrapped up in the ""quiet"" moments. This doesn't mean that there aren't big moments where things come to a head. My favourite was a scene where a couple of the characters are caught in a grain silo where there is no easy escape. So, you get the best of both worlds in A Quiet Place.A dystopian future is pretty common now, we get post-apocalyptic movies and T.V. shows all the time so to get noticed, you have to do something new. Krasinski hasn't had a lot of experience directing but he and his team did a great job shooting this movie. The environment is simple in A Quiet Place, the Abbott family lives on a farm outside a small town but there wasn't a frame I didn't think the movie captured that setting beautifully. They use certain colours to convey danger and they use different parts of the farm to accent the peril of the Abbott family. Considering the low budget (approximately 17 million) they knew how to use it effectively.If you follow movies or T.V. you're familiar with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. They're both charismatic actors and they carry this movie. They excel as the protective and sensible parents and they had wonderful chemistry together (considering they're husband and wife in real life, not surprising). I also thought Millicent and Noah were solid for kid actors. They're victims of their characters but you genuinely care about their safety.This movie completely lived up to the hype. John Krasinski completely pulled off pulling triple duty here and they crafted a white-knuckle tense thriller. I would warn that while there are horror elements, its not a horror movie. The aliens have a unique design that is terrifying, and the movie knows not to overplay its hand in showing them too many times. A Quiet Place is more thrilling than scary but that's okay. I'll be visiting A Quiet Place again and although I understand the Hollywood climate to churn out sequels on anything successful, this might be better served without a sequel. They ended it on the perfect note and I think this would be more effective as a solo outing. I'd give it an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10. If you haven't seen A Quiet Place already, go check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Seat gripping.,"I spent nearly the whole film peaking out from under my jacket, with my breath held - it's been ages since I've seen something to wonderfully thrilling. The tension is the product of some really exceptional photography, and awesome sound design that really wields silence. Inevitable comparisons to HUSH will arise, but I thought A QUIET PLACE made different, refreshing choices - the score is present, throughout, and you are given places where you feel comfortable shifting in your seat, and eating popcorn.Notably, there are places where eating popcorn seem utterly deafening. Or, as my theater had to deal with, if someone two seats behind you had a cold? Sniffles are loud.Krasinski and Blunt are surprisingly good, together - I was worried about two people who are actually married trying to replicate that sensation in a way that someone could see on screen; individually, this seemed like a defining role for Krasinski, who showed an air of confidence and maturity I haven't seen before. Blunt was terrific, which did not surprise - it's so hard to see when she's working, an underrated skill.The daughter was awesome, and carried so much of this movie's surprising heart around on her young shoulders.A personal aside: This felt, to me, almost frame by frame, to be a classic M.Night flick. The exact sort of linear, generous, and rewarding movie-making he has managed for years, but is usually panned for, bc of he weight of peculiar expectations - if you told me he secretly wrote and directed this, I wouldn't blink, and I intend that as a real compliment to Krasinski.I loved this.

Easily the best horror of the year so far // MORE REVIEWS on instagram: moviesmaniax,"A well-deserved 97% Certified Fresh on Rottentomatoes. A Quiet Place starts off with a promising concept that basically if you make a sound, these creatures would come out and eventually slice you in half. This allows a fresh take on the film's storytelling through mostly silent sequences that once something does make a sound, it will effectively make you jump and make your heart beats like a running horse as you unexpectedly anticipate what's about to happen next. Once the film hooks you with this gimmick, the thrills only go uphill from there where it smartly builds up the stakes of this family, making it even higher and thus lowering their chances of surviving, thus leaving the viewers a more terrifying and breathless experience as the story progresses. Another selling point of this film are these grotesque, alien-looking creatures that look deliciously creepy and mesmerizingly frightening as well as the strong performances and well-constructed characters that you will actually end up liking and caring for their fates. Overall, not only does this film have a promising concept but also with its breathlessly terrifying moments along with brilliantly constructed characters and plot, the execution is just beyond and exceptionally horrifying. A Quiet Place is perhaps one of the best monster films ever made and easily the best horror of the year so far.>>A<<",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

An unbearably tense 90 minutes with a real beating heart,"Looking at his page on IMDb, former star of the American version of The Office John Krasinski has previously directed two features, neither of which I have seen or even heard of. It would seem like the third time's a charm, as his latest, the riveting horror A Quiet Place, is just about as accomplished and tightly-directed as you would expect from any seasoned veteran. Teaming up to co-star with his real-life wife Emily Blunt, Krasinski has crafted one of the most memorable and genuinely scary horror movies in recent memory, and one of the biggest sleeper hits of 2018. Taking place in the now-familiar territory of a post-apocalyptic landscape, A Quiet Place shares more in common tonally with John Hillcoat's The Road than, say, George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road.It's the near-future and it's apparent that great misfortune has fallen upon the Earth's inhabitants. The Abbot family, consisting of father Lee (Krasinski), mother Evelyn (Blunt), and their three children Regan (Millicent Simmonds), Marcus (Noah Jupe) and youngest Beau (Cade Woodward), are trying desperately to survive, foraging for supplies, food and whatever else that may prove useful in an abandoned library. On their journey home, an accident occurs which devastates the family and reveals to us precisely what has befallen our planet, and why the Abbot's were so keen to make as little noise as possible. They are surrounded by spider-legged creatures with the strength to break through steel with ease and the speed to reach its intended victim in a split second. The hideous creatures are completely blind, but have hearing so powerful that they are able to pin-point a sound with uncanny accuracy, and reach the source with lightning speed.After this mood-setting opening scene, we wisely jump forward in time over a year. The Abbots have seemingly taken every precaution imaginable: they walk barefoot on sand-covered floors, eat their meals from leave rather than breakable plates, and only communicate with sign-language. Krasinski, along with co-writers Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, have fun with laying out traps and red-herrings for their characters to possibly fall prey of, like an exposed nail near the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs, or the fact that Evelyn is heavily pregnant. But it's careful not to fall into the traps of genre cliche and predictability, as the Abbots are apparently a step ahead of their tormentors. Lee spends his spare time tracking the creatures' paths and calculating their numbers, as well searching for a way to possibly kill them. He also tries to build a working hearing aid for his deaf daughter, after many failed attempts. With Regan also feeling responsible for the tragedy at the film's opening, her relationship with her father is strained.A Quiet Place is as much about both the fragility and strength of the family unit as it is about unseen monsters in the dark. Krasinski and Blunt themselves have children together, and no doubt fed their own experiences, fears and difficulties into their characters, albeit placing them in a more extreme and hostile environment. This also helps us to connect with the characters, fearing for their safety when that inevitable damning sound is made, and feeling genuine concern at the idea of a parent failing to protect their child. The action is intensified, and A Quiet Place really earns it scares. Every movement is a jump-shock waiting to happen, but it's scary for the build-up and the knowledge of what comes after. The performances are great all round, with Millicent Simmonds - who is deaf in real life - making a real impact, surely cementing her status as one of the most promising young actors around. Krasinski has a done an impressive job of dodging being known forever as the guy from The Office and proving himself to be a strong dramatic actor, but he'll be best remembered here for his skills behind the camera. A Quiet Place turns what could have been a routine jump-shocker into an unbearably tense 90 minutes with a real beating heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Good idea, but has one big issue","A Quiet Place is an interesting movie. The concept is intriguing and the story itself is decent. The problem is that the movie isn't scary. And I don't say this to be tough, I genuinely felt little to no fear throughout the film. It is disappointing, because of how much potential it has.It is difficult to pinpoint the exact issue that stops this movie from being scary. The film just felt like it was holding back. It would have definitely been scarier if the characters were better. I cannot name more than one basic personality trait for any of the characters, which is a problem, especially with the low kill count this stopped the few deaths from being memorable. The atmosphere and setting could have been creepier as well, but it was not bad.Overall, this movie is worth a watch if you want to watch an interesting apocalypse movie, but definitely not a must-watch, and if you want to be scared, stay away from this if your not below 13-14.

Instant Horror Classic.,"This horror film works extremely powerfully on a number of levels.It perfectly demonstrates Hitchcock's thinking ""There is a distinct difference between 'suspense' and surprise', and yet many pictures continually confuse the two. - if filmmakers keep spectators unaware, they can create ""fifteen seconds of surprise,"" but if they inform them of the impending encounter, they can produce ""fifteen minutes of suspense""In A Quiet Place director (and co-star) John Krasinski (who directed three episodes of The Office - not exactly a training ground for this) has clearly listened to Hitchcock because everything about this superb movie is driven by suspense. I counted ten times when I leaped from my seat, but I was on the edge of it from start to finish.It's lean, taut, beautifully shot, expertly sound-tracked and superbly sound-crafted (absolutely essential in a movie that's about noise).His acting, and that of his entire family (particularly the outstanding Emily Blunt - his real life wife), is razor sharp.And the whole thing is done and dusted in a credible 80 minutes flat.Bish, bash, bosh. Job done.Scared the crap out of you.Now, go home.Really, this is film craft at its finest and a straight into my top ten horrors of all time alongside...The Shining
It Follows
Get Out
Alien
Jaws
Psycho
The Exorcist
Rec
Paranormal Activity
What brings these all together (with the exception of The Shining and possibly Rec) is the lack of REAL horror.Less, in my book, is generally more.What makes this movie so damned good is the relationship Krasinski builds between members of the family. His willingness to dispose of lead characters with a minimum of fuss makes the whole much more believable and credible and the fact that the story treats its audience with respect. It has a strong beginning, middle and end although we join the story some 89 days into its telling.The visual clues are subtle. The emotions real, small and detailed.He makes few plot mistakes (although the 'nail' set up is a little contrived and 'the spaceship' has a pretty big 'guess what's coming' flag attached to it).The gore is minimal which is how I like it.Now, look at that list above and you can see a golden age of horror emerging: A Quiet Place, Get Out, It Follows, Rec and, just missing the list, French horror , Raw, are all pretty recent. They are all minimalist but they are all a) brilliantly directed and b) finely acted. The craft skills are evident in abundance in all three, but none of them need a lot of gore to engage their audience.I hope Krasinski gets his just rewards for this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

One for those who like to pick holes in films,The premise of the film uses silence to create tension and this works well to make a good mild horror.

A missed opportunity!,"This movie was entertaining, and best of all, it was different. The movie made me realize how important sound is to our lives, and it became intolerable for me about 10 minutes in that most of the movie revolved around the main characters keeping quiet in order to survive. I was just so used to the background music, dialogue and explosion in modern cinema that this movie made me uneasy. This is what made the concept so original and interesting. It definitely kept me intrigued.This could have been such a great movie, unfortunately it was not executed well enough. The story was just too bland. One of the most touching and emotional scenes in a movie of (probably) the year cannot excuse its extremely slow build-up and poor suspense factor throughout what should be a horror/thriller movie.However, I cannot praise the acting of ALL the actors well enough. Everyone did a stellar job, especially Millicent Simmonds. Her character was the cause of most of their problems and was extremely unlikable. She was such a great character! She exhibited perfectly the ignorant entitlement of most children. Although, you knew all she needed was to feel loved, you just couldn't feel sorry for Miss Danger Magnet. Let's be honest here, she isn't very good-looking, and this adds to the fact that people are more readily eager to dislike unattractive people. This, I think, is where the casting did an A+ job.Of course, the biggest twist of all is that the producer, Michael Bay, known for sound effects and explosions, produced a movie in which most of the movie was devoid of sound.I would recommend a watch. However, do not expect a masterpiece. I think the very high IMDB score makes no sense to me, but to each their own. There is no reason not to watch this movie as it is well worth the price just for its uniqueness alone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The terrifying sound of silence,"A possible alien invasion seems to have decimated the human population during the course of the film, these invaders are completely blind but with an incredible sense of hearing and extreme strength and speed, thanks to their high sensibility and superhuman power, they have managed to destroy man and woman everywhere. Our protagonist and his family must survive in a remote village among the mountains, on their own farm where they manage to survive on the basis of TOTAL silence, because the slightest sound is devastating for any living being near these aliens.We enter this movie with a lot of mystery and a very unique new element, silence. I must say that the power of silence was used in an excellent way, giving a unique and sensational touch to terror, without the need for screams or scares, only the small use of soft sounds and music, you can achieve an incredible effect of great suspense and perfect tension to entertain and frighten the viewer.The performance and direction at all times was impeccable, with great work from the actors, demonstrating excellent skills and also a great chemistry among all, even if there is almost absolutely no dialogue (I think that in the whole movie they only speak 3 or 4 times), they manage to connect in a profound way thanks to the use of sign language and facial expressions.Totally satisfied, an excellent horror movie (something uncommon), so good that it left me wanting more, incredible suspense and a final barbarous work.

Excellence in film making.,"WOW! This film would have been highly enjoyable just on its horror elements alone, albeit cliché. 
However the exploration of what I imagine is the main theme of the film ascends the entire experience to a new level. That theme being what a parent will do for their family. I found John Kransinski (the dad) to be overwhelmingly relatable, the same can be said for the whole cast honestly. This is perhaps what allowed me to feel so much for the characters. Never before have I felt so strongly what the characters are going through. Not trying to put you off but I felt intensely anxious almost the entire film, it was strangely enjoyable.
Even during jump scare moments I was never scared like I would be in other recent horror successes such as The Conjuring or Insidious. The film was nonetheless horrifying though. I mean this in the most positive way. This a horror about more than scaring the s*** out of you. It's a truly beautiful story set around an incredibly thrilling horror sequence.

SUSPENSE AND HEART WRENCHING... ALL IN SILENCE,"A great film from beginning to end. Very impressive considering it's rated PG13. As expected, the film is mostly in silence, relying heavily on the acting and scenery to convey story and tone. The movie follows the story of a couple and their children although eventually you see evidence of others living in the same town. The story takes place in the year 2020 and the irony of it is that with all the technology and advances that surround us today, the family is forced to live as if it were several decades ago. They use, radios, fire for light and they hunt for their food. As the storyline progresses you discover how carefully the couple have thought out what to do in the event of a tragedy. I found myself caring for the characters and anxiously waited to see how the family pulls through. The monster remains a mystery for the majority of the film. However, it's presence is definitely there almost the entire time. There we plenty of jump scares and I found myself holding my breath in suspense several times. In summary, the movie is about a husband and a wife surviving day by day and doing everything possible to protect their children. The movie was beautifully executed, suspenseful and heart wrenching. It was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Uniquely tense, a great thriller","Our take: See it in theaters and hope that the rest of the theater can stay quiet.
Post-credit scene: No.Krasinski shines in his directorial debut, keeping the audience's attention from start to grand finale. The whole film keeps you tense but also allows for moments of laughter and tears. It's shot exceptionally, and there's really nothing to complain about directorially.It's also not often that a film is so drastically different from everything else in theaters. This one would almost be better seen at home on Netflix where a viewer could control their surroundings. At the same time, the film is exceptional on the big screen if the rest of the audience can cooperate. The film is almost entirely shot without verbalized words, but even without speaking, the characters are able to connect and communicate their devotion to one another through something as simple as eye contact, which is often taken for granted in film. Silence is often unnerving and its use in the horror genre is relatively pervasive, but to take the suspense of silence and extend it to something feature-length. The creativity and the guts to commit to something so risky really paid off.One of the best aspects of the film is the casting of deaf actress Millicent Simmonds as the deaf daughter, Regan. Not only is the representation important, but the way Krasinski handles the character herself is impeccable. Even in the aspects of sound mixing when the movie is from Regan's point of view is amazing - there's a complete lack of even ambient noise. Following an Oscar year where the Best Picture film was both praised for featuring a character with a disability in the lead and criticized for failing to cast an actress with that disability to play her (the mute Elisa played by Sally Hawkins in The Shape of Water) it's good to know that directors and storytellers are taking the steps to ensure that not only are they including representation in film, but they are actually being representative.Featuring: Some serious lapses in logic, but that doesn't take away from the film. It's a horror movie after all, what would it be without the need for some serious suspension of disbelief.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"May not be scary to all, but a brilliant heart stopping movie nonetheless...","I knew before I went into this movie that it was going to be good. I just knew. But I did not think it would be THIS good. This is horror done right. A family living in complete silence of something lurking in the shadows. A movie based around silence. Every sound you hear and every move each character makes puts you on edge in fear of whatever it is that they're avoiding catching them. Not every single horror is going to scare everyone. It's just a fact. Some people are afraid of different things. However, you know when a horror movie is done right if it grips you and makes you feel the intensity that it's trying to portray. The directing was excellent aswell as the acting of every single actor/actress in this movie. They make the situation they're going through and the emotions they feel believable, causing you to care for them and hoping they survive. My teeth were clenched (almost) throughout the whole movie. You hardly get a break to breathe. This movie is brilliantly shot, executed and overall an outstanding new entry to the genre of horror/thriller. Although it may not be as scary as some may have hoped for, it definitely puts you on edge in its entirety.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

More Thrills then Chills,"The term ""horror"" is underused here, as for me I was on the edge of my seat, but was never genuinely scared. However, despite that John Krasinski delivers a tension filled film. I admire the creative ways the characters had to be when figuring out how to remain quiet. Alsl, the film raises your tension and anxiety and never really let's ggo. Unfortunately, this film does have problems. Some of the choices the characters made were questionable, and the payoff in the end was underwhelming, leaving us somewhat unsatisfactory. So while I do like the film, I do see and recognize some flaws in it. With an absurdly simple premise those flaws could have been avoided. But I guess no film is perfect. The performances were good especially by Emily Blunt. Interestingly this is another film directed by a comedian that is horror, both here good, and am excited for the next film by either filmmaker. Alsl, for non-horror fans out there, don't worry, this is one you can handle. No ghosts, demons, or zombies, just a family forced to survive in the most unlucky situation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Silence is Survival,"It's not often a truly unique movie experience comes along. 'A Quite Place' is definitely one of those. Making his first big-screen debut, John Krasinski also served as co-script writer, and is the lead character in this film. Starring alongside his real-life wife, Emily Blunt, he delivers an earnest and engrossing story. At 90 minutes, this film immediately engages the audience in the narrative with only small bits of information on the actual backstory, and the story line remains highly focused and spare. With the story premise that sound brings certain death, that facet of the story is driven home in a powerful way within the first ten minutes.Krasinski plays Lee Abbot and Blunt is his wife, Evelyn. Together they are struggling to survive this constant threat on a rural farm. Rounding out this tiny cast is Millicent Simmons (who is actually deaf) is their oldest and deaf daughter. Her physical condition is woven into the story line. Noah Jupe, who already has an impressive acting resume, plays the middle son to great effect. Cade Woodward, also making his big screen debut, is the youngest sibling. Together they must adapt to living a silent life or pay the ultimate price.The movie is so effective because it immediately sets a level of suspense that is maintained throughout the story. The audience gets no relief and certain events only serve to increase the tension. It's extremely engrossing to watch and as a viewer, one is easily caught up in the potential for disaster at every turn. The term 'nerve-wracking' doesn't seem sufficient. You could hear a pin drop in the theater where I saw this movie. Because of this, the use of sound in the film is also played very effectively. With no real musical soundtrack, the use of Neil Young's 'Harvest Moon' is especially poignant and heartwarming. Industrial Light & Magic supplies the special effects which are kept to a (thankfully) bare minimum and this judicial use only enhances the authentic feel of the film.I found it best not to overthink the story line, as I began to envision a number of plot holes, but because the film is so involving, the viewer isn't given the opportunity to second guess any of the elements involved here. I did feel that this offering sort of paralleled a recent episode on the NetFlix series, 'Black Mirror'. Season 4, Episode 5 - 'Metal Head' contains a similar scenario where humans are being hunted; but the whole silence concept used in 'A Quiet Place' definitely sets this film apart. By far, 'A Quiet Place' is the biggest (silent) bang for the buck I've had at the movie theater in a long while.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

An immersive experience! Not your average thriller,"While the film is short, at an 1 hour and 30 minutes, it's well paced. The story is is about a family's everyday life and eventually a fight for survival. It's about a mother and fathers journey in parenthood during a vicious attack on humanity. It doesn't bore you with details about the ""creatures"" with words you don't understand. The average family just manages to survive and you follow along side them in this story. While the very, very end(like the last ten seconds) leaves something to be desired, a film has to end somewhere. I have to respect that.The acting was great, honestly. I've seen all of the actors before but not like this. Maybe it was the chemistry between real life spouses John and Emily. The children are also very talented. Every moment and action had a purpose. No one was over acting and nothing felt ingenuine or out of character. This really helps you emotionally attach yourself to the characters and their story.The technical aspects. I think an oscars for sound mixing can be expected. I never appreciated a films general sound until this film as well as Mother!This film was incredibly smart, not pretentious though.

A Conventional take on the Unconventional,"In horror cinema nowadays, the traditions of slasher flicks and torture films have been replaced. Now, it's all about high concept and gimmicks that sell the films. A simple idea that grabs the intrigue of an audience member that is up to the director to decide whether it is a worth one to stretch into a 90+ minute film. In that sense, we are getting more experimental horror films than ever before in this modern age of cinema, especially with companies like Blumhouse and A24 rolling the dice on small budget, high-concept films.For the film 'A Quiet Place', the gimmick is simply silence...and I cannot lie, if this is an indicator of where mainstream horror is heading, the genre may not be as far-gone as so many people deemed it only a few short years ago.'A Quiet Place' is a horror film with a concept so simple yet so fascinating; antagonists who have incredible hearing can only be stifled by not making any loud noises whatsoever. Thus, a majority of this briskly-paced 90 minute film is executed in near-silence. Characters speak through sign language. Acting is mostly done through movement and expression. Everything is done subtly and without a need to pander or 'dumb it down', for the most part.Admittingly, I expected this effect and technique to be broken almost immediately, but what I received was commitment to this concept. With a few rare exceptions, the film owns the advantages and disadvantages this decision comes with, and makes for an intriguing theatre experience as you sit in a multiplex theatre with crowds of others, nervously pinned to your seat in the highest of high tension scenes. In THIS space, someone can hear you munch popcorn.What also impresses me regarding this film is its use of sound design, perhaps obviously enough. A particular choice is made for one character that creates for an interesting sequence or two regarding sound, which were highlights for this film when it came to its tension scenes.That said, this film isn't without faults, and pretty glaring ones at that. At multiple points, the film falls into the typical genre pitfalls of cliche and logic holes. A certain 'rule' of the world they establish actually threatened to wreck my suspension of disbelief at one point, though I stuck with the film simply because it was so fascinating in what it aimed to achieve. Even so, various scenes feel like they were producer-mandated and had fingerprints of people who ""know what a horror movie should be like"". It reeks of cliche at times, which is a shame considering how unconventional the initial concept was and how much open space it had to do some intriguing things.Along with these leaps of logic and simply dumb things I noticed while watching it, the sheer feeling of ""polish"" throughout the film was unfortunately hard to miss. Seeing as this was handled by Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes production company, it was unfortunate to see various scenes lost in their feeling of grit once I looked in the back and started to realize how much the scene looked like a SET and not an environment that was lived-in.I feel, if this screenplay and concept was handled by someone like Trey Edward Schultz (""It Comes At Night"", one of my favorites of 2017) and a studio like A24 or Blumhouse, this could have been a landmark film in the horror genre. This could have received the gritty, unrelenting and unique direction such a concept needs to thrive. Instead, what we get is a polished version of an idea that so desperately wants to be unleashed in full execution. Instead, we get the studio-mandated version, which isn't BAD by any means...but not as great as it should have been. The phrase ""A conventional take on the unconventional"" continues to reverb in my mind, and I think this describes the film perfectly.All of that said, I cannot say this film does not excel in many regards. The concept is something we haven't seen executed on this kind of scale in recent memory, the performances all suit the film perfectly, the sound design is top-notch, the world-building is actually quite excellent and give us a believable method to how this family lives in a world where no one can make a sound, and some scenes are actually quite proficient at piling-on tension.Amidst genre pitfalls and cliches, 'A Quiet Place' manages to be a good time at the theatre that was pleasantly self-contained and without too much silliness. For a 90 minute gauntlet of horror and suspense with an interesting premise, I think much of the current cinemas producing schlock horror could learn a thing or two from the execution of this film. Considering this film's incredible first weekend take, I think audiences are interested in cool concepts for a horror film like this as well.If silence is indeed golden, this film isn't quite 4 karat, but it most certainly is up there...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Incredible and a movie for the ages,"This movie was like ""Signs"" amplified times a million. 
So perfect. So suspenseful. So emotionally driven. 
Puts a whole new angle on the horror genre in general. 
Beautiful collaboration between one of my favorite couples, only second to the fiction based romance that is Jim and Pam. 
John Krasinski and his equally talented wife, Emily Blunt have long awaited the ""right film"" to costar alongside each other for the first time, and it's easy to see why they unanimously decided on ""A Quiet Place"".
It will not only have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish (seriously, there is not one second that feels prolonged or in need of action), but it will have you leaving the theater wanting to text your family and let them know how much you love them. 
Beautifully directed by John, he and Emily also star as on-screen parents, which is not only a true testament and visual depiction of their real life romance, but also of how adamantly they love their children and will protect them at any cost. 
John has described this film as a ""love letter to his children"" and plot aside, it is the most authentic I've ever seen two actors perform in the longest time. 
Every kiss, every tear, every look of horrific fright upon their faces, and the undying need to save their family is mirrored in John and Emily's eyes. 
Both actors have confessed how difficult this film was because it hit so close to home. With Emily explaining that she prefers to take on roles that are very different from her own persona, this film challenged her because it was so real. 
Likewise, John expressed his fears in taking on a film with almost no dialogue and he worried how it would be received by audiences and critics alike. 
With standing ovations, a 98% rotten tomato score, and his wife being so proud and supportive, it's heart-warming to see John step out of his comfort zone and succeed. 
I absolutely would not have taken the time to write this ""review"" if I did not think it was a movie for the ages and a risky script to tackle that was done flawlessly and paid off extremely well for both the cast/crew, as well as audience goers everywhere. 
If you like ""horror"" movies that aren't riddled with crazy plots, tons of gore, and paranormal craziness, this movie will make you think, feel, and keep your heart racing without compromising the film's integrity.Basically, 10/10. Would recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Remind me old films,"A Quiet Place is all about silence, that creates extremely intense experiences that we could wish for. John Krasinski has done amazing piece of art.

Because there is one thing I am not sure it is right or not, that is how you find a way to kill the monster since barely people all over the world is alive, why did they not use gun to shoot them at the beginning, even I know that sound is a tool as a barrier to prevent them to attack.

"Cool premise, but ultimately not much of a film","I'm pretty surprised by all the raves for this one. Maybe I'm getting too old, but it doesn't seem like folks are requiring much these days to declare a movie a masterpiece. At the outset, I bought in; I thought this might be something great -- you all know the premise already, and it is a good one. But then, the story never takes off -- for me it's pretty flatline... Other negative reviews have mentioned the logic inconsistencies/failings -- and certainly there were those -- but for me, the major offense was the lack of narrative momentum. We're presented with a situation -- and that was certainly well done -- but then, nothing especially interesting happens or drives the plot. For the entirety of the film. I found myself getting bored. I also beg to differ about the incredible ""tension."" I didn't feel it. Sure, it employs a lot of standard horror movie tropes, and there's all the annoying quiet-THEN-LOUD jump scares, but genuine tension? Not once you've seen the same stuff a bunch, and not when a lot of it is illogical. Sorry, but this movie was a very average -- don't believe the hype. I also wasn't that into the CGI creature(s), which seemed to borrow a bit much from Stranger Things.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The Plotholes Don't Matter,"A Quiet Place follows a single family as they navigate a new world of silence. The daughter of the family being deaf gives them an advantage in this landscape as they're all still able to communicate with one another. But this movie isn't about the alien invasion, it's about them, the family. It's about being a family. The mother, Evelyn is heavily pregnant, which as you can imagine poses its own problems. You can't keep babies quiet, and good luck not screaming through labour. Thankfully they're a smart family with a lot of smart solutions to problems. For instance they have a soundproofed basement for the baby to reside in, and a further soundproofed box with breathing apparatus to put the child in should things get hairy. They use a system of lights as a warning, use paths of sand to walk around barefoot, and keep connections with other local survivors by regular check-ins by firelight.What I found really refreshing and unexpected about this movie was how incredibly light it was on plot. Where did the creatures come from? Doesn't matter. How have the family managed to keep corn crops without making a sound? Doesn't matter. Why is the mother pregnant again? Doesn't really matter, but you'll understand if you pay attention and don't lack brain cells. Instead the film is super simple, basing almost the entirety of the action on the family farm, and almost all the tension derives from things going from bad to worse one thing at a time, and setting it all up well in advance. You see the nail pointing up through the step and you know what's going to happen. Rather than this predictability being a problem, it instead suspends you as you wait for the inevitable, and fully understand the consequences of when it does finally happen. And then it snowballs. One thing after another, and even when you think they're safe, something else happens putting your heart back in your throat.The acting is great all round, especially from the kid actors. John Krasinski achieves a perfect balance between acting and directing, giving a very genuine performance as a father stuck in a hard position, trying his best to protect his family. Near the end his performance may even give you chills. Emily Blunt is fantastic as the mother, going through the emotions effortlessly as if this was all really happening. She's a supportive mother, a loving wife, and when she endures pain, she endures it harder than anyone else. Naturally the chemistry Blunt and Krasinski share is palpable, which is not surprising considering their real life relationship. But the kids really impress. Noah Jupe is maybe the most expected of the child actors as Marcus, who still clings to being a child as much as he can despite knowing he needs to mature up and help pull his weight. He's ultimately a child wracked by fear. Millicent Simmonds absolutely nails it though as the defiant Regan, determined to not be defined or looked down upon by her disability. Her real life deafness really adds authenticity to the emotions she displays, having grown up with other ways to communicate and emote. Big props to everyone else for learning sign language though, the movie wouldn't have been the same without it.And yet the biggest star of the movie was the sound department, or more rather their restraint. The film's biggest strength is its use of silence. Every little sound becomes amplified and carries so much more weight than usual, thanks in large part to so much of the movie being in absolute silence. The score by Marco Beltrami never betrays this approach, only peeking in when absolutely necessary to add emotional depth and enhance the suspense. Krasinski otherwise lets the silence speak for itself. There's nothing more nerve-wracking than a rattle, bang, or cry when it literally means life or death.A Quiet Place is a tight ninety minutes of nail-biting tension. It never outstays its welcome, touches on just enough world-building to entice without detracting from the core family and their one bad night in the country, and displays some of the most restrained and atmospheric directing from Krasinski. There are plot holes here, but they never detract from the film's underlying foundations, and most can be explained away with a little bit of thought, or just simply don't matter to the story it wants to tell. Why didn't she remove the nail? I don't know, when did she even have a chance to remove the nail? I give A Quiet Place a very high 8/10, and honestly I could easily give it more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Better than expected, justifying the hype.","I initially did not want to watch this, as I feared it would be similar to the highly acclaimed yet utterly boring films 'It comes at night' and 'It follows'. 'A Quiet Place' was equally acclaimed, and in this instance, I must admit I was wrong and the film justified the high acclaim. This is a very unique film and interesting concept. Despite the very little dialogue or sound in the film, this was remarkably never boring. On the contrary, I was completely spellbound and literally sat on the edge of my seat waiting for the family to make a mistake.What I found interesting about this film compared to most other post-apocalyptic films is the fact they never show or tell you what actually happened for the family to be in the situation they're in. But I enjoyed the fact they kept the plot simple, and never over-complicated it with back stories and twists. This is essentially a survival tale. The film had to rely (a lot!) on the actors' abilities to make this work, and they did! The acting was superb - especially John Krasinski, who is ultimately the hero.Naturally - in a film like this - you're bound to have plot flaws and there are a number of them. My biggest issue was right in the beginning when the family let their 4-year old son walk BEHIND all of them, without anyone even holding his hand. They were so concerned about sound and the elements surrounding them, yet this was apparently perfectly in order. There's also a scene where they play Monopoly and even use fibre pieces instead of metal. From outside, you surely won't be able to hear ordinary Monopoly pieces on a board from the confines of your home, so this was taking the idea just a bit too far. Also, why are they using lanterns and candles if they have electricity? The creatures are blind anyway. Keeping the newborn baby silent was also not believable. It's simply impossible to keep a baby quiet at all times. The film would have done better without the baby.Despite all these and numerous other flaws, though, it was a very good film and very different. The chemistry between the characters were also very good (although I found their daughter Regan a bit annoying).

If Alfred Hitchcock had done a monster movie.,"A Quiet Place is an incredible film and is one of the best thrillers/horror films I've seen in a very long time. Krasinski hits the nail on the head with excellent direction, phenomenal sound design, and a constant presence of suspense and unknown terror. His characters are real and dynamic. Each with their own do's and don't's of this brave new world. One of the scariest things about the film is the knowledge that if one sound is made, it could be the end of your life. Blunt's performance was intense, and sympathetic. A mom who perseveres through death and life. Krasinski himself was a masterclass in fatherhood. A father who has to both protect and teach his children in a silent world. Think about something for me. What would you do in his situation? One of the standout performances however was Millicent Simmonds. Being actually deaf in real life, Her performance adds an authenticity and a genuineness to the role of being in a silent world. Overall, this film is original, suspenseful, and definitely one I want to see again. It is my hope that Krasinski makes more film like this.

"I've been following this movie ever since the first trailer came out, and I dare to say it may be nominated for best picture 2018.","This is my first review on IMDb; I'll try to make it as compelling as possible.First of all the characters have lots of personality and the emotional investment put in them will be colossal; you will care a lot about them. Very important; they act as humane as you would possibly expect. They fear, they love, they hate, and regret. All of this thanks to the amazing actors that are able to transmit all of it (be it Krazinski, Blunt, or the child actors). They know what they are doing and you can tell they enjoy it.Secondly, the setting provides for a really creepy atmosphere. The fact that they are living in a situation where the most minimal sound can mean death, then it is certain that tension will be present. We end up being used to the mostly quiet film so every sound will give you goosebumps.The creatures are really intimidating as to be considered life-threatening which makes them all the more terrifying, and their hostility is really something sinister to behold. The extent of their brutality can be witnessed in the very beginning.Lastly, the storyline is smoothly presented. Nothing feels forced or out of place. You can tell from a distance that the writers and Krasinzki (you'll have to excuse me since I don't recall his first name) really thought of every detail. In an interview, Krazinski told this was one of the most if not the most personal film in his career; his performance and his direction prove him right.I can safely say that ""A Quiet Place"" is really a cinematographical achievement. I will be really disappointed if it is not nominated for the Oscars or the Golden Globes. I really encourage you to watch this one for yourselves. Do yourselves and the producers a favor. I promise you will not regret.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Amazing. Thrilling. Intense. Suspenseful.,Very well laid out plot. This movie is the 3rd movie I've ever seen more than once in theaters.

A decent horror.,"This film is slightly overrated, you won't waste your time watching it however... just don't expect the best horror ever, the movie is well structured with many things to like about it, good acting, good effects, good suspense, good cinematography, nice drama, its just a very decent movie, you'll most likely be satisfied.That being said, in my opinion the movie is not scary and relies on a LOT of jumpscares, which you would expect anyway in a film like this... but there are quite a few unnecessary jump scares which could of been removed and added in more creepy scenes instead, this would improve the movie as a whole.The concept is new and fresh, but just because a movie is unique does not mean it should automatically get a high rating, but nevertheless I do recommend giving this movie a watch, especially if you like horror themed thriller films.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The positives: the monsters are flat good, I would say the third best movie monsters behind Alien and the tomorrow war. A number of great intense and scary scenes. Good acting, dialogue, and directing. Excellent special effects. Negatives: just one but a big one, plot holes and logic gaps big enough to drive trucks through. Even with the illogical plot issues the movie is still thrilling and fun, and if your able to crank up your level of suspension of disbelief you will enjoy it, if you try to rationalize the plot while watching the experience is much less enjoyable.

Serious faults with this film,"Whilst the film started out well ie atmospheric tension built well, I soon discovered a major flaw which undermines its principle premise of the family not being able to talk with each other. Why on earth can't they whisper in each other's ears? Then all the ridiculous gesturing and pseudo-sign language becomes redundant. The lethal creatures out there don't react to the gentle shuffling of human feet on the floor, walking through vegetation etc, gentle whispering has an even lower decibel count than these and would not attract a lethal response.
I got as far as Emily Blunt stepping on the nail in the wooden stair tread, then thought this so ridiculous that I ditched the film. How come there is a big nail suddenly sticking upwards at least an inch out of a stair tread when the family will have been up and down those stairs endless times prior? And for a nail to be sticking UP means it was hammered from below, another totally implausible idea. And the idae that this was a bent nail which was straightened upwards by her pulling on the caught bag doesn' work either, a nail that size/thickness would not un-bend so easily. When she went up the stairs the bag she was carrying had caught on this nail and, stupidly, she just yanked on the nail to free the bag. Another stupid action which common sense dictates you would not do given the scenario of needing to keep totally silent.
And the momentary glimpses of some long-limbed horror creature is dumb also, much better to have not shown the source of the killings of people and of animals, the human imagination works wonderfully when things are not obvious but hinted at.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

One of the few original horror films that come out each year,"It is very hard to do straight horror movies these days that are actually good, that's what so few compared to yesteryears are made. I think it is because horror is the genre which is the most exact in what it has to do and has the most limited tools with which to do it. In only 40 years of the blockbuster horror film the tropes have largely been done to death and everyone knows them and sees them coming a mile off. However, a small handful of times each year an innovative way to approach the genre comes through, and this was one of those films for 2018. The concept is genius because it makes for an extremely tense watch and lots of opportunities for believable horror. Not a great deal actually happens it is a simple concept done very well.

Post-apocalyptic monsters hunting you.,"I only read the first review for A Quiet Place and that review could not have been anymore wrong. The writer of that review clearly doesn't get the concept of a good horror movie, it needs a solid soundtrack. In that review he stated that the movie should have been completely quiet, what would result in just a visual movie, that ultimately in the end would get you bored. Now the soundtrack brought the necessary suspense in this movie. In any good horror movie half of the suspense is thanks to the sound effects and soundtrack. A Quiet Place is an interesting story, in a post-apocalyptic environment with dangerous creatures hunting down anything that makes a noise. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski gave a good performance, even though John Krasinski isn't one of my favorite actors at all, but in this movie he's actually okay. The rest of the small cast, the kids, did a good job as well. The monsters were good and scary, perfect for entertainment. Good CGI's, and even with the very limited conversations a movie that keeps you on the edge. They could make another movie with those monsters, that I wouldn't mind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Mildly entertaining, though unremarkable","Wish I could get behind this as much as everyone else. It's decent. The creatures are relatively cool looking, some of the lighting and set design is nice, and most of all it was enjoyable to see a mainstream film commit to being so quiet for so much of its runtime. The movie also does a relatively good job of making the vulnerability of these characters and the fragility of their safety feel palpable. Beyond this though, I was very much underwhelmed by the final product. I understand the metaphorical layer the film is going for - the idea of sacrificing everything for your children and the insistent paranoia that surely goes along with being a parent. But the metaphor is just there. It isn't explored in any deeper or satisfying way. Perhaps it would've resonated more if I were a parent myself, but as it stands I felt there just wasn't enough to chew on with the story here. And when you take away that metaphorical level, the movie that remains is ultimately just a very traditional cat-and-mouse creature film with plenty of loud, easily foreseeable and mundane jump scares. Yes, as quiet as the film often is, it still very much relies on those piercingly loud jolts for the bulk of its scares. I'll always prefer a horror film that can get under my skin; one that can disturb rather than startle me. And I also just had a nagging sense that the film lacked the directorial vision it really needed to help elevate the material above the basic premise. Fair, mildly entertaining, but derivative and ultimately forgettable.Light 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Great Interesting Film,"I plan on finally getting to see A Quiet Place 2 tomorrow evening, so in prep I had to watch the first film and I did that today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a family trying to survive where they must live in silence to avoid monsters that are out to kill them.Main Character
Real Life Married Couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski play the two lead characters here and they are both really good here. Obviously, they can't really talk together so they have to rely on natural chemistry that they obviously have and it is very effective in the film. These are two characters you actually care about in a horror film and I can't tell you how much better it makes the overall experience.Supporting Characters
This film has one of the smallest casts imaginable and really the only ones to mention are the two children played by Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe. They are both very good, especially for inexperienced performers and all of the cast do really good jobs and feel like a true family trying to survive an apocalypse.Story
The story is fascinating because of how little detail there is. This film refreshingly doesn't overcomplicate things or explain too much about this world like there is no indication where the monsters actually came from. The film is simple as we watch these four people attempt to survive and stay quiet, their characters are what drives the film and the incredibly tense situations that they are put into. But there is no doubt, that some of the plot elements aren't really explained enough and with the premise there are times where the plot doesn't exactly make sense. Plus this films very ending infuriated me a bit and felt a little cheap after the film that I watched.Script
Now this is the hardest part of the film to examine as there is very little dialogue to work with. What is here is good and the dialogue displayed through sign language does a good job in developing the characters. But there were some elements of the plot that weren't written as well as I would have liked and it did hold the film back a little bit for me.Style
The films style is really good, the use or lack of sound is really effective and keeps you on your toes for the duration of the film without the cheap jump scares that most horror films employ. The film is only 90 mins long which was the right decision for sure and it manages to turn some mundane activities that they do and turn them into scenes that make you bite your nails in tension.Overall
Overall, A Quiet Place is a great film that does its job as a suspense thriller with elements of horror really well. Its a short film so if you haven't watched it then do it and then go see the sequel in the cinema.Rating - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Very Impressed,"A Quiet Place is a great horror film. This is one of the most genuinely scary horror movies that has come out in a very long time. It seems to be third time's the charm for John Krasinski in the director's chair, as he truly hit this one out of the park. Not only are the horror scenes some of the best I have seen in recent memory, but you actually care and feel for the characters. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are both fantastic, and demonstarte a great on-screen chemistry, consdiering they are married in real life. The kids were pretty good as well, as long as they weren't talking, (I'll get to that in a minute). The film build tension incredibly well, and, I must reiterate, the horror in this movie is actually scary. A Quiet Place is not full of dumb and cheap jump scares, it provides real horror. The scares in this movie are earned through scenes full of tension and uneasiness that lead to the scare, they are not lazily thrown in throughout the film. The cinematogorphy is also very well done, with most of the shots in the film being interesting and captivating. But, as is usually the case, there are a few scenes in this movie that aren't very good. There is a scene where John Krasinski is talking to his son near a waterfall, and the entire conversation is a little cringy, because the kid is not a good actor when he has to talk. There are a couple other shots and scenes that annoyed me as well. I found the very last shot of the film to be a little cliché and unneccesary, (but I won't spoil it for you). Overall, A Quiet Place is a genuinely scary film, filled with very good perfomances, great direction, a great story, and great cinemotography, make sure you check this one out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Best Scary Movie I've Seen in Some Time,"A Quiet Place was a very refreshing scary movie. This is the best horror movie I've seen in some time. Though it wasn't totally unique, it was original enough.This family lives somewhere in the woods during a time in which the world (as it seems) has been completely overrun with these vicious creatures that use sound to hunt. When I said it wasn't totally unique, think The Descent but way more extreme. In The Descent (which was an excellent move by the way) there were also creatures that used sound to hunt BUT... they were located in an isolated cave in a remote location. In other words--not many people are coming across these creatures unless you want to go spelunking in uncharted territory. The alien predators in A Quiet Place were above ground and they were everywhere. So we're talking about your day-to-day life that has been extraordinarily affected.You know how they say if you want people to pay closer attention to you then speak softer? I started off watching this movie in a reclined position--because that's the type of seating this theater had--but by mid movie I was fully upright and at the edge of my seat. For some reason I felt as though the relaxed position I was in wasn't defensive enough, like at some point during the movie I would need to spring into action and I didn't want to be slumped down in my seat when I needed to.It was an intense and suspenseful movie. This guy John Krasinski, who directed and starred in the movie, did a heckofa job. Of course I have to credit the writers as well. This was that rare scary movie in which you weren't constantly saying: ""Now why did you do that?"" There was one are-you-kidding-me moment but it was crucial for establishing the premise of the movie. This was just a great movie, scary movie or not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Silence is golden and lines are lousy.,"This movie earned some respect from this viewer right up front: it just THRUSTS you into the story. Usually, in post-apocalypse tales, the tendency is to utilize some back story or text to tell the audience how the world got to its current state. Not the case here. We follow a young family, played by real-life marrieds Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, and Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe as two of their children. Their main concern in this post-apocalypse Earth is trying to survive the wrath of some very weird creatures that appear to be blind and which hunt by sound. The sense of hearing on these creatures is so acute that our heroes have to take a lot of precautions, including going barefoot in the woods.There are some character decisions here that don't make sense, and the story too does not bear a lot of scrutiny, but when it comes to the horror aspect of the presentation, ""A Quiet Place"" delivers. As expected, the sound design is quite good, and Krasinski, who also co-wrote, co-executive produced, and directed, builds some considerable suspense. The family themselves aren't always THAT smart, but they're still surprisingly sympathetic for modern horror movie characters. You actually care what happens to them. Plus, it's definitely of some interest to have a script where much of the dialogue is conveyed through sign language, and where our heroes have their work cut out for them trying not to make too much noise.The performances are right on the money and very effective, from personable leads Blunt and Krasinski and Simmonds and Jupe, two very appealing child actors.Finally, the creatures deserve a mention since their design is somewhat inventive and interesting. They are just purely animalistic and BRUTAL.How did these creatures arise in the first place? Krasinski and company never let you know; they keep exposition to a bare minimum. And that can either be a strength or weakness for the potential viewer.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A horror movie that you are more likely to cry than have nightmares.,"A testament to what the horror genre of films can be. They don't have to have gory murders left and right, they don't have to be provocative or disturbing. A true horror film just simply uses the human nature of fear and puts the audience on the edge of their seat. This movie did that.
 Leading off they developed loveable and rounded characters, as well as told you exactly what you needed to know about the monsters, they feed on noise. A simple concept that was explored in its entirety. John Krasinski molded this love child into a fantastic creation and then made a smart decision and casted his wife as his co-star. The two of them played off of each other well, giving us a glimpse into Krasinski's more serious acting side, as well as showing off Emily Blunt's tremendous ability to play the war torn pregnant wife. 
 The movie did just what it had to do to be successful, no gimmicks, no random murders just to show the monster was evil, no long backstories to build them up, and the movie ended just where it needed to. I mean sure, were all excited to see Blunt and co go out and kick some alien butt, but in the end the film explains enough to know what is going to happen. 
 For a horror film, it surprised me. I am not a really strong horror film fan, and won't really go and see them, but this was in my opinion what a horror movie should be. This was a horror movie for the average movie goer. I am excited to see what Krasinski comes up with next, and for more films to take the concepts that ""Get Out"" and ""A Quiet Place"" found success in and explore them further into a new age of horror films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The silence is deafening,"To start off I would like to say this movie was a gripping, unique and intense thriller that I enjoyed immensely. I saw this in the theater which makes for an even more interesting experience to say the least.If you have ever wanted to be simultaneously extremely self conscious of every creek, groan, cough, nose whistle you yourself make and at the same time equally bothered by every candy wrapper, popcorn bag and loud chewer in the theater, then this is the movie for you. If you haven't seen the movie you may not know why I say this but (SPOILER ALERT) there is almost zero dialogue and limited sound of any kind for the first 40 minutes or so. Seeing this with an audience really does make this an interesting dynamic and adds to the suspense in my opinion.A Quiet Place is not earth shattering in its premise and actually bears many similarities with 2015's Hidden, however I do think this movie outshines that one on many levels. There is far more intensity to this version and the silence only adds to the feeling of dread and terror.9/10 stars and I would recommend seeing this in the theater if at all possible.

One of the best horror/thrillers of all time.,"A Quiet Place is set in a bleak future. A family is forced to live underground in complete silence, to protect themselves from monsters that hunt by hearing sounds.A Quiet Place is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director John Krasinski adeptly handles his on-camera & off-camera duties. Krasinski has given us one of the most unique & well made horror movies, since Get Out(2017). There are 1 or 2 really well executed jump scares & plenty of intense scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat, throughout. What makes this film flawless, is the fact that we can emotionally connect with all the characters. We genuinely care about each & every main character of the movie. Emily Blunt is spectacular as Evelyn Abbott. Blunt proves that she is one of the most versatile actresses in the industry after varied roles in, The Devil Wears Prada(2006), Looper(2012), Edge of Tomorrow(2014), The Girl on the Train(2016) & so many more. John Krasinski is outstanding as Lee Abbott. Krasinski has proved his acting mettle after starring roles in comedies like, The Office(2005-2013) & Aloha(2015) & hard-hitting dramas like 13 Hours(2016) & this film.

A mawkish place,"The trailer really made me want to see this but the moment I saw this movie being plugged on the Graham Norton show, my heart sank. I have no issue with mainstream movies or movies from big companies and I hate it when people are snooty toward them. But horror is slightly different. When horror is made for a general audience, rather than people who breath the genre, that's when things go wrong.The Director actually pegged the very issue with the movie when he said he felt it was a movie ""more about family"". Did he think he was being fresh and original? Movies like that are ten a penny, within and without this genre of science fantasy adventure. A direct, unbiased depiction of people in desperate circumstances committed to being terrifying that is well made...now that would be something.Even if we choose to not call it a ""horror"" movie, just some kind of macabre adventure, it's not like I have a problem with pathos in either. I think it can really enrich a picture about physically terrifying things when we get characters we can see ourselves in, whose plight moves as well as chills us, what some people would call ""making it human"".But there is a significant difference in pathos and sentimentality. A story, especially a monster movie like this, needs to earn its sentimentality by giving us characters that we can relate to with time to make our own minds up about them. This movie oozes a certain smugness about how it is some kind of hip, new age,tear jerker-horror, and although a lot of scary stories have been improved by having that kind of element to it (Silent Hill 2, Eyes without Face) the handling here is just a bit too aggressive. The cinematography zooms in to wring out the feels, the simpering performance from the Dad who always looks incredulous to something he's just seen and the elegiac tendency of the score all add to this.One particularly sickening scene was the Dad dancing with the mother, I know that sounds innocuous but just wait and see how they visualize it. This tonal approach does not only make it hard for me to lose myself in the dark story it should be telling but also makes me struggle to really believe anyone is in a a huge amount of danger. Toy Story 3 was able to put me on the edge of my seat even when I knew there's no way Woody wouldn't survive to see the next one. But here the plot armor just feels too thick. Whether I was right or not to assume that is besides the point, a story is a journey as much as the destination. Thus a lot of what the movie does well is kind of wasted on itself.I've been very negative so far but as my numerical rating would suggest it isn't really half bad (if you keep your expectations low like me). It's engaging for all the reasons you expect it to be. It has a good concept, a certain amount of atmosphere (reduced dialogue and sound is a bit of a cheat code to that but whatever), a lot of interesting logistics on how they maintain this lifestyle and several well crafted moments of suspense with a superbly convincing set of special effects.To keep myself amused I watched with French subtitles which you can do on Netflix at the moment. And no, I did not miss nuances because of that if I my toot my own horn.The rest of this review will be mainly me listing all the particular small things that annoyed me about this movie:1) They flash up what day number it is. Tell your story visually please, obliging non-diegetics are not scary.2) They show their menace WAY too early. The first time showing it should have been that scene with the nail. And they have a cliche sound too. They could have done so much more to stagger how much we glimpsed at what time but they didn't.3) The daughter is deaf. Really. And it is just a coincidence. An audience can take one coincidence sure, but any motivation for this coincidence comes way too late. Now I think about it maybe the family survived this long because they already knew ASL? I'm still annoyed though.4) Too much back story. The crux of horror is mystery. I don't want to know there are exactly 3! Just make them different colors or something.5) The mother. Emily Blunt's obnoxious portrayal and the irritating characterization made me hope if one person got killed it would be her. ""Who are we if we can't take care of our kids?"" Shut up!6) On that note she is pregnant for most of the movie. I am really sick of pregnant people in horror movies. It does have relevance to the plot to be fair rather than being there strictly to manipulate us into feeling for her rather than actually giving her a personality that doesn't suck. I'm not really mad that they made her pregnant, my problem is that they were a bit...*family values* about the whole thing if you know what I mean.7) The final seconds of this before the credits had my raising a particular finger and saying "" f&£# you, movie"".8) This is something I have only learned reading the FAQs but apparently the creatures are known to have arrived on Earth from a meteor. I mean, I missed it so I guess it was pretty subtle (or maybe my French isn't actually as good as it could be), but it is such a rookie mistake to outright tell us where they're from. I know the cosmos is a big place I'd rather have the origin of the creatures a mystery. But this is emblematic of how one should not think of this as a horror movie; to do so is to ask to be annoyed.In conclusion, we were not cheated exactly but we were spared a classic because they were in denial about what genre this move really is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Praise Song to Parenting; Not Very Scary,"""A Quiet Place"" has received very enthusiastic reviews. I thought it was merely okay. I was not scared for one second, and one goes to films like this to be frightened. ""A Quiet Place"" is a praise song to parents and parenting, and that may be why the film was not able to work its magic on me.Monsters stalk the land, in the case, a rural corn farm in upstate New York. Few survivors remain. The Abbott family - a mother, father, and three children - are eking out their existence the only way they can: quietly. The monsters are blind and hunt by sound.The word ""abbot"" means ""father."" Remember Jesus calling his father ""abba."" ""A Quiet Place"" is a praise song to John Krasinski's role as Lee Abbott, the father in this film, and to fathers in general. Lee does everything for his family, and I do mean everything. If you want to see a movie that deeply respects fathers and fatherhood, go see ""A Quiet Place.""Evelyn Abbott is very maternal. Her status as a mother is emphasized in the most biological of ways. Regan Abbott is their deaf daughter. Just like Regan in ""King Lear,"" this Regan has daddy issues. The family drama plays out with monsters arriving every now and then to attempt to eat someone.The film is a series of set pieces, showing a survivalist family trying to outwit fate with jerry-rigged gizmos. Just imagine what a Mr Fixit Dad would do to your home and property if he were trying to defeat blind monsters that hear well. I wish more use had been made of duct tape, every do-it-yourselfer's best friend.Quite a few of the set-pieces are rather sadistic. The filmmakers do whatever it takes to place each character in unique peril, pain, and agony. One scene was highly reminiscent of a frequently repeated motif, involving sound and those humans most likely to make noise, from Holocaust movies. I was alienated by this sadism. It began to feel manipulative and, at one point at least, completely unbelievable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Horror Film of the Decade,"If you need your films spoon-fed to you with elaborate explanations of everything the characters do, this is not the film for you. if you are incapable of filling in the blanks in what is seen onscreen, this is not the film for you.

This film is like an artist experimenting with negative space - constantly challenging the audience to fill in the blanks.

Remember the original Jurassic Park??,"Completely different film to this! But if you do remember the excitement of watching Jurassic Park for the first time, then watch this film!!It has all those water rippling, Jelly shaking, Velociraptor toe tapping and T-Rex at a windscreen type of moments (Dinosaurs not included).I've recently come back from the cinema from watching this film at an Advanced screening and wow!! Great film!!Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are superb in this film. They are faced with many tough moments and raising a family in this environment only makes it that much harder! They do provide great emotional value and keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish!There is an annoying kid in the film, but i suppose if you put yourself in a similar situation. Perhaps we'd be the same as well..?? I'm not sure but it still doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film.It is a unique film playing with sound and silence! I really do recommend seeing it! There is no huge underlying story of how everything came to be. Its all about the family and how they are living and what goes on in this 90+ minute thriller film!The ""Threat"" in this film i won't mention but i feel i can safely say.. Fantastic Job!!You can definitely take your brain with you into this film. You are aloud to think about the life style in this film and how to survive but if you are really going to delve deeply on the idea of sound and how to live silently you are going to ruin the film for yourself. Just enjoy the film itself for what it is!! Enjoy what goes on and hopefully you'll be as excited and adrenaline filled as I was when i left the cinema!!Have fun! Film is about escapism and i definitely found it! Its so far my favorite film of 2018!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
It will scare you.,"""Who are we if we can't protect them?"" Evelyn (Emily Blunt)As a thriller/horror film, A Quiet Place has its allegorical implications, in this case the parental imperative to protect children. Blind monsters plague the Abbott family, who dare not make a sound because those bad boys have acute hearing, with outsized ears to prove it, in their quest for food, human or otherwise.In this above average nail-biter, writer/director John Krasinski is a deft suspense purveyor, ratcheting it up as the family gets closer to greeting the monsters in person. In adherence to the formula, the suspense builds from establishing the problem that the monsters have put the family in defensive mode, to the inevitable standoff.Blunt and Krasinski (playing husband, Lee) are effective as a loving but challenged couple with two children and one on the way. Because the stars are married in real life, a close bond on film may be the reason they are so good in their roles. Because this is a horror film, our sympathy for the besieged fodder is enhanced by their real marriage.The irony that complete quiet is the bane of the monsters is appropriate for millennials, who would wither if their smart phones were not noisily distracting them every hour of the day.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"A nuanced, intelligent and absolutely gripping film","I dont usually write reviews but i feel compelled to in this case.
A Quiet Place is one of he best movies in recent times in terms of depth of story, intelligence, consistency, and yes, a mad sense of tension that keeps you glued to the edge of your seat. It has a simple yet deeply intriguing premise, but the winner is how beautifully it was shot and executed. There are no wasted moments, no tangents, nothing that doesn't lend value to the story(I never felt my time better respected in recent movies). The acting is phenomenal, and you'll be discussing the story for hours afterwards. It's a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A good thriller/horror,"An interesting experience but possibly required to see in an empty cinema or alone. It is extremely experimental but also sticks to quite a few conversations at the same time.The acting was good, with all the actors having to rely on facial expressions and body language. The child actors are either hit or miss but aren't too noticeable. Sometimes the monsters are terrifying and other times they are just bland. I really enjoy the use of silence in the film, it is so refreshing. However, a cinema setting can be quite hard to remain quiet in as any sound is emphasised.

Original Idea to freshen an old genre,"I've had IMDB for years now. However, I just made this account only to give this movie the 10/10 it deserves. I know everybody can't love one movie, but this movie at least demands respect. The genre of an aliens/creatures apocolypse has been done many times in television, and they've all done just about the same thing. This movie brings new light to the subject by having the creatures rely on sound and sound alone. We don't know where these creatures came from or why they're here (which I love because how they came to existence could be illogical or not make sense and ruin the movie). All we know about them is they're killing machines who hear everything. This makes the characters live in a limited dialogue world where they must rely on sign language, bare feet, and marked pathways to survive. The silence and lack of speaking throughout the film only add to the intense environment.
 The family is a father, Mother, and three children who struggle to survive. They also had to live with the fact that any dropped object, opened door, or activated toy could mean certain death. Adding to the feeling that any character could die at any second. The acting is phenemonal! Everytime a scene demanded intense facial expression or an overwhelming sense of fear the actors delivered flawlessly. The characters are very intelligent and many times throughout the movie I caught myself thinking, ""yeah that's what I would've done too"", which alone separates it from many other horror/thrillers on the market. This movie also isn't full of clichés either, the characters make good decisions for the purpose of surviving. That's another thing to love about this movie, the sole base is survival, there's nothing else to get in the way like plot fillers or wasted time. It's either you live by the rules of this new world, or die.
 John krasinski did beautiful work on this feature film debut that shows just what a father is willing to do to protect his family. Overall I give this movie a 10/10 and will definitely purchase it as soon as it comes out to watch at my leisure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Solid horror film - but usual flaws,"What makes this flick good? Solid acting, directing and suspense. However, as with most sci-fi or horror flicks, it has the usual wonder-why-they-do-stupid-things moments. In fact the whole premise is the stupidity of not being able to fool or kill the creatures. Yes, you can shoot one with one bullet. Not so tough. And they hunt by sound, right. So if you throw a rock far off, you can do the old distraction trick. Why one has to scream and sacrifice one's life makes no sense. You can scream and then run away and fool the creature since it can't know your present position but has to go on to where it last heard sound. Can't even do sonar. That's less effective than little brown bats. Oldest trick in the book is to distract or fool the blind. So why didn't people do that? Maybe people are really dumb. Or the people who came up with the idea are not that bright. And finally, given the sensitivity to sound, yes, of course, that's must be related to the creatures' weakness. Why some military personnel or scientist didn't test and try to eliminate creatures that way. If such creatures really exist, they would have easily been eliminated. So like the usual teen horror movie, we have to question the weak premise of such creatures becoming a dominant specie. Can't happen, sorry, it doesn't make sense.

Extremely Well-Made and Tense Horror Film,"A Quiet Place (2018)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Set during the future where most humans have been killed off by mysterious creatures, parents Lee and Evelyn (John Krasinski, Emily Blunt) must try and defend their children and make sure they can survive. In their world everyone must stay quiet or else the creatures who are blind but have excellent hearing could get them.Each and every year a new horror film is released and somehow word of mouth starts to get around that it's "" the scariest movie ever made"". The hype game on at least one horror movie a year is always very strong and to be honest very rarely does the movie live up to that sort of hype. A QUIET PLACE was 2018's horror movie that was hyped up by critics and fans. I must admit that I was shocked to see how wonderful the film was and that it actually lived up to all of the hype.I'm certainly not going to call this one of the scariest movies ever made because it isn't. What the film does do is create a wonderful atmosphere and is so well-made that you can call it one of the best technical horror films ever made. I say that because the majority of the film is played in dead quiet since the characters can't talk or make any sort of sound. The way director John Krasinski manages to build up the suspense and know when to let the jump scare happen is something you'd expect to see from a filmmaker with more movies under his belt. Wes Craven always said that a director has to know when to go for the scare because if you let the tension go on too long the viewer will give up on it and you lose. That doesn't happen here as Krasinski handles the entire film perfectly.Technically speaking the cinematography was wonderful, the use of music was perfect and I'd argue that the sound effects are some of the best and most important of any movie out there. I really loved the way that the director build this isolated world where these people have to live with a certain set of rules or else they'll die. This is certainly a survivor movie and a darn good one at that. I'm going to avoid spoilers but there's something that happens that cast some darkness over this family and it pays off extremely well as the film plays out.The performances are also extremely good with both Blunt and Krasinski leading the way. The both of them have to do a lot of acting without talking so this is always challenging to an actor. The way both of them react with their eyes and body movements was perfectly done and both really delivered what the parts called for. Both Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe were very good in their roles and what really helped all four actors is that they really did seem like a real family.A QUIET PLACE did have a flaw or two but they certainly didn't damage the movie too bad and it was mostly just a couple things that characters did. With that said, this is so well-made that one can't help but be impressed by what the writers and director pulled off. There's some great tension throughout and this is certainly one of the better horror movies in recent years.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Psssst.....'A Quiet Place' is a Good Place,"................................................oh sorry, I was trying to be quiet with the review. Oops.Whispers: ""A Quiet Place"" serves as one of the freshest and most well-directed thriller/horror experiences to date by successfully reinventing the use of one of horror's biggest tropes: the silence before the scare.Sometime before the present story, alien creatures arrived on earth that are blind as a bat but have a heightened sense of sound and speed to track their prey. These creatures appear to have wiped out the majority of the population (both human and animal alike) with only a few scattered families remaining, including the protagonist unit of the Abbot family. This family attempts to survive on limited resources and deal with each other's family drama all the while having to remain as silent as possible to hide from 3 creatures lurking in their woods.The gimmick of the film is that characters have to refrain from all loud noises in order to survive. Even the simple sounds of walking on leaves or creaky floors and even moving plastic board game pieces could attract unwanted attention. If that can get you killed, image what knocking over a lantern could do. Or you could also try to give birth to a baby. The idea of using silence to heighten fear is nothing new to horror, but in ""A Quiet Place"" the technique is made even more effective as now ANY sound is deadly and scary. It practically makes the use of jump scares seem less lazy again.Since the characters can't make even make heavy foot noises, the use of speech is rendered useless and characters must rely on American Sign Language as the main form of communication...translated to the audience via subtitles. This was first used efficiently on the big screen with Fox's new Planet of the Ape trilogy for the ape to ape dialogue. With a few exceptions where characters are near spots making natural noises louder than their voices, this is a dialogue-free film. One could compare the film to that of a foreign made one with subtitles or even the old silent pictures of the 1920s. ""A Quiet Place"" relies mostly on visuals and saves its moments of sound like it is a limited resource. I am sure some audiences will find this boring after some time...because lord forbid there be even an ounce of patience left in the general audience today. Still, I can safely say ""A Quiet Place"" handles these techniques to the highest level of quality.This is made possible from director and lead star John Krasinski who proves that both behind the camera and in front of it, he is more than just ""Jim from the Office"". Krasinski helms the film in a very Hitchcockian manner or even that of Kubrick's ""The Shining"". It's deliberate and slow, allowing for the audience to take in the atmosphere and the rules of the world in a smart way. The audience is treated with the respect to put all the pieces together by delivering the exposition only in visual or implied means. In a sense, the lack of dialogue forces the film to use old-fashioned storytelling, which makes for good storytelling overall.The only complaints are mostly nitpicks based around certain moments of character behavior. Some characters do things that you really would think they would be smart enough not to, such as keeping a toy that literally was just established as a noisemaker or running off into the woods by yourself to throw a private hissy fit (though to be fair, the whole ""unrealistically foolish decisions"" thing seems to be a common trope for horror movies in general).Then there was the plot point of the mom of the family being pregnant. In a world where noise is literally death, why would you risk getting pregnant (it is clear she got like this AFTER the world went into a mute hell)? Even more so...how did you manage to ""procreate"" without making noise? On second thought, perhaps the less we know the better...Still, these are little nitpicks that are basically overshadowed by all the greatness around them. ""A Quiet Place"" takes a seat right next to last year's ""It"" as modern-day proof that horror can still be superb. But if you feel the need to give a standing ovation...remember: silent claps.P.S. In reference to the people that sat behind me in the theater: If you saw the film prior to bringing your friends to see it again...perhaps don't say what's about to happen. That would be greatly appreciated, please.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"This is not horror, or decent for that matter.","First off, this movie is downright not a horror flick or ""full of suspense"" as implied. It is pretty tame and lacks that edge. I don't understand critic reviews calling it terrifying when I grew up with movies like The Ring, The Blair Witch project, What Lies Beneath and other actual horror movies that made me deathly afraid of inanimate objects and the dark for over a decade.As per mentioned in many of the other user reviews, this movie has some MAJOR plot holes that are so glaringly obvious it almost feels insulting that we the audience are supposed to not be able to see them. There is such a thing as suspense of belief to make a movie more interesting, but this one takes it above and beyond.The creatures in the movie are sadly a rip-off, modeled from a very popular TV series which should become obvious if you watch the show (not to be mentioned so not to spoil anything). A few changes here and there and voila! An ""original"" creature.I found myself bored watching this, becoming increasingly infuriated as more idiotic things happened which made me wonder how this is getting such a good reception.

Close to perfection,"Honestly one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had. Watched it in 4DX with all kinds of effects, which really added, but the movie itself were phenomenal standing on its own.
Near the end (no spoilers), I do believe an event happened that was pretty unnecessary considering the weaponised circumstances, but it was a minor flaw.
The sound effects and beautiful visuals create an atmospheric experience hard to forget. I caught myself multiple times thinking: ""Goodness, the creativity of the set is unbelievably impressing and almost original.""
The acting: superb. The storytelling in general is excellent, although many of the ideas (a sense triggers monsters in a post-apocalyptic world, making it almost impossible for the survivors to use it; among the survivors are a pregnant woman which comes into play in the story, etc.) seems like a kind of rip-off from the novel Bird Box by Josh Malerman, which I believe won't get its movie now because this one is simply too close. I'd say, even though I'm a fan of the novel, I highly doubt it can get anywhere near the perfection that A Quiet Place is, and if you like horror-thrillers, please don't make the mistake of missing this one!

A Quiet Place: 8.7,"A Quiet Place is a movie with few words, but it's loud. As the silence goes on it slingshots the volume of every creak and scratch in the movie upwards. All thanks to the genius premise. In today's horror movies monsters have become kind of dull. The simple change in senses to the monsters in A Quiet Place makes them a lingering omnipresence that stays with you the entire movie. No matter what scene you're watching you are tyrannically and desperately trying to control the sounds each character makes. No matter what emotion you feel or thought that you think, the monsters presence is always there. The opening of the movie introduces you to the next hour and twenty minutes that you'll have to experience, and it summarizes the entire experience of the movie in itself. That's what a good opening should do. Every sound heard in this movie finds it's way to the panic button in your brain. Even the slightest sounds hit you with a sliver of anxiety. The dynamic duo of John Krasinski and Emily Blunt elevate your desire to see their family survive, more so than if anyone else were in the Father and Mother roles. They are fantastic. The Father's relationship with his daughter is what drives the story, and the problems with their relationship are solved in a very emotive way. The Monsters design was very unsettling, it gives you the same sensations as eating food that doesn't sit in your stomach right. These creatures stick in your head even after the ending of the first movie you watch after watching A Quiet Place. The movie achieves the getting to it's spectacular ending without falling into the trap that Horror movies fall into. That being the trap of everybody in the story being a complete idiot only the story can move along. It successfully steers clear of even giving you thought of idiocy. The only trap this movie occasionally falls into is the few cliche jump-scare and fake-outs that every horror movie seems to have now. Also there's only one hiccup of logic that is unbelievable, and may take you out of the movie for a moment. Overall, A Quiet Place is a brisk Horror/Thriller that pushes all of the fear buttons, but doesn't tire you out by overstaying it's welcome, thanks to it's perfect runtime. So I give it an 8.7",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Blown Away.,"Wow. As someone who doesn't like most horror/thrillers, I'm quite amazed. The movie revolves around a smart family of characters that are expertly written and acted, the plot is new, & it feels fresh to modern cinema.

Tension tighter than a loaded gun,"Tension tighter than a loaded gun. As soon as the film starts rolling the tension beings to tighten and it does not let off during its entire 1 hour and 25 min run time. Now that may seem like a short film, but with the movies lack of dialogue this runtime is actually perfect for its style. In a world where a great horror movie is near impossible to find, a quiet place will leave you picking your jaw up off he floor on multiple occasions. Watching this film in theatres may have been one of the best movie watching experiences I have ever had. The director had the audience in the palm of his hands the entire film and you could feel the suspense in the thick air of a packed theatre. Everyone on the edge of their seat trying as quiet as possible to scarf down their popcorn during the silence of A Quiet Place. With an amazingly strong cast and even more amazing directional debut by John Krasinski A Quiet Place is not a film you want to miss watching on the big screen. So find a theatre that is still showing this original thriller and grab a ticket, just remember not forget your jaw on the floor on your way out.A Quiet Place 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Quiet Place both silences and deafens you.,"Like 'Lights Out', it's another horror thriller that chooses one sensory organ and manipulates it to create an original captivating concept. For reasons unbeknown to us, the world has been invaded by predators that utilise sound waves to hunt their prey. A rural family use both their intelligence and fearlessness as they attempt to survive the hostile environment. Modern monster flicks seem to consist of colossal creatures causing chaos in catastrophic calamities (try saying that when drunk...), so it's incredibly refreshing to see a minimised version that focuses on tension as opposed to obstreperous dullness. Extraterrestrials roaming the countryside listening out to the slightest of buzzes, before rampaging across the corn fields and demolishing the source. Grotesque yet creatively designed creatures that are shrouded in an ominous veil. A horror debut for John Krasinski, he embedded a sense of deftness which enhanced the cinematic quality. Extremely slow movements during the non-verbal scenes (which is practically the whole film) to then suddenly speed up as your heart starts pounding. Krasinski and Blunt's real-life chemistry was replicated here, as two endearing parents who have experienced both love and loss during this external torment. The characterisation was adequate throughout given that the actors exhumed emotion through facial expressions and sign language. Sound editing was phenomenal, especially if a noisy object like a toy rocket is activated. Fear is endured...then silence. So effective! However, I struggled with certain aspects. The narrative just couldn't maintain momentum after the exhausting first half, which only leads to a satisfactory conclusion. Various character choices were unquestionably idiotic. Getting pregnant? In this horrific situation? Stupid. There are others to which I just rolled my eyes, and unfortunately detracted from the sensory auditory viewing. Overall, a promising genre debut for Krasinski who has crafted a thriller that invades the senses, leaving you fatigued by the end. Just don't overthink it...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
effective scares nonsensical ideas work against it,"Essentially this is an excuse for a bunch of SHOCKINGLY LOUD sound effects. Which will make you jump. On the whole Krasinski shows himself to be a better director than writer, and or the multiple writers added enough elements that the follow through doesn't work out.As I left the theatre I could already hear people complaining about things that didn't make sense in the film.It does involve you in the family's plight, but a key main plot point doesn't really make sense and keeps not making sense as it creates various suspense scenes.There are both questions that aren't answered and answers that don't make sense and raise more questions that are better left not asked. Once you are done being shocked by some enormous noise and mostly effective set pieces--sort of like those in Jurassic Park, you keep getting distracted by the nonsense.Technically and from a craftsmanship point of view the movie is slick in a good sense with the needed good sound design and with a better than average Beltrami music score that helps the scares and connects the family love elements.Creatures are all CG but for the most part well done, they get a little less interesting the more we see of them and for creatures that have sensitive hearing they make an awful lot of noise, an awful lot--just one of the movies logic problems. By the end SPAWN fans will wonder what he's doing running around in this film.You could say this movie has that Hollywood weakness of wanted an effect more than a reason for those effects. And in this case there is drama and melodrama the film is wanting to create and does.There is very little dialogue in the film though a bit too much subtitling--as they family uses sign language to communicate, the few real dialogue scenes are ok with one poor exception being a phony father son talk with the kid talks like 70 year old worldly woman.You'll be on the edge of your seat until you aren't and then it all starts to fall apart, too bad.Let me put it to you this way what's the first thing you'd do with your wife in a world where silence is key to survival?Yeah, well, you're answer won't be what these parents do. Never.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Orginal storyline,"Its another monster movie, but with a twist. I like the dynamic this movie adds that goes hand and hand with the monsters weakness (without giving too much away).

Again, not to give too much away, but how one of the main characters dies in the film left me scratching my head, there was other options in that scenario.

Good concept with a terrible plot.,"I watched this movie i have to say that it was a fresh and new concept. As a lot of people have said in other reviews that it's not possible to stay quiet completely and the movie and concept is stupid, they need to realize that it's a movie, and you have the freedom to show something that is not real, once you see the movie you will see the whole idea of the movie is well executed. Now talking about the plot of the movie, in this case it lacks them both, and is all over the place. Character development is also not so good, you won't be emotionally invested in the characters as much. All in all the movie is a good watch but i would only recommend watching it, if you are person who is into fantasy and horror genres.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Pretty Good Suspence/Horror Movie,"A Quiet Place is a pretty good movie. It keeps the viewer in suspense for the entire film. I thought that the ending was kind of weak, And, this is one of the reasons why I only gave this film a seven out of ten. There were, also, a few major holes in the story that were just plain illogical. For one, why would this family leave their vulnerable, little four year old son to trail behind them, unsupervised, as they walked through a very dangerous wooded area. It made no sense. It was obviously a disaster waiting to happen. But, the biggest hole in the story was how easily these carnivorous, fresh-eating monsters could be killed. A shot gun blast is all it took to kill one. If there doesn't happen to be a shotgun handy, they can also be subdued with a high pitched sound. If these creatures could be done away with so easily, how did they manage to kill, and eat most of the population of earth? Again, it just doesn't add up. So, to sum things up, it was a very entertaining suspense film, with some serious holes in the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Acting Awesome Directing.,"This is one of the best horror/thriller/sci-fi/suspense/stories that has been made in a LONG time.

How our capacity to love conquers what logically could be seen as abject hopelessness. This is a tremendous story stressing POSITIVITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT.....something not in vogue in Hollywood, or our world....I'll take hope, love, truth, compassion, self sacrifice, and strength of human inherent goodness EVERY CHANCE I GET vs the divisiveness, hopelessness, selfishness, materialism that we get sold every day.

"Rivetting, suspenseful and scary","Let me say right from the outset that I am not a fan of horror movies. That''s because a vast number of them are just plain dumb, paying more attention to being 'scary' than to being plausible or even sensible. Also, I've never been a fan of getting creeped out just for the sake of being creeped out. I know some people like that experience, but not me. That's why it is such a surprise for me to say how great this movie is. To be fair, it's wrong to call it a horror movie. It's a suspense movie, but it is definitely scary and, best of all, it is intelligent. The acting throughout from quite a small cast is brilliant. You will be drawn in to the lives of this family as they face.... well, I'm not going to drop any spoilers here; you'll have to watch it and see. Wisely the producers kept this punchy and have not to let it drag out. It comes in at just around 90 minutes, and you will be on the edge of your seat for most of them. I read that a sequel to this is in the works and if that is so then I say bring it on! This is one movie that merits it. I can't praise this movie enough and give it a hearty recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Walked out of the movie, Amazed.","I went to the movie with mixed expectations. The trailer showed a plot that seemed interesting and thrilling, but was portrayed as a horror movie. Don't get me wrong, the creatures in this film were scary! But the underlying tone of the film is a thriller and shouldn't be turned away by people who don't like horror movies. The gore is minimal/non-exsistant and that is what made this right up my alley. 
I also heard so many mixed reviews about how quiet the movie is but I went into it thinking 'it is OK, I don't mind hearing whispers or wrappers from others in the theater.'. In the beginning of the film, there was theater noise and it started to become a little irritating. 
The movie quickly turned into a immersive experience, I even watched it thinking I needed to eat quieter and even forego my popcorn all together because I would be heard! The entire audience seemed to follow the same line as they tried to keep quiet. I loved that aspect and how it brought the movie into the theater. 
Yes, some plot holes were apparent but there were many other well thought out plot points, made this movie one of the best I have seen in a long time!
I laughed, I cringed, and I even cried (twice). The range of emotion depicted was beautiful and I wouldn't mind seeing it again (even in the theater).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

This movie though seems as if they did not give a second thought to how plausible the scenes were, nor how any likable heroic character would act to protect their family.It's an entertaining movie with good acting and quality production but don't go into it expecting it to be meet the expectations set by the over the top reviews.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The Most Terrifying and Tense film ive seen - Ever!,"First up i must tell you that i am a horror and Sci Fi fan and nothing more pleases me than a movie that scares the crap out of everyone. Ive seen many in my time that make me jump, for example the classics like Alien, Poltergiest, The Amityville Horror & Friday the 13th to modern ones like Sinister, the new It and Insidous, but nothing comes anywhere near as close to the tension that you get in A Quiet Place.The main difference is a simple one. In these classics there are moments that make you jump but here it is relentless for its 85 mins running time. You cannot take your eyes off the screen. And whats even more amazing is that if anyone in the cinema make a noise (like rustling of papers and food, then members of the audience are telling people to be quiet!Its a simple story, there has been an outbreak all over the world that has caused strange creatures to kill everything. and there are not many survivors. All we know is that the creatures are attracted to sound. We follow one family as they struggle to survive in a silent world. But circumstances arise that cause certain noises which then lead to extreme danger.Whats great about this film is that although its a horror, there is hardly any gory violence, hardly any bad language (in fact hardly any spoken words at all!) its just pure terror.The director and cast are superb. Emily Blunt is one of my favourite actresses and she plays the troubled wife really well and the young deaf mute daughter is portrayed perfectly by Millicent Simmonds.Being a Hitchcock fan, i can only imagine that this is the film he should have made if he was alive today.

This is my kinda film!,"Right from the opening shots I was sold. Tense. Near silent. Unknown danger. A strange normality settling into a world that is clearly anything but. I don't know why, I've always loved post-apocalyptic stories, but so often they're done badly, this... is... not. This is carefully constructed, meticulously detailed, achingly patient, with its pacing, with its characters. Brimming with an underbelly of violence, the surface still teams with a soft compassion and desire. Now that all sounds rather fluffy I know, that's because watching this I couldn't help but feel enveloped by the love and ingenuity of the on screen family, as they strive and attempt to control what's happening to them, but make no mistake, there's gut wrenching elements here. It's the play between the serene and the peril that makes this enthralling cinema. Edge of the seat stuff, on several occasions making me audibly gasp. The strength here though, as with all good films, is the characters, their defiance, their humanity, without caring for them you've got nothing, but I did care and willed them on through every marvellously terrifying twist.

A quiet movie that says a lot,"A Quiet Place was written and directed and stars John Krasinski alongside his real life wife, Emily Blunt with Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe in this fantastically written and directed horror/thriller about not making a single sound. And trust me this movie is making plenty of sounds with how popular and talked about it is for how amazing it is.Krasinski makes extremely bold decisions with this film. Between it's extreme lack of dialogue, I counted only two scenes of dialogue scenes and the rest is from visuals or signing to one another. The direction to this film is amazing and feels like Krasinski has been doing directing his whole life in this film. And the extremely smart choice of Blunt being his on screen wife makes this film one of the most memorable performances by her ever.The writing of this film I can only imagine on script is a lot of parentheses explaining in detail what each character does with their movements and looks and of course the main dialogue is just signing and explaining what they sign throughout it. But the attention to detail with how they explain just about every question I had in this film through visuals and how they have survived so long. And of course some questions they didn't explain but I'm happy they kept them out for pacing and for the chance of ruining the whole story with it possibly becoming an exposition scene from it.The acting is some of the finest acting all year, Every second Blunt or Krasinski was on screen I was mesmerized by their performances and cared so deeply for their characters alongside with the child actors from the first second to final I was worried and wanting to bite my nails for how great they were on this film for nothing to happen to them at all.With this film being so quiet and having very little dialogue I don't really have much to say about it besides see it and get your own opinion on it.But my only complaint with this film is the electrical issues with some places having electricity and others have nothing but candles and lanterns. But besides that this film is fantastic and definitely a film worth seeing multiple times.A Quiet Place gets a 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Spoiler alert: I walked out after 30 minutes,"Yet another abysmal production of post-apocalyptic half-witted what-ifs that tries its utmost best to leave you mentally scarred for life.

Better than average horror,"This movie contains violence towards kids. As a dad I am really sensitive to seeing bad stuff happen to kids in movies and tv. There is no real gore, a couple of scenes where you see some blood but they did a good job of keeping it pg.Weird monsters have taken over the world that hunt by sound so the whole premise is for the characters to stay quiet. The movie does a good job of building tension by using this idea and only teasing of the dangers surrounding the characters. We don't get a full reveal until much further into the movie.There are some problems with this movie as with any movie but it was entertaining enough for me to look past it's problems and just enjoy it for what it was, a fun scary movie (well, my level of scary anyway).This kind of reminded me of that movie Reign of Fire where the world is taken over by dragons, mixed with the fixation of a global event but from the eyes of a family like in Signs.

Suspenseful,"The movie deals with a very basic concept. What if monsters attacked you based on sound.That really is it. You follow the Abbott family in this dystonia where every movement, every breath has to be done as quietly and delicately as possible. Even something as basic as taking a pill bottle off a shelf is suspenseful as you hold your breath wondering if it'll be too loud.Watching this in a crowded theater it was amazing how loud opening a bag of chips sounded (and yes I stopped and shoved it under the chair. I'm sorry!) The actors were very expressive as they had to use facial expressions and sign language to get their point across wordlessly. Whenever sound was present in the movie it gave you a jump.Millicent Simmonds was amazing as the daughter and Emily Blunt's performance as the mother put everyone on the edge of their seats.The only reason I'm removing two stars is that there was a glaring plot hole in this movie. Monsters who are sensitive to sound, so much so that loud noises and high frequencies repel them would stay away from humans generally and humans in a large city specifically... Thankfully the focus of the movie was the family which gives it somewhat of a pass.

Unfortunately all we seem to get are constantly repeated sequences where the singu!ar event of the family being terrorised is repeated over and over.It has some originality, it's certainly well acted, well produced, with strong production, but my interest was lost about ten minutes in, and never fully returned.

Future Horror classic,"One of the best Horror thriller in years. It is also one of the most ambitious films of the genre in a very long time. Almost establishing a new genre: The Silent horror thriller, because there is literarily not much to say about the dialogue as it is almost not existing. It contains more sign language than actually spoken words. But this was an interesting effect which actually worked extremely well because so the audience concentrated on the images with with director John Kransinski told the story. He also stars in the male lead role as a father who protects his family from monsters who react on any kind of noise, so they live in total silence. He and his wife Emily Blunt also poetry grieving parents and that is a serious element of the story which gives it a very special touch as well. And if life wouldn't be difficult enough Blunt's character is also pregnant... and besides a child birth which is obviously loud.. the audience permanently asks themselves... how will they prevent the baby from screaming... which comes natural? At least that was one question I had all the time which was one of the factors that kept the film extremely interesting. I had a few issues with some logic holes which is the reason I dont give it a higher rating. Besides John Kransinski and the wonderful performance by Emily Blunt we see another great turn by Millicent Simmonds who works so well with her facial expressions. It got a great score which adds to the sometimes unbearably nervous atmosphere just well. Good film and a future horror classic for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Beautiful Place,"I just got through watching John Krasinki's ""A Quiet Place"" in my local theater and I absolutely loved it. A lot of other people are extremely nitpicky about certain choices the family in the film made, but personally, while I do find some merit in their arguments, I think they failed to see the larger tale being told here, a survival story about a loving family and how their lives are inexplicably altered after an unknown menace descends upon their world. This ""menace"" takes the form of grotesque, Lovecraftian type creatures which as the title may hint at, are completely blind and hunt using their highly developed sense of hearing. 
Watching this highly suspenseful survival thriller reminded me a lot of older films with similar themes such as Shyamalan's ""Signs"" which also similarly focuses on one family trying to survive an alien menace descending into the world and lives, threatening to tear it apart. 
The deadly creatures in this film are never fully explained as to what they are or where they came from, but I personally didn't mind that, because that's not the focus of the story, and was never intended to be. I see it more as a story about perseverance and the strength of familial bonds even under harrowing, life-threatening circumstances. Even though their lives are now completely changed and every day becomes a question of survival, that still does not prevent them from laughing, having fun, and enjoying their day to day existence. Not once do they despair over how bad things are, how their real lives are essentially over, how they'll feel safe again. They're fully aware of the sort of world they now inhabit, and that death and loss are inevitable, but life goes on.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
John Krasinski's favourite band is Nine Inch Nails,"Interesting idea and for his first directorial debut I would say well done that man.
But first if you're seeing this in the cinema take it from me, Don't get Ice in your drink, don't get crisps or other noisy crunchy type food, stick to Marshmallows. I had this big lad sitting next to me in one of those leather recliner seats and he kept moving his body weight so I could hear every squeak of the leather and he had ice in his drink and crisps. If I could have got that nail out the step in the movie I would have shoved it in his temple.Anyway that's out of the way, it is enjoyable and tense you are aware of every noise the background music is subtle and well done. The whole scene around the water breaking and the birth is very good and keeps you on the edge of your seat. One thing I didn't understand was why go barefoot everywhere I would have put a few pair of socks on my feet to maintain quiet but I suppose bare feet cuts down on the washing.

GENRE BENDING MASTERPIECE!!,"Mute mode is the new horror, proves John Krasinski. 'A Quiet Place' is the most gratifying horror experience I've ever had. It's terrifying from the word go. The creature in the movie is exceptionally CGIed. I loved watching it. Initially you may think it's an Alien movie inspired creature, but it felt way distant than a Xenomorph.The duration of the film is 95 minutes. 
The premise is a family trying to survive three alien things. Your advantage is your disadvantage. They're blind but brilliant listeners. They have ears like fish gills built all over their head. The Abbott family is in an enclosed apocalyptic environment and the chances of being alive is solely based on their silence. Everything felt so originally composed.
The film is amazingly paced for a thriller plot. The super brilliant usage of sound aroused my tension and literally made me freeze a couple of times. The sounds effects fueled the scares.We've all been to horror movies and what we usually do is that we try to outsmart the director. We loose focus on it's details trying to predict the place from which the ghost pops out. 
But A Quiet Place is where these predictions bite the dust.Lastly and most importantly, without the extraordinary performance of Emily Blunt this movie wouldn't have been 'this movie'. She was terrific and backed Krasinski in solid manner. 
The Mother giving birth to her child scene is truly one of the most intense and brilliantly executed scenes ever in a horror movie. With his artistry, John Krasinski has upped the ante for future film makers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

We shout out loud with gratitude in the face of an archaic cinema facet revivified by post-modern suspense genre: Silence,"What was the last time you watched a nearly-silent suspense film made by a major Hollywood studio? It seems that this question has no answer. The main originality builder here is its ability to evolve in a particular not-talking film, that's already a bombshell. With an over limited use of dialogues and an intrepid skill in conceiving an irrefutably captivating story with coherence and vigor, it seems impossible to make a movie without the actor's voice, for many artists is a requirement for storytelling understandability, since the characters are the link to the viewer, they make the connection, but, not all the stories take this kind of paths. From page one of the script what writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods wanted was to stick a plot in absolute silence, because precisely this was the thematic thread around the story would derive, its almost complete leading and its unbelievable results become the film into a must-see, because in addition to the pictures, it profits from the unbeatable performances and incredible cinematographic tricks to replace the imperceptible emptiness of any human noise. Broadly speaking, this kinematic tool seems to be the engine of the idea, however, dissecting my own experience and some spectators' opinions, such a factor didn't work in top form. We agree that the first two halves of the film, despite determined exceptional moments, fall abruptly, losing the constancy of its sporadically dynamic, frenetic pace, causing sadly distraction or disconnection in the public with the flick. But these are eventual failures and flaws, quickly saved by the aforementioned sequences, which share authenticity, beauty and horror in comparable conditions.The second wise move is, of course, the story. Divided into daily chapters, the settling of a not-too-distant utopia sets the plot as a rich center of ambitious possibilities, which knows how to use very well. Around orange woods, a beautiful river and a country house adorned by cornfields, the story puts its eye on an American family that is severely affected by a literally unexplained human extinction, which, in a kind of modern twist to George A. Romero's masterpiece, was aggressively reduced by some annihilating creatures, very similar to Ridley Scott's alien, that possess an overdeveloped sense of hearing, oxide beasts that have imposed just one rule on people who wants to survive: zero sounds. With this setting, the family will undertake a hard survival path to hell in a land where nothing is seen, but everything is heard. Although cinema has often shown humanity as an endangered species- of course, most in YA film adaptations, -a horror story had never used it in such a clever and impressive way, here monumental destructions are not of metropolis or nations, the powerful destructions are the plot twists and the consequences these horrific rust animals stir up. Likewise, the script allows each of the characters to develop in an organic, emotional and cohesive way, as the actions of one member have an impact on the other, thus forming a complex chain in which each character is vital to the other. The twists are perfect, unexpected and painful. Heartbreaking, they're simply afflictive as these are the ones that make to weep many silent viewers, extremely well-achieved tear-jerking moments, a film rich in worries. Nonetheless, many resolutions fall into commonplaces, verbi gratia, putting a major character in jeopardy, at first glance, seems risky, indeed, very few take seriously that something is going wrong, and it's a shame because the incredible tension given to the last act is undermined, but beware, don't trust yourself, because there are surprises, awesome surprises.It's worth highlighting an underlying social and political character in the script, subjects with a chance of controversy and debate. Placing the first minutes of the movie precisely in the year in which a new American president was elected and scattering enigmatic and renowned newspapers on walls and paths attribute a latent denotation of political nature, perhaps, putting an emphasis on the big role that the United States has inside this annihilation. The origin or purpose of the instinctive creatures is never clearly revealed, but it could attributable some responsibility to some kind of authoritarian rule; a fiction not too distant from our reality.Only seven characters on screen, three of them are single-use narrative gears, but the story keeps above water in large part due to the refulgent, strong performances. Assuredly the broad recognition of the Hollywood-stars couple helped in the global reach of the film and the feeling of each moment, possibly because father and mother are husband and wife in real life.There's no complaint as for the artistic field, indeed, here is where the film shows some of its best bets. Mainly, the clever camera movements leading the film because they encompass the essence of the moments; dolly moves, zooms and blurs and some hand-held camera shots behind or in front of the characters produce insecurity and discomfort. Likewise, the angles chosen by the filmmaker/actor are coupled with the meaning of each scene, the picture gets narrative power, necessary due to the absence of constant dialogues. The cinematography of Charlotte Bruus Christensen, who had previously worked in ""Molly's Game"", ""Fences"" and ""The Girl On The Train"", achieves an unparalleled, threatening and alarming imagery all the runtime, the viewers never feel confident, much less relaxed, among the foliage of the forest or the dense corn crops. Leaning on a numerous production crew, the film mutates into a kind of test in which the slightest error (crunch) leads to the worst final, there are marks on the ground indicating where they can and cannot step on, noisy elements are eliminated, nobody wears footwear and all the paths are delimited by white sand that looks more sinister than it should, even a newborn's whining aren't allowed in a world that must remain forever in mute.Christopher Tellefsen deserves personalized recognition thanks to his decision of reducing as much as possible the length, synthesizing the crucial parts and discarding what doesn't contribute, focusing the core of an entertaining genre film. Time flies by as situations are located in the right place, carefully beneficial choices. After the screening, I found four memorable scenes, dark dreams coming true thanks to a set of artistic and creative components to achieve such level of effectiveness and unbeatable naturalness: The first one takes place at the beginning, just before the main titles make their appearance as vanishing powder; the second one is an incident inside a creepy silo; The third one is a painful sacrifice demanding a few wipes and the fourth one, exhibited in the last act, is starring Emily Blunt in a bathtub and the danger lurking, certainly brutal and the best of all the movie by far.The sound section is good, but that isn't enough. Despite pictures had to execute the narrative function the dialogues could not, the accompaniment was to be exceptional, as original as the ideas of the script and terribly disturbing as it should be in a horror film. Two Oscar nominations, but Marco Beltrami's soundtrack doesn't have much to highlight because it complies with simple emotional, atmospheric compositions and loudly cheap high-sounding sounds when the creatures make their entrance, it's quite common and unimaginative in a manner of speaking. A huge dissatisfaction with such powerful references, however, the biggest disappointment was the sound editing work, which plays its role half-heartedly, it doesn't use an important feature in the way it should, a terrible flaw. While on several occasions a good frightening impact is achieved by breaking the silence with an accidental sound, all the alternatives the story had are not explored.With his third work as a director, John Krasinski burst into as an inventive and original voice for suspense genre. His film is a tension construction class, as well as a visual delight thanks to a sensible and exciting perspective on a story that isn't wasted. It's amazing to see how he understands the function of each camera movement, knows how to keep an exquisite timing between the characters and sets up vicious sequences that leave the spectator petrified. We place a value on the prioritization of the coherence and storytelling sharpness, bringing the characters in the foreground, not relegating efficient jump-scares with oppressive atmospheres leading to a breathtaking climax. Like hotcakes on the tables of the major studios, he announces himself as one of the most innovative Hollywood filmmakers and screenwriters at the expense of this spectacular debut that took everyone by surprise - let's just look at its worldwide box office, making ""horror"" movie history - not for his role as an actor, but for his unexpected endowments as far as cinematographic constructions are concerned.""A Quiet Place"" by John Krasinski is a dystopian, heartbreaking, nerve-wracking nightmare, any reluctant spectator will end up surrendering to the supreme tension of this sci-fi thriller starring the never quiet life of this prepared family. Sometimes intense, poignant and irrecoverably tense; the humanity in its narrative mechanisms, the power of the pictures and the fireproof charm between the leads guarantee one of the best forays in the genre this year; alongside ""Get Out"" by Jordan Peele, it's really fascinating many comedy actors keep tremendous creative minds for different genres, ironic thing, we find horror in humor. Great achievements and broken promises, the film leaves an inexplicably bittersweet flavor, perhaps more bitter than sweet, because it disappoints to understand that most of the time, when hyper-positive buzz catapults a film tends to be a dissonant marketing squeal.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A nifty idea with its share of contrivances,"A Quiet Place is a nifty idea for a film that, in terms of plot, expects us to buy a lot. We have seen silent films and we have seen movies short on dialogue (one of my favorites being 2013's All Is Lost) although the role played by silence in John Krasinski's horror thriller is an interesting one. You would be right to compare the film to 2016's Don't Breathe, but the ambition here is even greater.Sadly, this does not mean a better movie. While certainly more clever than other examples of its genre, it fails to avoid the story-convenient character stupidity (or rather momentary lapses of caution from otherwise well-prepared characters) and such clichés as the ever-resilient ""jump scare"" tactic. Admittedly, it might make more sense to include such scares in a horror movie like this than most others.I should clarify: the story is set on a scarcely populated future Earth, where only a few human beings have survived the arrival of deadly creatures; creatures which are blind as bats but extremely sensitive to sound. Because of this, the remaining humans try to live in nigh complete silence - creating paths of sand to walk and conversing via sign language - barring those who can bear no more and scream until the creatures find them.The year is 2020. Lee Abbott (Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) try to prevail along with their three children - one of them being deaf (perhaps more than one), which usefully explains this particular family's proficiency in American sign language. We are lead to assume other members of the species weren't so fortunate, at least not within close range of the Abbott family.To keep silent, they eat decidedly non-crunchy food, and as mentioned, rely solely on non-verbal communication (a rule which is broken by our heroes at a few inopportune occasions). This makes for a series of uniquely tense moments, even when we question the decision that brought us there. The build-up is expertly done, the camera giving us a good look at the things that are likely to break the silence and doom our heroes (the accompanying sound editing is masterful). Unfortunately, details like this compel us to wonder what else would be making noise but doesn't.I don't know if I can recommend this movie in a theatre, as not everyone will be lucky to be in the company of an audience that has the patience or attention span to let the silence of the movie engulf them. Douglas Adams used the term ""terribly ghastly silence"" when the Vogon fleet arrived and our world suffered for its inability to read the appropriate demolition orders and planning charts. This is probably the sort of silence we experience when we visit the world as seen in A Quiet Place. All the everyday noises we're used to are very noticeably not there. Unless your fellow movie-goers have smartphones to check.Ultimately, the result is a mix. To reiterate, A Quiet Place isn't free from the clichés and contrivances that plague this genre (the obligatory family photographs play their usual part and there is no way that, as the film insists, the humans we follow are the first to discover the creatures' weakness), but it is a considerable directing effort on the part of Krasinski. It looks beautiful and convincing. Its lack of sound sets it apart. Oh, and these are some stellar performances from participants of all ages.I commend the film for its ambition and Krasinski for his skillful attempts to turn himself into something more than simply ""Jim from The Office"" - we'll see how that goes. It has problems, but I couldn't stop appreciating what it was doing, nor could I get over the fact that I wasn't watching After Earth, which arguably features alien monsters similar to the lifeforms in A Quiet Place. Granted, the former movie is much funnier.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

It starts out well, unfolds smoothly, hits you with all the right feels, keeps you hooked and ends right when you wants it to end.Just the right movie to watch in a horror/monster genre right now with the best of old and new stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Very gripping movie with some exceptional acting performances! A must watch.,"Best one I have watched in recent times. Wanted to watch it only because of our beloved 'Jim'. What a career growth he is having and man, what a story!! First 10mins of the movie makes you shut up and listen without making any sound. Emily's acting is by far the best performance in her career, and there's no doubt that she's gonna a win a lot of awards for this one. The sequence where John says 'I love you' to her daughter was one of the best scenes you'll ever watch.Very gripping movie!! More than worth it!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic story and acting,This has one of the best original stories I have seen in a while. The actors are amazing at showing all kinds of emotions with only facial expressions. The sound crew should get a bonus check for the work and editing they had to put into this. I would highly recommend watching in theatres and even owning it once it hits dvd or blu-ray.

Good original thriller,"A Quiet Place is a thriller as unique as it is entertaining.In it, a small family tries to survive in a post-apocalyptic world in which creatures that are guided by sound hunt them down. The plot could not be any simpler and no effort is done in order to deepen it. In fact, no explanation is ever given as to ""how did we get here"". But such an explanation would be unecessary anyway: the film is a thriller after all, not a sci-fi; you are just supposed to go along with it.If you do, what you have ahead of you is an original premise, solid performances (particularly by Emily Blunt) and an interesting and fitting way of dealing with sound in a film that ultimately revolves all around that.That is not to say that the movie doesn't have flaws. The development of the relationships between the characters is not all it could be: the conflicts among them go largely unexplored throughout the film and fall into cliche towards the end. Still, when a thriller keeps you tense for an hour and a half, I'd argue that is has done it's job well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Entertainment on it best,"It felt like reading a short story. A good one! The story it's tight; no explaining the past; no unnecessary intro with news broadcasts. And it's tense from the beginning, with that good stomach coldness that all thriller should give you.And what about the science unacuracy and logic problems pointed out by other reviewers? Don't worry, they don't get in the way of the suspension of disbelief. The pace is just fast enough and the anxiety is just constant enough to prevent the audience from thinking about it. And later? We'll, after such a good entertaining experience, you won't care.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
So so,"This plot is so simple and its content is so familiar if you watch several survival films before. There are a bunch of unreasonable moments in such film and the end made me shocked cause i didn't think it just end up like that.

"Great concept and really well done, using almost only sounds","It is a great movie. It is done in a very intelligent way. It's not like the most of the films now-a-days, that just slap you with the truth and what's happening at your the face right at the beginning; it actually doesn't tell you almost anything and leaves that whole mistery in the air, which in a way only results in an eerie ambience, since you don't know a single thing about these human-eating monsters.The acting is really good despite only having a total of 2 minutes of dialogue and it gets you stuck to the chair with the crazy amount of tension, of suspense of the scenes and the characters.Fair amount of good jump scares and the sound effects are just beyond comparison to anything else. It is true that has a lot of bad choices made by the characters, but it wouldn't be a horror movie without that, would it? Not to mention that half the main cast are kids.Above all, it dives right into this post-apocalyptic environment and with some action that just develops later in the movie. I recommend watching, and especially while wearing headphones.(Also... it is not as easy as you think to live in a waterfall :) )",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Sheer brilliance of writer and the actors,I would say this movie is one of the perfect horror thriller. Emily blunt in the lead has played a perfect role of the protagonist. Writer John has shown his brilliance with both the screenplay and his acting as the father of the kids.I would call it concept horror /thriller movie because calling it just plain thriller/horror would not do justice with the imagination of the writer John.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Very smart concept but to improve details and pace,"I watched this with my wife and heard a few recommendation from colleagues. I can say that the overall concept about not-making-noise is very clever and absolutely builds lots of intense in the movie.

Quite good of a movie,"When it comes to horror movies there are very few that actually peeks ones interest in the plethora of cliched unoriginal movies in this genre and successfully meet those expectations. In the recent times the success rate of such movies have only increased and i am glad it succeeded this time as well.With good direction, A Quite Place's simple yet interesting plot is what keeps most of the tension built throughout the movie with great performances by the lead characters to support it. And focusing on just this one family was a great choice to create the claustrophobic tension that was required for audience to be engaged throughout. There wasn't a single dull moment in the movie and kept my interest or curiosity till the end. One might find similarities to other horror movies such as Signs and 10 Cloverfield Lane but it never feels like a ripoff.On the downside i did find the movie to be predictable to a certain extent with few out of character choices (which do server some purpose for the plot to move in a certain direction, so understandable) and few unnecessary jump scares.All in all its a pretty good movie, definitely worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Quiet Movie,"I have to give the filmmakers credit on this one. To keep an audience enthralled in a movie where the script is probably less than 25 pages long, is quite a feat. These creatures of unknown origin are really scary and creepy, and they allow for the tension to build throughout the film. The story really hits you in the feels, as a beautiful family struggles to survive in this new world saturated with flying monsters. The performances are all solid, and I personally love Neil Young's Harvest Moon, so seeing it in this film was pretty awesome. It was the perfect usage of the music too. I am not sure this movie needed the sequels, but that is Hollywood today. They never leave a good thing alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Really good scary movie,"Saw this with my husband, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. It had a lot of well-placed jump scares and tense moments... without getting too spoiler-y, things that I never would have even thought of in a ""monster survival"" type of story come up and play out in interesting ways. I loved the strong family relationship shown as well; it's actually really nice to see such a positive portrayal (rather than the ""humans are the real enemy"" approach you see in a lot of horror these days). The characters are largely very likeable and very strong. The pacing and acting were great as well.I would say this is well worth a watch :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Quiet Place.,"'A Quiet Place' attempts to take the interesting themes of the existential and isolating loneliness of deafness and the body horror of pregnancy with its threat of childbirth pain and/or complications to create something poignant and compelling, but with the exception of a couple of bold moments, the film mostly fails due to some lazy and derivative horror filmmaking conventions (completely unscary post-Giger CGI, a myriad of obnoxious jump-scares, overbearing 'emotional' music cues, etc.).Despite the hype, this is yet another merely competent modern horror film, an allegory about how scary parenthood is, which is a painfully heteronormative and middle-class thing to get horrified over, when you think about it.However, this is certainly one way of getting around the persistent problem of atrocious dialogue in modern film -- just have everyone keep it buttoned.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
It's worth watching! Highly recommended!,"I'm very impressed by the trailer and some reviews written on internet so i made decision to watch this movie immediately. 
I think this move is a brand new kind of horror movie, it has something we would scared and screamed while watching this movie, also it talks about a family and the role of father and mother are the lead of a family, the way they protected their children, how they understand each other and how they showed their love with each other. Especially the last scene, after showing the daughter that he loved her so much, he died as a hero to protect his children. 
I think this movie was successful in making this character - the father. Ahhhh family factors in this fim were perfect.

One thing I will not do ...,"... is include any spoilers with my film reviews. I do not give blow-by-blow accounts of every scene or plot twist as I do not agree with doing so.I am moved to write this review by the many, many comments I have read eulogising the film ... and those I have read criticising it vehemently. The truth, in my opinion, lies somewhere in between (but more towards the 'good' end).The excoriating reviews are the ones that have upset me the most. OF COURSE THERE ARE PLOT HOLES. OF COURSE IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. I mean, for goodness' sake, why do people go to see a film with a premise of this nature and then proceed to pull it apart afterwards ?! How on earth does that make sense ?!The whole point of going to see a movie like this is to escape; to suspend disbelief; to exercise one's imagination - it is NOT to talk about everything that doesn't make sense or could be done better, surely ?!Perhaps I am being too harsh. For me, this film is no better than a 6.5 because, yes, there were lots of things that didn't quite sit right but, even though it was a little ponderous at times, when it ended I could not believe I had sat still for ninety minutes ! And THAT is the sign of a good film. For me and my films, very little else matters.The acting was good, the monsters were excellent, there were some genuinely tense moments (if you can overlook the inconsistencies) and it was sufficiently thrilling. But it is NOT a masterpiece of the horror genre. Nor was it so shockingly awful that people need to rant and rave about its deficiencies.If you like sci-fi/horror then you should probably go to see it. Then you can make up your own mind. But if you're the sort to pull every little thing to shreds then, please, spare yourself ... and us all.PB",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Silent Masterpiece,"A Quiet Place is a movie which tells the tale of a family which is forced to live in silence when their lives are threatened by some sort of creatures who have taken over the world. The cast includes real-time couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt along with Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe. The film is directed by John Krasinski himself who, before this, has one more directorial credit before this movie.First of all, let me try to make it clear how much I liked the film. I think this movie is a silent masterpiece and there are so many others which try to reach this level but haven't in my opinion. This movie had the power which Don't Breathe (2016 crime thriller directed by Fede Alvarez and starring Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette) only touched upon but couldn't master. Movies like these force the audience to hold their breath as if they're in the film's setting and even one sound from us could also be harmful to the characters inside the film. This was strengthened by the crisp and effective development of characters so that we immediately felt connected to the family and also feared for them. I was 10 mins in and I knew I am going to like it. In just 1.5 hours the movie has so many awesome scenes that throughout the movie I had a lump in my throat. I wouldn't say that I was scared, not at all, but I'll say this much, this movie made sure that I'll stay clear of any kind of rusty nail (you'll know, go watch it).Now, let us talk about what makes it so good. First, the silence. The music is perfect and only used when absolutely required. Kind of like Gravity (2013 Alfonso Cuaron directed, should not need any more introduction than that), where the music only comes into play when the debris from the spaceships becomes visible. The similar concept was tried in Hidden (Also about a family, living in a bomb shelter after an outbreak on the surface, hiding from whatever is out there), 2015 horror mystery by Duffer Brothers, but as I said earlier, A Quiet Place perfected it.The star cast limited and fitting. The reason this movie was my most awaited this year was one, intriguing trailer and two, Emily Blunt. After Edge of Tomorrow, Blunt is my new favourite. Krasinski was a plus as I wanted to see what he would do here, something totally different than what he is known for. Also, Simmonds continues to amaze me. After a decent performance in Wonderstruck, she deserves a thumbs up here as well. A similar comparison can be done with 10 Cloverfield lane, a 2016 horror mystery which worked because of an outstanding cast including Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman.I just don't understand how these actors are so good at directing suddenly. First Jordan Peele with his Oscar-worthy direction with Get Out and now Krasinski. The direction in this feels so mature that it was hard for me to believe at first that it's his second feature. The editing reminded me of Baby Driver (which I feel was the best last year, Dunkirk, a close second).So, in conclusion, I would say I loved it. Go watch it as soon as you can in your nearest theatre, I know I will watch it again whenever I get the chance. I have only one complaint and that is why did it end! Can we have a sequel, please!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

One of the most tense films I have ever watched,"The use of sound design as well as just the general mood for the film, creates an absolutely beautiful experience that I'll happily watch multiple times.
I went into this film completely blind with no expectations and it just so happened to be one of my personally favourite horrors of all time. Within just it's short (yet perfectly paced) hour and 35 minutes runtime there are so many moments that will make you feel many emotions on top of fear as this movie focuses on a couple of relate-able, yet touching themes that focus on family. The film even clearly uses it's sound design as a plot point that is cleverly foreshadowed without yet only fully realised by the audience until the moment the characters do. The attention to detail in this film is something like no other

Highly recommended if you love suspense films. This has got plenty!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Engagingly simple thriller although not quite gripping enough to make you blind to the odd weak point,"Much talked about, this near-silent film is set many months after humanity has been nearly wiped out by some form of creatures which hunt by sound. The Abbott family silently survive with their 3 children, and a fourth on the way; although the pressure to prepare for the birth and survive the day is significant. The simplicity of the film is its main selling point; beyond newspaper headlines there is no backstory or development of the situation but instead we have the rules and the stakes laid out very clearly in the first few minutes. Within this frame we have a family struggling to survive and stay together as a group despite terrible loss and situation; so it is making us care for the characters while also stripping out all the things that would take us away from them if we chased a bigger world picture.Mostly it plays it out very well, making for a tense and silent affair which doesn't resort to too many empty jump scares. Things get weaker as the film forces events and situations for the sake of drama, as well as being fine with plot holes/weaknesses that they need to make those things happen. The flooded basement is one example, but the ending is the one that bugs me most as it transforms the female lead character into something she isn't, and has an odd 'kick ass' tone to it that doesn't fit with the rest of the film. It is a shame because it is an enjoyable dark and lean film up till that point, but neither the handling of the baby or the ending really ring true within the context of the rest of the film. Good performances and well enough put together though - worth a look as long as you know it is not the classic that the hype suggested.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
It had potential,"The thing I hate most about movies like this, is that the writers can't think of anything to move the plot forward, so they make one of the characters stupid and irrational, and thus, that character does things that nobody else in their right mind would do in order to 'move things forward'. So many totally realistic things could have happened to move the story forward, but no, they don't do that. And then, that character, as totally unrealistically as it sounds, figures out in the end what nobody else on the planet (we assume) has been able to. Come on, SO many people would have tried this already. We literally already have such weapons in existence. It was a watchable movie up to a point.

The usual amount of talking and shuffling around in the beginning, but by the end completely silent as you become scared to make a sound yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Decent,I like this and I think It has a lot of potential. The way this movie was filmed was great each shot could be a background for you're phone. The biggest problem I have with movie is how predictable it is. It would have an extremely intense scene that would lead to something that a three year old could see coming. I also think that if the aliens weren't shown right at the start then there would be more suspense leading to the big reveal of what the look like. I gave this a 6/10 because it was a good movie that is worth watching just way too predictable.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the most thrilling films of the 21st century!,"It's not just the grace before meals. Mom and Dad - per the end credits, Evelyn and Lee Abbott, played by real-life husband and wife Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, who also directs - have an easy emotional intimacy and awareness of one another that would be moving and enviable in any screen couple. Their slow dance to Neil Young's Harvest Moon - sharing earbuds because the blind monsters track their prey by sound, so any significant noise is potentially deadly - is the most tender screen dance in ages.Centrally, A Quiet Place offers an empathic portrayal of disability, namely deafness - the one disability that would seem most dangerous given the premise, but which turns out to hold a key to survival.This is by far one of the most thrilling films of the 21st century.

Suspenseful fun experience,"A Quiet Place is an exploration of creating suspense with the lack of sound. The entire film feels like the quiet moment before the loud jump scare, building tension with silence. This brings a deep feeling of anxiety in the chest as the suspense grows. This feeling of anxiety is what I felt throughout most of the 95-minute runtime, and that is exactly what I look for in a horror/thriller. This sense of unease paired with a few cheap jump scares makes for an exhilarating and frightening experience.One of the things that is obviously unique in this film is the usage of sound. The film is so quiet at many moments that a minor auditory change can be startling like going from complete silence to a loud roaring river. However, silence is not the only thing utilized; it is often used as an indicator that something is going to go wrong, which heightens the intensity. Both the usage of sound and silence is what makes this movie stand out from other post-apocalyptic horror films from recent years.Another aspect of A Quiet Place that is executed well is the acting from the entire cast. Both Blunt and Krasinski do a solid job, but I think the performers that really stand out in the film are the child actors, particularly Millicent Simmonds (a deaf actor who plays a deaf character). The usage of American Sign Language throughout the film as the main form of communication makes for a unique experience, which is rarely seen in other movies. I also enjoyed how the film used the lack of sound during climactic moments to simulate how Regan, the deaf character, experienced her surroundings. It was a subtle detail, but it really put's the viewer in her perspective and I think that is what made her character the most compelling.Even though a Quiet place excels in many areas, I was left with a feeling that something was missing. I think it was the fact that the events the characters went through seemed familiar to other past horror films of a similar genre such as Signs or It Comes At Night. I also would have done a couple things differently with the way the film ended, but I do not want to spoil anything - so I won't get into that. Despite having a few minor issues, A Quiet Place is a successful horror movie that lives up to expectations. What A Quiet Place does right it nails, making it one of the best horror films I have seen in some time. I would recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a suspenseful anxiety-inducing experience.The Good:Very suspensefulUsage of sound (and the lack thereof)Powerful actingThe Bad:A few cheap jump scaresSome familiar horror troupes",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Relentless and unforgiving,"This is a very novel, and very good take on the ""I am legend"" style movie.The characters have to be silent as the creatures preying on them are ultra-sensitive to hearing, so most of the movie plays out in silence with them using sign language to communicate (fortunately sub-titled for all of us who don't know sign language!).It's a nice touch, and really makes you feel the tension. There are in fact frequent moments in the movie that will have you at the edge of the seat, if not jumping out of it whenever something happens to startle you (which is often).The pace never lets up and the movie never lets you feel like any of the characters are in a ""safe"" place, as the moment you think a ""problem"" is over, where other movies would show the characters rebuilding and relaxing, in this one the next thing goes wrong nearly straight away.After the end of the movie quite a few people in the theatre nervously laughed as a way of releasing the tension that had built up throughout the movie, it was that relentless.Also without spoilers, right at the start the movie does something harrowing that let's you know that certain ""conventions"" of these types of movies won't apply, so you can't predict how the story will unfold, which makes the whole thing all the more suspenseful.Emily Blunt is of course as good as ever, and all the other actors, including the children, pull their weight well.Not for the faint of heart, but a Grade A horror movie/ thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"A breath-taking, bone chilling experience.","Let's begin.
A Quiet Place grabs you and never let's go. The idea of quietness has been done before, but not in this fashion. Every moment you feel for this family. The first ten minutes was a shocking and well developed sequence, was a good way to set the mood and story. Emily Blunt is possible the best part about the film. She brings the most realism and down to earth performance and it pays off for her character. Now when I say the film grabs you and never let's go, I mean you don't have a lot of time to breathe. You're always on edge, and one specific sequence of scene of Evelyn(Blunt) going into labor, the suspence and thrills of that amazing well shot and chilling part was fantastic. The ending was a good payoff and showed some great character development, but some might not like how the film actually ends. It will go off of how the film as a whole made you feel. All in all, go see it, watch it on the big screen, rent it, buy the blu-ray. A Quiet Place is a fantastic and breath of fresh air.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

This movie requires you to go along with every cheesy horror movie cliche of dumb people doing dumb things. I was shocked at how frustrating this picture was to watch with moronic characters making horrible decision and decision.I now figure that all the rave reviews this film received must have come from horror fans desperate to quench their thirst on original material. This is understandable, due to most of the films that fill this category are not very good or very original, so when something like ""A Quiet Place"" comes along, it's originality made it stand out and a buzz about the movie is created.

You can find the most useful comments here, all about loopholes, that is, many plots are not logical enough. But as John Krasinski said, he was not going to shoot a detective film (even his intention was not to make a horror film). This film is more about the family, how to express it in a fearful environment. Obviously, they did it, in a silent way. Isn't that the case? Sometimes the gap between family members is so silent, but it is not the sound that resolves these embarrassments, but some daily small movements that let you understand the indestructible power of the family.Don't let these blind commentators ruin a good piece of art.

"Thrilling, gripping and tense.","'A Quiet Place' is directed by John Krasinski and stars himself, Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe and is the story of a world ravaged by monsters who hunt by sound. Even the slightest noise could mean death. So we follow this family trying to live in absolute silence as they live their everyday lives.
 
John Krasinski shows himself to be a more than capable director, as this is his third directorial feature film. The way he conducts the camera is immaculate and the cinematography is lush and vibrant. Krasinski gives a stellar performance in this film, that is full of subtlety. Emily Blunt is just absolutely magnificent in this film, one scene in particular which could be done laughably, but she truly ensures the maximum believability and was enthralling. Millicent Simmonds as their deaf daughter, also being deaf in real life, is fantastic and truly understood her character.
 
The monsters really posed as a threat to this family, and their designs looked very outlandish. Almost all the scares in the film were extremely suspenseful, and the tension builds throughout the film to a whopper of a finale. Although, occasionally, the film can divert back to the common horror tropes of fake jump scares, but the majority of the time every tension filled scare is worth it.
 
Although horror is a large part of this film, there is an equal amount of heartwarming relations centred around family. The family dynamic glistens with love throughout the whole film, and due to trauma set up within the opening act, those complications come into play. The film is paced very consistently, having never a dull moment. It is a film that is easy to pick apart from a screenplay point of view. There are nitpicks you can have with certain things that happen, and things the family use. But if you delve to far into those unnecessary qualms, the core of the film is lost. 
 
'A Quiet Place' is as terrifyingly thrilling as it is heartwarming. Kransinski's vision is very clear, and hits home for what he his trying to achieve. There are some unnecessary nitpicks and fake unearned jump scares, but the crucial core still beams with creativity and thrills. If you're looking for that gripping horror-thriller, this will be your ticket.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Worth The Hype,"So I was skeptical about seeing the film as it had high ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB but also heard that a lot of people didn't like it... it was definitely worth paying 10 bucks to see.I am frustrated with everyone whining on here about ""bad choices"" made by the characters and ""insufficient details"" on the part of the writer. First, as in life, no one goes through life without making mistakes. Especially children. The movie does a good job of showing this phenomenon of humans making mistakes that end up being costly or important to the story in some way without being over the top or unrealistic. If no one made a mistake than the story would be boring. Also, as with most situations in life, the view from your vantage point is almost never holistic. If you knew everything about a situation when making a decision you would never have regrets. The film puts you almost directly in the seat of the characters and you see and experience the horror as they see and experience it from their vantage point. So of course they don't know exactly how many monsters are out there or even how this tragedy happened. And HINT, that is what makes this film so good. If you knew everything about the story than why would you want to see the film? The film has you guessing at every scene as to what is going on and where the story will go and I really appreciate films that do that. Definitely worth the hype.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Excellent (with Minor Criticisms),"It seems like when a film does very well, there is a small segment of the reviewers that will emerge to bash the film. They will give it an unfair score to balance out all the positive reviews they feel is unwarranted.It seems like A Quiet Place has been hit with such reviews. If you don't like a film, that is fine. However, be fair and honest in your reviews. Don't give a low score simply because you didn't like it as much as a lot of other people.I enjoyed A Quiet Place. It is a monster movie in the vain of Alien and Cloverfield. I liked the characters and farm backdrop. The creatures were interesting. The use of sound and communicating in quiet ways were unique and interesting.I do have a few minor criticisms. In some ways they over explained the creatures with the newspaper shots, but in other ways I would have liked to know more. I don't particularly care where they come from, but I would liked to further know the ""rules"" of how they hunt.I also don't understand why the don't try and live by the river or waterfall. However, it is forgivable since the farm gives them food and shelter. I think this could have been easily resolved by simply removing the waterfall screaming scene. You can be louder by the river, but only within reason.Despite these criticism, I think the film is a worthy watch for anyone that likes these types of films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Very Good, if You Ignore Several Illogical Plot Points.","""A Quiet Place"" was really a sleeper hit, one of those summer films that unexpectedly made bank at the box office. It was obvious there would be a sequel with the open ending, if the film was successful, there is, and it was. While you may be enthralled while watching this film, it is one of those film's whose premise, upon which the film is precipitated, falls apart immediately once you leave the theater if you really think about it This is indeed it's strength and weakness, it has an ability to pull you in to each moment, but one of the crucial plot points, upon further reflection, totally unravels. That will not be written about here, to avoid spoilers, and I recommend you avoid reading detailed spoiler filled reviews until you watch the film.This is a well-executed film, one of those rare thrillers that truly squeezes out every moment of tension, in this regard, it is one of the best thrillers to come out in the last few years. The acting is perfect, the lighting, pacing, sound(especially the sound), direction, etc are all nearly perfectly executed. If only the script were stronger, it could have been one of the all-time great horror thrillers, but as it stands, it proves Hollywood can still make good(not perfect), original content that resonates with a large audience.This film gets a lot of heat for some of the choices the characters make, and while I agree some of them are bad, I am not one of those people that thinks people always make smart decisions in tense or difficult situations, I would actually posit, they tend to make some of the dumbest decisions of their lives, and this is absolutely 100% the case in this film. My problems in the film do not lay within the characters choices, but rather the nature of creatures, and that is all I will say. Again, the only real problem with this film, lays within the script. Were the script just a little bit tighter, this would easily be an 8 or 9 star film.Here is hoping that the sequel can improve upon some of the weaker points of the script in the first film, it is absolutely possible, and if it does, it has the potential to spawn a whole new franchise, upon which could have unlimited possibilities.God Bless ~Amy",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
a flash-in-a-pan lucre-overachiever and clever horror-fare dented by its implausible plot device,"A runaway success in the North American box office, actor/director John Krasinski's third feature A QUIET PLACE is a close-knit post-apocalyptical monster horror on the strength of a stimulating prerequisite: what if the tripwire to alert those voracious and blistering predators lurking nearby is not sight but sound?The story is exclusively hinged upon a cloistered nuclear family: husband, wife (Krasinski and his spouse Blunt) and their two surviving children (a daughter, played by the deaf actress Millicent Simmonds and a younger son, the adorable Noah Jupe), after a prologue illogically shows their youngest offspring is snatched by a blink-and-you'll-miss-it creature due to a childish oversight (what kind of parents would let a tot tailing in the rear under that treacherous circumstance?), then, the narrative fast-forwards to one year later, and to spice up the plot, the wife is visibly gravid and instinctively we can presage that her pending delivery will be a helluva encounter with disaster, but it also prompts us to question the counterfactual decision in the first place, why they want another pregnancy (of course we can empathize that it is a grief-assuaging strategy, which comes off so harebrained in its timing) when the couple both knows a new-born baby will most likely put the entire family in the risk of ruination, not to mention the Sisyphean job of smothering every possible noise made by a baby in his nascent years, or simply lock him up inside a sound-proof basement as long as they can? It also underlines that the parents are too self-centered and reckless to bear in mind of the probable danger inflicted to their other two kids, a script-smith is terribly needed, for instance, if the pregnancy could take place before the prologue, it would be more plausible.Enough of this critic's persnickety grouse about its (seemingly unintentional) natalistic infelicity, because in essence, the film is a tautly configured, meticulously calculated genre fare (although that self-evident shush gesture is manifested in excess), and fortunately doesn't squander its innovative premise, silence has never been wielded in such lengths to induce thrills and spills (the wife's bathtub ordeal and the sibling's grain silo narrow escape are gratifyingly entrancing), and jump-scares are particularly modulated within an acceptable extent although the nerve-racking prospect of a spiky nail facing upwards is painfully hackneyed. The epiphany, aka, the weakness of those sightless monsters, is teased out in a gradual realization that doesn't necessarily jump the shark when it transpires, also it astutely adheres to that timeless irony, there is just one thin fine line between one's strongest suite and one's Achille's heel.The quartet cast is optimum, Blunt is most impressive when she is left alone with menace looming over in propinquity whereas Krasinski proves to be a capable hand both behind and in front of the camera, plus Jupe is such an extraordinarily natural player for his tender age, however, the standout by my lights is the gutsy Millicent Simmonds, who makes great play of her gnawing conflict with guilt, resentment and disconsolation, and ultimately, her evolution into the linchpin which once-and-for-all, turns their misery into an incredible triumph is the most heartening takeaway from this flash-in-a-pan lucre-overachiever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Wonderful Cinematic Experience,"I have been lately thinking about the how the innovation is dying in Hollywood as most of the write-ups are either adapted or a remake or the easiest way to make a big buck (Superhero flicks) . Not you DC !The next day i ended up watching this movie and to be honest it is one of the most memorable cinematic experience i have come across in my life.After the 1979 Alien or the 1993 Jurassic Park, the latter being the first Hollywood movie i watched in theater, it took me back to the place where i was literally at the edge of my seat. I was nostalgic in some moments, the same i felt when i watched Alien/JP for the first time.Yes, this movie does not have a major plot or any major backdrop, it is a simple story with brilliant undertones. But the way the movie was executed cinematically with the sound design, it was a treat to watch something fresh and new at this age of mediocre and repetitive film-making.I was nervous towards the final third of the movie as most movies screw it up by then, but Krasinski did the unconventional thing.And Emily Blunt, what to say about this beautiful female, she was perfect for this role and that smile at the end of the movie shows a lot of emotions.This is going to be in my Top Movies for this year already.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A unique premise let down by a simple script.,"The concept of a film dominated by long periods of silence may not be incredibly original (an episode of ""Buffy"" once adopted such a premise), but it's original enough to offer something different in the thriller/horror landscape IF your script doesn't simply use the concept as a gimmick.Unfortunately, ""A Quiet Place"" never does aspire to justify its plot beyond the selling factor of being somewhat original, and that's the problem: it knows you don't often get films like this, it knows you know that, and therefore the writer never feels he has to try too hard.It may be too cynical to say that all one need do is insert a cliche family into a world where sound kills, develop a bare minimum of familial drama (mostly conveyed via sign language), and then simply devise scenarios where they get into trouble, but yet that's exactly what the film does. That's, essentially, all the film IS: set pieces hinging on borderline fleshed-out members of a family trying their best to be quiet in a world where monsters hunt by sound.That's not to say the film doesn't have genuine moments of suspense--it does. But one can't help escape the fact that nearly any writer with a modicum of imagination could easily devise twenty or a hundred more scenarios where characters inadvertently make noise and bring the wrath of hungry creatures down on them. We LIVE in a world with sound, so the highest level of imagination one has to have to write these situations is to imagine their characters trying and failing to perform ordinary human tasks quietly, or, as this film often relies on, reacting to physical pain.By all means, go see it for the suspenseful set pieces, but don't be deluded into thinking it's more than the sum of its parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"NOT a ""horror"" film, but rather a suspense movie","There are many things the new film A QUIET PLACE is. What it is NOT is a ""horror"" film (as it is being promoted). What this film is is tense, suspenseful, well written, acted & directed, and quite good.Co-written and Directed by John Krasinski (THE OFFICE) and starring Krasinski and his real-life wife, Emily Blunt (LIVE, DIE, REPEAT, the upcoming MARY POPPINS RETURNS), A QUIET PLACE tells the story of an Earth that has been overrun by aliens who hunt humans as food. These creatures are blind and have limited olfactory senses, but what they do have is extremely good hearing, so to stay alive, you must stay quiet.We are introduced to this world by a family of 5 that have, thus far, survived. It consists of a Mother (Blunt) and Father (Kasinski) and their 3 children, one of whom is deaf. They have learned how to live in this world and we watch them struggle to stay alive - and stay together as a family unit.This is the Directorial debut of Kasinski and he acquits himself quite well. This film is strongly paced with a sure eye for what this film should look and feel like. His handling of the actors is strong and he is smart enough to realize that this film could wear it's welcome out, so he keeps things short and to the point.The acting of the children are good and Krasinski is very good in his role, but it is the work of Emily Blunt that really pulls this film along. As the matriarch of the family, you can see the care and concern on her face, her futility in trying to hold things together. Someone get this actress an Oscar already! Maybe not for this film...but...she is an Oscar-caliber actress showing off her abilities.But...it is the silence that is the differentiating factor of this cinematic experience.Because of the nature of the premise, this film - by necessity - is (in essence) a silent film. Because of this, an interesting thing happened in the movie theater I was in. At the beginning of the film, I could hear wrappers being handled and popcorn being eaten and drinks being drunk. But...after about 10 minutes, the theater became just as silent as the screen and you were pulled into the silent world of the film.All in all, a fantastic, unique time at the cinema. As I said, I would not classify this as a ""horror"" film, but rather a taught, tense, suspense film that had me jumping out of my seat on more than one occasion.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Hitchcock-esque horror thriller,"A few quick titles will come to your mind when you think about tense, cinematic achievements. Combine that with horror, you get films produced by classic filmmakers such as Hitchcock, Argento, Carpenter, and Craven. Krasinski has created such a masterpiece, that pulls together some very prevalent horror-esque themes to achieve a unbelievable amount of tension and suspense.With the setting atmosphere rather cliched, the modern depiction of a dead, decaying world, the consequences of making 'sound' and the internal fight within the characters are shown in the starting 5 minutes. A perfect set up. Horror thrillers naturally drag on. A quiet place has no such scenes. The 95 minute thriller leaves no such gaps for the audience to rest on. And its biggest victory is on that front. To silence the cinema hall, to care for the characters, to make us bound to them are achieved by a rare number of horror films these days.A quiet place takes on almost the same theme as 'It comes at night. Only, Krasinski did it better. The short screenplay, the limited amount of world building, the varying horror elements all seems like drawbacks but actually relieves the viewers of the conventional way of building horror movies. Emily Blunt produced a stand out performance, with all the cast providing the character support.A quiet place is a rare, cinematic achievement. It does not depend upon the lead performances and stands on its own. But then again, it does achieve everything a horror film desires to achieve.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
An OK Silent Movie,"If the first half of the movie was as good as the second half, it would have received my rating of 7. But the first half was tedious and too slow, so overall a 6 is fair. The end result is an enjoyable movie with tense moments in it.I wonder why so many reviewers rate it so badly. What did they expect? If you want to watch a horror movie this is not it and never was meant to be one. The story was good with warts and all, but why try to demean any faults? You cannot be relaxed if you spend your time looking for errors, but you miss the thrill and enjoyment for which most people watch a particular movie. If it is not your scene, don't bother about it in the first place.I don't like silent movies, but I knew what I was in for and this film gets my thumbs up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Simple but amazing film,"I went into this movie with high hopes. I had been hearing good things about the film and I was excited to see John Krasinski as a director.As a fan of Krasinski I was interested to see how he would perform in a horror film Krasinski gave an excellent performance as well as Emily Blunt. The children in this film were pretty good in their roles.Overall I enjoyed the movie, however, at times I found myself hating the daughter. I'm not sure if it's because of the way her character was written or the actress herself but throughout the film I was not a fan of the character.The plot of the film is quite interesting. You follow a family that has learned to survive this post apocalyptic world and must stay quiet. Obviously this means that the film doesn't contain much dialogue. Krasinski does a great job directing the film so the audience can tell what is going on without the characters needing to say it.So far this is one of my favorite films of 2018 and I am looking forward to more from Krasinski as a director and a serious actor. I would love to see a prequel to this so the viewers could have a backstory as to what the creatures are and how they came into being. Great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

This movie focuses on one family, on how they struggle to keep silent just to stay alive.This film proved that you don't need gore, blood, and predictable dialogues just to make a scary film. Silence and the unknown is terrifying enough. A single sound makes me jump. The plot is very interesting and original.Of course, the cast is magnificent. Very impressive acting.

There were plentt of options to work around the problems this family faced.

Well-made but ultimately an implausible and weakly-plotted horror film,"A family tries to survive on an Earth (apparently) overrun with sightless creatures that hunt by sound, from which the only protection is silence. The film is very well-done and the permeating quietness is striking. The cast is excellent in what must have been very challenging roles (as much needed to be expressed through 'body language' and gesture). Unfortunately, the film's lack of exposition leads to many unanswered questions and potential plot holes. As the family is hundreds of days in isolation, presumably the film takes place in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by the creatures, but other than hints in vague newspaper clippings, this unlikely scenario is never addressed. While we're told the creatures are 'armoured' (and so presumably invulnerable to the family's shotgun), unless their hide is made of unobtainium or some kind of supernatural material, the idea that they, however fast and fierce, could stand up to military weaponry is ridiculous. They are blindly (sorry, couldn't resist) attracted to sound and are repeatedly shown opening their armour to expose their hearing apparatus when near potential prey, so presumably they would be easy to lure into traps and killed (or at least deafened). Another obvious question pertains to the monster's response to ambient sound. The scene at the river shows that being surrounded by noise is protective so why not surround the farm with wind chimes etc. to mask sounds and then put similar noisemakers elsewhere as distractions (the argument that all of this would be too noisy to set up ignores that fact that Abbot (John Krasinski) was able to string up hundreds of warning lights). A good story/script would have addressed these kinds of concerns (as well as the numerous others brought up by other commentators). 'Tremors' (1998) makes a good counter-example: once the basic premise (admittedly far-fetched) was accepted, the rest of the story was internally consistent and, within context, believable. An alternative approach was taken by 'Bird Box' (2018), a similar 'sensory-deprivation' horror yarn, in which the threat was supernatural and thus, by definition, free of logical constraints (although a little more exposition and internal consistency would have helped that film as well). ""A Quiet Place"" is an example of a film in which the execution was better than the material, which seems to becoming more and more common as (IMO) films in this genre continue to focus on imagery and 'mood' at the expensive of narrative.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Not gonna lie thought at the being of the movie it was awkward especially in a movie theater..... and I expected a better ending, considering how good the rest of the movie was.

What Does It Mean,"This fantasy about a family trying to survive on an earth occupied by demonic monsters whose senses are limited to hearing, and who will attack any human who makes any significant sound, is compelling. Yet I find myself wondering what it all means. Modern fantasy and sci-fi films are all about making a counter-factual assumption, and then watching as the characters deal with the situation. For many viewers, that is enough. They can get lost in the details, take pleasure in the methods, without considering the true strength of non-mimetic fiction: the metaphor. Dracula is scary because he symbolically offers the pleasures and terrors of non-heteronormative sex; Frankenstein's Adam - the name of the monster - asks us what makes a human being. These are questions that haunt us all, and which can be investigated in fantasy, because stated baldly, without the mask of Mimos, we are likely to get caught up in irrelevant arguments. No one wonders why Sauron is a bad guy, whether he had an unhappy childhood. No. He's evil. To be good is to fight him. But how? And at what cost?So what makes this movie so compelling to a viewer who wants more than ""how do we deal with these monsters?"" What do they symbolize? The only similar work that comes to mind is William Tenn's Of Men And Monsters, in which gigantic aliens invade Earth, take over the world, and leave humanity in the position of mice in the walls. That, however, was handled in Tenn's humorous, mechanical fashion. Here, we are still confronted with the basic situation, and left with the question of what it's supposed to symbolize, what gives the movie its strength (besides the obvious novelty).I think it's political. Perhaps current events have made me see everything through that lens, but I find the thought compelling, that here we have an old-fashioned nuclear family, which simply wants to live. However, if they make any noise, they will be obliterated. It's a fear that anyone who thinks themselves a member of an oppressed minority can feel. Whether you're Black in America, or a Jew in Nazi Germany, a woman's liberation or gay rights supporter, or a modern men's right activist - to put it in the least inflammatory way - you fear bringing down the weight of the powers that be, always ready to crush anyone who speaks up in the name of justice and decency. That, I think, in our modern, aggrieved society, makes this movie so popular. Everyone feels oppressed. Why not the oh so very White family of John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, and their loving, well behaved children?There's also novelty, with its almost pure visual story telling, harking back to a bygone era of silent movies..... which only emphasizes that it holds the old normative values to be best. Well, that can be investigated in the sequel, and the many imitators that will reduce it all to a purely mechanical shocker.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Blunt is great in this unique and tension-riddled horror,"Who would've thought a horror/thriller that takes place almost entirely with silence as its key weapon of fear and tension would become one of 2018's most talked about and likely most well-regarded horror releases?Jon Krasinski's high-concept and well-executed A Quiet Place sees the one time The Office employee take the next step in his directional career with the help of his off-screen wife and always impressive actor Emily Blunt, in a film that is a highly unique experience in many ways and one that makes a trip to the movies an experience within itself thanks to the films nature and execution that will have many taking slow and considered breaths when watching to ensure not too much noise is made.Set in 2021 where the world has seemingly been ravaged by an alien race of monsters that hunt entirely through sound and focussing its attention on the Abbott family of Krasinski's father Lee, Emily Blunt's pregnant yet determined Evelyn, Millicent Simmons deaf teenager Regan and Noah Jupe's young Marcus as they look to survive on their rural property, A Quiet Place is in many ways a quiet and considered film that is all at once a nail biting thriller, a tension riddled horror and a family drama that masks rather familiar and predictable story tropes and scenarios around its fresh and intriguing central premise.It's a well shot film and the production values are of the highest order, from visual effects, cinematography and importantly sound design choices, Krasinski and his team have worked with a relatively low-budget to create a polished and proficient 90 minute ride.A Quiet Place is also another fine example of Blunt's ability to command the screen and her turn as Evelyn is one of her very best. Displaying a raft of emotions and fears through merely looks and expressions, Blunt delivers a great performance for her directing hubby in what's a role that's likely to go down as one of the all-time greats of female heroines in the genre.While A Quiet Place does a lot right, there's also an inescapable feeling that there are reliance's on a few to many pitfalls of the genre with some character decisions and implausibility's of scenarios hard to overcome (how can racoons be alive for 400 plus days when they make consistent noise or how did the Abbott's manage to build such a fully-functioning farm considering the circumstances) and while they are relatively small things when weighed up against the good, they are still stumbling blocks to A Quiet Place's quest for greatness.It's also arguable that A Quiet Place begins to lose its chill and thrill aspects as the runtime wears on and while there are ample situations that create unease and shock, the film isn't all that ""scary"" and once we catch a few good glimpses of the foreign beings, a lot of the initial intrigue and suspense gives way to a more run of the mill experience.Final Say -Filled with some standout moments, a great Blunt turn and a highly original concept, A Quiet Place is a film that on paper shouldn't work but does here thanks to Krasinski and his team and while its far from perfect, if you're looking for a fantastic cinematic experience that's best enjoyed in a packed house, A Quiet Place is the place to be.3 ½ noisy racoons out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A parallel to life in an autocratic regime,"Not sure whether it was the intention of the writers, but the story is almost like metaphor of life under an autocratic regime, with hypersensitive, and merciless authorities.

Some people never give up on the idea of fighting back. Some people may also grow so exhausted and hopeless that they surrender in whatever ways.Generally a movie with great focus.

On Earth no one must hear you scream!,"I liked the concept of A Quiet Place but unsure about the execution with much of the blame lying with the script. Ironic as the film has very few lines.Directed and co-written by John Krasinski. The setting is a desolate post apocalyptic world. Earth has been invaded by monsters who are blind but have ultra sensitive hearing. Make a sound and you are dead, ripped apart by an alien.Living in a remote farmhouse, a family does their best to survive but they have lost one child already. Lee (John Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) have set up their lives to survive this vicious world for their deaf daughter, Regan and young son Marcus. However Evelyn has become pregnant and is about to give birth to a baby and that baby is going to make noise.The film left me uneasy at the beginning as one young child walks single file at the back, with both the adults way ahead at the front. It did not look like sensible risk management to me and so it proved.

"Pretty well done, dangerous monsters can hear but can't see.","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip, she doesn't care for scary movies.John Krasinski wrote, directed, and has a lead role here as Lee Abbott. His real life wife, Emily Blunt, is his wife Evelyn Abbott. They also have a deaf daughter and two young sons.As the movie opens we see shadowy figures quietly moving through what appears to be an abandoned store. Then we see that the whole town appears dead, but this family has a home and small farm outside town.On the screen flashes brief messages, like ""89 days"" or ""492 days"", presumably since the alien monsters attacked and killed most people. These monsters are very fast and vicious, but they can't see, only detecting possible prey by hearing sounds. So everyone is very quiet, conversing mostly in sign language.Of course there wouldn't be much story if the people remained quiet and undetected, and if the monsters never were able to find them. So things do develop and as the movie ends it sets itself up for a possible sequel. The family does find the monster's ""Kryptonite"", very high pitched sound.And in fact the IMDb has a listing for the sequel now in pre production. Suitably interesting movie.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Overrated And Not The Smartest,"I was really excited for this one because the concept looked interesting, I really like John Krasinski and Emily Blunt and it was getting rave reviews. This movie is definitely overrated and not nearly as smart as I wanted it to be. BUT I did have a good time.First of all, the acting is great by most of the cast. Which is what makes it feel like even more of a waste that there wasn't great character development to go with the performances. This is probably my biggest issue with the movie. As far as I'm concerned, all the cheap jump scares, plot holes and dumb character decisions can be forgiven if I'm truly invested in the characters. I wasn't. There should've been much more time spent with the family and getting to know them. It just felt way too rushed. I think maybe they were trying to be relentless with the pacing but it just felt rushed. That powerful moment toward the end would've been so much more so if I was truly invested in the characters.The first 30 minutes or so are really good. It's intense and they made the scenario much more plausible than I expected going in. Sure there's some heavy handedness but that could be forgiven. After that it becomes a pretty typical, generic horror movie. Jump scares, loud spikes in music and then the family, who we've been made to believe is so smart, start making some pretty dumb decisions. This was disappointing considering the pretty smart and intriguing setup we were given. And especially disappointing considering the reviews this was getting, declaring how smart it is and being compared to Get Out. This doesn't even touch Get Out on terms of directing, cleverness, writing and originality. Also, I don't think John Krasinski knows how to release and rebuild tension as a director. There are some great moments but that's about it. Critically I think this movie is a 5 but I'm giving it a 7 because I had a good personal experience and it is a fun movie.Here are a couple of creative decisions I would like to have seen personally. Number one, I think the score should've been sparsely used, if ever at all. The first time we should've heard music was the dancing scene with the headphones. Second, I think that powerful scene towards the end should've been from the deaf girl's point of view, being completely silent. I think that would've been much more powerful.Overall its fine and a fun watch but nothing too extraordinary at all. Check it out in a theater and I'm sure you won't feel like you've wasted time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The only reason I can't give this film a 10 is because we had minimal information of how we got to this point, (how it all began) but it did a great job dropping us in the middle of things and giving a great resolve.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Tense, original, unsettling.","In John Krasinski's directorial debut, we follow a family forced into perpetual silence to evade extraterrestrial monsters with exceptional (albeit inconsistent) hearing. We see the way of life the humans must adopt to survive, and the severe consequences of when those rules are broken. The creatures (of unknown origin) hunt exclusively using their hearing, forcing humans to resort to a world without noise, if they wish to stay alive.There is something unnerving about a large group of people in utter silence, transfixed, daring themselves not to make a noise out of reverence for the film they are watching. This felt original, backed by a good story that worked particularly well in a cinematic atmosphere. Moments of tension were executed perfectly and with brilliant acting, particularly by Emily Blunt. Krasinski handles the camera well using creeping angles and smooth tracking shots to establish an eerie dystopian world. Noise was used sparingly but often to very good effect heightening the drama of a scene and emphasizing shocks. Considering there was a relatively small budget ($17 million) the set is well devised and doesn't detract from the immersion of the movie. The monsters had a very unsettling look and were well designed, which added to their menace.There were many drawbacks however, such as the over use of jump scares, which surpassed their effectiveness after considerable repetition. Once the suspense began, it did not let up. This became a problem as there can only be so much tension a person can feel before a plateau occurs. One moment would go wrong after another, not allowing any processing of information or respite from the action. With such a short run time (90min) it would have been no bad thing to focus on character development during down time and allow the audience to fully digest the ramifications of what they have just witnessed. There are large plot holes concerning the inconsistency of the monster's hearing. Once you start unwinding that thread it can lead to a lot more flaws (why don't they set up camp by the river? Do the monsters distinguish between living/non living sound? Wouldn't monsters be attracted to all the sounds of nature constantly overstimulating them? etc) Such an abrupt ending may have benefited from a defter touch to conclude a thoroughly thrilling movie.Acting: 8

Creepy suspense monster thriller that you see with the masses,"Normally when I see a film in theaters, the audience can sometimes be a liability. You want to appreciate the film as it is on screen and have zero interest in its impact on other people watching. Enter this film, which proves to be the exception.It is the story of a family trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world torn apart by predatory aliens who hunt based on their extreme hearing capacity. The oldest child in the family just happens to be deaf. It's an imaginative premise that is extremely well-executed by Krasinski. I dare say it's the most creative suspense film I have seen in recent memory.A popcorn suspense thriller with this much tension can only be appreciated for its full effect when you see its power on a crowd of viewers. This film kept everyone in, well, complete and utter silence throughout until its gripping conclusion. You cannot ask for much more than that from a film of this genre. I give Krasinski a world of credit in putting together a master class in suspense.Acknowledging the film's nasty foibles and tricks, however, I also have to admit that it does not shy away from having its characters make stupid mistakes or show a marked lack of judgment in key moments. This is an easy ploy that lots of horror and suspense thrillers use, but here it doesn't detract from the film's achievement too much.I recommend that this film be watched in theaters, and seen with a large crowd, the best setting in which its impact can be strongly felt.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The only negative thing about this film is the person that brings popcorn to it.,"Sometimes we just get really surprised. We go to a film, expect a lot and go home displeased. Other times however, we go in expecting garbage but then fill up 9 or 10 stars on IMDb. If somebody told you there was a horror/sci-fi film that Jim Halpert directed and starred in, you'd be rolling on the floor laughing. Well, this is that film, except you gain a new respect for this man. It is a true success story for John Krasinski and his entire cast. I was awe-struck by the performance of each actor. The directing was foolproof; you could tell that every small detail was taken care of. It gives off the feeling that a perfectionist was behind it. And the action, the drama, the suspense, the sound... just brilliant. There are a couple of questions surrounding the story and the monsters that IMDb reviewer @jef_olsen touches on very well, but I am only removing 1 star for this as everything else was truly magnificent.Seriously, the only thing I can really complain about is not even about the film itself, it's about the noise made by people in the movie theater. The reaching for and chewing of popcorn during the long, silent portions of the movie, or the passing of candy packets from one friend to another. And then there is the occasional 'Sally Soundtrack' who needs to be shushed a few times before he/she quiets down. If you're going to watch this movie, I highly recommend watching it at home, in a dark room, with 5.1 surround sound, no interruptions and absolutely no outside sound. Like many reviewers wrote, this is an experience, not just a movie. It has to be watched in ""a quiet place"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A great date movie,"Setting aside the Cloverfield conspiracies, 'A Quiet Place' is a great date movie, a real creature feature. The actors don't miss a beat and who da thought something as simple as sound or lack of could be the major source of tension in a movie (well it's obvious really when you thing about it). 'A Quiet Place' was as intense as Alien 2 back in the day, I stopped breathing; a lot. The monster up close and personal was a little reminiscent of the clicker zombie, in the Last of Us and just as hard to kill (or maybe it was just me) although when it flashed its JAWS it was defiantly reminiscent of the alien in Alien (which has a RTmertor score of 97% hmmmm). Arachnid looking aliens are alway high on the Richter for the most creepy. My day after score for 'A Quiet Place' is 7 now did it make sense? Well does any creature feature? ahahahah Well worth the effort of braving the cinemas; or if your like me curled up in your jammies, heater on, cup of tea maybe a scone or three in from of the wide screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Solid movie - I'd repeat, I spent my money well","This is an easy review!Characters:
10/10
Likable, well rounded, interesting. You didn't have a lot of them, but they were definitely all very solid, and every single one of them played their part in the plot.Story:
08... 9ish/10
The perfect number of jump scares, well placed each time. The story makes sense to a point. The movie is not about making you question yourself, the world or whatever. It's all about your senses. It's a come-and-feel-it movie. I recommend being watched in those sessions that are less crowded. The chewing of popcorns and the chit chat of rude people can ruin the experience.The only reason it got a 9 it's because of the ending. It was very complicated to create an ending that would be up to my expectations since the movie keeps building up its own potential until the end. I'm still a bit undecided if I liked the ending or not. Maybe discussing it with someone could help clear this up for me.Performance:
10/10
For the majority of the movie, this cast had to show their emotions through their facial expressions. They rocked it, that's it.Soundtrack:

Keep Quiet and Carry On,"John Krasinski's third directorial effort 'A Quiet Place' is based in a world where making a single noise is life or death. Considering how implausible that seems in the current world we live in, one full of noise, it's hard for anyone to keep quiet these days but when there's the slightly unoriginal creature at your doorstep ready to rip you and your family apart, you adapt quickly (and quietly).Where A Quiet Place gets it right is the quiet anguish of a family trying to survive while also trying to contain some sembalance of normality in their lives and the audience feels it (or at least I felt it). The movie appears to keep the tension throughout and it's more than the normal surival movie as this movie has a element of protection to it, there's something rather strange watching a father trying his best in a helpless situation. The Jim Halpert sub-verbal cues are on point and the scene's flow very well with no break's in the ultimate tension or suspence of the picture. Where the movie goes wrong in my opinion is the final arc of it, the spoon feeding of information where it's quite obvious what the weakness is but perhaps the character's aren't completely clued in as we are, the creature is one I've seen a multitude of times but it makes sense to stick with the same formula and structure of previous movies, other pains I have are nonsensical because regardless of all the setups you could possibly protect your family with I believe that I would have been killed moments after the creatures inception and at risk of sounding reductive the movie for me is about a family (and how difficult a process that really is) and individuals looking for a baseline security we all need for peace of mind. A scene that sums up the movie is where Emily Blunt's character admits that she could have protected there child if only she had carried him and John's character tells her to stop. A world in where you can't look away from your child for a second and as far as that premise goes, in a world full of noise, it would be sometimes nice to keep quiet for a change but only sometimes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Thriller masterpiece !!,Never seen movie like this. Unique content and mind blowing. This is my fav thriller horror movie. Cant get out of my head. There was not one second of boring scene. Hooked with movie from starting to end even watched full credits. If u want true experience of this movie watch alone at night after 12 with full bass and max vol. Then its real fun. Every scene is horrible. U dont know when wat will happen. This is father of all horror movies in my opinion. Conjuring and other horror movies like it are nothing compared to this masterpiece. This movie is gem as they are very rare. Like i m legend movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A decent horror thriller movie.,"Judging from the casts, this movie looks like a low budget movie with additional CGI stuff. Sometimes, a low budget movie has a great plot or even a twist. However, A Quiet Place isn't that kind of movie.The plot is really simple. Because of its simplicity, the movie didn't have time for story telling. Imagine like this. You're having a supper in a fancy restaurant and the waiter directly gives you the main course without an appetizer. After you're done with your main course and ready for desert, the waiter appeared to tell you to pay the bill and leave the restaurant. Yup, that's the plot.Despite of the plot, the tension of the movie is well executed. It feels like you can understand what the protagonists feel in certain situation, especially in the climax. I wouldn't recommend a woman who easily get traumatized or whose PPD to watch this movie. The psychology element of being a woman is emphasized in the movie.A Quiet Place isn't a spoon-feeding movie. It needs certain aspect to understand the core. Well, it also because it's a slow-paced movie. Nevertheless, Emily Blunt and her husband (who also the director) showed us great chemistry without saying a lot of words. Also, the movie serves you a new sensation of watching movie in theater. It is really quiet in the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Something NEW,"Finally, a new kind of a horror/suspense/sci-fi movie from Hollywood. YAY. There is virtually no dialog as a human family hides in silence from a species of ... whatever they are ... that hunt and kill humans. The species seems devoid of weaknesses except they are blind and hunt by sound, so humanity's best chance is silence. With the adults, hey, not a big problem. With children, uh, not so much. The movie opens with what was shown in the trailer, with a little boy activating sound on a toy space shuttle, and dying when a predator attacks. The family struggles to survive in utter or near-silence amidst cornfields and woods in a rural place. It's not a concept I've seen used before. VERY good movie and if you're into the genre, well worth buying a ticket.PTH",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Slow start, into a great horror/suspense","This movie is a slow burn for the majority of it. If you can't sit still and get bored easily, you might have issues with the first 30-40 minutes.There is very little dialogue, most of their communication is with sign language that is subtitled. No big deal for me, but some people will hate that.Having said that, once the movie gets going, it is quite entertaining and very suspenseful. There are 2 or 3 well placed jump scares, but it doesn't rely on that for the only strong reaction from the audience.There is VERY tiny amounts of exposition in this movie. You only get glimpses of old newspapers to see why and how they are in this predicament. I felt like I could have used a tad more with the ear pieces, I didn't really know what the plan was or purpose was for those, but I get the general idea. I have no clue how they work, and would have liked to have some more explanation on that. Otherwise, you really don't need any exposition and it is all right in front of you.You get a real sense of dread and what a miserable existence these people have due to the situation they are in. Everything they do must be as quiet as possible. Just dropping something on the floor could mean the death of the ENTIRE family. Thinking of having a baby in this situation is horrifying.Horror movies seem to have WAY more misses than hits these days. I thought this was a fresh idea, the antagonists were well thought-out and original. The effects are good, and they did awesome with an idea that could have fallen on its face due to the pace and complete lack of dialogue. People are impatient these days, many want everything explained and don't like subtitles. They want the story to be in your face from the start. But. this movie really pays you back for the smoldering beginning.I give this an 8/10. If you are a patient person who likes a slow burn that ends in a bang, you might really enjoy this as well. I would compare the pace and payoff to 10 Cloverfield Lane in a way...I would suspect that the vast majority of negative reviews are from people with short attention spans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

total surprise,"A good one. Because it is more than a good thriller or an unusual hhorror. It represents an inspired pledge for the kinks defining the family. It is well crafted, example of great use of atmosphere and seductive expression of John Krasinski director art. It is difficult to describe or define or propose a verdict about it. Because it is the kind of film who propose a different perspective about events at each new view. Maybe, that is the basic virtue of a so rare film. The science to explore nuances and to give an impressive portrait of a vulnerable world. A film about courage and love and sacrifice and what is real important for you but, more significant, for the other. The performances of children are more than great. A film as a seed- after its end you feel it in special manner .After so many blockbusters and mediocre horrors, remakes and predictable thrillers, ""A Quite Place"" remains a real good surprise.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Quiet Place Film Review By Logan Coleman,"A Quiet Place film is the latest film starring John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. This film is about father doing all he can do to keep family safe. The performances that stood out were John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe. I can see references from films like Jaws; Alien with western influences. This film is about father doing all he can do to keep family safe. This film will also appeal to deaf people who have wanted to see a thriller film with a lead that is deaf.There are two major surprises in the film. I can see John Krasinski being nominated for an Oscar for best lead actor, director, and best screenplay. I do see potential Oscar nominations for Emily Blunt and Millicent Simmonds.

A generation defining horror movie.,"A Quiet Place is an unexpectedly great horror movie. I myself thought it was gonna be bad , seeing as Jim from the Office ( U.S. ) was set to direct and star in it. But i was genuinley surprised at the level of attention , thought and detail put into this work of art.As you've probably heard by now , A Quiet Place brilliantly use visuals and a lack of sound ( hence the name ) to tell it's very interesting and original story. In fact , in a 1:30 hour movie there are only two scenes where characters genuinley have a conversation. Not since 2015's MAD MAX: FURY ROAD have i scene a movie pull this off so well.But besides the genius level cinematography and writing , the one thing that makes this movie as great as it is is the amazing cast. John Krasinksi and Emily blunt have already proven themselves to stellar actors , but new comers Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe really steal the show , with child acting levels so good you could compare them to the kids from Stranger Things , or the LOsers Club from the 2017's IT.In short , A Quiet Place is an intense , stunning , clever and all round great movie i would recommend to audiences of all kinds ( except kids , ofcourse! )",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
So good,"Loved the movie, I was thinking this would be another cheesy horror movie. But it wasn't, it was filmed so beautifully, I really respected the side that John took, not being able to speak, using sign language to communicate really helped the family be efficient. The dance scene with John and Emily was my favorite!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A silent creep.,"A Quiet Place is the directorial debut for John Krasinski who also plays the main character, Lee Abbott. The family Abbott now lives in a post apocalyptic future where strange alien creatures have invaded. They can't see or smell well but are excellent in hearing, so far that they can track down potential prey with the sound of a little electronic toy. This family must now survive in this world making as little noise as possible. They don't wear shoes, eat out of leaves instead of plates and in my opinion the most interesting and unconventional aspect, speaking through sign language. A Quiet Place was a really unsettling and suspenseful film, mainly because it was quiet. Sounds that are made stand out so much that it honestly hurt my ears. The sound design is excellent, loud and irritating. This helps to build up the suspense and fear. The actors were also believable in their respectable roles, John Krasinski plays the caring husband and father. He has to keep his family together and protect them, however there is a deep frustration hidden beneath this character, in fact within all of the characters. Sometimes you can see that he wants to burst out but he can't, this frustration is captured beautifully by glances, groans and other small emotes. Krasinski real life wife, Emily Blunt also plays his wife in the film Evelyn. She is the caring mother, that must show strength and shelter to her children. There is also the sense of panic and terror hidden beneath her eyes. Blunt is an actress that is often unappreciated at large Award ceremonies such as the Oscars. This is unfortunate as she shows here once again how excellent she really is. This film is told with very little dialogue, mainly through facial emotes and sign language. The fact that all actors remain so believable with so little dialogue is commendable. Krasinski also shows himself to be a talented director, he sets up potential challenges really well for example a nail poking out, that could potentially later be a danger. The creatures themselves unfortunately weren't that scary or interesting, big CGI monsters. They didn't evoke this feeling of terror and phobia like the xenomorph did in the original Alien films. There was one interesting element towards the end that got me thinking about the creatures and I wished a little more of this. However this is really nitpicking, the film itself is excellent, a great creature feature in the vein of Jaws, Alien and Predator. What pushes this film over the edge onto being a great film is that it has elements of mainstream cinema, it does have jump scares (that were a little irritating) but also some great artistic choices. Most prominently the choice of very little dialogue. Overall this is a memorable, unsettling and frightening experience that I would highly recommend to fans of good horror / thrillers, creature films and good films in general.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Tense Intense Suspense,I saw the pre-release screening last night in Belgium not knowing what to expect. What I was drawn into was a pretty classic attempt to bombard my senses with many intelligent emotions from one scene to another. I would not really class this as a horror as such it is hard to describe.Deep human emotion with brilliant acting and a great atmospheric filming style.This is one I will not forget in a hurry and I was glad nobody in the audience made a noise because you need A Quiet Place for this.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Could've been better,"Firstly, this was a dumb movie to pick for a popcorn dinner but to my credit, I was determined to go in blind.Premise was good! Acting by Blunt was great! Characterisation was okay (no back stories. You're dropped in and then airlifted out). Treatment was lacking. This could've been much scarier (I was not scared), the survival of the characters was favoured by the writing in an obvious way, so for me it was more of a drama/thriller. For me a truly scary movie needs to be entirely unpredictable, you have to feel that no character is safe from the axe. The weakness of the beasts was revealed way too early and made it known that the characters were mostly safe.Ending was terrible. Such a lame ending required a much greater emotional overhaul throughout. I was actually disappointed that so many characters survived.Still, it was somewhat tense, and while I could see where it was going, I was curious to see how it went.Recommend to watch this alone at 1am after a smoke for best enjoyment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Great idea but no information,"I like the idea that they are monsters that are blind, very well thought out! But the film feels very ""empty"" to me without much detail.

I hope the second one will be worth it, I'll be sure to check it out!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Quiet Place shouldn't be silenced. It's an effective thriller that understands the rule of what you don't see is scarier,"One of the most important tips to creating horror is that ""what's not seen is the scariest thing"". While I'm not sure who said that, I first read it from a book on Alfred Hitchcock and how he implemented that philosophy to his works like Rear Window, The Birds, and most prominently, Psycho. Tension featured in those movies was very high and it was accomplished all without showing the monster. It's not to say it didn't, but Hitchcock understood that fear does more then create a barrier. Fear clouds judgment and can even turn the rational irrational.Filmmakers like Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and James Wan have all used this tool to their storytelling advantage. The only rules are that they can either never show the creature or they have to deliver on what's gotten people so frightened. Much of what's been done is what we could see. Today's movie focuses on what we can hear. Alien invasion stories are popular and the idea of creatures that hunt based off of sound is actually intriguing. How would society or even people continue to live in a world of forced silence? Can we be completely silent? Let's see if A Quiet Place can deliver on that idea.In the near future, the world seems to have already gone through an invasion of aliens that can't see, but have extreme sensitive hearing, and therefore, hunt based on sound. We get the idea that a mass extinction has happened and that people try their best to live in silence to avoid being eaten. The struggle is such for a farming family, the Abbott family. This consists of father Lee (played by John Krasinski), mother Evelyn (played by Emily Blunt), daughter Regan (played by Millicent Simonds), and sons Marcus and Beau.During one scout for food, Regan gives Beau a space shuttle toy, in which it's noise unfortunately, causes him to get eaten. A year passes and the family seems to have set itself up well with everyone speaking in American Sign Language and taking every precaution to make no noise of any kind (I guess this means no potato chips!). Regan still blames herself for Beau's death and starts to become more rebellious. Her father Lee does everything to help everyone survive, including making a soundproof basement for radio contact and his future newborn son.You may have noticed that while described the world and characters of A Quiet Place, I didn't fully explain the story. That's because the plot, while small, is actually well done and would spoil the movie if I did. A Quiet Place is actually very entertaining. Is it a masterpiece? Almost...if more questions would have been answered about these aliens. Now while the plot does implement the ""what's not scene is the scariest thing"" element, I don't think it delivers completely. Some of the questions I had included, ""if they can't see, how could they have found Earth?"" and ""wouldn't the loud noise of gunfire and missiles and scared them away?"". I expected answers to these that would have given these aliens more credit, but I didn't get it.How are the humans? They are all great. Like the recent The Shape of Water, these actors have rely on body language and facial emotion to communicate. Both John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are expressive enough to pull off the unseen tension while raising their children. The breakout star here is really Millicent Simmonds. Not only does she look like a ""real"" teenager, but she uses her real deafness to her advantage, giving her not just a honest look into a world of silence, but how to respond to people who could never understand her.It's said that the movie has an underlying theme of parenthood and the responsibilities that it comes with. I wouldn't say it's underlying, and much of the plot is about accepting responsibilities and understanding that no matter how bad things look, your parents will always care for you. This in turn, does make A Quiet Place more family friendly then you'd think. It's certainly a scary movie first, but this is something that I think most families could watch together and I think that was director John Krasinski's plan all along.I'll give this seven hearing aids out of ten. As far as a movie, it's entertaining. I can't call it a masterpiece like Jaws or Psycho, but if this does get people to talk about it, then A Quiet Place is doing something right. You can't silence this review; go and see A Quiet Place.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Could have been better,First half was poor but then turned into a good film. It should have gone further than the end and show the tide turning and cut out the useless stuff from the first half. All in all worth a watch but not repeat viewings.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Hush&Shush,"Directed by John Krasinski We follow a family as they try to survive in a world populated by creatures that hunt by sound. A quiet place is a film that at first glance doesn't look like much, and many would be turned away at the idea of watching a movie with very little dialogue, but the movie offers a suspenseful and thrilling experience. The whole cast gives off great body language. The creatures hunt by sound so nobody speaks in the movie. You don't get a single word until about 40 minutes in. It's so quiet that you don't even hear birds or crickets chirping, and most of the story is told through gestures, sign language, and expressions. The daughter's Deaf with a faulty hearing aid. It's like a modern attempt at a silent film, that requires your attention to appreciate it. The family is likable for the most part, the daughter does have questionable actions involving the parents. It's pretty reckless and irresponsible even for her reason way. John Krasinski also stars as the father lee, as more the protector of the family. He spends his time down in the basement bulletin survival tactics and trying to find survivors on broadcast radio. The creatures are good but nothing really special. The forefront of the movie Is more focused on the family, and their relationship until the second half is when the monsters are more relevant. Although it does kind of break the immersion a bit when the monsters show up and they make such a big deal about noise. There are certain moments that attract the monsters, it just makes you think if they can hear that well this family would probably already be dead. It's not a spoiler given how it is advertised in the trailers The wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) is pregnant and gives birth. I don't care how you write the story or the situation. Nobody's going to have a baby in this situation. Babies make noise awake or asleep they cry. Overall A quiet place is a good film if you are a fan of more atmospheric as opposed to action-based to check the movie out if not then you're not going to enjoy what the film has to offer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The fusion of horror with a strong dramatic charge is effective, intensifying the impact of the performances, especially through body dialogue and the use of sign language, which are masterfully executed by the cast. The construction of tension is impeccable, creating a feeling of distress that grips the viewer from beginning to end. Although the aliens' design may seem generic at first glance, the grotesque and frightening look is enhanced by the special effects. The mystery surrounding the origin of the aliens, although little explored, adds an intriguing element to the narrative.With a bold proposal for the genre, ""A Quiet Place"" stands out for the creative strength of the screenwriters and the talent of the production team and cast, consolidating itself as the best horror film with science fiction elements of 2018.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"A ""Dumb, Illogical, and Loud"" Place","Don't let the title of this movie fool you! A Quiet Place is not really all that quiet after all. Having constant scary music and jump-scares in ""quiet"" scenes actually hurts the premise of this movie. It really infuriated me, because this could have been one of my all-time favourite Horror movies if done correctly. Unfortunately, characters were making dumb choices non-stop that even under my suspension of disbelief was crossing the line. The logic behind what the monsters can and can't hear constantly changes, which is a sign of bad writing as the movie breaks its own rules to make sure certain events happen illogically. The acting and technical side of this movie were pretty good, as well as the monster design, but that's about it.Overall, a fantastic premise hurt by sticking to clichéd Hollywood Horror movie tropes and a soundtrack that doesn't know when to stay quiet. Come to think of it, maybe the movie would have actually worked better without a soundtrack at all.3.5/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A quiet thrill,"Suprisingly this chest tightening thriller is layered with emotion, tension and overall quality that will see it on most must watch 2018 lists.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Thriller not Horror,"A Quiet Place was released on April 6, 2018. Starring and directing are John Krasinski, and Emily Blunt accompanies him. This film is about a family living on a farm in a world full of alien monsters. These monsters kill when they hear the slightest noise. As parents, they have to teach their young how to be quiet and not disturb the monsters. They teach them American Sign Language, expressing themselves in other ways than crying, and that toys cannot have batteries because the monsters will come. This family is on their journey of survival by silence.
The overall film was not as terrifying as everyone made it out to be, but it was a successful monster movie. I have viewed horror films that have made me not want to go to sleep or be alone in the dark, and this film is not on that list. Instead, this type of cinema leaves me wondering what I would do in a monster-filled world that they hunt you if they hear you. What would I do if I had to teach my children not to make a sound, ever? These films make you put yourself in the main character's shoes, which puts your survival skills into question. This movie's central theme is family; these parents would do anything to protect their children from harm. For example, in the trailer, the little boy has a toy rocket ship in hand while the family is taking a walk. As it starts to make a noise, the father slowly turns around and looks in the woods to hear a monster getting closer to his son.
Some useful methods they used to strengthen the film was that they had marked spots throughout their house to show where they can step without the floors creaking. In many horror films, they make all the bad things happen at night and in the dark. In this film, the monsters can appear at any time of day. Over the years, they have gotten sandbags and poured a pathway of sand so that they would not make any noise on the pavement or leaves. I liked the fact that the family did not play it safe. They decided to have another baby, knowing that babies do not understand the gravity of the situation when they cry and knowing how loud giving birth is and how close she has been to being killed by the monster for giving birth. The setting impacted this movie's sense of scary by the family living in an old home with a silo surrounded by a corn maze. This movie had me on the edge of my seat with the tension. For example, when the baby would not stop crying, the mother could not do anything about it, but she knew that the monster was near her, so she acted quickly.
The film had genuine-looking killer aliens. They were genuinely terrified by the fact that they sprinted through trees, had faces opening, exposing a slimy set of sharp teeth. These monsters are almost replicas of the Stranger Things ""Demogorgon."" The creatures are blind, so their hearing sense is heightened. This trait of theirs is beneficial to the family because they would have been killed a long time ago if they could see them. The movie's realism was accurate to me. The first time I saw this was in theaters, and it seemed as everyone in the room had put themselves in the movie, and it was silent throughout. No one wanted to open candy or cough because they did not want to make noise causing the creatures to appear.
I enjoyed the fact that they did not just whisper throughout the movie; instead, they learned some American Sign Language. The actors had to retain part of a new language for their role, which is inspiring. For the past four years, I have been learning ASL and about the Deaf community. There are not that many films that incorporate ASL, and many Deaf people thought that it was awesome they got to connect to the movie rather than watching only closed captions. This movie did an excellent job of making it feel like real-life scenarios. For example, Millicents Simmonds is Deaf in real life, which only adds an authentic sense to the movie. This movie was very loyal to her real-world of silence and sign language. The scary part of her being Deaf is that she never knew how loud she was to attract the monster. For example, when she was in the corn maze by herself at night, her cochlear implant let out a high pitch screech. She did not understand why it was doing this, but little did she know the monster was right behind her.
Overall, I would rate A Quiet Place a B+. I liked the actors, the story, and the setting. The tension everyone had while watching this movie was crazy. There were some inconsistencies throughout the film, but it is one of John Krasinski's first films, so I think he can get away with it because it is still a creative film. I would recommend watching this film if you are interested in Stranger Things or monster movies in general with little jump scares. This movie should be titled as a thriller, not a horror jump scare movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Not bad,"I went Into the movie not really knowing the plot nor watching the whole trailer, so didn't know it was a quiet movie with hardly any dialogue even though I knew the title. It was well made and the effects and acting were well done. I did like it but it was a lil slow from the beginning but not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Surprisingly good,"I am a 61 year old woman who avoids slasher movies like the plague and is really not all that interested in violence in films. So, I reluctantly admitted a movie with these kind of reviews was worth seeing. I, of course, was pleasantly surprised.Although A Quiet Place has many traditional plot lines of a thriller, I enjoyed the unique aspects, especially the basic concept: noise of any kind would give away location and put the whole family in danger.Given the tremendous amount of silence, it seems ironic to tout the script, but it is incredibly well done. The characters are so well drawn. We know little about the life they led before, but we learn so much about the thoughts and emotions of each family member. Amazing what the eyes can say.The setting is a farm and the area is beautiful as well as creepy. The music certainly adds to this creepiness, as well. The ending is beautifully left vague but with a hope the strong women characters will prevail.John Krasinski did an amazing job as both lead character and director. The only flaw I may have noticed had to do with the gun placement, but I may have missed something.Otherwise, this is an example of the craft of filmmaking done exceedingly well. Everything is tight, the tension is constant, and the story is absorbing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Very effective thriller,"Should've won a couple years ago for sound design being so incredible! I originally saw in the theater just wasn't reviewing much back then even at that point I loved A Quiet Place. Amazon had it free I don't know why it's not anymore either way wanted to rewatch before part 2 which I'm seeing tomorrow. Anyway for a horror movie it's really unique, I prefer the more violent or psychological thrillers in most cases and I don't think Quiet Place gets talked about much when it should! Emily Blunt and John Krasinki have such a beautiful relationship, I love it al and how it gets more intense as everything continues/",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A self contained thriller that masterfully tackles an interesting concept.,"Having seen no promotional material or trailers, but only the high critic score I expected this movie to deliver a solid, well crafted story. It exceeded my expectations.A Quiet Place is set in a mysterious world where making a sound will result in death, however the story is not about monsters or saving the world. Its about a family who has adapted to the environment around it and their struggle to live in a world without the freedom to express themselves through speech.It sets up characters and develops them extremely well especially for a movie where almost all communication is through sign language and fleshes these characters out so that the final act of the movie has extreme emotional weight.A major chunk of this is to be attributed to the fantastic performances, especially by Emily Blunt who, in my opinion should be a frontrunner for an academy award this year.This film has little to no extra scenes with each moment either acting as a set up or character development (though it may drag ever so slightly in the end) and thanks to the focused screenplay and fantastic directing A Quiet Place is a movie well worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

I'm hesitant to watch movies that go in a new artistic direction. This was not one of them!,"As a horror movie and an overall movie fanatic, I've never written reviews about movies before because it was for my pure enjoyment. This movie changed all of that. I absolutely did not expect 90% of what I found in this movie, as it's artistic expression and the genuineness of the characters had me drawn in. I actually connected with the characters in this movie, and had empathy for the struggle of the life they had to live. As for the horror aspect, I would call this revolutionary for the thriller genre instead, as most thrillers feature what you would call dead air, which creates the build up for intense moments which may or may not feature scares, this movie takes it to the all out extreme of how you can mystify an audience without even having to make a single sound. I would say it should've given film makers a wake up call to show that they can explore a specific aspect within a film, make a movie incorporating that aspect as the basis of how the plot should play out, and the movie will still be completely AMAZING! This is my first review, so go easy on me please. But if you ever have any doubts about watching this because it is very horroresque, I would say as long as you don't faint at the sight of blood, you'll walk out of the theaters enjoying everything this film encompasses..Yeah, this was my favorite movie of 2018, even over infinity wars.That is until Jurassic World 2 comes out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Good performances, not so good plot","I remember watching Starship Troopers and being struck by how silly the plot was. What military would send human soldiers into a near- suicidal battle with physically superior alien beings? As Ripley says in Aliens, nuke them from outer space. It's the only way to be sure. Watching this movie gave me similar thoughts. We don't have much backstory on these aliens, buy they don't seem as terrifying as the aliens Ripley and company had to face. Where is the military that could dispatch these creatures with modern armaments? The human family facing these creatures seems ill-equipped and poorly armed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
When Silence Is Scary,"John Krasinski proves himself to be a director of promise with this smart horror movie set in a near future when humans have to be completely silent if they are to survive.There are strange, spider-like creatures on the loose, you see, and while they can't see or smell, they can hear the tiniest sound, and when they do they come creepy crawling along to tear you apart. What these creatures are, or where they come from, is never explained, which is a wise move on the part of the filmmakers, because the air of mystery adds to the overall scariness of the premise. We don't know any more than the characters in the movie, who focus not on the big picture wheres or whys, but rather on surviving moment to moment.""A Quiet Place"" deftly straddles the delicate line between being entertainingly scary and disturbingly off putting. Much of the content in this film is of the variety that personally bothers me very much and can make horror films feel more like endurance tests than anything else. I'm talking specifically about children being in peril for the entire movie, and the frantic helplessness parents feel in trying to protect their young from circumstances beyond their control. I don't generally enjoy stories like that, and there's a moment early on in ""A Quiet Place"" that sends the message to its audience that all bets are off and the movie isn't necessarily going to follow horror movie rules, including keeping the kids safe. But Krasinski as a director has more on his mind than just making us feel awful, and instead focuses on the strength and resilience of families when pushed into situations they could never imagine, and the willingness of parents to bear almost anything to keep their kids safe.In a world that never shuts up, ""A Quiet Place"" reminds us how scary silence can be.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The scary sound of silence,"A QUIET PLACE comes with echoes of WAR OF THE WORLDS and CGI aliens that look like hideous clones of Sigourney Weaver's intergalactic chums. After an invasion by people-chomping monsters a family of survivors try to find sanctuary in rural America: Emily Blunt and her real-life husband John Krasinski (who also directs) and their three kids. The aliens are blind but super-sensitive to sound, so the family learns to live as silently as possible, talking in sign-language and whispers. The perils of noise are brought vividly home from time to time: a battery-operated toy or a dropped plate brings terrible retribution. Emily is pregnant, so you wonder how she is going to give birth in silence and produce a noiseless infant. These questions are answered in nerve-shredding scenes in the second half of the film.Normally, when someone's phone goes off in a cinema, you make noises of disapproval and long to belt them. When this happened yesterday I almost hit the deck!A QUIET PLACE has the rustic unease of several of M. Night Shyamalan's movies. You think the countryside is safer than the city?

"Good but to ,,Quiet''","""A Quiet Place"" is a gripping and innovative thriller that breathes new life into the horror genre. Its unique premise, where sound-hunting creatures threaten humanity, creates an intense atmosphere of suspense and tension. The film's minimal use of dialogue and emphasis on silence becomes its strongest asset, drawing audiences into a world where every sound could mean danger. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski deliver compelling performances, anchoring the emotional core of the story. Krasinski's directorial vision crafts nail-biting sequences that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's expertly crafted sound design and visuals heighten the immersive experience, making silence a palpable and anxiety-inducing element. Moreover, it successfully balances horror with heartfelt family dynamics, adding depth to its storytelling. However, for some viewers, the heavy reliance on silence and minimal dialogue might create moments of slow pacing, especially for those expecting a more action-packed or dialogue-driven narrative. Additionally, while the concept is innovative, some plot elements might come across as familiar to seasoned horror enthusiasts, potentially reducing the surprise factor or originality in certain scenes. Some viewers might also find themselves wanting more extensive exploration of the creatures' origins or backstory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
