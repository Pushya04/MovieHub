Maybe the formula needs invigorating...,"I attended the Cast and Crew screening on Sunday, in Leicester Square, with high hopes for this film as it's without doubt the most exciting job I've had. This was my first feature experience, and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.But, even as someone with a lot of time for his films, and a pre-existing bias, I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well, especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick, but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free-floating, evocative trip. Sure, it's weird looking, but we've seen it before, and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs, absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them, drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time, simply because we're not giving much to care for.With a source material so familiar, even to those whose knowledge is second hand references, there needs to be a degree of innovation (as in Svenkmejer's dark stop-motion version, or the co-opting of Terry Gilliam in to his ""Tideland"" narrative), or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a mid-point that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story, and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted, quasi-Gothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself, and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential, and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out, when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem, that Tim Burton, while he is still making decent films, has been a long way off special for some time now.6/10 (if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5), but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids, I'm sure it'll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved, and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film (although I got this one for free...)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"some stunning visuals, clumsy writing","It is still worth the high price of the 3-D admission to see some of the amazing animation and design, but the writing is extremely boring and clumsy, and the performances cannot save it. Too many liberties were taken with the originals here, and in no way improve upon them, it only barely resembles either of Carroll's books in theme and some specific scenes. There are some ""Disney moments"" that literally set off a gag reflex as well.The animation is quite stunning and wonderful though, as is the costuming and set design (in so much as there were sets and not just green screens, I'm sure SOME actual props were used). There are some clever elements that owe only to good visual design and direction I'm sure, as the only other clever bits in the dialogue were the parts directly lifted from the originals.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing Wonderful,"Adding a little bit of a background story and a few more characters to Alice's adventures didn't do as much as i thought it would for the story. Truthfully i wanted to love this movie, I'm a huge Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp fan. But this just didn't do it for me. I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fantasy , imagination and adventures is this peculiar version based on Lewis Carrol tale","Tim Burton film version of Lewis Carroll's classic proves the special slickness of director to create weird worlds and strange characters . Alice (Mia Wasikowska)is 19-year-old and doesn't remember nothing about her former visit on Wonderland happened 10 years ago . Then she returns to the magical world from her childhood adventure, where she reunites with her old friends as Mad Hatter (Jhnny Depp), White Rabbit (voice of Michael Sheen), Chesshie Cat (Stephen Fry), Blue Caterpillar (voice of Alan Rickman) and learns of her true destiny: to end the Red Queen's (Helena Bonham Carter)reign of terror who helped by Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover) is fighting her sister White Queen (Anne Hathaway)for the kingdom.Moving rendering of Lewis Carroll classic with gimmick of blending live action and computer generator puppets and 3D animation . Riveting for its casting , but overall , roller-coaster spectacle. Most of the charm and wit remains from original story in this particular version . It results to be an amusing of somewhat aloof , storytelling of children classic with a magnificent three-dimensional visual effects team at its best bring to life the following : the Cheshire cat , Blue caterpillar, the Queen of hearts, March Hare , Tweedledum and many others. Breathtaking array of technical effects with impressive set pieces illuminate the Alice's full-blown adventures. The amazing plot is pure entertainment and with interesting screenplay based on characters created by Lewis Carroll , though here Alice acts as a heroine who combats dragons , monsters and of course the evil Queen of Hearts . Episodic characters as Mad Hatter and Queen of Hearts are given major boost by strong personalities from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter . Spectacular final battle full of action , groundbreaking frames and fabulous fights . Overwhelming production design , though full of digital effects with impressive scenes and portentous images .

Not what you would expect from a Johnny Deep picture,"When I decided to pay a premium price for a 3D blockbuster I expected a memorable picture. Besides the fact that Johnny Deep plays a great role as usual and H.B. Carter also has a nice performance the overall plot is dull and static. I believe that because they had to ""improvise"" and write a new story continuing the original one, the quality of the screenplay and plot decreased significantly. Although there are some funny moments and well written lines for the main characters, many of the others pass by unnoticed. Overall it was a nice, entertaining flick with average 3D effects, way below Avatar, and a simple,uncomplicated plot. Also it was rather short since I expected 120 minutes at least and not 100. Finally I would this movie performed below my expectations. A 7/10 would be a fair grade in my honest opinion.Best, Stefan",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Has anyone seen white rabbit with clock here?,"After watching this movie I don't want to live in this world anymore. I love Tim Burton's movies and this one wasn't disappointment. The cast was great. Everyone played, they weren't just grimacing. Helena Bonham Carter was great as always. Mad hatter was something, his lines were witty and his dance was the funniest thing ever. Every character is special. I liked this Alice, she's strong, smart and modern. And every time I saw the cat I wanted to be there to hug it. I was worried that Disney would spoil this movie, but I was wrong this is absolutely Burton's movie. The landscapes will make you forget about everything you saw before. Atwood's costumes are beautiful, they fit the characters same is the make-up. If you like fairy tales don't miss Alice In Wonderland.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Treading water in Wonderland,"Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer-generated imagery on-screen. Sure it's very efficient and well-designed but like CGI in general, it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly-familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry, hey isn't that Alan Rickman, I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain, etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter-productive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voice-over actors.There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman – they say familiarity breeds contempt, well that's a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depp's Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards, while Burton's visuals and Elfman's music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film, and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite, as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We don't know or have any interest in these characters, so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them, it means nothing. It also doesn't help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title character's state of mind – at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upper-class chump. So you are left wondering what exactly was the point?I saw this in 3D and if there is one thing that this film has taught me it's that I am done with this 'new and improved' technology. I sensed it was a gimmick even before I watched Avatar; now I am certain. A bad film is a bad film, and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota. It's all surface-veneer, and really that's this movie's ultimate problem, there is nothing of interest within the CGI/3D. A great shame, as the source material is undeniably compelling.I realize that I am almost done here but I have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film. What was it? It was when the Mad Hatter and then, subsequently, Alice do a truly cringe-worthy little dance near the end of the film. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I half-expected Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres. That didn't happen. And that is, at least, one saving grace.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It is that, being the story of a nineteen year old Alice who returns to barely-remembered Wonderland, but it also lifts dialogue and scenes from the original books. The story is your standard journey, emotionally, but all set in a very Tim Burton Wonderland.Which, of course, looks astounding. Wonderland is an amazing place, often colourful, but equally often ravaged and desolate. It's a treat for the eyes, with the imagination and design shining through the technology. (It's very, very good, but strange things happen if you look somewhere the 3D doesn't want you to look and there's the odd moment of strangely stiff animation, especially when human(-like) characters are completely CGI-ed up.)Unexpectedly, it sometimes feels like one of the Narnia films (though makes those movies look like accountant-led spreadsheets that have been printed out on toilet paper and left out in the rain), but mainly it's exactly what you'd expect from Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. It's a great big treat of a movie, to be sure. Given that it's Tim Burton working with Disney, it's often gruesome and scary, but not too much. It makes you laugh at times, it pins you to the back of your seat at others, it gets you leaning forward trying to drink in every detail of the place, but it's not ever actually surprising. You know what's up, you know where things are going and you're never shocked. (Maybe once, in a quiet, horrible scene that stands out, even amongst the rest.) Even if you've not seen a single still photo or second of footage, if you know Wonderland and you know Tim Burton, you can picture it yourself effortlessly.So much of it is still in my head this morning, but it's all visual. There's no heartache or sense of triumph that lingers after a great story. Funny as it is, there's only one line I'm ever likely to quote (a single word). I just have these amazing images left in my brain. In that sense, then, it's appropriately dream-like.I doubt I'll go back and watch it again at the cinema, but I'm most definitely getting the Blu- Ray when it comes out next week, or whenever Disney decided they should bring it out.If it feels like I've damned it with faint praise, I don't intend to. It's all pretty wonderful for the two hours it takes to speed past you, but I just want to make it clear - nothing that goes into your ears or your heart ever quite matches what goes into your eyes.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pure, undemanding, trippy wonderment.","On its release last year I couldn't find much to fault Avatar on. But after watching Alice – the first serious CGI-dominated 3D film since James Cameron's immersive motion picture – there's now a glaring issue with it: the bar was set waaay too high. Previously the computer generated effects in Alice would have knocked your socks off, however in a post-Avatar world it significantly underwhelms. Not an overly fair statement for a film which has consistently beautiful and detailed images – take the awe-inspiring climactic clash which is set on a chess board-esquire battlefield for example – but you can thank Cameron for that. Once you get past the fact that Burton's creation does not aim to achieve realistic environments or creatures and that the actors will never appear to be anywhere other than in front of a green screen, you are in good stead to enjoy the colourful animation for what it was intended for: pure, undemanding, trippy wonderment.It's a damn shame then that this meticulously crafted, psychedelic visual-journey isn't matched with a screenplay that was given just as much effort. The inbuilt metaphors of the Alice tale are still there however writer Linda Woolverton adds very little in the way of character development or plot undercurrents, seemingly intent on relying on the visual effects wizards and actors to contribute the extra layers. Her biggest missed opportunity is further exploration into the Mad Hatter or even the White Queen – both of whom are half-baked caricatures – with the Hatter coming off as a mere chance for Depp to be quirky, rather than the cleverly-written character with an interesting back story that he should have been. To Woolverton's credit though, she did manage to concoct some deliriously amusing dialogue for the Hatter and the Red Queen; a small highlight of her script which partially redeems her lack-lustre attempts elsewhere.Kudos to Depp, then, that he still generates another memorable, albeit this time one-dimensional, on screen persona. He provides his Hatter with plenty of lovable eccentricities and rough edges, all the more noteworthy considering the non-existent depth to which the material affords him. He'll certainly be a hit with the kids. The rest of the cast are unpredictable in their output: Aussie newcomer Wasikowska overdoes it as the titular protagonist, Hathaway's saccharine White Queen grates on the nerves and the opaque Glover is unbearably boring as Stayne; whilst Carter's malevolent Red Queen is a hoot, Lucas induces a laugh or two as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, Rickman oozes noble charisma as the Blue Caterpillar and Paul Whitehouse's March Hare steals every single scene he is in.Depp's usual strong performance and Burton's knack for striking visuals narrowly prevail over a shallow script and an unconvincing leading lady.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sylvie and Bruno Continued,"I can usually find something to engage with and love in any film. It is a sort of challenge and promise to myself to do so -- as a choice in building a life. But this movie was a nadir in my adventure.The Alice stories are special, special absolutely and special to me.For many people, the stories are simply amusing nonsense for children, something to be fuzzily remembered in the same way as, say, Peter Pan or a Grimm's tale. But it is anything but. Carroll advanced our ability to speak to ourselves when he polished the story and sent it to us.One can hardly expect someone like Burton, or anyone making a big budget Disney- distributed project to understand the material. But if you cannot understand the soul of what you are working with, you cannot leverage or extend it. You will need to count on your own talents instead. But Burton's strength is simple: the imposition of disordered fantasy on relatively ordered reality. He has exhausted this and was finished as an artist long ago.By any measure other than color intensity, this is a failure as a movie. When Depp isn't given a complex structure to support, he can at least be amusing. Here, we have not even that.What is normally considered nonsense sequences in the books are anything but. Dodgson was the foremost theory of logic in Europe at the time. Based in Oxford, he created the story for the child of the Dean, the creator of the then great Greek lexicon. Dodgson/Carroll was a master of the inadequacies of logic within the medium of everyday language.All the ""nonsense"" sections are really a catalog of all the strange ways in which logic breaks when it encounters the way we linguistically form thoughts. Many of these parody assumptions Dean Liddell made in his understanding of Greek, mistakes that have saddled us with flawed scholarship on Aristotle and his logic. They are great, great fun: puzzles that even a 6 year old can laugh about.This is where playful narrative originates. Only Shakespeare, Joyce and Lennon-NcCartney have had similar influence on our everyday thought. Karl Rove, for example, stands on the shoulders of Charles Dodgson's trickery.None of this is conveyed. None, even though the Marx brothers made this safe territory for film humor.Even the overall structure of the Alice stories is cool. Dodgson was not a pedophile, nor a drug addict, but he was something more dangerous to his soul. He was a charter member of Oxford's Psychical Society and a student of the inventor of mystical tarot, the self-named Court de Gebelin. The structure of the Alice stories, based on this, is our first structurally folded literature.His ordination ruined by his guilt about this, he spent the remainder of his life writing a C S Lewis-like Christian allegory, Sylvie and Bruno to make amends. It was every bit as tepid and worthless as this. Every bit as wrong, as offensive to reality.The movie also mixes in Jabberwocky. That was a poem written years earlier as a teen, to amuse his crotchety parson father, someone obsessed with the perversion of noble Saxon words by effete French. The poem is about the battle between true (Saxon) language and logical language.(This comment is on the two-dimensional exhibition. I decided that the effects would be beowulf-like and cheaply distracting. I think I was right.)Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie Review: 'Alice in Wonderland' is a beautiful world to behold,"Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a sequel and not a retelling of the original children's novels by Lewis Carroll. In this film, Alice is now 19-years old, and soon after the death of her father, is proposed to be married away. Feeling pressured, she runs off, following a white rabbit, which leads her to Wonderland, a place she only vaguely remembers from childhood. There, she meets past familiar faces as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), and eventually the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), who has been terrorizing the land with her harsh rule and beheading of heads. Alice finds out that her destiny is to end the Red Queen's rule by slaying the queen's dragon, Jabberwocky, as written in the prophesy. Along the way she meets up with all sorts of colorful characters.If you remember, Steven Spielberg's Hook was the live action sequel to Peter Pan. Similarly, Tim Burton's film is very much like a close cousin, except it's about Alice. The progression of the story is also kind of similar, where the main character, Alice, like Peter, must rediscover herself and finally defeat her nemesis. Likewise, both films are both elaborately staged, they are both about growing up and making choices, and there's a big showdown. Chances are if one liked Hook, one will find many things to like about Alice.Tim Burton's version of the Wonderland's environments are gorgeous, imaginatively created, lots of colorful details, and breathes life. The castles are sleek and intricately designed. The creatures are generally live versions (CG) of the Disney's previous animated version, and they're even more odder and fun to look at. I particularly loved the portrayal of the Chesire Cat in this film, and the way he snakes through midair like water feels very natural, although it wouldn't feel so natural in real life. Only complaint I may have in terms of visuals would probably be where we see CG versions of natural creatures like dogs--they're not particularly stylized so their CG-ness can be more noticeable.Danny Elfman's score fits the environment just right, giving added intensity when needed. This film is essentially Tim Burton's playground and even if there wasn't any story, it still would be plenty of fun to just watch the loony characters in their environment. I will add that 3-D aspect of it helped a lot.Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter with usual gusto, as he brings much energy and quirkiness to such an oddball character. I suppose there is a mix of Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow in there somewhere. Given that other characters are mostly or completely CG, Johnny Depp's character can feel a bit of out of place, as he still feels human. Helena Bonham Carter as the big-headed (literally) Red Queen is fun, expressive, and extremely likable for such a short-tempered character. Mia Wasikowska is particularly noteworthy as Alice, which she plays with free-spirited pluckiness, charm, and beauty.The story, admittedly, is a simple one, although it is to the story's credit that Alice is now an adult--it helps since many happenings in Wonderland can be quite unfriendly, bizarre, and grotesque. Thankfully, no more worries about some dream causing some lifelong trauma to some poor child. I also appreciated the fact that her Wonderland, like dreams, is an extension of her frustrations with the ""real"" world, where she felt she had many ""expectations"" from outside forces. At the same time, it's not like Where the Wild Things Are, where other characters are actually projections of real-life people from the main character's life. For example, to read Mad Hatter as an extension of her father feels a bit like a stretch, although the Red Queen could possibly represent her future mother-in-law since they both dislike animals. Certainly, one can merely enjoy it at face value and the creativity of this world and be fine with it.Overall, I enjoyed this world of Alice. In one sense, that may be the important thing, if one were to stick to the flavor of the original novel. The story within the Wonderland, I felt, wasn't as poignant as ""real life"" moments, which were filmed with much love and detail. Given the fact that original story consisted of series of random events and character interactions, it was nice to see the characters work together a bit. The overall result isn't something beyond what one would expect from this style of work, but it's fun, and where it succeeds, it succeeds well, thanks to the consistency of Tim Burton's imaginative visuals. *** out of **** stars.For more of my reviews, you can follow me on Twitter at http://twitter.com/d_art",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Alice against Lewis Carroll,"I loved ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed. Alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next, and what twist will put Alice in just new trouble, often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing. Now this is all exactly what this movie does not have. After Alice arrives in the new 'underland', you will soon be in on the entire story: It is two sides, good against evil, and Alice is to slay a monster. Not a single second is unexpected. Nor are there any twists. (But even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept: Scenes without any real characters rush by, there is no focus of attention in the opening.) But most of all, my understanding of then brand ""Alice"" is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self, her anxieties, her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy, all taking shape in landscapes, characters and events painted in dream-language. Of this essence, it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression - let alone, if Tim Burton is in the team. But there is nothing, nothing of this concept in this movie. Instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal, natural instabilities that every one carries inside, the story here is already written, and Alice is only to follow marked footprints. For the only reason that... she is the one foretold to do it. There is merely the most silly 'hollywood-intellectualism', where 'good against evil' must be taken as, like, certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles, and it is so much about decision making and all... I'm devastated. Eventually, Tim Burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content. The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie, and Alice, slaying him. Carroll is dead, long live 'Alice does Hollywood'.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
very good movie,"Alice in Wonderland is a very good movie, where you can find everythings you want. There are action scenes but not too many, very nice characters where you're attached-with and a lot more. The story respects the original tale but doesn't mimic it entirely, and let's Tim Burton's talent talk by himself.

It's a very good movie that I recommend to you, no matter your age.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Call me Mad, but I Hatter really good time.","The setup of this movie sounds like the beginning of a good joke: ""Tim Burton and Walt Disney walk into a bar..."" You wouldn't think it possible, but it happened. Tim Burton, the master of dark, twisted fantasies where every story involves at least 1 corpse, teamed up with the studio known for bright pink bunnies and such.The temptation is for Burton fans to expect a Burtonesque flick while Disney fans expect an accurate retelling of the 1951 Disney cartoon classic. Neither happened, not by a longshot.What happened instead is something you just have to experience. Someone once told me that the root of beauty lies in contrast. A yellow flower in a field of yellow flowers isn't as beautiful as a yellow flower growing on a desolate battlefield of some war-torn desert. So with that in mind, this is a movie for people who can appreciate the contrast between Burton's sarcasm and Disney's innocence. I'll give you an example...In the Disney cartoon, as well as Lewis Carroll's original story, the Red Queen runs around commanding ""Off with his head!"" at anyone who irritates her, but of course the Red King quietly follows behind whispering ""You're pardoned"" each time, thus saving the executioner a ton of gory axe blades. But in this version, in a brief but stark moment, we learn that the beheadings are quite real. And then bam, we quickly return to Disney territory where we are entertained by the banter of cute talking mice.Literally, I rubbed my eyes, turned to the person sitting next to me and asked, ""Wait... did we just see a bunch of decapitated heads??"" Confusing at first, this volley between macabre & merry becomes the charm of this film. I should add that I counted at least 3 characters who got an eyeball disgorged. And yet, in Disneyesque fashion you never really feel a sense of menace; it's mostly in good fun.I purposely didn't mention the plot until now because, to me, the story was secondary to the overall vibe of the film. But in case you're wondering, this is *not* a retelling of Disney's, Carroll's or anyone else's ""Alice in Wonderland"". This is sort of a sequel to the original where Alice, now 19 years old and about to get married, gets reconnected with her long forgotten adventure of youth. In that respect, it reminded me of how the movie ""Hook"" was sort of a sequel to ""Peter Pan"".To me, that's the only department where this film lost a few points, because it felt like they were weaving too much of a story into a tale that was inherently a stream-of-consciousness that mimicked the randomness of a dream (Lewis Carroll himself invented the story on the spot while rowing Alice Pleasance Liddell and her sisters on a pond). This version follows more of a straighforward plot to defeat the bad guys, and in so doing, it got away from the dreamlike feeling of all other versions I've seen.Johnny Depp... of course JD steals the show with his alternately endearing and terrifying Mad Hatter. He plays the role as someone suffering from severe PTSD which manifests itself in multiple personalities. There's his normal, gentle, lisping Hatter. And then there's his cruel, dark Scottish Highlander Hatter who sounds like Sean Connery just lost his place in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles.Honorable mention goes to Crispin Glover (Marty McFly's nerdy father in ""Back to the Future"") who plays a very chilling Jack of Hearts. And another honorable mention goes to Anne Hathaway who plays the angelic but somewhat ditzy White Queen.Special effects are good for 2010 but a bit dated for today. The best effects are the subtle ones such as the way the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) was depicted as having an enormous, bulbous head. I also thought the ""Drink Me, Eat Me"" scene where Alice shrinks & grows was done very well.In the end, although I had been expecting something of a trainwreck, I think the odd pairing of Burton & Disney was a success. So what's next? Maybe horror master John Carpenter (""Halloween"") does a teencom with Lindsay Lohan & Jamie Lee Curtis called ""Freaky Friday the 13th""?",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A marvellous 3D disappointment,"To be honest I was expecting so much more from all the hype building up to this film's release. Burton has more than obviously juxtaposed the relationship between good and evil, however this is not what Alice in 'Underland' is about. I was hoping to see a graphical dive into the creativity and imagination of Alice's mind, however what we are presented with is an idolised view of each individual character thrown together in a weak and see through plot about power. The story has no originality, and throughout I was noting similarities between 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.' C.S Lewis may be in touch about copyright.

Hope always springs eternal,"Precisely twenty years ago, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp had their first cooperative experience in cinema, the result of this team work was the pretty uncommon and extraordinary fairytale ''Edward Scissorhands''. After they made a lot of successful movies together, they decided to turn the clock back and make another mind-blowing fairytale. This time in their field sights was Lewis Carol's story ''Alice in Wonderland'', if you have ever pondered about the candidate for directing such a movie I think the answer would be obvious - Tim Burton! Apparently nobody else could re-create the same atmosphere on screen that was created by Lewis Carol in his legendary book. Evidently, his old friend and vivid actor Johnny Depp always imbued his films with bright colours and inimitable style. Finally, after many thrilling months, we got opportunity to see their version of ''Alice in Wonderland''.At first view everything seems to be great. There are terrific visual effects, an exceptionally detailed world and plenty of unique characters that we all loved while reading the Lewis Carol book. We can see the amusing twins Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the kind White Rabbit, bombed grub Caterpillar, the evildoers Red Queen and Knave of Hearts, bloodthirsty Jabberwock, the mysterious Cheshire Cat and a remarkably well performed Mad Tea-Party with Doormouse, March Hare and Mad Hatter.But Tim Burton's picture has a strong lack of insanity and lack of a firmly funkadelic environment intrinsic to the overblown Lewis Carol's world. His Gothic, grotesque and black humour disappeared also. This was the main disadvantage of the film, many thought it resembled ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' rather then the ''Edward Scissorhands'' calibre, though it was expected due to obvious reasons. The primary reason being the unwanted influence of Disney which always restricts a wide spectrum of Tim Burton's ideas. Its no wonder that we got what we got. Tim Burton can't be blamed for an incomplete job, taking into account his dependence on Disney we can assume he gave it all he could.The acting was decent but not awesome. It's hard to acknowledge but Johny Depp is getting older and his acting skill rapidly running low. His acting wasn't as innovative as it used to be. Instead of a true Mad Hatter he just showed Jack Sparrow in a red wig and made-up face. Mia Wasikowska also wasn't the best choice for the Alice role. Her acting style just doesn't fit with the real Alice character and besides, she hasn't got enough acting experience to play the part effectively. The only one really stunning bit of acting was demonstrated by Helena Bonham Carter who played Red Queen. As for the rest, acting didn't impress me at all.Unfortunately, I should admit that this work isn't as great as was expected. We had already got used to the fact that Tim Burton was a reliable director who never failed his fans, but this time he just made a normal picture for a single viewing. This would be a good result for any typical and ordinary director but a serious misfortune for a high level master like Tim Burton. He definitely should stop tangling with such companies as Disney otherwise he seriously risks to become a simple commercial director without his own vein.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hard to have any emotional attachment to the characters,"I saw this movie in 3D not too long ago, now i must admit i was warned before hand that it was not an ''edgy'' Tim Burton movie as we are familiar with, but in their opinion just a very good Disney film.Even though i went to see it with that kept in mind, i still found it very hard to attach to this film emotionally, making it VERY hard for me to really ''get into'' it. sometimes i would even gaze off and look at how weird people looked with their 3D glasses...After the movie was over i started thinking about why i didn't like it, i couldn't really put my finger on it other then i just couldn't care what was happening with the characters throughout the movie.In my eyes there was next to no emotional scenes, well, perhaps the flashback of Johnny Depps character when the village gets attacked. that was pretty much it in my opinion. Especially the scene where she leaves wonderland, they could have done so much more with it. The whole movie seemed abit rushed to me.So in a nutt-shell, because of the lack of emotional peaks throughout the movie i found it VERY hard to bond with anything that was going on... shame really agree? disagree? thoughts? hate? cheers",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Word Summary: lolwut?,"This movie just left a bad taste in my mouth. It had a great deal of potential, what with gorgeous sets and gorgeous and talented stars, but it didn't do much with them. The acting was generally quite good, as befits the aforementioned gorgeous stars, but the lines the actors were speaking were generally average, occasionally just trite and lame.The writing was nothing surprising. Every single line was formulaic, from Alice's predictably whimsical musings about flying to the Hatter's tritely ""meaningful"" repetitions, to the reoccurring admonitions that one need only ""believe."" Seriously, Disney. You've worn these tropes pretty thin over the years.Howabout an utterly non-whimsical female lead, or a kooky mentor who encourages the hero to -dis-believe? Shake up the formula just a little, pretty please? Let me qualify my statements. This movie is by no means terrible, though it is terribly average. This movie's sin is not proactive horribleness, but rather passive mediocrity. All the usual characters and set pieces are right where we expect them, nothing to surprise us anywhere (not even the rather out of place dance at the end).The ""lolwut"" in the title is what kept popping in my head as I saw one well-tread cliché after another break dance across the screen. What indeed. With all this potential squandered on mediocrity, I could not fully enjoy even the otherwise fun story. Bad taste in mouth.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disenchanted,"Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska) is, unbeknownst to her, on her way to her engagement party. Turns out this is the famous Alice who 13 years earlier ventured in to Wonderland. Surely there is a creative reason to pull her back into the zany world. Nope, she merely felt the urge to chase a rabbit who himself was seeking to fulfill a prophecy. And so, Alice in roped back into the world of fantasy/absurdity.If you've seen anything at all on this movie, then the strengths are obvious. It's Disney, it's CGI loaded, it's in 3D. Everything visual is well appointed with lavish detail. It makes me wonder if director Tim Burton is better suited as a set designer since he is always given projects for his vision. I recall a time where his vision wasn't hampered by the concepts of others, at time when his films were so wholly original that nothing else compared, and sadly he's been stuck in a limbo of ""revisions"" for a decade.For a girl who can't remember anything, Alice is never surprised. She sees giant creatures, she shrinks, flies on a hat, all without a yelp. The first person to blame would be Burton, since Wasikowska lacks leading experience. Still I wonder what's going through her head when she decided to play Alice as oppressively jaded. Outside the last ten minutes, she's the antithesis of Dorothy. Having a protagonist who's so down trodden in a beautiful world is counterintuitive.Johnny Depp. You pay the man and he'll do his thing. I can't tell you that his character, The Mad Hatter, is an original. I'm sure it's a combination of other Depp figurines. With the Hatter he has carte blanche to do anything, anything at all, and somehow be considered in character. It doesn't matter that he's periodically possessed by a Scotsman—he's in character and he's Johnny Depp so it must be fantastic, right? More amusing are Helena Bonham Carter and Crispin Glover, the latter of whom you wouldn't recognize.The White Queen (Anne Hathaway) was in position to be the most complex element of the film. I suppose her role is to assume power in the event that her sister is dethroned. For a character who talks a big game of peace, she sure does mix together an abhorrent potion to return Alice to normal size. Despite repeatedly saying she represents good, I didn't see any evidence. Toes would have been crushed I'm sure, but the vibe from Anne's portrayal suggested that she wanted to be the calculating nemesis.I can't tell you how stupid this movie made me feel. For some reason it figured a major plot point would be found in determining the identity of Alice. If you are seated in the theatre watching a film called Alice in Wonderland you will not be surprised to find that the lead character of Alice is indeed the very same mentioned in the title. Why we spend most of the film getting to this conclusion feels like an attempt to recreate Hook.By the end you realize that Alice is the problem with Wonderland. In the 13 years she's been gone, her friends seem to be in good health despite the Red Queen reigning over the land. Why are they looking for her now? The Red Queen was in power this whole time and they seem to be in good shape, but when Alice gets there the queen challenges them. I suppose she's just as upset to have such a lifeless young girl in her land. I for one am disenchanted.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Will take you into a World you really don't care about...,"Alice in Wonderland will take you into a World you really don't care about and give you characters you really don't seem to care for. It will give you CG you will look at each other and question and an ending you knew was going to happen. Nothing wrong with the actors; they do their thing as in accordance to the script provided and the voices of the little CG puppets, comuppets, cuppets or whatever we want to call them are well cast too. I am really not sure why this was such a yawn fest; maybe it's my age, maybe I am just too hard to please and expect too much; maybe I took too many recreational drugs in my youth and it takes a lot to get me excited now, or maybe it was just pretty boring; who knows?",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Flawed...but harmless,"Well, well, well. To start things off, I've been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I first heard about it in 2007. I mean, seeing a Tim Burton adaptation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" sounded like a really cool idea, and having Johnny Depp, Alan Rickman and Christopher Lee in the cast? How can you go wrong? Well, after seeing it for the first time, it was quite a let down. First of all, this is a Disney movie, and it's kind of weird knowing that this is a remake of a movie that was made by the same company. Well, it's actually not a remake. This is actually a sequel that just so happens to have the same title. However, unlike Disney's line of direct-to-DVD sequels, for this one, they attempted to do something very different. A couple positives I can point out is that we get to know more about the characters such as Alice's last name as well as her sister's name, plus I did catch a lot of references to the original classic. The beginning was interesting, but once Alice came into Wonderland, things went downhill. It's like everything was just shoved into my face. I didn't care much for the story; it was a little untraditional. The characters were OK. The Mad Hatter was good, so was the caterpillar, the Red Queen was consistent, the Cheshire Cat was amusing, but the rest of the characters were just all over the place. It's like, What happened? What's going on? What's this? What's that? What's everything? The whole movie was so confusing. It seemed like the creators were putting special effects before story. The 1951 classic has a lot of charm and warmth, and it makes you look forward to watching it again, but this new one doesn't have the same warmth. Overall, this was not a terrible movie, nor was it a cinematic masterpiece; it's a good movie that has a lot of flaws. If you're wanting to see a good movie that'll live in your heart, then don't watch this movie; it's not worth your time, unless you're a huge fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. If you are a fan of them, then I'm sure you'll rank this as an A+ film, 10 out of 10, 5 stars out of 5, whatever. I'd really hate to see Disney do this to other classics they've done. (Oh, wait, I think they already did.) So, yeah, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film to Tim Burton fans and Johnny Depp fans, but not to fans of the original Disney classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Visual Delight, But I expected way more.","Going to theaters to watch Alice in Wonderland, I had very high expectations because of the people in it. The wonderful Tim Burton and Jhonny Depp partnering up again and that made me excited. (Their History together include classics such as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow and etc.) I was also very excited for the two well respected Oscar-nominated Actresses (Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway) But most importantly is that I love Alice in Wonderland the book and the 1951 classic animated Disney feauture.Anyways the movie review itself: I thought Alice in Wonderland looked beautiful and even breathtaking at times. You got to admit that the movie looked beautiful visually. But emotionally it didn't really connect and lost a lot of its heart to the original.I was very disappointed with Tim Burton, I thought that he knew what the movie should of been like. This is not Tim Burton's best at all. Hopefully in 10-15 years time, another remake of this movie will be created and hopefully it would be better.Overall: Alice in Wonderland deserves a much better remake, but the movie itself was visually breathtaking and it was a really fun movie. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice in Blunderland,"I was able to catch a prescreening of Alice in Wonderland tonight on March 2nd. Despite some pretty nifty visuals, and jaw dropping set pieces, I found the movie to be incredibly dull, flat, and utterly full of itself. The film is merely a vehicle for Johnny Depp to showcase his talents, and he portrays the Mad Hatter as an actor who can't quite find the right shoes to fill in the role. He rotates from a Scottish brogue, to a feminine lisp, and staggers once in awhile as the unmistakable character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Where the visuals triumph, the story lacks. The proposed 'sequel' to Alice in Wonderland is literally a rehash of most of the finer points of the original, except a lot more Johnny Depp- a character who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and root for, but who i found a bit annoying and tiresome after awhile. The plot is fairly simple. Alice (the stone faced, newcomer Mia Wasisoska whose acting is limited to mildly concerned, mildly puzzled, and mildly agitated) flees from an arranged marriage proposal from a wealthy lord. She follows a curious white rabbit and tumbles down a hole into Underland, referred to as Wonderland by Alice. She then meets a variety of odd characters, most of them familiar from the original Alice. The plot is fairly simplistic, and a tad boneheaded. The Red Queen (Bonham Carter, slightly overdoing it, but arguably the best actor of the bunch) rules the land, but is pitted against the tiresome goodness and light of her sister, The White Queen (Hathaway doing an air-headed imitation of, you guessed it, Captain Jack Sparrow). Alice is destined by some ancient scroll to defeat the Jabberwocky and end The Red Queen's reign of terror. Alice boils down to mere eye candy-something that is visually pleasing, but is only a piece of fluff. If your a fan of Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this movie is right up your ally. I prefer Burton at his best with movies that attempt to involve the audience like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Big Fish. However, this bloated mess is sure to rank in hundreds of millions of dollars, but it tugs at our wallets rather than our hearts. It's a scary thought, but I hope that Burton's best work isn't behind him. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A beautiful, brilliant film.","I went into this film without high expectations. I saw so many ways it could go wrong, and many of Burton's more recent films have left me feeling somewhat indifferent. However, all my fears were for naught. I adored the film, without reservation. Indeed, this is not only one of Burton's best films, it is probably the best screen adaptation of Lewis Carroll ever (with the possible exception of Jan Svankmajer's Neco z Alenky from 1988). It isn't often that a film ends and I immediately want to see it again, but that's how Burton's Alice in Wonderland affected me. The cast is flawless, top to bottom. The film's vision comes the closest anyone has come to capturing the frenetic, nonsensical impossibility of Wonderland (and I loved the whole ""Underland"" thing). I'm hearing all sorts of bizarre negative criticisms, though none with merit. This is a bold and triumphant film, one that finally addresses, without holding back, the darkness and complexity and maturity of Carroll's writing. I will add that I saw it in 2-D, and was pleased that Burton avoided letting the 3-D thing ruin the movie, as is so often the case with that sadly popular gimmick. The film is a giddy, hallucinatory, unrelenting dance of shadow and light, hilarious and heartbreaking, brash and underscored, possessed of all the marvelously contradictory oppositions that characterize the source material. For the first time, I think, it felt as though Alice were truly an integral part of the landscape, and not just some baffled Victorian tourist passing through. And the climactic battle with the Jabberwocky...just wow. I cannot recommend this film strongly enough. (--Caitlín R. Kiernan)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Meeza in Punderland writes about the awful ""Alice in Wonderland""","Director Tim Burton's long-awaited film adaptation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" is finally here! And ouch! What a disappointment! Unfortunately, Alice is malice in boringland. We all know the trippy story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" so I will devoid this review the Wonderland narrative (Google: ""Lewis Carroll book"" in case you want to be reminded of it). The visually stunning and conceptually enthralling movie somehow had too much pot I mean plot to give me a cinematic high. Burton inserted way too many pseudo-eccentric characters in the flick for one to really get absorbed in their wonderland. I wonder why? Let's just say the movie's Cheshire Cat, Dormouse, March Hare, Blue Caterpillar, Bayard, White Rabbit (didn't I go there a couple of years ago for my bachelor party), and Tweedledee & Tweedledum (contrary to popular belief, not played by George Bush & Dick Cheney) did not do it for me. But the character I wanted to white out the most from the screen was the lackluster White Queen; probably had something to do with Anne Hathaway's asinine performance as the pale one. No, I am not going mad- I have not forgotten The Mad Hatter! My jury is still out on The Mad Hatter but let's just say I was expecting more of a charismatic Hatter character from the eccentric thespian maestro Johnny Depp. Mr. Hatter was captivating at first but after a while Depp's ""more of the same"" performance became more of a persistent hat trick that did not achieve its gravitating goal. I must say that the villainous bigheaded Red Queen was my favorite character in the movie due to her grandiose livid reactions expressed in that petite frame, priceless! Helena Bonham Carter's performance as the Red Queen might just get her a red carpet trip as a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominee at next year's Oscars. OK, maybe not, but Bighead Red did red-rock. Oh, and there is that Alice chic. Mia Wasikowska's starring performance as Alice was as lifeless as acting could be. Her sterile & immobile characterization of Alice made one wish that Alice would shoot down a few shots of Tequila & some Red Bulls in Boogie Wonderland in order to enliven her up! I wonder what hypnotic drugs Linda Woolverton was taking (or for that matter not taking) when she scribed up the unnecessarily-complex adapted screenplay based on a children's tale that is ""Alice in Wonderland"". The Art Direction, Cinematography, and Visual Effects of the movie were its strong suits, and do merit high praise. But that is not enough to give ""Alice in Wonderland"" a storybook-ending favorable review. ** Needs Improvement",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A truly remarkable failure.,"It is amazing that they managed to make a remake that is worse than the original IN EVERY ASPECT.This film looks like a B movie, the animation, styling and scenery are flawlessly default and most of the movie visuals looks like the designers downloaded a pack of 3D stock models and colored them a bit. If you watch a showreel of almost ANY decent animation studio you will see much better and creative stuff than this.The direction is ridiculously non-interesting, some short shots are just plain stupid and I have no idea HOW is THIS possible in this budget. There is no rhythm, there are just a bunch of scenes with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Sound editing is retarded with voices overlapping each other, atmospheric sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes non-existent. At the scene where the Mad Hatter gives a speech and makes a riot in Queen's castle the cheering crowd sound behind his speech is AWFUL! You can download better crowd samples FOR FREE.Music sounds like a bunch of sampled ""ooouuuooo"" shitty, spooky loops of crappy classical music in a default Burton way. Acting is WHATEVER and seems like everything was written and shot in 5 days. The voice dubbing of 3D models is worse than the earliest works of Dreamworks.There is no drama, there is no crescendo, there is no playfulness that makes Alice in WONDERLAND such a powerful story. There is not a shred of IMAGINATION here. I mean, even the opening credits look like they were done in 1 hour. To top it all, the song in the ending credits CANNOT be more cheap and that pathetic attempt of the final ""DANCE"" - some miserable version of a popping' breakdance is disgusting and is on the level of The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.Even on a ""woman becoming a powerful individual"" symbolism level the movie as bland as POSSIBLE.Holy ****, this movie is a humongous piece of an even more gigantic, moronic, generic feces that Hollywood is happily sitting in.

Visually enchanting. Tim Burton once again skews one's world view with this wonderful literary classic.,"I for one am a big Tim Burton fan, he's one of the best directors around in film. I love his offbeat use of odd faced characters, and dark backdrops similar to old classic German cinema techniques. Burton always seems to be the master of the sky the leader of the macabre as his oddball characters bring out the best of not only themselves but Burton as well. And this is proved in his films ranging from ""Batman"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Sweeny Todd"", and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". So I knew going in I would enjoy his take on ""Alice in Wonderland"" as he once again teamed up with Johhny Depp so I know the chemistry was present for some great work.I probably enjoyed the film even more having saw it in IMAX as the crystal clear images and teardrop reflections of images flying right off of the screen was exhilarating to witness. I for one knew like most the plot and story of this literature classic even though I had never read Lewis Carroll's take. Even more fun was the kooky and colorful zany take that Burton would have. The story is typical taking place in London a young girl named Alice(Mia Wasikowska)thinks back to an adventure she had and enjoyed thirteen years earlier, and at the present she seems weighed and tightened down by family and a politically correct majority.So with any typical fairy tale when a little bunny rabbit appears Alice is lead to a fall thru hole that will take her to a magical joyful land of new adventure and new characters! Alice's meetings aside from the rabbit include the March Hare, the smiling Cheshire Cat, and the awkward yet lovable chubby fellows Tweedledee/Tweedledum(Matt Lucas). To top the journey adventure off Alice meets the strange yet determined Mad Hatter(Johnny Depp)and this character reminds one of a Carrot Top in Kabuki makeup. It's the goal of all to slay an ancient dragon called Jabberwock which will fulfill a prophecy and free Wonderland from the Red Queen(Helena Bonham Carter). The power and a special item(a sword that slays the dragon)will be returned to the White Queen(Anne Hathaway, as this character is a spitting image of Snow White and Ginda the good witch). This tale clearly has similar themes to another classic like ""The Wizard of Oz"" as I just mentioned a comparison a few lines ago.Overall this film is enjoyable and a visual treat to watch especially in IMAX it's your typical classic feel good literature tale of meeting new friends, good against evil, as along the way courage, thought, and love is learned. It's really a must see too for any Tim Burton fan as here he shot actors against green screens filling in the world with computer generated imagery. As clearly this is one film where the images and characters outweigh and outclass the plot and stories meaning.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually Wonderful/Dumb Story,"Once again, someone takes a timeless story, with wonderful characters and a really cool plot and sells it out for a predictable, silly, action film, where the Mad Hatter becomes a love interest. Come on! The film begins with an amazing world created with great care. The images are almost startling in their lushness and complexity. So what happens. You take the Alice in Wonderland canon and take all the starch right out of it. Johnny Depp is great to look at, with his colors and his aberrant behavior. At some point, it all falls apart. A war between the white and red witches takes center stage. It is made obvious that Alice must fulfill her destiny by killing the Jabberwock. She begins to ally herself with benevolent forces. The queen who is visually interesting but really boring begins the ""off with her head"" stuff. Anyway, by the time the thing was over, I just didn't care. I'm a firm believe in story and this one doesn't have an original bone in its body. How sad. And I really enjoy most of Tim Burton's output.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Impressive CGI. Bit crazy, and lacked a climax.","Of course with this being a Burton film I knew it would contain some pretty crazy moments and wouldn't be considered a sane film, and it certainly wasn't.I saw the film simultaneously with the London premier, we had a live stream off the green carpet prior to the film. It was very impressive.The film kicked off, unfortunately we sat on the left row of seats which deemed some of the 3D, especially that on the opposite side of the screen, useless. It looked impressive but we didn't have a good viewing angle.The film itself, without wanting to give too much away, was a bit crazy, sometimes the editing threw me off and I couldn't quite understand what was being said by these eccentric character. There were comic moments but not enough, it lacked the humour that it desperately needed.The film climaxes very suddenly and not in an impressive manner, I expected to be blown away, but there didn't seem to be much suspense in the build up to the disappointing climax either.Some of the voices were brilliant and I'm a bit Depp, Carter, Fry fan; they didn't disappoint.Overall the best part of the night was the stream from the green carpet; seeing Prince Charles being bowed to and giggled over.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The script is perfect, the acting excellent and the cinematic experience is second to none, so why does it not please people? Again, from a personal view, this movie is perfect. The CGI is amazing, and in some of the characters, you can actually see the person who is acting the voice. The storyline is as good as you could wish for, the music fits perfectly with the story. 100 percent excellence. This movie was made in 2010, and it is a fresh today as it was when it was released.

Tim Burton does it again!,"Tim Burton really knows how to deliver a very unique story with a dark tone which make it all the more interesting and realistic. I loved the tone of them film as it added drama and suspense to the film. The CGI effects were really good and the whole film was visually appealing. Tim Burton really captured the concept of Wonderland and allowed us to be transported into that world to escape from reality. The characters were really good: Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter (he really engaged into being a fickle character and you really liked his character) Helen as the Red Queen (Bold, sharp, evil, a very good portrayal of the Red Queen) Anne Hathaway as the White Queen (initially hard to relate to, as the film progresses her character becomes more appealing) and Alice (not the strongest character but still a character worth taking notice of) and all the rest of the characters were enjoyable to watch. However i wish they focused a bit more on the world of Wonderland. It is a place of strangeness, fantasy and imagination yet the film focused little on that aspect and instead on how Alice is finding it hard to remember when she was least there. Of course its great Tim Burton paid attention to character and plot but maybe with the added value of exploring the surroundings and taking in the imagination and fantasy of it all would have made the experience much better. But all in all a very enjoyable watch with action, substantial characters and great effects! (plus its a clean movie which is great)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Expect the worst... and it will still disappoint you.,"When I first heard that Tim Burton was making Alice in Wonderland, and when, later yet, I saw the stills and first promotional shots, I could not wait to see it. I decided to forget all about how disappointing Burton's latest movies were, and thought to myself, we'll probably all fall in love with him again.So when the first reviews turned out to be less than favourable, I was surprised. When some of then were outright terrible, I started suspecting that maybe my expectations had been too high. But nothing, NOTHING prepared me for yesterday's bitter disappointment.First, the positive. Nice costumes, and I mean REALLY, seriously nice costumes. Dresses to die for, and hats to wear in a dream. And the Cheshire cat who is so fluffy that you are seriously tempted to reach out and ruffle his tummy. And the Red Queen, who is the only believable character with acting worth the mention. And... oh wait, the list ends here.If Burton had spent as much time writing the story, developing the characters and working on the dialogue, as he had on making sure that the dresses were spectacular, this movie might have been quite alright. But instead, he opted to provide a story so predictable and unimaginative, you have to wonder why it was put to screen at all. And he seemed to have thought that, if the story (or lack of it, to be honest) was not dreadfully bad enough, this could be fixed by carefully adding a cliché to almost every line in the dialogue, and by making sure that there was not a single funny (like laugh-out-loud funny, not a half-smile-OK funny) moment in the whole movie.Worst of all, he mercilessly murdered the essence and soul of the characters. Alice is lifeless, boring and mechanical. The Hatter has a few brilliant moments and he was graciously allowed a few acceptable lines by Burton, but mostly it is all been-there-done-that another over-the-top-facial-paint-role for Depp. The movie leaves one thankful for the Red Queen – her character would not impress you in any better movie, where she would simply be a decently amusing villain, but here it's only her presence that can lighten up the screen somewhat. Hathaway's beauty is worth admiring, but the White Queen would be better left in a poster, as the moment she starts speaking or moving, it is so unnatural, word ""cringy"" does not do it justice. The others are not even worth the mention, with the exception of the Caterpillar, where Rickman's charisma cannot be so subdued that it would not shine through.At many points in this movie I tried to tell myself – this is a movie for children, what do you expect. Well, much more. There are many wonderful children's movies that are delightful to watch for audiences of all ages. This leaves you a feeling you just spent 2 hours watching the Mardi Gras carnival at 4 am, where beautiful clad dancers barely even move anymore, their steps mechanical and their eyes glazed over, and the audience too drunk to care.I went with a friend who said she loved it, as it looked nice. If this is all you are looking for, and if you watch it while playing your favourite album on your MP3 player so as to limit your experience to moving images, you might just find it enjoyable enough.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deserves its $116M opening weekend!,"My primary reason for seeing this movie was because it was another Bonham Carter-Depp-Burton collaboration. I was timid to pay the 3D price after remembering Burton's attempt at ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (I wasn't a big fan of the movie, like many other critics), but this was well worth the price tag.I agree with many of the other reviews available online. The visual experience is breathtaking and when this movie is released, it will be well worth the Blu-ray price. However, I disagree with reviews stating the movie had no ""plot"" or ""substance"" or was ""too confusing."" (For those of you who haven't seen it, be sure to pay attention to the beginning of the movie--everything that happens ties in with Alice's Wonderland experience.) Perhaps this is where people have become disappointed: you can't watch this movie thinking it's just like the book or a remake/live-version of the Disney animated film that was produced nearly 60 years ago. You have to approach the movie for what it is--Burton taking familiar characters, a familiar setting and plot, then expanding on it with his own take (once again with the help of best friend Johnny Depp and long-time significant other Helena Bonham Carter); using superb animation technology and phenomenal costume design--I expect to see various ""Alice""s this Halloween.I give this a 9/10... because, no film is perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
PG? Have you checked the children?,"Tim Burton applies his usual relish to this story. The execution is excellent in all departments, except it's not a movie for children.It's not a movie for a lot of adults either. Burton brings Alice's adventure(in fact the story is the residue of Lewis Carrol's lsd trips) to life in what closely resembles Gothic horror. Burton's wonderland characters are demented, mutant humans and circus freaks, and frightening animals that talk. If I were a child watching this I would feel affronted, horrified and disempowered. Having said that, I think it's hilarious that Disney asked Burton to direct this demented children's tale. I doubt that Mr & Mrs Average will trust Disney with their children again. The violence is powerful. Wonderland's sinister atmosphere is thorough. The questionably redeeming allegories and truisms of the original story are lost in this fiercely frightening version. The Red Queen's three face slaps on her consort are tremendously violent. The realisation of the Jabberwocky is goth monsterism at its nastiest. The original story Lewis Carrol weaved with words, engaged children's imagination. Burton's film realisation leaves no where for young minds to retreat to. Don't let them see this. Share it with your least favourite in-law, and laugh uproariously throughout it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An amazing experience,"As an avid fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp films, I was of course waiting months for this movie to hit the the theaters; I even went to the midnight showing. Since there was so much hype about this movie, I had high expectations, and Alice in Wonderland met my expectations and more. I was completely absorbed by the movie the entire time; the plot was never boring or confusing and built up to an extremely satisfying ending. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter did an exceptional job, of course. Not only was the acting convincing and the plot exciting, the effects were unbelievable. It wasn't a sensory overload and never was too much to take in at once; it was perfectly balanced and I could almost taste, smell, and feel the setting. Overall, another excellent film by Tim Burton. I highly recommend seeing this movie, and in 3D if you can. I was highly impressed.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Return to the world of Wonder, and wonder you'll find...","Ever since the teaser was released, I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Tim Burton's new movie, Alice in Wonderland. I was always excited to see new footage, photos, behind the scenes previews and the such presented to the public. And from that, I knew what to expect from what I've been waiting for for months.Lewis Carroll wrote two amazingly brilliant books in the late 19th century which have captivated many generations, and is considered a classic throughout our cultures.As for the movie, it was visually stunning. Sometimes it didn't seem as if the environment was CGI. It was dreamlike, to say the most. The detail they put into everything was beautifully rendered. I reckon they did a brilliant job.It was lovely to see these whimsical characters on the big screen once again. The performances and voice acting was well done. Although Mia Wasikowska's portrayal of Alice may have seemed bland and wooden, I reckon she did a fine performance. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter was a treat, and a nice and interesting depiction for this hysterical, yet dark character. Helena Bonham Carter, in my opinion, stole the show with her hilariously wicked performance as the Red Queen. She was joyous to watch. And not to forget Anne Hathaway, who played the ethereal White Queen, who was surprisingly alright to say the least. The Knave, played by Crispin Glover, did a great job too. And the wondrously suave Cheshire Cat, played by the amazing Stephen Fry, really was one of the best things about the movie. And not to forget the March Hare, Absolom the Caterpillar, Tweedles, the White Rabbit and many other wondrous characters, who's voice actors did a terrific job.The music was very Danny Elfman, and did create a wondrous atmosphere throughout the movie.Likes aside, here are what I found to be not so wonderful: The story was weak, of course. It was rushed and lacked in parts. I wish they gave it more, like an extra half hour or so. Wasn't amazing, nor horrible, but wasn't great. It was okay, at least I was enthralled into the movie. Though, it was predictable and cliché, but I wouldn't let that be a bother. I wished too that they kept the wordplay from the books into the movie, to capture the essence of what made the books remarkable and extraordinary.Overall, I enjoyed this movie for what it was: an entertaining ride. If there had been more time and a bit of a tidy up, in my opinion, it would've been breathtaking. Though, this is a movie you either love or hate. It is not one of Burton's greatest to date, but still, it is an enjoyable experience.I give it an 8/10 (though, it would actually be a 7.5).****/5 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Crazy Burton visual style,"Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is an independent-minded 19 year old girl. She is being pushed to engage the horrible lord Hamish. Her family has fallen on hard times after the death of her father. With Hamish on bended knee in front of everybody, she runs away following the White Rabbit. She falls down a hole into a world called Underland which resembles her one dream which she's had ever since she was a little girl. She meets the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and many other fanciful characters.This is Tim Burton's visual style through and through. He gives an unique look to the already wonderful Wonderland. The characters are all too familiar. Mia Wasikowska is a perfectly lovely actress. I do wish her character has a bit more fun. That could be said of the movie itself. Both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are suitably weird. However Anne Hathaway is way too weird and it doesn't fit her. Matt Lucas is fun as Tweedledee and Tweedledum. I am not in love with the story especially the third act. It tries to take it to a more serious real place. I like this more for the crazy visual style than anything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The 21st century's Wizard of Oz,"For decades Tim Burton has had a unique vision of the world that's he's been trying to communicate in his movies. I knew 20 minutes into this one that I was watching his masterpiece; it's the culmination of everything he's been trying to say. He finally got everything right. This movie is flawless, delicate, and a perfect communion of his world view.I knew halfway through the movie that it was the best I've seen in a decade, and by the end I knew it to be among the best cinematic experiences I've had in 40-odd years.Watching the movie also gave me a twinge of sadness, because the more I loved the movie, the more I understood -- from experience, mind you -- that it was going to leave a lot of viewers bewildered and unhappy. Tim Burton is generations ahead of his time, and the closer he comes to showing us his true vision, the more people he alienates, leaving an ever-smaller core of aficionados who can be moved and astonished by the brilliance of that vision.Johnny Depp obviously gets the vision. People who work time and again with Burton do so because they get *him*. And Depp gives a bravura, astonishingly subtle performance of an incredibly difficult character. It may have been his finest work to date. But the difficulty of the character will also confuse many people, and you're going to hear about it in the reviews.The movie, like many of Burton's movies, pokes fun at precisely the kind of person who doesn't get this movie. People who've lost touch with the wonderment of their childhoods, people who are mostly concerned with what is fashionable and proper, dull people with little imagination and even less tolerance for it in others -- these people are caricatured in Alice, both in the ""real world"" at the party and again in the Red Queen's court.Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful metaphor for the relationship between Burton and his audience. The theme of the movie is that a few people in the world -- ""only the best people"" -- still have boundless imagination and delight for the truly novel, while the rest of polite society thinks of them as being quirky, off-kilter, or simply embarrassing.It will take years for this mess to get sorted out, of course. People will whine and moan and complain about it. In time they'll accept it. A generation from now this movie will be viewed as one of the best fantasies of our times: a 21st-century Wizard of Oz (to which Alice pays a brief homage at the end of the film.)A word of advice: go re-read Lewis Carroll's two Alice stories before watching this movie. No Alice has ever been truer to the spirit of Carroll's strange, haunting and timeless vision.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim's Ego,"And yet again Tim Burton's ego gets in the way as it did with Willy Wonka seriously thinking that he can improve an age old classic by replacing what he refers to as a mere series of events a little girl stumbles through, with a trite paint by numbers good versus evil story a la: Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Chronicles of Narnia, Golden Compass. He leaves out the magic of the books, the cutting wit, the Topsy turvy absurdity which make the stories so special and a little girl called Alice who's precocious cleverness is way beyond her years. It is not about stifling a director's artistic vision (which every artist has a right to) or reworking of the story but the mere greed and egotistical ambitiousness with which he went after this project, clearly to fatten his pockets. Poor Lewis Carrol is rolling in his grave.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Alice in Wonderland,"I nearly laughed out loud at the family of three seated beside me, as the dad loudly remarked that they are probably the only persons in the hall who have read Lewis Carroll's books Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the follow up Through the Looking Glass. It's one thing to try and brag to all around that they are well read and learned, and it's another actually to know that it's probably not Tim Burton's style to adapt a classic to the T, given various adaptations from print to screen thus far. The characters are clearly from both books with events vaguely resembling what was read before, but this film is a totally different ballgame altogether.In some ways, the narrative screenplay that Linda Woolverton adapted seemed to be more in line with Steven Spielberg 1991's effort Hook, which had Robin Williams star as Peter Pan in the retelling of the J.M. Barrie character, only that Pan had grown up, and had forgotten his roots and experiences in Never Never Land. While the characters in that world clearly remembered him (although older, pudgier and without the ability to fly), much of the story explored how Pan had to rediscover his touch and memories of the place he once called home.Which to Alice, played by the relative fresh and ethereal looking Mia Wasikowska, the audience joins her in that similar route to discovery, and we're left wondering really, like the rest of the characters, whether we're all mistaken if this Alice was the same as the one we grew up with, the wide eyed child who flitted from one random event to another in Underland, encountering fantastical characters such as talking animals, to jealous kings and queens. It's not quite how we remembered it to be, and Tim Burton also showed glimpses of how it would look like if he had played this movie straight, but that would be losing a lot of fun that had found its way to his vision, so much so that he provides such a trippy ride, you'd wonder who was more loony, Burton, or Carroll himself.In fact, every character here seemed a little mad or come with that tinge of insanity, even the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) herself seemed a little bit over the top in her all white goodness. And the host of characters we come to love, such as the constantly grinning Cheshire cat, the twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the rabbit with the watch, and plenty of card soldiers now given a bit more flesh, all make a cinematic comeback thanks to the wonderful world of computer graphics, and 3D technology to make them all pop out of the screen vividly. While there were plenty of specially crafted 3D moments to enhance the visual storytelling (the final battle scene involving Alice being the most outstanding I've seen thus far), kudos also went to the wealth of British talent roped in for roles both in the flesh, CG enhanced or providing voices to their graphical representation, with the likes of Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Christopher Lee and even Michael Gough, who had collaborated with Tim Burton before.And this film, like most of Burton's others, comes the return of long time collaborators Danny Elfman in music, Helena Bonham Carter having a field day as the ridiculously evil Red Queen with her big head being the butt of most jokes, and Johnny Depp, who wows in yet another unorthodox role as The Mad Hatter, given more screen time and more depth compared to the novels. We know how outlandish Depp can become each time he's in a Tim Burton film, and Alice in Wonderland is no different, but surprise surprise, Mia Wasikowska's performance as the titular character got curiouser and curiouser as the film went along, which is a good thing since she delivered enough not to be overawed by her co-stars, and stood her ground in making the character her own.She's quite the clotheshorse too, given the opportunity to showcase some Underland fashion sense no thanks to her changing body size. She becomes quite the reluctant blonde messiah to Underland whose presence rings forth the prophecy in the change of ruler-ship. In her own world, we see how she's quite the stubborn girl who is a far cry from societal demands of fulfilling one's role as a dutiful young wife to a rich lord (thanks to her good looks), taking off during a surprise proposal ceremony in order to follow the white rabbit. Mia Wasikowska fit the bill as this headstrong girl with that tinge of uncertainty and curiosity, and makes it a delight to follow her in one heck of an adventure filled with comedy, danger, and spectacular computer generated graphics.Purist shouldn't go up in arms that the film didn't stick to their beloved tale, as it had enough Easter eggs and references contained within that will please the fans when they spot them. This one in my opinion had more bite, and fit quite well as a compendium of sorts to the established classics, showing that Burton has the insane gall to add his own Midas touch to entertain the masses, with a quality effort complete with amazingly designed visuals that just might make everyone go pick up the books and give them a read again. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
""" If you look closely at a mirror you will realize it has more than one reflection ""","Charles Dodgson wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll and his imaginative books have been christened by the world of literature as Classics. His most famous and enduring work written in 1865 is called "" Alice in Wonderland "" which by the way is the title of this movie. Although read mostly by young literary students, this particular film has a dark, shadowy, foreboding environ meant for adult audiences. Carroll's original story is of a twelve-year-old girl named Alice who follows a white rabbit down into a strange nonsensical world full of odd assortment of creatures. This latest version is decidedly updated from it's original synopsis. The original Walt Disney film had Kathryn Beaumont as Alice with Sterling Holloway as the Cheshire Cat. Now we have Tim Burton directing this more somber offering, with Mia Wasikowska playing Alice. Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter with Stephen Fry as the disappearing Cat and Alan Rickman is recognized as the voice of the Caterpillar. The menacing Jabberwacky is played by accomplished character actor Christopher Lee. Attemping to forget the original and focusing on this 2010 version, one finds it interesting, assertive and whimsical. The fast background scenery is fantastically creative and more importantly action driven. The Idea of a mature, 18 year old warrior Alice is difficult to comprehend as she is not only to be married, but forced to accept a social standing and offered a traveling business venture as well. It's far from Carroll's original concept. Nevertheless, it's a movie for any who desires to join Alice in the modern world and far from the Looking Glass where she began. ****",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much better than the reviewers gives credit for,"In spite of having to read many negative reviews, I was still curious to see this movie. I not a huge Burton fan neither, although I've enjoyed some of his previous work. But it was something about «Alice in Wonderland» which seemed appealing; it's visual look and it's quirky characters. Still I had in mind the several hostile reviews, which accused this movie to be a flat, soulless and muddled attempt of a classic, which I also feared it would. But after finally seeing the movie, I can claim my disagreement with the reviewers. In fact, I'm not sure if we even saw the same movie. What exactly was so terrible about it?Overall, I found «Alice in Wonderland» to be very entertaining. I feared that the movie would loose some of it's magic as the main character entered to Wonderland, but fortunately it never did. I enjoyed the movie from the very start to it's very end. It's a cute fantasy/adventure movie, equal to the «Harry Potter» and the «Narnia» flicks (although I personally felt «Prince Caspain» had some slight weaknesses). But beware; there are some frightening creatures who may scare the youngest in the audience, so the PG rating is suitable.One of the films biggest advantages is it visuals. With it lush and dark landscapes, cute animals and colorful costumes, the flick is beautifully to look at and I can't wait to enjoy the sharpness of the picture on Blu Ray. The score of Danny Elfman is effective and gives the movie a dreamy, atmospheric tone. The characters are mostly passable. They don't steal the show entirely, but neither do they appear as distractive or annoying.Although I've always liked the original novel of Lewis Carroll, I must say that I found this new twist of the story fresh and creative, depicting the «wrong» Alice's adventures in Wonderland as a young adult. Linda Woolverton, who's behind the excellent screenplays for «Beauty and the Beast», «The Lion King» and «Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journplay», has written a solid and decent script to «Wonderland». Many has claimed this screenplay to be muddled and confusing, but I didn't felt it that way at all. Once again, did we even saw the same movie?Mia Wasikowska is quite decent as Alice. Although she doesn't have a distinctive emanation/charisma who characterizes other young actresses at her age, she's still delivers a nice and acceptable performance. Personally I felt her screen presence expanded during the movie. Johnny Depp is indeed a good actor. To claim anything else, would be a like claiming that the climate isn't humid in the rain forest. Although I've never been crazy over Depp's work, he's goofy and great as The Mad Hatter, which is indeed the best character in the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is also believable and funny as the Red Queen (just prepare yourself to hear «Off with his head» at least a hundred times during the movie, ha ha). While Anne Hathaway, on the other hand, is warm and passable as the White Queen (although I must confess it was a little distracting to see her with a blonde wig and with a British accent).In fact, I can't see anything wrong with this new Burton version of «Wonderland». I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone as possible. It didn't deserved the negative criticism at all, in my opinion. With quality films like this, perhaps I could finally forgive Disney for it's recent mistakes? (*Cough, leaving hand drawn animation behind and promoting teen stars as crazy, cough*)So follow every white rabbit you see and follow him to the hole... Wonderland is waiting...",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Okay entertainment; doesn't do much wrong, but doesn't do a lot right either.","Okay, maybe I should check myself on that last statement. Visually, the film is quite impressive. The many different elements of Wonderland are wonderfully constructed, both with the CGI and the production design. Burton's always had a knack for creating visually interesting and imaginative movies, and you get that again here.The cast mostly acquits themselves. We've come to expect Johnny Depp to play weird/out there roles, so his performance as the Mad Hatter is enjoyably nutty. And Helena Bonham Carter (another Burton regular) is quite good shifting from being villainous to darkly comical as the Red Queen.What never really takes flight, however, is the story. While I was watching the film, I couldn't help but feel that Disney was telling Tim Burton what to do the whole time. When he's at his best (""Ed Wood,"" ""Big Fish,"" ""Sweeney Todd""), he can mix a bizarre and visually unique world with a close to home emotional journey with well-developed characters. Here, he has the world, but the story seems to be checking the plot points instead of taking on a journey of its own. Too often, Alice circles around her belief that ""it's just a dream"" while we, the audience, know otherwise. And speaking of Alice, while actress Mia Wasikowska sometimes shows the plucky courage necessary for the role, there are also moments where she is too stiff in her body language or underplays the scene that surrounds her.Overall, I can only marginally recommend ""Alice in Wonderland."" The sets and CGI are top-notch, and some of the actors do well with their roles. But the story needs more life breathed into it and it needs to feel more organic rather than ""been here, done that.""",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slow start,"When I first tried watching this film, I got really bored because the start was quite slow. The protagonist felt a bit frumpy and unsympathetic. It starts to pick up when she actually enters Wonderland itself. Interestingly, it seems to be a sequel to the original 1953 version and not a remake, as the characters remember Alice from ""last time"". The best part of this film was the visual imagination and effects.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The best ""Wonderland"" film I had seen","Tim Burton is back! Along with his regular star, Johnny Depp, they both concocted this extension of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (one of my favourite stories).I saw the movie in 3D with my dad, and it was the second film my dad had ever seen in a theater. Also, it was the third 3D film I've seen. What I meant by the extension of the story is that we get to see a 19-year-old Alice returning to Wonderland (or ""Underland,"" as it is called) after escaping a possible wedding engagement to some poop-a-doop-spoiled-brat snob, to end the Red Queen's reign of terror and restore the White Queen (who is the sister to the Red Queen) to the throne.So anyway, I really love this film, and I love the film's musical soundtrack by Danny Elfman (Tim's regular composer).

You've got a very important date,"Alice returns to the whimsical world she first encountered as a young girl, reuniting with her childhood friends: the White Rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Dormouse, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, and of course, the Mad Hatter. Alice embarks on a fantastical journey to find her true destiny and end the Red Queen's reign of terror.I haven't read the original book or have seen one single adaptation so I didn't know what to expect when walking into this film other than the fact that it has the trio who always stick together: Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. By the end of the film, I was blown away by the imagery of the story, although not the story itself. I went to see this film in 3D, and I'm glad to say it was perfectly suitable for the film.The use of this technology was similar to AVATAR in that it used the 3D to enhance the storytelling experience rather than throw things at the audience every five minutes. Another thing I enjoyed is the visual treat. Once Alice goes to Wonderland, we get to see a lot of jaw-dropping images that do not let up. It's, literally, one great imagery after another after another after another. You can tell the people working on this film worked their butts off for this and it really paid off. The story, however, didn't match to the high standards of the visuals. It was interesting in some ways but the film does meander a lot in the middle of the film. Still, by the end, I enjoyed it overall.Another thing I enjoyed a lot is the characters, particularly Alice, the Red Queen and the Cheshire Cat. Most of the characters are really sweet. The performance by newcomer Mia Wasikowska is really good. There is this aura around her that lightens up the screen every time she's on. Johnny Depp is weird at first, but it's mostly kinda boring. I didn't find him interesting as much as the other colorful characters in here. However, I did love Helena Bonham Carter and her ""Off with their heads!"" line that seem to plague 90% of her dialogue. I also loved Anne Hathaway as well. Some may find her performance overreaching but I think it's appropriate to the weirdness of the film. And it's always great to see Crispin Glover in a weird role.The voice work is as good as the live actors, if not better. Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit works really well along with the noticeable Alan Rickman voicing the Blue Caterpillar. Barbara Windsor gives us a cute and cuddly character as the Dormouse. Oh, and the more we say less about Paul Whitehouse as the March Hare, the better. I found his character to be disturbing to say the least.The movie could have fallen to the ""all style but no substance"" category if it weren't for the great characters and the unique approach given by Tim Burton and his wonderful, yet odd, visual style. The film is humorous at times that I chuckled quite a bit throughout the film and heartfelt at times. Sure, some people would criticize the film for being uninteresting and underwhelming as compared to the visual style but I think it's good enough in my book. Watch the film in 3D or in IMAX 3D if you have the chance because it's really worth the money to bring yourself in a magical world filled with wonder.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderland that is dreamy and funny and simply wonderful. A trip that we take on in dreams.,"A wonderland that is dreamy and funny and simply wonderful. A trip that we take on in dreams.Alice has a dream and the whole story is a familiar story for most who have known it since childhood. But never have I seen it come off so wonderfully with exquisite costumes, art direction and the graphics that are so intrinsic. Once you have the whole feel of it, then each characters come across with a panache that is their own, be it a stalwart like Johnny Depp or a Anne Hathaway, all take the story forward in a way that is so engaging and also enticing.The music took me in and was fantastic, it was aptly creepy at most times and it was thrilling too as the trip went on. The finale music is just a great one though the finale fell short of lot of my visual expectations. I must say the movie got dragged right when Alice met White Queen and since it started to loosen a grip on a suspense thriller it held to for thus long.All performances were very very engaging and they all induced a character of their own and this appreciation goes to Burton for extracting such performances.Burtonish and Johnny Deppish. It's 3/5. It is good for now but surely could have been a Wow had the finale been better and the movie been shorter.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoy!! Just in time for tea time :),"I guess this is a hate or love kind of movie. To be honest, I did not like it much on first viewing. 
Then I saw it again. I had to become accustomed to both the cast, the make up and the creative choices, and to this universe. First time I saw it, I thought Alice was gravely mis-cast. I was So Wrong. Mia Wasikowska is portraying a girl who feels stuck in an incredibly dull world, and she hates all the expectations upon her and all women.

Alice In Wonderland: 6/10,"Tim Burton is a dignitary among contemporary directors, but I have never been his devoted fan, my favorite Burton's film is Edward Scissorhands (1990) (Sleepy Hollow comes next). Also I have a little grudge over his last film Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), as I find it meaningless besides its theatrical performances and gloomy settings or maybe I am just simply fed up with Gothicism.Frankly speaking, this film is only a mediocre work from Burton, the imaginary wonderland is Burtonesque but the story is witless, which evolves in a quite prosaic way without highlights or excitements. However the fun is still achievable especially I think the newcomer Mia Wasikowska's novelty is pervasive all over the film, which is adorable and eliminates lots of sleepiness. Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen are both skin-deep characters but fully bring forth the vividness. Johnny Depp is as crazy as usual as the mad hatter, but not particularly remarkable. Surprisingly I am very much impressed by the voice of Alan Rickman as Absolem, the mighty caterpillar, which is truly mesmerizing.This 3D feature won a huge success in the worldwide box office (collected more than 1 billion US dollars) as it followed the 3D upsurge just after Avatar earlier this year, however I become somewhat worried about Burton's next project as it seems that his fame is forestalling his talent to reach his maximal level, owing to a fact that Burton has never been nominated as Best Director in Oscars, which might hint us that in some level Tim Burton and Michael Bay belong to the same category, more like a skillful film craftsman than a genuine auteur.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Alice in blunder-land ( oh wait, that's not the real Alice!)","What a over-rated, self-indulgent movie. Right from the inclusion of Johnny Deep in a maddening avatar to Helena Carter as the tyrant witch witch an oblong head, Tim Burton yet makes another movie that is barely watchable and completely loony, in a bad way.Mia Wasikowska stars or rather pales as Alice, devoid of emotion or interest. Her pale, frail look gets on one's nerves as she sleepwalks throughout the film, with an expressionless countenance that feels weakens the movie significantly. The scenes where she is supposed to be brave look rehearsed and forced. In fact, I and my friends got so bugged that we wanted her clothes to fall off so that she could create some stir in the audience!Anne Hathaway, vibrant and exquisite in Rachel Getting Married, gives a superficial portrayal of the kind and loving White Queen. Poor soul is soulless in the movie as she tries hard to be Meryl Streep or Julie Andrews but falters. Why did Tim have to cast her for a role more suitable for an older actress? Though miscast, she at least tries to make a character of her own, unlike Mia, but looks robotic. In fact, she looked like a typical deceiving hag who would bear her fangs anytime. ""Oh, she's wearing white! Symbolizes peace. She must be the good one"" but unfortunately, she ends up getting wasted. And even though her performance is being berated by a number of viewers, I feel that she at least tries to get into her role. Wish she didn't look so hideous here!Mad Hatter is played by the outlandish Johnny Depp but he too doesn't cast much impact in his half-baked role. None of the characters, including him, connects with the audience. None are very likable. I remember, in Chronicles of Narnia, where though the main four Britishers aren't versatile actors, but the supporting cast shines. Tilda Swinton was towering, tormenting and impactful. Aslan, though not a real character, still was very likable. Here, everyone is mundane and lifeless. Depp still tries to give his fullest but the dreary pace of the film outweighs him since his performance isn't groundbreaking or any of that sort. And I'm not a hater of Johnny or Tim Burton (loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, liked Timm's Batman, Johnny's What's eating Gilbert Grape?)Helena plays the Red Queen in a quirky fashion that gets customary and monotonous. She plays the role differently though, not the traditional ones who are mostly staunch and resolute. Instead, she plays a role similar to Meryl Streep's in She-Devil, who gives herself too much airs. She is funny and redeeming for a while. Then she grates because she does the same act throughout the movie and makes her performance one-dimensional.Crispin Grover is tolerable. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are neither funny nor likable, overbearing at times. The story is tedious and the animation prosaic. The real world characters are so full of themselves and don't supply anything to the movie. The final scene is a bit implausible and rushed.Well, it was a long, long, unending journey in the theater for me.

Decent Version of the Classic Tale,"Alice in Wonderland (2010)** 1/2 (out of 4)Updated version of the Disney classic has teenager Alice (Mia Wasikowska) about to be forced into a lifeless marriage when she takes off running, falls into a hole and into Wonderland. There the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has a mission for her and that's to bring the evil queen (Helena Bonhnam Carter) down and free (Anne Hathaway). I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film and when the end credits started I walked out of the theater with a take-it or leave-it feeling. This certainly doesn't match the animated film but at the same time I'm sure kids watching the story for the first time are really going to love what they see. For me the film just seemed to by the numbers as if Burton really didn't know where he wanted to go with the material. Everything is very beautiful on the eyes but a lot of the emotion seemed to be missing and the film really lacked any heart or soul. Out of all the Depp-Burton films I must admit that this was the first time I was disappointed with Depp. He certainly gives a good performance here but for the life of me I couldn't help but feel he got robbed by the screenplay that really didn't leave him much to do. In some ways I felt that Depp was a bit too good for this part and that the character was underwritten. I was also bored with Carter and her performance. Perhaps she's just been in too many of Burton's films but I didn't find any part of her character or performance to be entertaining. Even Hathaway's character is rather weak but the actress at least gives it her all. Wasikowska is the real reason this movie works as well as it does. I really couldn't take my eyes off of her and she did a marvelous job as Alice. I thought she gave an incredibly strong performance and I believed her every step of the way. She was cute, charming and fun which is exactly what the movie needed. Horror legend Christopher Lee lends his voice at the end of the film as well. The visuals here are very easy on the eyes but, again, without the heart of soul there's really not enough here to make it a winner.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's a good movie, worthy of being watched.","Alice in Wonderland ReviewTim Burton's 2010 film ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a strange spin on the classic tale. The film is about Alice's return to Wonderland as an adult, after her time their as a child. It's different and it works well. Wonderland is a luscious and beautiful world, populated by unique and interesting creatures. For a two year old movie, ""Alice in Wonderland"" has amazing CGI effects, and all of Wonderland looks extraordinary.Johnny Depp is the only actor who truly shines in this movie, and shine he does. He portrays the Mad Hatter, a mad man with a top hat, orange hair and pasty skin. The Mad Hatter sometimes goes off on rants, which really help to showcase his madness. He is lighthearted and serious at the same time, and Johnny plays this character with such charisma he deserves an award. An actress worthy of mention is Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the Red Queen. Unfortunately, those are the only two actors worthy of notice. Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice the protagonist, falls short as Alice. She delivers her lines so blandly and without passion that it is hard to feel sympathy for her, even when she's in the most desperate of circumstances. The rest of the characters are played well, but since their roles are so minor it is hard to want to mention them.Alice's quest leads her to discover more about herself; that she wants to do something important in her life. ""Alice in Wonderland"" tells a good story, and it is a good movie. That's why I am giving this film an eight out of ten.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Easy-going entertainment,"I found this film to be easy-going entertainment for a family afternoon of relaxation. Actor-spotting was fun, especially for the voice-only actors (Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Babs Windsor, etc..) and I found it visually stimulating: expected from Mr Burton. I am a Depp fan and he delivered his usual quirky style, showing off another accent which I thought quite convincing, on the whole: but the whole film felt a little empty and shallow to me. It seemed to just meander along nicely without anything to really stimulate the emotions. We enjoyed it, but I doubt any of us will be wishing to watch it again. I'd like to give it a 6.5 but I'll be generous and go for a 7 :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Was okay!,"One could say 'Alice in Wonderland' is certainly a digital wonderland, which doesn't quite mesh together well and feels cartoon-ish at the best of times. Visionary, stylistic filmmaker in Tim Burton returns with yet another recreation of a classic in Alice in Wonderland. However, much like 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', this film serves a purpose to inspire me to watch the original movies- in this case the 50s Disney cartoon that I so fondly remember. Or I could actually read the book! However, this film is not without its charm!Yet another Tim Burton collaboration with Johnny Depp in a starring role! Filling the shoes (or hat) of the Mad Hatter. Johnny Depp does a reasonable job in this role, and is likable and insane enough. However, I think audiences are more curious to see Depp perform this character specifically than any other aspect of the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is quite good as the Red Queen, and this character is an interesting mix of actual real footage mixed in with digital effects- making Bonham Carter's head cleverly over-sized! Overall, the film is glossy and utilises some clever CGI mixed in with actual footage, but it all felt a little overdone!Moving on to Alice. I actually thought Mia Wasikowska was quite good in the title role. I was more surprised to learn that she was one of the kids in 'The Kids Are Alright', which certainly displays some range! I didn't even know she was Australian, and I predict a great future for this young actress, as I think she held her own with Johnny Depp and a range of CGI animals and a giant jabberwocky to boot.Basically, 'Alice in Wonderland' was a viewing afterthought for me, and I never rushed out to see it at the cinemas. I pretty much got what I expected, and that is a passable flick no better than something like 'Clash of the Titans' where you are curious to witness a digital CGI interpretation of classic characters and material. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter all raised the bar with 'Sweeney Todd', but then again that was unfamiliar territory for me. Still, I felt 'Alice in Wonderland' was a step down for all three artists, but not a letdown!*** out of *****!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shame Tim Burton's great imagination can't match his storytelling,"This is basically a sequel to the original ""Alice in Wonderland"" and not a good one at that. Tim Burton has a good vivid imagination when it comes to his films, such as this one. It's a shame though that his level of creative doesn't match his level of storytelling because the plot just wasn't that good. Johnny Depp is a actor that really gets into his roles, but there just wasn't anything memorable about this one, he just looked like a clown with the mix of personalities between Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow. For a place called Wonderland, people would expect a lot of mad characters to be in it, but everyone seemed pretty normal. As a matter of fact everything seemed find and dandy until Alice decides to comeback to Wonderland, than all hell breaks lose for some reason. It's a shame Tim Burton's great imagination can't match his level of of storytelling.6.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Dreamy, Funny, and Such A Modern Twist To A Fairy Tale","This movie is EXCELLENT. It's a movie with humor, action, great costumes, terrific special effects, amazing animal characters and beautiful painted backgrounds. The actors and actresses were cast perfect for their characters. Along with all that is a great story and fantastic music. The animators and set designers were superb artists, and the production feels like you are in a fantastic dream. Tim Burton's vision and Danny Elfman's music is a great duo. Helena Bonham Carter steals the show - she is the evil sister you love to hate. Carter, as the egotistical mad Red Queen sister and Hathaway as the White Queen (gothic white) sister. has Wonderland kingdom in the middle of a sibling rivalry. I have to admit I wanted to see ""Alice"" because of Burton & Carter & Depp collaboration. Add to that, Danny Elfman's score and Alice (Underground) performed by Avril Lavigne, makes the Movie Soundtrack great too. ***** 5 Stars - Go See The Movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a good movie but could of been tiny bit more stronger,I remember growing up with the cartoon Alice in wonderland it was a wonderful film and one of Disney's classics films and now we have this remake to it made by Tim Burton who made the night mare before Christmas and Coraline which where amazing films This by the way is pretty good but it does have a few problems one of the main problems is that Alice does not want to kill an evil creature and I found this movie a little bit too dark it was also a bit too long. Okay the story is about Alice who is going to get married to some guy I don't remember what his name was but he looks like the guy from the new series of Doctor who and she finds the rabbit with the clock and chases him to the tree where she feels in as a kid and meets the hatter and some new characters which did not appear in the cartoon before. But all Theo this movie is pretty good but I think the writing could of been a little bit more stronger with the plot from the begging to the end its still a good movie but needs to be a bit more stronger if you know what I meanBut still a good movie with a few problems and needs stronger story line I give this movie a 7.2 out of 10 pretty good.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Less enjoyable than surgery.,"The Good: It did not give me cancer.The Bad: Alice in Wonderland is a treasure of classic literature, and classic Disney. Well it was. That all changed with the latest abortion by Tim Burton. AIW was easily, the lamest, contrived, nonsensical piece of crap that has ever made me want to gouge my eyes out whilst watching it. And I use the above terms of nonsensical and lame, in the most disrespectful ways possible.Gone was the innocence, whimsy, curiosity, and dare I say magic, of the novel and the Disney animated classic. In its place, a wooden, funny looking actress whose range of emotions went from ""oh, a fly just landed on my plate"" to ""oh, a dog. and it's brown."" Those last two situations didn't actually occur, however, they may have been more interesting than what had.I am literally shocked. How one could take a piece of literature (and film, in numerous outings) and turn it to ""that"", is beyond my level of comprehension. This proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that Tim Burton can no longer be regarded as a genius, or even a competent storyteller. He has become a quirky nightmare with a lot of money and fantastic art director. To boot, Johnny Depp has become an unwatchable characterization of himself, a bad parody, that seriously needs to stop, and much like the director, needs to get back the formula of Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands.I'm blown away by how poor this film was. I went in with zero expectations, and it surpassed them in a negative sense. In a rating of 1 to 10, I give this film a burial at sea, so no one can urinate on it any more than Tim Burton already has. Oh, and Avril Lavine does the end music. She is to art what small pox is to life.Let me add, I get it. It was supposed to be a follow up, or sequel, or something along those lines. Something of an homage piece if you will. This was not executed. In the least. The dialog was barely audible and both mixed and pronounced to the poorest degree. The plot was quick, the inside jokes quicker and hackney, the plot spoon fed and completely forced. This film disgusts me. It's everything wrong with modern Hollywood cinema directed at a younger generation, and even to my own. Once again, a treasured tale from youth and fond cinematic memory now has an blemish, thanks to this. Tim Burton needs to stop adapting loved literature. Like, now.The Ugly: I sort of wish it gave me cancer so if (and when) they do make a (gasp)sequel, I'd be dead long before the trailer came out. Or would at least have bigger problems on my hands.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"If Tim Burton would have made this film eight to ten years ago, it would have been a masterpiece, instead it's another trite film based on a delightful and well-read novel.","This is probably one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in a few years. Alice in Wonderland should have been something up Tim Burton's alley, and instead he turned it into something it wasn't. He should have taken over the screenplay from Linda Woolverton (whoever that is) and created darker, more dimensional characters; instead, what we get is Tim Burton for kids. I would have preferred his take on Lewis Carroll's novel rather than a rehash of every Hollywood fantasy film. I thought the younger Alice in the film looked the part of the original illustrations and would have been perfect for the role. Depp ruined the Mad Hatter with his accent and incoherent speech, Burton ruined the Mad Hatter with his ugly costume design. I was disappointed to not hear Hatter shout ""Change places!"" I understand he is saddened by resent events, but even a mumbled, sad, ""Change places"" would have been nice to hear and keep his character intact through a simple and effective effort.The charm behind Carroll's novel is that there really isn't much of a story, but rather a series of random and always bizarre events that are colorful and imaginative. You start to gain the sense that Alice really is in a peculiar land and at times you even often pity her. With her return to Wonderland the life behind everything the novel created almost evaporated. I say almost because the Cheshire Cat steals the show and truly did save the the film. Regardless, I would have much preferred a stop-motion attempt (The Nightmare Before Christmas) from Tim Burton rather than the use of actors and actresses to portray Carroll's characters. What we're left with because of this is unnecessary, though beautiful, CGI and a lot of it. At the very least the mood atmosphere of Edward Scissorhands would have been a delightful treat.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why all the hate?,"I have read some of the reviews that have been posted on here, as well as on Empire and so forth and I just need to ask: Why does everyone hate this film? Granted it's not Burton's best (unlike say Edward Scissorhands or Sweeney Todd) but it is Burton showing what he does best: create a weird and wonderful (primarily visual) world. Johnny Depp is not spectacularly awful as the Mad Hatter, but I do feel that the use of the Scottish accent was over-egging the pudding just a little bit. Mia Wasikowska is going to be a major star in the future, and this is the major leg-up for her that will attract people to see The Kids Are Alright and Jane Eyre, which sounds it will be fantastic. She is by far and a way a bright light that is a bout to explode into a supernova in Hollywood.The rest of the cast perform their roles terrifically. Anne Hathaway's White Queen is sweet and sinister in equal measures, but I feel they could have done more with her character, perhaps showing her dark side a little more. For Bonham Carter, Rickman and Fry, the roles of Red Queen, Caterpillar and Cheshire Cat respectively, fit like gloves. Their voices, as well as actual performances, in Ms Carter's case, made me feel as though they are the defining representations of the characters. Although, it has to be said, Bonham Carter does seem to be channelling Queenie from Blackadder to a great degree.Michael Sheen, Barbara Windsor, Timothy Spall and Matt Lucas all scrabble for screen time, and they all get it, and are perfectly adequate in their performances. The main trouble that most people seem to have with the film is the story. Granted, it does seem to be in the vein of Hook and Return to Oz in the sense that the Heroine has to return to their childhood adventureland and discover their destiny. In that respect, the film can't decide if it's a re-imagining or a sequel, which may infuriate some devout Carroll-heads. But to be fair, the original story of Alice has been told so many times by so many different directors that if Burton had stuck religiously to the book,. there would have been no surprises or excitement for anyone.Also, to those who say that this is Burton's least personal film; Alice is an outcast in Victorian society, who then finds companionship in The Hatter, who's just as much an outcast as she is, and then goes off to slay a giant monster to save her friends and prove she's capable of taking charge of her life. This is what runs throughout most of Burton's movies: The outsider making their own way in the world. And who says the film is not dark enough: the girl has to make her way across a moat by usign decapitated heads as stepping stones!In conclusion, if you (like me) love Burton, go ahead and see it and decide what you make of it. It is a crazy, wonderful mad film with great performances and spectacular visual effects. It's just not a great one.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great,"If you did not watch the original 1951 animation it might be hard to appreciate this one. The weirdness in the first is much more intense but that is the purpose of the movie so on that it will not be everyone 's cup of tea.Plot - A nice and very weird adventure into Alice's(Mia Wasikowska) mid to find herself the courage of walking her own path in life. 6⭐The performance is a thing of beauty done by the actors, with huge names like, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, brings the writers script life and emotion. 9⭐This is a heavy CGI movie but the Director(Tim Burton) and the Special Effects team did a fantastic job and went to all details with a dedicated care in making sure it is not a poor use of CGI (2010 standards) 9⭐Disney did it again and I recommend watchin with kids and family on any weekend

"A very good enterteinment, with a great cast, Danny Elfman's always competent music and a fantastic look, with first-rate visual effects","Lewis Carrol's most acclaimed work has inspired several film and television adaptations. In addition to the classic animation of 1951, one of the best known is this live action version, directed by Tim Burton with the participation of Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, both from Walt Disney Animation Studios.The story adapts short stories and poems written by Lewis Carroll and sets up an interesting scenario, that is, do not expect a faithful version of the Carroll classic, nor a sugary adaptation to the molds of the 1951 Disney animation. What Tim Burton offers is a different interpretation, sometimes reverential, sometimes quite free. Again, nothing different from the other works of the filmmaker who drank at the source of characters already known to the general public. Here, Alice (Mia Wasikowska), at 19, goes to a party and finds out that she is about to be proposed to hundreds of socialites. She then asks for time to think and leaves everyone looking questioned. As she runs, running away from that awkward situation and people she doesn't like, she sees a certain white rabbit in a vest and watch in her hand and decides to follow him. She then falls into a hole and ends up in Wonderland, a place where she was ten years ago despite not remembering him. There she is received by the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and starts to deal with fantastic and magical beings, in addition to the wrath of the powerful Queen of Hearts (Helena Bonham Carter).Linda Woolverton, Disney veteran, signs the script based on the short story already known to everyone. Linda's work does not come to compromise the progress of the feature, but it is also far from other works by the screenwriter like The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast that she signed the script along with other big names from Disney. Perhaps the biggest problem with Alice's script is Disney's need to create labels for her characters: good and bad, good guys and bad guys. The culmination of this problem is punctuated with an ""epic"" battle at the end of the feature that in no way resembles Carrol's smooth and realist tale. It seems that that battle, the setting and the motivation of the characters do not match the essence of the story and it ends up not working well for the progress of the feature.As in the book, Alice who falls into a rabbit hole that transports her to a fantastic place populated by peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures, revealing a logic of the absurd, characteristic of dreams. This is full of satirical allusions directed at both Carroll's friends and enemies, from parodies to popular English children's poems taught in the 19th century and also from linguistic and mathematical references often through enigmas that contributed to his popularity. It is thus a work of difficult interpretation as it contains two books in a single text: one for children and another for adults. The book can be interpreted in several ways. One of the interpretations says that the story represents adolescence, with a sudden and unexpected entrance (the fall in the rabbit hole, starting the adventure), in addition to the several changes in size and the confusion that this causes in Alice, to the point that she says who no longer knows who he is after so many transformations (what he identifies with adolescent psychology).Woolverton's script easily takes the viewer with Alice underground and experiences this adventure watered by envy, falsehood, debauchery, sarcasm and, of course, madness. With inspired and, at the same time, confused dialogs thanks to the ""fabulous"" vocabulary created by Carroll, the feature enchants from beginning to end with a dynamic script and the ideal size. However, the text does not show Carroll's dream dreams that made the two books so successful. Here, they become a mere pretext for an average adventure commanded by a warrior Alice and a hatter who is just crazy in appearance. This drastic change in the characteristics of the characters ends up pushing away the original material of the adaptation, creating an inevitable resistance on the part of the viewer. The Hatter has always been self-centered (and his daydreams), just like the Cheshire cat. The self-centeredness of these figures was one of their main characteristics and are misused in this adaptation.
It is true that not all changes are bothering. The creation of a mix between the Queen of Hearts and the Red Queen in the same character, defended in an amusing way by Helena Bonham Carter, is one of the good creations of the screenwriter Linda Woolverton. Supporter and her lover, Stayne, the jack of hearts (Crispin Glover, from Back to the Future, 1985), is also an interesting addition to the plot. The Hatter himself has his good times, even though he is totally different from the original. Johnny Depp is the actor who has the perfect past career to qualify him to live the Hatter in theaters. Making his own version of the character, he captures attention whenever he is on the scene. With orange hair, pale skin and asymmetrical pupils, the composition of the character turns out to be more interesting than his own. To a Mad Hatter, his ideas and attitudes seemed quite healthy. The opposite is true when thinking about the March Hare, insanity in person at the tea table and a great transposition for the big screens.Other quotes that are worth the adaptation are that, although Jabberwocky is often confused as a character in this work, in fact it only appears in its sequence, Alice in the Other Side of the Mirror. He is, however, often included in the film versions, which are usually simply called Alice in Wonderland, causing confusion. The Queen of Hearts is also confused with the Red Queen, who appears in the sequence of the story, Alice on the Other Side of the Mirror, but they do not have any characteristics in common, except the character of both being queens. The Queen of Hearts belongs to a deck of cards that is present in the first book, while the Red Queen is represented by a red chess piece, given that chess is the present theme of the second book.In the rest of the cast, in addition to the aforementioned Johnny Depp, we have Helena Bonham Carter, the director's ex-wife who is a stamped figure in her features. Despite having a lot of fun with her Queen of Hearts, Helena is underutilized and her talent comes down to some hysterical and also affected cries. But perhaps no one is as unnecessary as Anne Hathaway and her White Queen who looks more like a Disney castle. The big surprise is even in the hands of the protagonist, the then newcomer Mia Wasikowska who battled and won big names to get the leading role of the film. His gaze lost amidst all the wonders of that underground world delivers a truth to the character that is gradually gaining our sympathy and our fans (despite the unnecessary battle at the end). It was a good start for the young and beautiful actress, without a doubt.If the story of Alice in Wonderland is not, let's say, wonderful, the art direction, costumes and photography give a bath of creativity. Many things can be said about Tim Burton, unless his films do not have their own style and overwhelming visuals. His new feature film is no exception, bringing an expressionist, lively and colorful ""Wonderland"". There are so many details in each scenario that it is difficult to pay attention to everything in just one look. As Alice goes through several transformations, growing and decreasing in size, she ends up wearing several different dresses, one more interesting than the other in the way they are mill metrically thought to appear improvised. The visual effects, in addition to the creation of epic characters such as the White Rabbit and the Caterpillar, are impeccable.Tim Burton returns for another project that had everything to match its bizarre and morbid aesthetic, perhaps even putting layers never seen before in previous adaptations. And, well, if there's one thing that usually comes with the director's name, it's the constant use of special effects - and I have to say that, despite departing from Carroll's profusely colored conception, he still manages to work with great care, especially in the regarding the presence of tortuous, wavy and asymmetric scenarios. In addition, the use of fog is remarkable, a semantic element of works of the genre, which value mysticism and the gradual understanding of the supernatural and the impossible. Burton also takes the opportunity to play a game of light and shadow that comes into constant debate with the color palette, since the scenery stained with heavy or orange tones, representing the endless conflicts of that territory, contradicts the most saturated elements.Despite the imaginary concern, the director forgets one of the main points of a film run that allows the connection between the work and the audience: history. In collaboration with Linda Woolverton, both decide to take advantage of the material not only from a novel, but also from the direct sequel entitled Alice Through the Looking Glass, perhaps as a way of bringing both ideas together - which are originally opposed to each other and do not dialogue except for scenic absurdity - in something that resembles fantastic fiction and a supernatural adventure, but which is oscillating without its own identity in the midst of the cinematographic universe.With its ups and downs, Alice in Wonderland ends up being a good movie, with reservations. Entertaining enough, it has a great cast, Danny Elfman's always competent music and a fantastic look, with first-rate visual effects. It lacks content, as it is just an adventure without the symbolism and charm of Lewis Carroll's writings. And it slips completely in its outcome, with a purely mercantilist view. But in general, it will please newcomers in the world of Carrol / Burton, who will be enchanted and have fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than other Disney remakes,"I have to admit that I am not being 100% unbiased due to the fact that I watched this film all the time when I was a kid and because now I have watched other Disney remakes than are just beyond awful. What I like abut this movie is that is didn't tried to copy paste the original, but actually tried to do it's own thing. The story is now about a prophecy statting that Alice one day shall save the Wonderland and is treated as if this film was a aequel to the original and I like that. When it came out people complained that it was called a remake when in reality it was a completly different thing. Now, those people bust be swallowing their words seeing the things that can't even be called movies that is making Disney. But the movie still can't be called good because it has quite some problems, the story goes super fast for starters and the CGI has its ups and downs, and you can feel it's already a decade old. At the end its just a film you watch if you have nothing better to do and is appearing on the recommended but it will grant you some entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What has Tim Burton been Smoking?,"All the beauty and the hard work in creating Wonderland really pays off especially if seen in 3D. Tim Burton's dark direction of Alice In Wonderland is somewhat interesting, the finishing look looks well made but sometimes its a bit too gloomy and added with the dullness of a story that is all too mature for anybody 10 and under (Go figure: Alice is like in her late teens, more problems). The characters all have their own unique touch; Alice is the low key but she's not a chore to look at, Johnny Depp is as charming as ever (a more crazier take then Jack Sparrow), The Red Queen's big heart shaped head is BIG and Anne Hathaway's White Queen never stops putting her hands in the air. Each character has charm in them but when added with Tim Burton's touch, each of them have their own ""dark side."" Alice seems to be the normal one but the rest like Mad Hatter (his creepy red eyes) and White Queen (when she's not looking at her orchids she's in the kitchen making up a hot potion of fingers and saliva) are all mad but in a good-funny way. Let us not forget about Alan Rickman who plays an ugly-wrinkled caterpillar that only puffs on a cigarette or in a kid's interpretation 'sucking on a perfume looking bottle and blowing out circle clouds.' The whole entire film...lets just say, ""Tim Burton, WHAT on Earth have you've been smoking?"" The whole entire film is like on the high ride with Tim Burton which makes the film Mad! I guess its a good thing, whatever he's smoking seems to be working for him and while I was watching this film, I couldn't help but hallucinate as well. The Storyline of the Film: It gets a 60%. It was very simply done and told. It seems like every Disney movie has a theme which this one has. Theme: being brave and mad at the same time which is what I got out of it. I know other people think it's about governing yourself and taking the lead. The C.G.I usage of the Film: It gets an 80% Visually Striking! A movie that gets credits for the visuals. Overall: 70% It's an interesting film made only to catch the audience's eyes but it does little effect to move the heart.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Disney Movie with Female Lead,"Alice in Wonderland is the best movie with a female lead character that Disney has ever produced. For the first time we see girl as hero/champion rather than it being all about her fighting with her father re: her marriage choice. In this movie, Alice must go through the trials and tribulations all heroes must face – she must make the impossible, possible, she must subdue her internal passions (represented by the The Bandersnatch), conquer her fears, create her own path and transform into the ""right"" Alice. In the end she must make her own choices, not the ones that others set out for her, even if they are different choices. Touche to Linda Woolverton for a great screenplay, Tim Burton for wonderful direction and Mia Wasikowska for a great acting job. I highly recommend this movie in Imax 3-D.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A MUST for Burton Fans,"Today, Director Tim Burton's latest film Alice Wonderland was released to audiences around the globe. I was fortunate enough to secure tickets to the opening midnight showing in Imax 3D with Jessica, Danny, and Brandon. Now, as a huge fan (no reference to my size or eating habits) I went in with exceedingly high expectations, and I'm pleased to report that all expectations were met! Tim Burton has once again brought to like a whole new world, filled with amazing creations and visuals. He's managed to take the novel, which had no real sense of plot, direction, or characterization, and develop it into a full fledged story with incredible fleshed out characters. I was completely entranced not only by the visuals, but my the story and characters themselves. The sets, though all cgi, were beautiful, and really captured the surrealistic feelings the novel contained. Now, this film is not a remake of the classic novel or cartoon Disney film, and is instead a continuation of Alice's struggle to grow up and be comfortable with herself. The parallels between the realm of Underland and her 'reality' are contrasted beautifully, both through characters, scenery, and dialouge. The designs were marvelous, really capturing the dark absurdity that is 'wonderland'. Its rare to witness a film that takes you so far into the story, that when it ends you have to take that moment to recollect yourself into reality again, and that's precisely how I felt when the credits started rolling.In my opinion, I enjoyed this film much more then Cameron's Avatar. Where Avatar was visually marvelous, Burton manages to create an equally stunning world, while maintaining an original plot and characters. The casting as well was incredible, and each actor brought more to the film.Out of five stars, I rate about a 4-4.5. I could go on for hours about the plot, characters, and well, everything...but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone! I'm open for discussion for any who have seen the film though. I hope this review was helpful to those unsure of going to see it. I highly recommend it.I highly recommend seeing this film in theaters, to fully capture the visuals and even the wonderful score by composer Danny Elfman. I look foreward to seeing it again and again when it is released on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Hit and Miss film, and shows 3D is not the future","Tim Burton is obviously is one of the most respected directors around, having made excellent films like Ed Wood and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barbar of Fleet Street. He had made films that have appealed to families to more adult-aimed films. But Tim Burton has also been a director who can also get things very wrong, like with Mars Attack and Planet of the Apes. With Alice in Wonderland Tim Burton directs a sequel to the Lewis Carroll story, and he is given us a film that has many good and bad points.Mia Wasikowska plays Alice Kingsleigh, a nineteen-year-old woman living in the upper ends of Victorian Society. She is a intelligent woman, quick witted, but doesn't like living her surroundings. She is also a woman who from the age of six had a recurring dream involving strange creatures, likes a smiling cat and a blue caterpillar. After being proposed by a very wet fellow, Alice runs away, following a White Rabbit (Michael Sheen). Alice falls into Wonderland, believing she is in a dream: but their is a debate within the creatures of Wonderland if she is the right Alice. But since Alice last was in Wonderland, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), had taken over and overthrown the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). It's prophesied that only Alice can stop the Red Queen's reign of terror, and kill her dragon, the Jabberwocky. To aid Alice she forms a group of allies, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), The Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), the Dormouse (Barbara Windsor) and Tweedledee (Matt Lucas) and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas).As stated Tim Burton is a good director with a wild imagination. With Alice in Wonderland is able to create a large, grant world with the aid of green screen technology. He shows a wide range of creatures, and even plays on the idea of a dragon. He design for the Red Queen is excellent, and the Mad Hatter's schizophrenia. But sadly this is also one of Burton's most heartless films, feeling like he was doing so he can do another project. They seems to be a lack of depth within this film and doesn't use the ideas this film created. Also some the the CGI was not as strong as it could have been. Alice in Wonderland has proved to be a successful 3D and along with the success of Avatar Hollywood executives are wetting themselves with excitement, hoping to have a money spinner with 3D. But whilst the 3D with Avatar took years of effort and had special cameras developed to film it, Alice in Wonderland was done retrospectively: with computer experts making the 3D from 2D film. But the 3D in Alice in Wonderland is weak in comparsion. It lacks the effectiveness, and many things were literally thrown at the audience. This shows that retrofitting 3D into films is not the future, and films like Avatar should be a rare treat, not the norm. The script by Linda Woolverton is not as a strong as it could have been. She doesn't use up all the ideas she created, and much of the characterisation is thin. She does try to write a fun film for all the family, with enough of a dark edge for young adults. But they should have been more fun in the film, and particularly more humour.Tim Burton has found an excellent new star with Mia Wasikowska: a young Aussie with a great future in front of him. She is the best performance in the film, able to show Alice as a quick witted young woman who still has the clouds of doubt over her head. Alice is tough cookie in this film and doesn't want to be dictated to. Burton also goes to his regular actors, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. It is rare for Depp to give a bad performance, and with he does create a character who delightedly mad, and shows to have spats of anger. He even give the audience a good Scottish accent when made. But despite Depp and Burton saying they wanted to bring more depth to the Mad Hatter, they sadly fail to do this. Bonham Carter is one of the best actresses around and she is also good in the film. She makes a great villain, who is prone to anger issues, and her character is given more depth, having a longing to be loved and issues with her looks. But the Red Queen also felt like a superfisical character. The real waste in the film is Anne Hathaway. Hathaway does have a few good moments, particularly comedic moments, but her character is given little screen time, and again, little depth. An smaller name actress or a good comedian could have been just as effective in the role.Overall there are good action scenes, and it should appeal to all but very young children. Mia Wasikowska shows she is an actress with a future, and there is enough or Tim Burton's die-hard fans to like. But this was a film in need of a stronger script.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton's Alice in Wonderland Lacks Excitement  For Viewers of All Ages.,"The recent film production, Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, takes a spin on the classic Disney Film. It features many of the audience's favorite classic characters, including Alice, The Rabbit, and The Mad Hatter. The production, is not so much a remake to the 1951 film, But a sequel with an entirely new plot scheme. The Film begins as Alice, a young woman who many will remember from the original film, at a family party, which she later discovers is for her own wedding engagement to a family friend. Later, she sees The Rabbit, running through her family bushes. (However later, we find that Alice has no recollection of her previous experience in wonderland.) She then, as expected, follows him down into his rabbit hole. Here, Alice finds herself in a small room, and drinks of series of potion, to become the exact side needed to fit through the one working door in the room. She then discovers herself to be in a large land, the audience members know as Wonderland. The new film also makes several references to the previous film, and the poem The Jabberwacky. After seeing this movie twice, the film seemed to never lose its luster, because it never had any. The film, including very untalented actors and actresses. (Besides Johnny Depps performance as the Mad Hatter, which I believe he portrayed quite well, with an upbeat emotion about him, even in the most upsetting of times.) However, at times, the movie's happy, and uplifting tempo, many audience members believed it would have, was ruined by Burton, who replaced it with a more sinister, adult approach. The film, in all honesty, was boring, the plot line, very lacking, and predictable after the first few scenes. It also left many questions unanswered, leaving me and many other audience members with many questions, about the ending. Also, towards the ending there were scenes of gore and violence, which many parents may find inappropriate for their children. However, many adults will find the film boring. In conclusion, Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton, is a grave disappointment. It is to gruesome for young children, boring for adults, and even many teenagers see the film as unsatisfying. In my opinion, even for parents taking their children to the film, Alice in wonderland is a waste of time, and money.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't listen to the bad reviews,"I was very hesitant to watch this since I got deterred by the ridiculous critics bashing it. For years i've been hesitant until today that is. I had nothing to do and decided I wanted to watch something and so I decided to give ""Alice in Wonderland"" a chance. After watching it, I gotta say... Don't ever listen to critics. Always judge a movie for yourself, because it's all personal likings/opinions. That's what I found out about this movie. I personally had a great time with it.The casting was great, especially Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Alan Rickman (God rest his soul) as the caterpillar etc. Tim Burton is great at directing as always with his particular style he puts in his movies. This followed the original ""Alice in Wonderland"" loosely and then went to do its own thing which was perfectly fine with me, because I think they nailed it. Oh, and the Red Queen ofc was great too. Very fun movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim burton's extravaganza,"Ill keep it short as usual, since it is always better to see a film without any prior judgments or opinions, with an complete open mind.This movie is a Tim Burton wet dream. Tim always makes a better movie (in my opinion) when he keeps to his own/original material ( scissor hands, big fish, mars attacks) not when hes taking ideas from other people ( planet of apes, Sweeney Todd, charlie % the chocolate) , but , strangely for me this one hits the mark. Charlie wasn't that bad, but it wasn't good either. this movie is like seeing charlie on speed. The time flew by, and what a ride it was! If you like Burton's surreal storytelling, and if you ever read alice in wonderland as a kid, your gonna love this one! And of course an awesome score from Danny Elfman yet again.Enjoy!- the_evil_fred",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If it doesn't gel, then it's not aspic... and this just isn't gelling.","Alice in Wonderland centers around teenage Alice who again travels to the magical wonderland she visited as a child. She has forgotten about it though and must learn about all the interesting creatures and cultures as she tries to save Wonderland from the grip of the evil Red Queen.It's hard to say what exactly, but something definitely went very wrong during the production of Alice in Wonderland. They had a great cast as well as a great director who seemed perfectly suited for a visionary movie like this, but amazingly none of this ever really comes together right. Aside from some of the visuals and a few of the characters none of this really works much at all.Aside from the poorly written script possibly the biggest problem would be the pacing. Characters and plot points are introduced at a such a break neck pace that it is very hard for any of it to really register in your mind. Every five minutes a new creature is introduced and then seems to just fade into the background as more characters are brought in. The viewer never really gets a chance to get to know or reflect on any of these characters and it's hard to find their motivation. Even Alice, who is the only two dimensional character in the film isn't even much of a character. Why does she care at all about the fate of Wonderland, I'm not sure.The acting isn't particularly state of the art either. I didn't find Depp's Mad Hatter to be funny or interesting, just annoying. Depp is a very good actor and excels in creating interesting character traits and turning what would have been boring characters into the high point of an otherwise dull movie (Jack Sparrow). He doesn't manage to get that here.The only reason I can find to see Alice in Wonderland would be for the visuals or if you are a huge fan of the original and just want to see Burton's take on the story. I'm not a fan of 3D, but if you are don't see it for that either. The 3D is not nearly as well integrated as in Avatar.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than people say,"I enjoyed this film, I found it interesting that rather than a remake it was an extension of the Alice In Wonderland books which it seems that not a lot of people realize, the acting was fine, Wonderland was visually stunning, and the characters were good, although I do not understand that when Burton and Depp decided the Hatter's accent would change to reflect his emotions, why they chose a Scottish accent which at times is hard to understand, and the 3D was not really necessary for it only felt like a couple of scenes were coming out of the screen, this film met my expectations, it had Burton's bizarreness, darkness, colorfulness and energy, all in all, a good movie and classic Tim Burton.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun to look at, anyway","In this reimagining of the Lewis Carroll stories, Alice returns to Wonderland after a ten-year absence and finds herself pegged as the savior for the mystical land, now ruled with an iron fist and bulbous head by the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Tim Burton's film is, as expected, visually stunning and imaginative but suffers from a predictable plot and 3D effects that feel sort of unnecessary.Alice (newcomer Mia Wasikowska) is now 19 years old and dreams nightly of her previous journey into Wonderland, but she has no memory of the actual visit. Her mother wants Alice to be married into a rich and powerful family, and at the beginning of the movie Alice and her mother appear at a posh to-do thrown by the parents of a snotty, dumb-looking suitor, who of course pops the question to her in front of a hundred simpering guests. But our Alice isn't ready for such a commitment to such a drip, so off she runs, comically falling down a hole in pursuit of the White Rabbit.Once in Wonderland, Alice encounters several of the characters she met during her earlier visit: Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Cheshire Cat, the Blue Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Dormouse, and the March Hare. It seems that the denizens of Wonderland have been awaiting Alice's return so that she can free them from the Red Queen's tyranny, something about a mystical calendar that prophesies Alice slaying the Jabberwocky.As with most Burton films, this one is a real treat to watch. In fact, if you just turned the volume down and put your special glasses on, you'd be amazed at the jaw-dropping CGI. CGI gets a bad rap nowadays, as if it were always a short cut to actual acting. But here, I found the effects to be creative and wonderful to behold. Indeed, Bonham Carter and Depp have as much to do with their characters' personalities as the CGI does.It might be that the movie doesn't lend itself very easily to 3D, but I think it's more likely that the script wasn't tailored quite enough to that technology. For example, the 3D Journey to the Center of the Earth, for all of its problems, was able to integrate 3D into the plot somewhat seamlessly, with boulders and birds alike flying toward the audience. Burton's Alice in Wonderland doesn't do that quite enough for the 3D to be really worthwhile. On the other hand, the pure animation of the movie is reminiscent of Coraline, and that's a very favorable comparison indeed. Wonderland here isn't meant to be some beautiful, pristine land; it's a land damaged by the touch of the bitter Red Queen, and you get a real sense of ominous peril.On the plus side, the acting and voicing is really top notch. JOhnny Depp is always a lot of fun to watch, in my estimation, no matter how goofy his hair may be (and it's plenty odd here). Sure, he turns in the affected performance from time to time, like his Willy Wonka, but his Mad Hatter here is both vulnerable and heroic (something that perhaps Lewis Carroll hadn't envisioned). But Bonham Carter is absolutely stunning as the Red Queen. She manages to be both terrifying and hilarious at the same time. The Red Queen, full of vanity but desperate for acceptance, is at once the most charismatic character in the movie.Another down side is that it seems to take forever and a day for Alice to even get to Wonderland. I think Burton spends a little too much time with the so-called outside world, at both the beginning and the end of the movie. What Alice's life is like outside Wonderland should be only of minimal importance to this story, I think. What matters to us is what happens to her in Wonderland, how she will persevere, who will she meet, and at which sizes will she be? It's helpful to know that Alice is about to be married to a selfish brat, but we don't need to spend 20 minutes on her outside-world situation.A final debit is that the movie operates on two tracks: one is a fantastic voyage replete with beautiful and amazing creatures and things, and the other is a standard-issue save-the-downtrodden heroine plot thread. The latter could have been scripted by any number of minimum-wage screenwriters. It reminded me of all of those movies in which some plucky hero or heroine fights all odds (as well as a lack of strength and wits) and somehow defeats the evil menace. Alice is no Lara Croft; she's not even a Red Sonja. She's just a teenager who's not even sure if she's dreaming or not.Alice in Wonderland does have its moments, but it tries to hard to mix a great children's story with a mythology and magic and kidnapping and revenge and other dark themes. And beware if you take children to see this. Even though it's a PG-rated movie, the film does contain a bit of violence, in particular a scene in which a baddie gets an eye plucked out.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
go see it,"despite other opinion, go see this one. it's worth your time and money. it entertains. makes good use of the 3d thingy. and is just a hoot. okay, not quite as erudite as a one sided discussion of character arc. or sophisticated repudiation of a fantasy script. but i liked it. better by far than the last 3d i paid to see. tim burton, keep 'em coming. not that i disagree with some of the previous comments. sure willy wonka left everyone with a bad taste. but this isn't willy wonka. maybe the boardroom had too much to say about the final product. so buy stock and vote the rascals out. you don't think the actors gave it their all? well, i just can't believe that tim burton got anything but what he wanted from all concerned. i don't know what some folks wanted to see, but i sure enjoyed what i saw...i pay for the movies i see, and that makes my vote count!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing Wonderful About This Wonderland,"Pretty terrible sequel of sorts to the famous Lewis Carroll story that finds Alice returning to Wonderland years after her first adventure to do battle with the Jabberwocky and end the reign of the tyrannical Red Queen.A lot of money and some pretty decent actors are thrown up on the screen in a frenzy of special effects, production design and action sequences that are meant to distract us from how badly written and unengaging the whole thing is. Johnny Depp is given a large role as the Mad Hatter and does his standard weirdo routine for the umpteenth time. Alice is a black hole at the film's center, mostly because the actress who plays her is uber-bland. The only thing that occasionally roused me from my drowsy stupor was Helena Bonham Carter, who gives the film its only laughs as the Red Queen.At one time I thought Tim Burton had the makings of a great filmmaker. I'm not so sure anymore.....Grade: D",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent enough.,"I figured that this movie was, pretty good from the high praise it had when it first came out. So I was like ""Oh, what the hay?! Let's see it!"" I'll admit, it was pretty decent, but that was with the 3D, and special effects. I'm pretty sure it's one of those films that might drag on if I saw it with out them. Well of course what I like about this film was the special effects, the costumes, and the story wasn't too bad either. I think it will be good enough to see in the theatres just once, or rent it for when it comes out on Blu-ray and DVD. Another thing I liked was the morale of the story. It's pretty much true, in general of life.I'm not giving this a rating because I am not sure what to rate it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visual Ambrosia With a HInt of Cheese.,"I won't necessarily say this movie was horrible. I had too many high hopes prior to release to say anything close to that. At best the movie was visually stunning, captivating, and a treat for those who wanted a Zelda-esk, Final Fantasy feel. At worst this film was clichéd, predictable, Cheesy, and just plain ""Over Disneyfied"".The score was magnificent. Danny Elfman did a fantastic job at recreating musically the ebbs and flows of the film, but SADLY for the first time Tim Burton Disappointed me.Visually, other than a stunning film, there are parts of the world of Wonderland that bothered me. I didn't care if they called the place ""Underland"", ""Wonderland"", or ""Crap"". The entire place seemed more like a theme park ride promoting a Nintendo Game, rather than the creepy, sometimes extremely confusing, and daunting, zoomed in world that we remember. Now don't get me wrong. It would be impossible to make Wonderland look anything like the 1950's cartoon world, but they could have at least shot for some of that insanity. Instead the setting was too wide, and all the quirks that is wonderland became lost within the massive ever expanding Lord of the Rings type vistas and landscapes. Stunningly beautiful, but pointless and unnecessary in my opinion. There was a definite ""unreal-ism"" that seemed to be missing. If I wanted to go to Yellowstone National Park, I would.Actors are only as good as the script they are given, which is true for any movie, including this one. Carter (red queen) and Depp (mad hatter) portrayed their characters wonderfully, but some of the lines they were given were just CHEESY and AWFUL. Depp did seem to be over-channeling Jack Sparrow at times. I'm not going to sugar coat it, I thought I was watching a movie on SCi-Fi/Disney channel collaboration there for a while there. Everybody from Alice's ""real world"" of London did brilliantly in my opinion, but as soon as she fell down the rabbit hole the dialogue became skewed and left a foul taste in my mouth after a while. None of the Characters were portrayed the way they were supposed to be portrayed. The Flowers talked in only one scene, and they were all grouped together with the other characters of Wonderland. Tweedledee and Tweedledum were brilliant, but not the creepy shifty eyed characters from the original film, just fat and childish. The Cheshire Cat irritated me the most; too smart and professor-like. Where was the oddball nonsense from the original, almost purposely confusing Alice? The Characters seemed out of place, almost always shown in groups, with disneyfied Dialogue. Smiling then frowning then Smiling again, hugs, in your face emotions, BARF. Mia (Alice) was brilliant at the part, but a bit dull and clueless at her lines at times.The Plot was descent, but not good. The Helms Deep style fight sequences and over dramatization of Champions, and Swords, and Destiny's made me yawn and want to go watch Lord of the Rings again. the story was over-simplified and clearly thrown together clumsily. There is little to no character development, and the film is shot with one too many one liners. I thought I was watching several ""Alice in Wonderland"" commercials just strung together in sequence. Shame on you Tim Burton! Now why I don't just give this film a complete 2 or 3 score is this: THIS MOVIE WAS BEAUTIFUL. Not Alice in Wonderland beautiful, but beautiful in a Final Fantasy/Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter kind of way. Some, and I mean SOME of the dialogue sequences weren't horrible, and some, again emphasis on SOME, of the plot was fairly good. But overall . . . . I would wait for this one to come out of DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a Disappointment Burton's Best or most Imaginative,"I liked the character of Alice. She was a very interesting character and did really seem more like Alice when watching the film than she did when viewing the trailer. The red Queen also seemed very much queen like.Other characters felt either empty or not as interesting or right to me. Something about the Cheshire cat just didn't seem quite right, and it was weird as they all ended up having names. Also, characters (such as the white queen) seem to appear to have some form of personality, but just don't seem real or full which wouldn't be a problem if it was the original story of Alice in Wonderland but Burton tries to turn everyone into more believable characters and it didn't work too well in some cases. Not a total disaster, the Mad Hatter turned into more than just a raving lunatic obsessed with tea.Burton almost seems to give a sense of order and logic to wonderland. It's weird seeing a Tim Burton film that seems to be trying to be NORMAL instead of weird! Wonderland becomes a linear and ordered place where you can go from one spot to another with no trouble of things changing dramatically or getting lost if you turn around. It lacks the imagination and surrealist absurdity of Alice in Wonderland that it should. It starts off the same as the original and then diverges quite drastically.But it's not a failure of a film. It still had an interesting plot, a few laughs and some imagination. It's still entertaining to watch and visually was quite vivid and interesting. The CGI was not groundbreaking, but it had style. I liked the specific look that they went for and it didn't look camp or unrealistic (well yes, unrealistic as it's wonderland, but you don't go ""that's just stupid""). The ending was happy. It was good. But Burton really didn't hit the mark on this one like his previous films.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Incredible images matched by incredible performances.,"The first thing I thought of while watching the movie was, ""Boy, this movie is really moving."" Before I knew it, Alice was spiraling down the rabbit hole. I don't want to say that the beginning of the movie was rushed...but it moves. And in reality..why should we dwell on the set up for too long? Alice has nightmares...she's 19 now...she's being thrown into an engagement with a jerk...stability is falling apart around her. We get it. So, while I maintain that the films first 20 minutes or so fly by, I don't find it too be too fast that one misses any important information.The next thing that I want to move onto is...folks...this is a kids movie. It's Alice in Wonderland. So if you're expecting Sleepy Hollow, or Big Fish, or one of Burton's darker more adult themed films...just get it out of your head. With that being said..I understand Burton's ability to make masterful children's movies...aka Nightmare Before Christmas. And for some this Alice may never reach those standards. In closing this part of my review I'd just like to express how envious of the kids today who get to grow up with a version of Alice in Wonderland this creative.On with my review...this movie rocks. The performances are spot on for each character. Anne Hathaway's White Queen is a spoiled rotten hippie. Through some back story cleverly thrown into the film (not shown through constant flashbacks) we discover she clearly was the favored child growing up, the other sister being the Red Queen. As an adult she still gets everything she wants, but puts a cap on herself by following peaceful guidelines.Helena's Red Queen is pretty awesome. She's not entirely overwhelming like she could have been. There was a lot of room for her to just be a screaming b**** the whole time..but she uses her fear tactics in a more composed manner with a perfectly delivered, ""Off with there heads,"" scattered throughout. Also, her big head was awesome.Depp's Mad Hatter is amazing. I had an ""argument"" with my girlfriend where she stated that he was the same in this as in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I couldn't disagree more. Granted both are zany (yes I used the word zany) characters...Both have differences in mannerisms, voice, and depth. I've read that some people think he phones in his performance, but with roles like these there is no way that could be pulled off. His Hatter is an emotional and mental mess. He's someone who is struggling with his insanity. At times, he can laugh it off with a joke, but other times he is afraid of his madness..unsure of his ability to keep himself in control. I think His performance in this is brilliant...and I don't like to use that word a lot.Mia's Alice is another one that people are complaining about, but again, I don't agree with. People are saying she's lame or dull. That she comes across as boring and stiff. Have you ever been 19? Throughout time, it is commonly known that kids go through some changes around that age. Not like puberty...but just with becoming an adult, but still being depended on older adults around you. I think her performance was spot on. You can tell she grew throughout the story, not just because the script says so, but you can tell through her wounds, her smile, her glow, as she returns from Underland.The additional computer created characters were also incredible. They all seemed like they were actually there. Sure they obviously didn't look 100% real, but it was like watching a live action cartoon. The visual effects people did a top notch job creating this beaten world that was once magical, but has been torn apart over the years. I also need to shout out to Glover's Knave of Hearts. His intensity is apparent even while having been on stilts and having his body be computer altered. The IMAX 3D was fun. It added some perspectives and depth to the images...which is extra awesome in a Tim Burton world. But I'd say that the 3D doesn't make or break the film. Everything else in the film can stand on its own without the 3D as a crutch.Finally, the script. That is the big thing I keep reading is that it's all visual and no substance. I don't even know where that is coming from. To me...a script is bad when my focus is pulled by how terrible the dialogue is. That never happened once during this. Also, the story line is interesting to me. It's no longer Alice going from place to place being like...""Wow! I'm the only normal one here! I wanna go home"" She goes home. The End. This time they decided to make an adventure out of her trip and I thought that it was well thought out and executed.While not being Tim Burton's best work, it is far far from his worst. I was entertained and I am looking forward to seeing it again!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"8 stars, maybe because it's my first 3D experience..","My first digital 3D experience, every scene fulfilled my visual fantasies. The dramatic visual effects take you so far into another world called ""Wonderland."" Technology is advancing everyday, every decade has its own stage and style. I can see the vast improvement of film making from watching the first feature length film watching the newest jaw-dropping films of today. I know that the technology in film will continue to improve even though it doesn't need any and despite the fact that it looks so perfect right now. What will be the new thing in watching a movie after 10 years, 20 years and 50 years from now? I can't imagine such additions. Johnny Depp, again, plays an interesting character in a Tim Burton picture, this time he is wearing Mad Hatter's costume. This is not an unusual character to him, and he is so used to playing this kind of role that he does not need any effort in acting, but the thing that caught my attention from the beginning was the make-up, they did a wonderful job on Carter's Red Queen too. Looking deeper into the film, I can see that it started and ended a bit fast, I think that that's what happened to Corpse Bride too. I craved for each character's personality and identity but it is so sudden that we don't get to know them much. It was a victorious ending in the Wonderland, but I didn't feel so victorious because it is not a surprise to us that Alice will be triumphant in the end. Maybe Tim Burton lacks emotional approach to his audiences. His tricks work in some cases, but all in all something is lacking and I needed a little a bit more. Summary: The story is good and usual, but in some areas ""Alice in Wonderland"" is lacking but not visually.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's certainly not Alice, but it is still a fantastical work.","There are different types of quirkiness in this world. First there's the whimsical quirky that the best children's books seem to have. This type of quirk can be found in the Alice in Wonderland books. There's the quirkiness that's quirky just for the hell of it, something Terry Gilliam does an excellent job at. There's the everyday quirky, that can be found in some of the best comedies. Then there's the dark quirky, and this is Tim Burton's domain. Now the question is, how do you take a time-honoured masterpiece of whimsy, satire, and humour; and make it dark, morbid, and slightly disturbing? The answer is Alice.Lewis Carroll would probably like Tim Burton's movie. It's dark, just like the book, though the book's much more subtle about it. It's twisted, something Lewis Carroll delighted in doing. In fact, the whole thing seems much more related to Carroll's lesser-known novel Sylvie and Bruno, which is itself a rather dark fairytale that goes where AIW didn't go near. Tim Burton takes the books and completely reinterprets in his own masterful style.As this is NOT the happy-go-lucky Wonderland, you do not have any saccharine and neon colors. This is UNDERland, muted, sad, but every once in a while a color will pop out at you surprise you. In White Queen world, it's so white it hurts. Cherry blossoms everywhere, everything ethereal and way-too-sweet, just like Anne Hathaway as the Queen. She tries hard to be good, and she over-succeeds. When flowers droop, she asks people to talk to them more nicely. And while making a potion for Alice, she sweetly puts dead men's fingers, dead men's blood, and other assorted dead things in the boiling tonic, all the while smiling and holding her hands up daintily. She is most certainly way too happy.Then there's Red Queen land. The castle has hearts everywhere, everything is red, ranging from blood-colored to the color of a a raspberry chocolate. The moat is sticky red tar, with beheaded heads in it (Off with their heads!). The Red Queen (Bonham Carter)is cruel, using animals as servants and furniture and enslaving various characters to do her bidding, cooing at them and treating them like pets. Everyone must have something deformed about the to make her head predicament less blatant. And if someone disobeys her, she will say without a blink that phrase everyone in Underland dreads.In Underland, you will find the dormouse, brave, not sleepy at all. Who has a habit of sticking swords in monster's eyes. There's the march hare who likes to throw things. Tweedledum and Tweedledee (Nohow!), the caterpillar (a wise, but obviously drugged insect who insults Alice at every possible time), and the white hare (who is so sure it is the real Alice). Then there's the wonderful Mad Hatter (which fits Johnny Depp like a glove). Excellent acting aside, I must give props to the makeup and costumer for making this character work so well.Alice is played by the practically-unknown Mia Wasilkowska. She is pale, oh so pale, and way too independent for her age. She seems weighed down by something, there's a fierce gravity to her. She seems to fit in with the dark and brooding Underland. Even her dresses reflect her surroundings. The acting is real, and she plays a dreadfully serious Alice.Plot is alright, not as bad as it could be. But at times, it lists, at times confusing or unexplained, and sometimes generic. But the references to the books are spot-on and give you an inward smile. The screenplay needed work, but there are moments of charm, pathos, and just overall wackiness. The music is perfectly suited to the atmosphere.10/10 for visuals, 10/10 for acting, 10/10 for music, 10/10 for costumes and make-up. 7/10 for story, and 9/10 for screenplay.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Pretty Good Film,"i have to say that i quite enjoyed tim burton's quirky take on Alice in Wonderland.johnny depp gave quite the performance(albeit that some of his scenes seemed a bit too ""jack sparrow 'esque"" but thats not necessarily a bad thing.oh and Helena Bonham Carter nailed the role right in the heart! she had me in stitches at times so props to her too i really cant say that this is on my top 10 favorite movies but i can say that it is a pretty good movie.problems? actually i should have removed the (s).there really is only one major flaw in the movie and her name is Anne.cant act.Hathaway! oh my lord she single-handedly made me cringe in disgust at her shallow,one dimensional character. white princess? i hardly felt any attachment at all and i kept thinking that Alice would overthrow her at some point so i wouldn't have to gouge my eyes out! oh and the score is brilliant,just thought i'd add that in there",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
alice in wonderland,"Well since movie tickets have gotten so insanely expensive me and my family don't go to the theaters very often anymore. Being that this was directed by tim Burton it was a no brainer we went and watched it. On the way in we wer discussing how it is impossible for Burton to make a bad film. We got our tickets, and paid over 40 dollars. About 20 minutes in i realised we wer duped. it was horrible. i wanted dark alice not this stupid bubble gum alice i got. that was our movie for this month and most likely the next. 40 dallors was wasted on this trash. HORRABLE. THat being said if you have kids i would recommend RENTING it. They would probably enjoy it and not feel jipped. TIM BURTIN SHAME ON YOU.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A competent adaptation,"I have to admit that I went to watched this movie with mixed feelings, since it's critical reception in my country has been mixed and lukewarm and I suppose the critics would have been more vociferous, had they not being restrained by the glamour and respect the name of Tim Bourton commands.I personally found the movie good enough, given the fact that it visualized an allegorical fairy-tale, something like Animal Farm, therefore it's scope is by definition restricted, since no allegory however brilliant can cope with the richness and ambiguity of real life itself.Having become conciliated with watching a fairy-tale, I enjoyed it, not so much about it's overall political or social sophistication but because it contained impressive graphic work and singular, if flat, characters.First of all I learned about the dragon Juberwakee, whom I thought a product of Terry Gilliam's cinematic imagination. The dragon had the same form that it had in Gilliam's movie, only it was frightening while in the Gilliam movie it was pathetic.The Chesire cat had an aptly mischievous look, similar though to that of Woopie Goldberg in a previous adaptation of the fable. I recognized the voice of Alan Rickman in Abessalom, familiar from Harry Potter's Professor Snape. Mat Lucas, of Poppetown fame was the voice of the mutually contradictory twins.I liked Johny Depp as the Mad Hatter, although he must be an exception in cinematic history, since he became a huge star portraying quizzical characters and thus refuting Dr.Johnson's dictum that ""nothing odd would last"".In this movie he stays loyal to the quizzical tradition he has created.Ann Hathaway is the good White Queen rather feeble compared with her sister the evil Red Queen, played by Helena Bonam Carter. Both are flat characters, although the mannerisms of evil are rather more memorable but I think is a generic problem since goodness like happiness does not create such a spectacular impression as their opposites.The sidekick, paramour and protégé of the Red Queen, was evil as well as slimy and even a traitor to his own benefactress. I think his morals were the worse of all the personages of the movie and that was vividly portrayed in the acting.The graphic work was competent and it even made the card-soldiers of the Red Queen look quite menacing.Also very able was the presentation of her obsequious and sycophantic courtiers.A peculiar problem that I had was with the language and I think it applies to any viewer whose language is not English. The word-plays and innuendos in English were mostly lost in the translation-subtitles and I could not understand their content in English unless I saw them written in English, which was not the case.The characters of the people which referred to the real world, were Victorian ladies and gentlemen, rather stuffy or even ridiculous, the suitor of Alice, for example.What I found curious is that the moral that Alice extracted from her adventure in Wonderland, was not a lesson in goodness or meekness, in the lines of her patroness there, the White Queen, but a vindication of Victorian commercial imperialism.In the final scene of the movie, Alice back in the real world, takes her place as the heir of her father, who was an enterprising merchant on the grand scale, deciding to continue and further his venture of overseas trade, renewing the partnership with a partner of her late father. We see scenes of goods travelling in far away eastern lands and Alice furthers her father's venture, proposing trading relations even as far as China, an idea with perhaps modern connotations in mind. I admit that I had never considered the Alice novels as moral justifications of the ""white man's burden"", or as educational tools for those destined to inherit and further imperial responsibilities.In general I found the movie not bad at all and less ""dark"" than some Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or late Harry Potter movies-if we stay within the domains of books for the young that were adapted to films.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More for kids than adults,"This was an OK movie. I wish Tim Burton would make a good movie because after all, he is very morbid. However, this movie plays out more like a kids movie than anything. Gone are the days of Beatlejuice and the like. I like the part of this movie where there were special effects. In otherwords, most of the entire movie. I hated the way the white queen moved around gracefully and I hated the cards who looked like Cylons. I did like Tweetle Dee and tweetle Dumb because they looked so expressive. I liked the way the queen had a big head and that one scene where the Catapillar blows pipe smoke was funny. I didn't think Johnny Depp's character was dark enough. There were a few scenes where his voice changed but there was really no violence. I mean, that queen yelled OFF WITH THEIR HEAD over 10 times but I never saw any blood.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice in Hollywoodland. The Sequel,"Alice returns to Wonderland following the clock-ticking nicely attired rabbit. However all that she remembers from her previous encounter is in the form of vivid dreams. This time around Alice is brought back as a saviour of the realm corrupted by the madness of the Red Queen. The land has fallen into ruin and the blood-hungry rule has blocked out the joy. Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has been patiently waiting at his tea party for the return of Alice. However Alice has grown and forgotten, which throws doubt among the other dwellers of Wonderland as to her true identity... Only the Mad Hatter casts away any doubt...The moment I heard that this movie was being crafted by no other than Tim Burton one thought instinctively came to mind: Here is the person born to make Alice come to the big screen. Coupled with the tremendous talent of his two muses: Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter I held the distinct feeling that this may yet be Burton's masterpiece. Sadly after an inspiring start to the movie it all goes downhill with the aid of dumb-downed comedy punches, thickly spread saviour plot and conventional Hollywood type story-build. This movie is a far cry from what Coraline managed to achieve - a relatively wacky story delivered in a new murky-dark package accessible for kids and adults alike.After the initial awe of the world into which Alice has been thrown you slowly settle in to the story itself. Similarly as with Avatar the plot just does not do itself justice. Instead of crafty and wacky we have a sub-par Sunday movie plot. The two stars of the picture - Helena Bonham-Carter and Johnny Depp do their best to make the movie different and refreshing, but Mad Hatter is severely overused and well... not mad enough (I actually had the impression that Mad Hatter was faking his madness).The ending of the movie is rushed and bordering on insulting. I agree we don't need a Return of the King ending, but plot solution was handled extremely poorly. It could have been excused in a movie from a lesser director, but I feel Burton probably got trampled over by his producers with the ending to make it sweet, pretentious and dumb.What didn't help me in the slightest is the Polish dubbing of the movie I watched. Especially the local Polish comedy actor (Czarek Pazura) dubbing Depp is appalling.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Alice back in Wonderland, but not entirely wonderful","Tim Burton films guarantee you 2 things: 1. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are likely to be found in the cast list. 2. There will be a Gothic undertone to it.But for me also Burton has this tendency to be a bit hit or miss. And Alice in Wonderland sort of falls between the two this time around*Warning, minor spoilers ahead*Firstly, although the 3d was a nice extra there really was no need for the 3d. OK, this could be the argument for any film now in 3d, but unlike say Avatar this film really did not blend it in seamlessly. There were moments where it felt like the 3d enhanced a scene, like when the hat was thrown, etc. But in general felt far more gimmicky than some films using it have.Visually the mood and the setting was brilliant, it was supposed to be a dying Underland and it felt like just that. The CGI of the scenes could be argued to be too cartoony, but this is a dream like world and that idea of being so far detached from our reality that Alice never at any time believes it to be anything but a dream.Keeping with the CGI the characters who were heavily created by this medium were also very crisp and believable, even the almost putty like tweedle Dee and tweedle dumb. The level of CGI characters also helped with the use of varying sizing of characters throughout the film.On the sizing front I personally thought this was a feather in the cap to subtlety with an extraordinarily difficult thing to do in film. The argument again could be it was almost showing off, but at no time was there a size issue with Alice that didn't make sense, and as such it worked nicely.The characters in the main worked too, with Alice being a very solid character playing the dazed and yet independent lead. Depp is Depp, its almost like he is ad libbing his role and the rest of the script is written around it, but I really cannot fault his portrayal of the Hatter. The March Hare was comedy gold for me, as this is meant to hold some juvenility to it being a child's story. The Red queen was an impression of Queeny from Blackadder II but this was fitting to her attitude and mannerisms. The white queen was almost parody in itself with the deliberate stance she took continually of this pure and graceful person. Even the Knave of Hearts had value to the flow of the taleAnd now to the said story itself. It was nicely woven as a nod to elements of what it was supposed to be a sequel of, but somehow it was almost like the premise outweighed the plot line they had decided apon. It was like Burton and the writers had thought 'what a wonderful idea, bringing Alice back to Wonderland now I suppose we need a point to her return big dragon to slay? Yeah, that'll do, lets get some lunch.'My apologies for the negativity, but I did feel like I was more interested in each individual character (Fry's Cheshire cat was the best of the bunch for me, and Rickman as the Blue Caterpillar? A masterstroke!) than the final scene. But of course when I criticise the plot thread I try to think of what might have worked better, and alas I really couldn't think of anything beyond maybe this novice fighter Alice showing that courage by standing up to the bully of the Red Queen, which may have felt more honest as a finish, but would have never been as epic as a final scene as the Jabberwocky's involvement. I did also find the last part back in reality to be very much a 'lets wrap this up guys, we have a plane to catch!' sort of speed But ultimately more necessary than just ending it without it, so I cannot really write a better conclusionSo all in all, the film was slid but really the premise was on a higher plain than the plots spine, and as such it suffers a little in the rating from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun but...eh...,"I was prepared to love this movie. I love Burton and I am a Depp fan too...but it just left me feeling...meh.

Just left me a little flat on the whole.I guess I was expecting more. Maybe if it had been all CG or Animatronics, it would have worked better.I did not see the 3D version.

Too much Tim Burton in a Tim Burton movie.,"I was very excited about this film prior to it's release, it went something like this:Tim Burton's making Alice in Wonderland: ""Sounds great!""Johnny Depp is playing the Mad Hatter: ""Oh, that's alright; it's a small part""The majority of the film will be filmed on a green screen: ""Oh...well that's can work. It worked for 300.""All of my initial reactions were wrong. I severely disliked it. Tim Burton has, for years, walked the thin line of CGI vs. reality very well. This is part of what makes him such a successful fantasy-filmmaker, but BOY did he drop the ball on this one.A lot of people have complained about the excess of CGI and, believe me, this fear is entirely justified. Nothing in the film looks real. Matt Lucas' Tweedle Dee & Dumb look positively cartoony. Several characters are CGI'd when they don't even need to be. The Bandisnatch is an entirely unrealistic-looking animal. Seriously, I could go on for hours. The 3D adds a small level of realism to it and I'll admit that the smoke effects work well when you're watching it through the glasses, but it pretty-much ends there.Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, *sigh*. Depp's performance isn't horrible, with the exception of the Scottish accent...which was just bizarre. However, his face kept reminding me of Marilyn Manson, particularly the eyes. I found it very hard to like his character in the way that Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka were likable. With a new look and no Scottish accent the Mad Hatter could have been fun to watch.Danny Elfman's score was lacking severely. There's nothing recognizably ""Elfmanish"" about it. It has no recognizable themes or glorious moments. Thumbs down on all musical fronts.Now I will say one thing about it that was brilliant: Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat; he's amazing. Not because he did anything particular new with the character, but simply because Stephen Fry IS the Cheshire Cat. The animation and character design of the cat was spot on and I loved every moment he was on screen.That's it really. Tim, learn from your mistakes! I know you can do better than this. Let's bring things a bit more down to earth for your next film. Just because madness is a theme of Alice in Wonderland doesn't mean the audience has to go mad watching it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Curtsey While You're Thinking What to Say - It Saves Time,"As an ""Alice"" purist I generally cringe at the assortment of attempts to adapt either of Lewis Carroll's works ""Alice in Wonderland"" and/or ""Through the Looking Glass"" to the movie screen. These have been of varying quality but even the best are no more than satisfactory (""Dreamchild"" being an exception but it was more about the real Alice than about the Wonderland Alice).But I had a pretty good idea what I was getting into before shelling out the bucks to see this Burton effort in 3-D. I knew that despite what many have said and despite its title, this is not an adaptation of Carroll's books. Accordingly I knew that this would greatly increase my toleration level. They could do what they liked with the traditional characters and play around with whatever sort of plot elements intrigued them; I would not take particular offense.That said I had no real problem with anything about the film. In Burton and writer Linda Woolverton's story, Alice revisits Wonderland/The Looking Glass House 13 years after waking up from her original dreams. Alice, now almost 20, is attending her sister's garden party, which she discovers is intended to be her engagement party. Cringing at a marriage proposal from the unappealing son of her father's former business partner, she runs from the party and follows a white rabbit down an immense hole.Her seemingly endless fall is arguably the best scene of the film and is by far the best Hollywood has ever assembled; even including a slick twist at the bottom where her hair is standing on end. Then she repeats the drink-me eat-me shrinking-growing bit from the book. And these two sequences are pretty much the only thing other than the characters that come directly out of the book. One advantage of having a 20-year-old Alice is that her clothes do not shrink or grow with her size changes. She must improvise on each occasion and this adds a touch of physical comedy to the transformations.For her part Alice seems to have suppressed the memory of her two childhood dreams, showing little familiarity with the characters she is meeting for a second time (in some cases a third time). And initially they are unsure that she is the same Alice who visited them over a decade earlier. But for the white rabbit, the dormouse, the Tweedles, and the smoking caterpillar she has be the right Alice because they have lured her back to fulfill a prophecy. It has been foretold that Alice will slay the Jabberwocky (a dragon worthy of the lizards in the old 50's sci-fi films) with a magical sword. This will change the balance of power, with the good White Queen getting the crown from the wicked Red Queen. We've seen this thing before, insert: ""Narnia, Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings"" here. And they throw in a few visuals from ""The Neverending Story"" series.Ultimately Alice goes all ""Joan of Arc"" or at least ""Jane and the Dragon"" and becomes a knight in armor. Many have lamented this action adventure turn of the story but the actual showdown takes only about 10 minutes so I don't think it is that big of a deal. And it has some considerable basis as Alice had been the White Queen's Pawn (because the Queen's daughter Lily was too young to play) throughout the chess match in ""Through the Looking Glass"". That story was just one big chess game with a lengthy combat segment between the White Knight and the Red Knight, as well as a fight between the ""Gladstone"" Lion and the ""Disraeli"" Unicorn for the crown. The only problem I see is that the combat is all too predictable.Burton's film has many delightful moments; I liked it better than almost any of the recently released big budget stuff although it's not in the same league as ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Atonement"".Mia Waisikowska strikes a perfect balance as the title character, playing the bravest heroine in literary history requires a lot of nonverbal stuff and she sells her reluctance nicely along with giving her character a subtle sensual dimension.Helena Bonham Carter pretty much steals the film, although she is upstaged on occasion by the grinning Cheshire cat. Depp's Mad Hatter never quite comes into focus, playing the character as a schizophrenic (at least that's what I assume he was doing) introduced a little too much pain into this type of story; in much the same way that his take on Willy Wonka just brought the viewer down. A run-of-the-mill lunatic would worked better.As the White Queen, Anne Hathaway was pretty much irrelevant and was most likely cast because of her ""small"" head (her features seem to take up her entire face-especially with the extreme make-up), a kind of good-guy bad-guy balance for her evil sister's big head. But I did like the off-kilter Morticia Addams take she gave her character; rather than playing her as a goody-two-shoes.The audience during my showing was attentive and entertained from beginning to end (well almost to the end as the film goes out on a couple of extremely weak scenes back on the surface). But most bolted before the closing credits, which played over Avril Lavigne singing ""Alice"" (Avril also appears in the film's trailer). Given that it is mostly up-scale theaters with state-of-the-art sound systems showing this film, those who left missed one of the best moments of the whole viewing experience. Not unlike those who missed the great closing credits animation sequences at the end of ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"".Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
full circle,"OK, so Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is really over-the-top, and basically an ego trip for Burton. But it is really neat to watch (especially in 3-D, like I saw it). By now, you've probably heard that it's set ten years after the original story, and Alice (Mia Wasikowska of ""Defiance"") returns to Wonderland to find that her destiny is to slay the Jabberwocky on Frabjous Day.Obviously, they can't totally recreate the book's spirit, especially since they're changing the story a little bit. But Burton's version retains Lewis Carroll's sensibility more than Disney's 1951 animated feature (which went too much for being cute, and not enough for being irreverent).The best character is definitely Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. Of course, I wouldn't expect anything less from Depp. Almost as good is Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous Red Queen. Most of the cast is composed of a who's who of UK cinema*, with some token Americans (Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, and Crispin Glover as the Knave of Hearts).Overall, the movie is exaggerated almost to the point of being sort of silly, but that's appropriate for this sort of movie. I certainly liked it.*To be precise, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman, Imelda Staunton, Timothy Spall, and even two cast members from the Hammer movies (Christopher Lee and Michael Gough).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Usual Tim Burton, but even that gets old eventually","First off, I was perplexed at the onset of this film as to why Burton decided to use the expensive 3D architecture to produce this film. Honestly, it could have worked fine in 2D seeing very little of the film took advantage of the technology. Most film by Burton can be classified dark, but with a bit of jocularity that keeps the film entertaining. I was disappointed that there really wasn't much levity in this film. The overall fingerprint of the plot was war: Why does one got to war? To what ends will it inevitably bring? A crown? Loyal subjects? Money? Power? Okay, one queen had secret weapons, and the other queen is waiting for their savior. Wonder who is coming to dinner? Burton arranges for his favorite players once again, but there are some fresh faces as well, such as the relatively unknown Mia Wasikowska - who by the way, plays an excellent older Alice. Depp is given his freedom to develop his cast character even to the initial painting he did of the character he played. Helena plays a wonderful queen, but her cheek is not all that unfamiliar when comparing it to her role in the Potter films. I felt even though the cast played on favorites, they worked well in this stylized edition of Lewis Carrol's books. Technically, as I already mentioned, this film could have been done with a lot less money had Burton omitted the 3D cameras. Putting on the glasses after having been completely immersed in Camerons beautiful Pandoran environment just didn't satisfy the desire to have a presentation of something new. Being one of the first CGI films that Burton has produces (Being a staunch supporter of stop-action camera techniques over computer generated animation), he wasted no time extrapolating and exaggerating his cast characters into solid cartoon format. The color is dark, the shading is deep and rich; but I just don't know if it is enough to keep people coming back after the DVD is released to watch it more that a couple more times before it ends up on CraigsList. I'm sad to say I would be fine watching this on my home theater had I the option of paying $10 to see a matinée which included a $3 disposable 3D glass charge (I am slowly obtaining an impressive collection of fat, black plastic 3D movie glasses). It was fun, but it just wasn't quite ""There"". Don't get me wrong... I like Burton's work and haven't really missed anything he's directed big or small. I just can't go the distance with this, although I truly wish I could have. -B",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Visually Appealing, But With A Lackluster Plot","Some will be disappointed by Burton's attempt at Wonderland, while others will simply be satisfied by it's simple charm and wondrous visuals. I am in the latter category. While others may have been taken in immensely by this rendition, I was not one who got terribly excited about the film. My expectations were somewhat low, as Burton hasn't quite delivered on a few of his more recent excursions. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how entertained I was with the film, particularly in the lead, someone new to me who I quite enjoyed.Certainly, it should come as no surprise that the new Alice looks great. There are a many wonderful things to see. I did, however, take issue with a few scenes that looked a little too animated. It made me wonder if this could have been a 3D animation as opposed to a live action that was quite heavy on the special fx. But, the problem evaporates quickly as the film progresses. Burton's typical goth style is in play here, with a Wonderland that is decaying from being abused by the Queen of Hearts. Adding to the visual scenery are several enjoyable characters, most notably Depp and Carter, playing the Madd Hatter and the Queen of Hearts respectively, but this world is full of wonderful characters, from the white rabbit to the march hare to tweedle dee and tweedle dumb. It's a great assortment of characters every bit as wonderful as one would remember them.Unfortunately, the film is not much more memorable than its performances and scenery. The plot is very much straight forward and all emotional cues are obvious and unmoving. There is a humanity here, but you simply don't care much. In fact, I found the Red Queen, despite her vicious, child like behavior, to be the most relatable. There is a certain sadness, though she is quite mad, and in a way you feel sorry for her. Most other characters, even Alice, are fairly ordinary and there's not a lot of gray to them. It's almost as if they are a little too likable for their own good. Which is a real shame, because Wonderland is such a wonderful place.This is certainly not a huge comeback for Burton. Just another in a long line of okay films that pale in comparison to his past days of Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and Ed Wood. Burton should really be doing more projects like those, where he added a touch of his own dark originality, even to an already told story. If he doesn't start treading some unfamiliar territory, his best days may just be behind him.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Alice in wonderland meets ""The Chronicles of Narnia""","I loved the original ""Alice in Wonderland"" book of Lewis Carroll. I also liked the adaptation made by Disney in 1951, and the dark version made by Jan Svankmajer in 1988. And Tim Burton, being a very talented filmmaker seemed to be (At first) the best choice for director for adapting one of the most influential fantasy books ever written.However, the final result is somewhat disappointing, mostly because this is not one literal-adaptation, but a completely new story inspired in the original tale. But, to be completely honest, the result wasn't entirely bad.Actually,I consider that ""Alice in Wonderland"" was a decent, entertaining film for the whole family. But a more one faithful adaptation of the original story would have been something much better.This version done by Tim Burton is closer to ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" rather than the original book, but it still worked very well. It was very funny to watch, like most of the films directed Tim Burton (Despite the ugly and unappealing CGI) and all the actors make a great work with their new version of the classic characters.Don't expect this to be a faithful adaptation of the original book, otherwise you will be very disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
World Premiere of Alice in Wonderland,"I was privileged to be able to see Alice in Wonderland tonight, and it is probably one of the best films I have ever seen!The 3D effects were second to none, totally awe-inspiring and the film flowed perfectly throughout.The casting was perfect! No-one else could possibly have been cast as the Mad Hatter other than Johnny Depp and it was absolutely fantastic to see so many British actors and actresses cast alongside some of Hollywood's greats. Most notably Matt Lucas as Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dee was inspired!As it is rated a PG I wouldn't recommend taking children younger than 8 anyway, it can be scary in places and unfortunately some people had taken younger children who ended up a little upset.....Very much a movie to be viewed on the ""big screen"" so don't delay and see it next Friday when it goes on public release.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Maybe it's time for Burton and Depp to find themselves new friends.,"Watching Tim Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND was a lackluster experience, and stands for now as probably the most charmless film the director's made. Plotted as a semi-sequel to the original story, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns several years after her first visit down the rabbit-hole to Wonderland where she meets up with plenty of adventurous creatures who remembers her. Sadly, Wonderland is all scattered between the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter lending her voice and her face on a huge animated head) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), and Alice is the only one able to get things right by dueling the Red Queen's vicious dragon Jabberwocky. Out of all the creatures Alice encounters (and at a certain time it feels like there's too many to handle), none of them are especially funny or amusing, and the film falls fatally when the plot turns page after page and gets rhythmically less and less interesting before it finishes with a incredibly dull climax. There's no further interest in character than fine costume and make-up (or in most cases, mediocre animations), and ironically on the occasion that the Mad Hatter's (Johnny Depp) past is revealed, it ruins his loony and screwy characteristics by humanizing him. I watched it in terrible and irritating 3D (this will be the last time), and were given a neat surprise when removing the 3D-glasses to find the entire screen blurry and off-colored, which seemed closer to author Lewis Carroll's hallucinatory vision than Tim Burton ever got.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved this film!,"I knew going into this film that it would not be the same Alice story that Lewis Carroll wrote, but rather a reinterpretation of the story. SyFy did their own modern day version of Alice that had a similar feel to it as well, but not quite as fantastical. I truly enjoyed Tim Burton's take on the story, and can't see how anyone wouldn't fall in love with it. The writing was excellent, the graphics vivid, the costumes to die for. And the story itself has such parallels with the real world itself. It just takes an intuitive mind to read into the story enough to see them. It's not just Alice in Wonderland. It's Alice in Underland, the land underneath everything. It's just a brilliant film, and the 3D aspect makes it literally pop off the screen. I urge you to disregard the bad reviews and see it for yourself. The old Alice in Wonderland story was a silly tale of fantasy, and this one adds just a touch of darkness, as only Burton can imagine.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a long-lasting fairy tale:Alice in wonderland,"Alice in wonderland is a story that has existed since our childhood. When I was a child, I have to imagine the scene and the characters by myself, because there are only a few pictures in the book, never can I foresee that someday, there will be a movie about it, needless to say in a 3D version. No sooner was the movie published did I went to see it, one reason is that I would like to know how they transfer a simple story into a one hour movie, another reason is that I like Ann Hathaway a lot, I think she is a great actress, not only is she pretty but also skilled in acting. When finishing the film, I think there are some differences in the story, the scenes are sometimes not so optimistic, even scary to me! Maybe it's because those movement and monsters are shown too vividly. Since I like Ann Hathaway a lot, I expected her to appear very often in the movie; however, it did not. All in all, it is still a pretty nice movie to entertain yourself, also to see the changes between the first time you read it in your childhood, and also this time, when we're a grown up already. To me I found myself enjoying the movie a lot, but also kind of disappointed, because it is not so a fulfilled movie as I imagine, which means, the theme itself is not so meaningful, anyway, I consider it a movie just to call back my memories, so just forget the knowledge part, and let my memories revise.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
this two think they can get away whit anything,"at the end it feels like if they were just throwing ideas at each other, both being convinced that anything they could show us wold be greeted without questioning. from the beginning the music is boring, the images are nice, the acting is bad except for the red queen who seems to be the only one whit faith in the film. also, to be fair, the main actress gives a good performance. the main problem is the story, the development is clumsy, the ending is childish. the least burtonian film ever.

I'll wait for the next one. but right now, after just watching the damn thing, I'm using whiskey and Tarantino to get me rid of the flavor this film has left in my tongue",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mediocre,"I finally got to see Burton's Alice In Wonderland and I really wonder what all the fuzz is about. The film isn't nearly as good as Burton's best work, but it isn't nearly as bad as some claim it is either. Although he seems to have past the peak of his career, Tim Burton at least managed to turn a horrible script in a mediocre but visually appealing film film and while it's a shame Alice wasn't the masterpiece it could have been (especially if it was based on the American McGee game) I don't think it deserves to get all the hate it gets either.If you're a fan of the original book, the famous Disney cartoon version or the American McGee computer game you're probably going to be disappointed for the lost opportunities in this film, but if you like Burtons sense of aesthetics it's still a pleasant film to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a mad mad mad good world,"Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is actually a sequel of sorts (think Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"", only much better) which again sees Alice go down the rabbit hole but imagines it in a completely different way. Linda Woolverton's script is like a blending of Lewis Carroll's books with ""Lord of the Rings"", which is actually a bit like ""Chronicles of Narnia"", only much darker and more eccentrically fun. Enough with the comparisons! What I'm trying to say is ""Alice in Wonderland"" brings an excitement to the fairytale that I've not seen in a long time. Mia Wasikowska does a superb job as Alice, now a teen being forced into marriage. She runs off and falls down the rabbit hole and into a strange world of talking rabbits, caterpillars, and Tweedle-dees and Tweedle-Dums. There are also dangerous creatures as well, like a humongous dragon that Alice is prophesized to fight in order to save wonderland. The evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) has taken over wonderland from her sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), and plunged it into darkness. The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has taken this especially hard and gone a bit loco (more so I guess). Is this all a dream? Has Alice been here before? Alice eventually must learn to come into her own as a hero and help the white queen and the other creatures beat the Red Queen or all will be lost, starting with their heads. This is thrilling stuff made predictably better by Burton and his production team. This is a wonderland scorched black by evil that still manages to keep a Gothic beauty (the make-up and costume design is perfect), a disturbing darkness (the red queen's castle is surrounded by a lake filled with dead heads) and eccentricity (the red queen's abnormally huge head and little body was a favorite of the characters). The cast is also game. Depp gives a surprisingly sweet-natured performance that erratically shifts into a crazy little giggle or Scottish accent on occasion, but he is wisely made a supporting player here. Wasikowska is the real find, as the conflicted and spirited Alice, probably one of the best female heroines to come around in a while. Hathaway is pure elegance as the white queen and Bonham Carter seems to be having the most fun as the queen of mean. It's also nice to see Crispin Glover, doing what he does best as the red queen's sinister henchman. Burton again makes the fairy-tale his own. I loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim & Johnny I won't buy you this time.,"Dear Tim,I really like your style, your way of chew stories and create masterpiece, BUT this time there's was something wrong with the plot, 3D is boring to my self till it won't be better, but this doesn't matter, PLOT was not good at all, not coherent with the original, not strong and not convincing.THEN... no one talked about Alice character: I mean where was her curiosity???? NOT AT ALL. I'm so disappointed with Alice character cause She didn't express love for the world she most love, she was just ""use to it"" which I don't buy, Alice was Use to it, but not just that, she loves her world, she would forget the real one for that.The Screenplay: I didn't like the ""I'm in a dream"" so often, We all know that it WASN'T just a dream, and Pinko Panko and Panko Pinko dialogs... what a shame! Not funny.Photography: The only thing I like, good, simple and smart.Editing: Man, I would get some SPEED.Johnny: Johnny poor Johnny, as my girlfriend just said, we are tired about ""no sex"" character, The MAd Hatter was boring, predictable and depressed.I liked Anne Hatway, I loved her here, She is the star in a dark sky.In the end, I'm afraid this was not what I was expecting and I pray Tim not to get into projects he's not personally involved emotionally, I won't say Tim Burton loved Alice in Wondderland as much as I do, so please next time, just stay out of it.Thank you.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A crazy delight from the master of inventive and creative film-making.,"Alice in Wonderland is one of those movies which shows Tim Burton still has what it takes to survive the world of cinema filled with huge special effects and action in almost every movie. It has the usual dark tone which is seen in just about every movie Tim Burton makes while also being a fun and creative kind of crazy (even for Alice in Wonderland).I guess you could say it was kind of a sequel to the story of Alice in Wonderland we've all heard. It's been 13 years since Alice has been in Wonderland, she is now 19 and thinks that Wonderland was a nightmare she had as a little girl. Like her father she is a thinker of things that seem impossible. Alice is being told what to do by everyone to where it seems that her voice has no matter in her own life. After being proposed to by a man she has no feelings for she once again falls down the rabbit hole. When in Wonderland she learns that there are many things she has to do to try and stop the Red Queen's reign of terror once and for all. She meets up with some of her old friends along with new on this amazing new concept for the classic story.Burton has done it again with Alice in Wonderland. There many very talented actors playing roles that are almost perfect for them. Even though I haven't seen it in 3D I already know that it would be a lot of fun to see it that way from what I saw from the 2D version. This is one of those Tim Burton movies that you would just love to see over and over again with the fun characters, amazing special effects and great battle sequences, Burton has done it once again.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could've been something to remember; but we will all just forget.,"If you don't mind to see Carroll's classic books torn apart, if you like CGI and films like Narnia, go watch this movie. You are going to have the best of times. The characters are lovable (even the ultra mean Red Queen), the CGI is beautiful and it has some of that Tim Burton feel we all like. Sadly, only SOME of it... the deeper meaningful part of Tim Burton is not here. This movie ends up feeling like an action film...Now, if you are looking for the real deal: Lewis Carrol nonsense magic. Forget it. This is too 'hollywoodesque' for you. I really hated how they disfigured the Mad Hatter. And it's not Johnny Depp (he actually makes it entertaining) it's the screenplay. This movie (this sequel) has very little to do with the books, and even with Disney's cartoon adaptation. Yes, it has all the original characters and situations, but the characters appear almost all together, with no sense of pace, and some of them are completely wrong (Mad Hatter, oh my god what was that!, the Dormouse...). And the situations were changed to get some nice screenplay to make a movie for people just wanting to hang there, eat pop corn and have some fun. I did like the vibe of the Cheshire Cat, the Red Queen, and, at the beginning, the Blue Caterpillar.So... I didn't like the movie. It's not bad at all, it's entertaining but... you know. It's just another movie. I think Burton made a big mistake here. It could've been magical if he just used the original book. It could have been something to remember; but we will all just forget. Carroll's writing was excellent and there was no need to try to beat him or disfigure his work. Disfigure sounds about right.7.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Typical of Burton, the wonder is in the visuals.","The world inside Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland is populated by angular characters who only exist to display their oddities. You never feel that they exist before Alice gets there. The challenge for Tim Burton is to open up that great book and extend its very limited characters into a story that we care about. That challenge comes from the nature of Carroll's writing. The most charming thing about ""Alice in Wonderland"" were the songs, the poems and the dances of lyrical nonsense. Those things are difficult to bring off the page, so what we are left with, in almost every version of this story, is a circus of odd creatures who are little more than irritations for Alice.In the new film version, director Tim Burton has done himself a favor by progressing the story a decade and allowing characters that we are already familiar with to tell a new story. Tim Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland is, in effect, a sequel. It picks up 13 years later, when Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska) is now 19 and flowering into young womanhood. She lives within the 19th century Victorian society but not of it. That is why she is about to be engaged to a hook-nosed stiff named Hamish (Leo Bill) who wouldn't know a knock-knock joke if it fell on him.Alice has been convinced since childhood that her adventures in Wonderland were all a bizarre dream. Yet, it has left her with an abstract mind. She has no use for the stiff-upper class social demands that surround her. We can see in her eyes that the so-called dreams still consume her.At her engagement party, she follows a familiar white rabbit a long, long, long way down a very long hole until she lands smack-dab in the middle of Wonderland. Yet, Wonderland isn't all that we imagined it to be. It is drab, dreary with rundown buildings and an overcast sky. That has to do with a change in the seat of power. The Red Queen of Hearts (Helena Bonham-Carter, sporting an over-sized head) has taken over and all life and color have been sucked out of the land.The familiar occupants of Wonderland are there. There's the feisty door mouse (voice of Barbara Windsor); The avuncular Caterpillar (voice of Alan Rickman); The March Hare (voice of Paul Whitehouse); The perfectly pleasant Tweedle Twins (Matt Lucas). The movie does not waste a lot of time introducing these characters because, based on the nature of the script, it assumes that we already know who they are. They enlist Alice's help to slay the evil Jabberwocky (voice of Christopher Lee) and knock the queen off her throne. The problem is, Alice doesn't remember having ever been in Wonderland the first time. She is still convinced that this is all nightmare, and expects to simply wake up at any moment.Burton, working from a screenplay by Linda Wooverton (who also contributed to Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King), tightens down the plot which, I think, keeps the characters from really coming to life. They all have their eccentricities but they form a collective, and no one ever really has a moment to shine. The charm of the book was that the plot was loose enough to allow these characters room to play.The exception is Johnny Depp, who occupies the role of The Mad Hatter from head to toe. Most actors would have played this as a costume role but Depp - as he always does - dives headfirst into this material, and takes it as seriously as the character will allow. With his deathly white skin, his frightful frizz on red hair and his unhealthy green eyes, he resembles a character who looks sick beyond repair - kind of a radioactive Ronald McDonald. Yet, Depp's rendition of The Hatter is slightly more sympathetic then I remember from the book and it is a nice turn.I was also impressed by Mia Wasikowska, as Alice. She takes the role seriously, but wears just enough amusement on her face to be in Wonderland but not of it. She thinks it is all a dream and accepts it at face value. She is an expressive actress who plays Alice with a note of irritation. She convinces herself that this Wonderland business is all a dream and seems frustrated that it is taking so long to wake up. Trapped in a power struggle between The Red Queen, and her sister, the fluttery White Queen (Ann Hathaway) there are enough sights and sounds to keep her in therapy for years but she takes it all in stride.That power struggle, by the way, gives us the film's weak point. While the early scenes examine Wonderland in all its eccentric fun, the third is a let-down. It turns into a standard battle between good and evil that only achieves the goal of wrapping up the story. Burton doesn't even take advantage of the fact that the battle between the armies of Red and White are taking place on a chess board - it looks like a grey-coaled version of Braveheart. Ho hum.My problem with Burton's films always lie at the screenplay level. He is a visual master and here he creates Wonderland under siege. The outlying regions look drab and grey while the Red Queen's castle is a masterwork of reds and whites and lush greens. By comparison, it is far more appealing than the castle of the white queen which is washed out in white as if the place is waiting for the painters to arrive. Yet his screenplay suffers by tying up its plot in a standard action story. Surely there must be far more craziness to run these characters through than a battle to the death with a deck of cards.Jerry Roberts",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Burton delivers Burton but no real ""heart"" in his Alice in Wonderland.","While Tim Burton can always promise his unique sense of style and aesthetic in every cinematic endeavor he undertakes, he rarely produces work that has real ""heart"". Such is the case for his version of Alice in Wonderland. Where the movie really succeeds is in it's rich costuming and set dressing as well as stellar performances by Burton's real-life wife, Helena Bonham Carter who plays the large headed Red Queen as well as Mia Wasikowska who plays Alice. The film's character design closely mimics the creepy illustrations (which are in alignment with Burton's creepy sensibility) from Lewis Carrol's original publishing of the book done by John Tenniel. I'm typically a huge Johnny Depp fan but just like his performance in the recent Charlie & the Chocolate factory, I think he missed the mark with this overcooked (<--speaking of his look) and underdone (<--speaking of his acting choices) character. Most of the other characters fell flat and Crispin Glover (Back to the Future & Beowulf) was just as creepy as he is in almost every role he's ever played. As far as special effects and CG, I suspected my recent viewing of Avatar would colored my view of this movie and I indeed found the ""Phantom Menace"" CG sets too unreal and ""video-game-like"" to suspend my belief. Also, I think that the choice to make the film 3D was more of a marketing afterthought (my assumption is based on the fact that all the 3D was done in post-production) and ironically most of it fell flat for me literally speaking. I would not recommend this movie to kids under 12 based on some of the more gruesome (although not really graphic) visuals having to do with beheading and the like. Having ripped the movie a new one, I don't hesitate to recommend adding this to your Netflix queue. There were some great scenes and moments throughout that I really did enjoy and the storyline is much closer to the original books than the original Disney cartoon was. However, don't expect the same warm fuzzy feeling that other movies under the Disney name have given audiences throughout the years. If you're a Tim Burton fan I recommend seeing it at the IMAX in 3D, otherwise I'd wait 12 weeks for the DVD release.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pointless,"How do you cinematize a literary masterpiece? Now, don't assume I'm one of those purists who'll never be satisfied.Burton could have done one or more of the following things:1) Reproduce the original.2) Create a new, ""parallel universe"" story that captures the same degree of subversiveness as the original.3) Modify the original to taste, but imbue Carroll's original images with a new power.Burton did not repro the original.He created a sort of storybook pastiche using the characters and a few scenarios from the original. But the subversion he engineers (Alice emerging to transcend the demands of class and status) is puny and tame compared to the big dogs that Carroll takes on.In a few, few instances, Burton did actually sort of grab me by the throat and make me see the depths of an original, Carrollian, image.For instance, when we first encounter the tea party, and the camera swoops in on the table, I was whupped upside the head by an inescapable, very dark realization: This is a harrowing depiction of the nature of spiritual madness. It starts out like a tea party, but the striving for stasis--the idea that we must try, at all costs, to preserve this beautiful moment--eventually turns it evil.But, really, that was about it.I also didn't appreciate (Spoiler Alert! Here comes my inner purist!) them calling the creature ""a Jabberwocky"". That oversight on the parts of the writers and artistic directors--whom one would have presumed to be Carroll aficionados--sort of took me by surprise. The creature is called a ""Jabberwock"", and a poem celebrating its heroic hunting and demise could well be called ""Jabberwocky"": This in the grand tradition of naming an ode after a noun by adding an ""-y"" suffix. If that seems nitpicky, just remember that Carroll was notably fastidious about such things.At any rate, I guess I would have liked to feel that the gang who produced this would have done a better job of artfully scraping away just enough of the aesthetic distancing afforded by the genre of Victorian Children's Literature that we could see with our own eyes (else what's cinema for?) a little more of Carroll's subversive otherworld.Instead we got a porridge (granted, thicker than gruel) of more of the Hollywood same.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually stunning; storyline was,"Many knew what was coming when they heard Tim Burton was directing a re-vamp of Alice in Wonderland. A visual masterpiece was expected, and it was achieved. The visuals keep the Wonderland feel by not being too realistic, yet not cartoon-y.The storyline was fresh and unique. Although, I feel Burton took a few too many liberties. And having too many liberties in Wonderland is something that's hard to accomplish. Burton's Wonderland seemed a bit too organized. Wonderland is supposed to be where the impossible and the unexpected happens. I did quite like the storyline, but it seemed slightly predictable they way Burton set it up (i.e. the ""Oraculum"").All in all, it was a very enjoyable film. Although it had very typical Burton casting (Depp, Bonham Carter, Spall, Rickman, etc), the actors all had great performances. And the visual effects were brilliant. The soundtrack was stunning as well.I love it. Subtract a star for the unvaried cast, and another for the predictability in the storyline, and you've got yourself 8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Insane, Weird and Wonderful","If you want to see a movie that remains in the real world and is sensible don't go see a Tim Burton movie. The images are whimsical, sometimes dark, unexpected and beautiful. It is strange in a genius way.I do like my fair share of non-fantasy movies, but sometimes a person wants to reevaluate reality through the lens of fantasy, that is what this movie does. People have been criticizing the script for being slow and I found that mostly adults or more straight laced types of people take that position. The massive group of about 7 or 8 year old's in front of me and my friend (we are in our 20's) were entranced just as much as us. The thing about the movie is you have to be willing to let the story take you in or you will be bored. The visuals are magnificent and are supposed to guide you along in the story. People who have difficulty with imagination and weirdness are not going to enjoy it, simple as that. It is a movie that teaches you a little insanity is good. Something that I think we should teach our kids. Its a good movie for someone who can appreciate quirkiness.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Typical Tim Burton,"Alice in Wonderland has never been one of my favorite stories, and although Tim Burton doesn't quite capture the essence of the book, for me it was a good thing. The look of the film is very expressive with the typical Burton trademark of wildly imaginative visuals and expressiveness. The performances are quite good, particularly Helena Bonham Carter doing a great job imitating Bette Davis in The Virgin Queen and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex. Wonderfully photographed, superb costume design and the score is well suited to the film. It's not perfect by any means, but Tim Burton is always worth a look, and I was not disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horrible!,"Tim Burton should be ashamed of himself making such a horrible movie. Johnny Depp should have read the script before committing to this movie. The visuals were outstanding (thats why i gave it a 2)but not enough to save the movie. The story is terrible you don't care about any of the characters, there is no climax to the movie and at the end you really don't care who wins the good or the evil! Do not spend money at the theater for this movie, maybe a rental but i cant even recommend that. This is one of those movies where the visuals are great and the acting is good but the action and the story are so poorly done that you just don't care what happens. If you like visually appealing movies then check out Avatar because that has a great story and good visuals.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"While ""Alice"" may be Burton's weakest, it's sufficient","**1/2 out of (****)After the plethora of advertisements and trailers, after the promotion in Hot Topic stores, and after all the insane hype, Burton's ""Alice"" has finally debuted. Now, that brings us to the major question: Does it live to its endless anticipation? Sadly, no. It's rather disappointing because of a weak script and any emotion that was in Burton's previous projects, has been completely drained out in ""Wonderland"". Sadly, if not for the scenery, this movie would have been beyond awful. The good news? The performances are great and the movie, visually, is the best I've seen. Is this a recommendation? Yes, but very slight.Alice in Wonderland centers around Alice, who is about to get married, when she backs out and accidentally falls down a rabbit hole. (How amusing right?). There, she's in ""Wonderland"", also known as ""Underland"", and it's said that she is the Alice who will fight the Jabberwocky. Although, many have accused Alice of not being the true warrior who has the capability of killing the Jabberwocky. Although, Alice has more problems on her hands. The Red Queen is trying to reign over ""Wonderland"".First, let's get to the negatives. We all know the ""Burton"" that gave us such powerful scripts as ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"", but this time around, he gave us a weak script that is just as hollow as the rabbit hole Alice falls into in the beginning of the film. We never go in-depth with Wonderland. The only thing we do is just explore the Wonderland, that's pretty much it. Also, when the film tries to be emotional or trying to pluck on your heart strings, it seems forced in and never comes off as authentic. This movie is very heartless and lacks a lot of emotion. Furthermore, there are some nonsensical scenes that add nothing to the film, but are rather filler. Moreover, the 3-D is very shabby. It is conversion 3-D and you can tell within the first ten minutes. The picture looks grainy and very unnatural. To add to that, the opening and resolution of the film are highly disappointing.Now, onto the positives. I did really love the characters, including Alice. All were root-worthy and surpassed my moderate expectations. Moreover, I thought the scenery was just beautiful. Every scene is polished to the fullest extent. Very vibrant and certainly worth the look. Furthermore, I thought the movie was very entertaining. For the most part, the movie catches your attention. To add to that, the characters were also very logical and complex as well.While it seems more like a bash than a recommendation, I did enjoy Burton's Alice in Wonderland. However, it is very flawed. The script is stale, the movie is emotionally drained, and it lacks substance. Although, with great performances, beautiful scenery, and a great pace, this ""Alice"" is sufficient. Even if Burton may never hit a home run like he used to, at least he didn't go through the route of Ridley Scott. Albeit, I do advise a matinée. And if you have to pick a dimension, pick 2-D.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still an important date,"Tim Burton has re-imagined Alice in Wonderland as some kind of quasi sequel as Alice (Mia Wasikowska) now an older teenager with a prospective groom on the horizon who she finds boring returns to what she remembers as underland by following a waist-coated rabbit down a hole which is ruled by the maniacal Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who is avenging herself on her sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway).The film takes time to get going and it is curious that if she has visited this place as a young girl which she thinks is all part of her dreams yet she has similar experiences as her previous visit. She shrinks and grows tall when she tastes different things and meets various characters as before like the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Cheshire Cat, the Knave (Crispin Glover) who does the dirty work for the Red Queen, the Caterpillar, Tweedledum and Tweedledee.The film is fun once it gets going and the plot starts to gel, Burton has made the film visually dazzling. The Red Queen with a bulbous head is crazy, Depp's Mad Hatter is a little subdued yet psychedelic with a melancholy back story. Wasikowska though is a little dull as Alice rather than beguiling.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton,I saw Alice in wonderland opening night. I am a huge Tim Burton fan I believe this is some of his best work yet. Also johnny depp played a good part i don't think any one else could have pulled off the mad hatter with his personality he did a great job. The girl who played Alice also did a great job all though i wish it would have been different ending it was overall a great movie.

One of Burton's weakest,"Getting Burton to direct this seemed like a good idea at the time, but his vision of Alice doesn't work.He said that he hated the 1951 animated film, and you can't do a follow up to something you dislike.Making this film a sort of sequel also confused audiences. Granted Burton wanted it to be that way, due to the amount of hate remakes get. So they decided to go the sequel road.Everything is dull and grey, the typical Burton look. And everything is all CGI, which looks really fake. Burton explained his hatred for CGI and green screen on the Corpse Bride DVD. And what did he do on this film?Johnny Depp was the typical weirdo he always plays. Also he character switches between an English accent and a Scottish one. I know it was to add to the madness of the character, but its just so distracting.Also, there is a scene where Alice drinks pee.Yeah, when the White Queen (Anne Hathaway doing ANOTHER fairy tale movie!) is making a drink to make Alice bigger (or smaller, I can't remember), she spits in it and pours pee in it. And Alice drinks it.Yeah, Lewis Carol would be proud. When did this turn into the Farrelly Bros' version of Alice?Now there were a few things I liked such as Mia as Alice. She's quite sexy. Those sexy shoulders. I think that's the reason why Alice is 19 in this. They wanted a more older, sexier Alice.It was also really cool to see Alice be a bad ass, although how did she learn how to fight?I've seen every Burton film, and I have to say this, Planet Of The Apes and Dark Shadows are the weakest of his filmography.I didn't like the remake of Frankenweenie either.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visual spectacle,"I went to the theater with high expectations, but although the looks where absolutely amazing the story was disappointing. the story has a lack of speed. the script has some great jokes but not all where funny enough. Depp was as great as always although his character had not enough room to unfold. Enough for the downsides. It was a great film. Beautiful costumes and make-up. (hint for Oscars?). A cheer for the acting of Helena who played the Red Queen. the animation was more then FANTASTIC!! And a big YAY for Stephen Fry and the Cheshire cat, which are actually the same :P.

Worse than awful,"If I could give this movie zero stars I would; in fact, I would give it negative stars if that were possible. I say this not as simple hyperbole, but because this movie was really that bad and it is a shame that such a classic story that was brilliantly written could be brought to this low level- cheapened to the point of being worthless. As an adapted screenplay, this movie is an abomination, not only because it barely follows the original story (which is what an adaption is supposed to do), but because it does it in such a ham-fisted manner.One of my biggest problems with this movie is the fact that it was turned into a vehicle for Johnny Depp. The movie is called Alice in Wonderland, not The Adventures of the Mad Hatter in Wonderland. But of course Depp is the bankable star that is supposed to sell the film, so naturally he has to be in practically every scene; never mind the fact that the Mad Hatter is a rather minor character in the book. Not only is he too present, but then they have to make him absurd in every aspect. The Hatter must be crazy in deed and appearance to such a ridiculous extent that it is painful to watch. The pinnacle of my revulsion came with the moronic dance at the end, made all the worse by the fact that it was CG ""enhanced"". Johnny Depp should try his hand at acting again instead of appearing in Tim Burton's movies as asinine characters who are completely obtuse, one dimensional, and boring.This of course brings us to the main reason this movie is so horrible: Tim Burton. It has gotten the point now where any movie associated with him is a sure sign of a bad movie. I know that when I see his name attached to a project, red flags immediately go up, but it has gotten so bad now, that I reflexively reject anything he directs or writes and with good reasons. 1) His ""cinematic vision"" is roughly equal to that of Mister Magoo after a night of heavy drinking. It was original when it was Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, but now it is worn out and a clear sign of a hack who is living off his past achievements. As a matter of fact, Mr. Burton, you do not have to make every movie with elements of your bizarro Halloween world included in each scene. A perfect example in Alice in Wonderland is the White Queen, who looks more akin to the Corpse Bride (naturally). 2) Burton's ability to tell a story has been seriously impaired by his reliance on special effects. This movie was one of the worst examples of trying to sell the visuals at the expense of the story. Then again, when you have such a compromised screenplay, maybe the safe fix is to dress it up with neat visuals. It still is very similar to putting lipstick on a pig, in my opinion. 3) Maybe it is time to change up the casting. Every movie the mope makes has Johnny Depp and Helena Bohnam Carter. And while he is at it, he can change the art director, and fire the lighting guy, the editor and the cinematographer too.This movie is supposed to be about Alice, but almost from the beginning she is getting lost in the shuffle, and the actress they chose for Alice was not a good choice either as she just fades into the background in many scenes and delivers her lines in a perfunctory manner that suggest nothing of a leading role. It is not that you do not care about Alice in particular, it is that you are left not caring about anything in this movie because the story has been so horribly eviscerated to the point of being unrecognizable. The beginning of the movie was mind-numbingly boring, and then when one finally reaches the point where Alice falls down the rabbit hole, and one has the slightest flicker of hope that the movie will somehow recover, those hopes are cruelly dashed by more horrible dialog and slow scenes that are meant to show off the talents of the CG animators rather than tell the story.I did not want to see this movie, in fact, I was manifestly against seeing this movie from the first moment that I saw the trailer. I saw this movie knowing that is was going to be a train wreck, nevertheless I chose to immolate myself by watching it. After the first thirty minutes I was convinced that this was a mistake and a waste of time, every bit as bad as Sweeney Todd, Willy Wonka, Sleepy Hollow and the steady string of turds that Tim Burton has shat out on the public for the past ten years.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Tale of the Return to the Wondrous Land or the Magnificent Tim Burton: Part seven,"Fairy tale. The film adaptation of the classic children's fairy tale of the same name by the English writer Lewis Carroll, in the talented processing of maestro Tim Burton. And I have read the original book source, but it makes no sense to compare the film adaptation with it, since this fantasy of Tim Burton was only inspired by the book, and the main story is about something else altogether. As you understand, we continue the story about the paintings of the greatest storyteller and visionary of our time, Tim Burton, and today his fairy tale, made under the wing of the Evil Corporation (when it still had a good reputation, and did not cause vomiting at the mere mention of it, as it is now), is next in line. I've watched this picture probably a thousand times, both in Russian dubbing and in the original, and I hasten to report to you that the picture is good, and even after the incident of thirteen years, it looks good, and makes the viewer feel emotions. And here is my brief opinion for you - A tale about returning to a Wonderful Land. Despite the obvious advantages of this fairy tale, there are also disadvantages in it, which must be said. And this should be the end of such an important introduction, and get to the point.So, the pros:
1. Scenario - if we leave aside the obvious feminist message (we'll talk about it below), then Alice from Wonderland appears before us again, but she has already grown up a lot, and returned to this bizarre place in order to fulfill the prophecy and defeat the terrible monster, along the way meeting old friends and finding new enemies. Although everything that is happening seems like another dream to Alice herself, that's just the real danger that threatens her. The final is certainly predictable, but that's why we are no less expected. Alice will have to re-strengthen her dampness and sort herself out, and loyal friends will provide all possible help. Before us is a modern fairy tale with the right message, and an excellent visual component that will surely appeal to both children and adults. The characters are bright and memorable. Dialogues are full of wisdom in places, so it's not a sin to listen to them. If you do not pay attention to the disadvantages that are in this picture, then you can enjoy the script, and then review this picture (I do this periodically).2. Characters - Mad Hatter, Absolem, Tweedledee and Tweedledee, Red and White Queens, March Hare, White Rabbit, Dormouse Mouse and so on. All of them are eccentrics of the highest order, because they are taken from the fairy tale of the same name, although here they have become even more interesting, thanks to the age of the main character and the problems that have arisen with these. And the actors contribute to the image, you can't take that away. Each of them is interesting to watch.3. The Cheshire Cat - I singled out this milah separately, because the appearance, his image and of course the voice acting (Stephen Fry in the original, Alexander Shirvindt in the Russian dubbing) just sunk into my soul. Cheshirrrr is a tricky one, but without his help, it would be extremely difficult for our crazy company. Bold and courageous (in some places). I love this cat, without him the picture would be somewhat less vivid.4. Humor - and, although the narrative in the picture is rather gloomy, this did not prevent the creators from adding humor, which is not only appropriate here, but it is simply impossible to imagine this picture without it. Especially in this regard, I am pleased with the Mad Hatter, and the rest of the characters humor well.So, the cons:
1. The feminist message - yes, comrades, it is here, and it is decent here. Yes, it does not cause a gag reflex as in most modern paintings, but it causes irritation. Alice is now a strong and independent girl who does not need love, but making a career is hers. She is purposeful, proud. Although, to be honest, she acquires almost all these qualities only in the final, having passed the test of Wonderland and proving in practice that she is capable of a lot. It is now for paintings with a similar message (like the terrible series ""Wednesday"") to pass tests and learn is not necessary - the heroine is already beautiful and strong simply in fact, and because she is female. Previously, I didn't really notice this message, but now it is visible so vividly that it is simply impossible to ignore it.2. Disregard for history - Alice's story is modernised here, but the screenwriter, in trying to make Alice strong and independent, went too far, spitting on the real story. No, if the script had started in 2010, there would have been no questions. But the action takes place in the second half of the nineteenth century - a time of strict morals, where there was no question of any rights for women. And even more so to take a woman as a companion in a representative trading company - it generally looks fantastic. Alice, of course, could become a companion - but only by getting married and out of the shadow of her own husband, she could achieve the realization of her ideas. That's all - she had no other way then. Let me just remind you that in England women were able to achieve the right to vote only in 1928, and this is provided that they fought for it all the first quarter of the twentieth century.3. The visual component - you know, the budget of the picture was two hundred lemons of cabbage leaves, and most of it went to the graphics, then I would like to see its quality without jambs and obviously hacky moments that are here.A little bit about the main characters:
1. Alice Kingsley performed by Mia Wasikowska is a young bride who doesn't really want to go down the aisle. With all his appearance and behavior, he defies Victorian society. A crazy dreamer, at the same time a strong and brave girl, you follow the bark and worry with interest and emotions. It should be said that Mia Vasikovskaya perfectly suited the role of the new Alice. She literally feels bulatness and at the same time femininity. Her behavior does not cause strong irritation. Good girl!2. The Mad Hatter performed by Johnny Depp - well, who else could play this character, if not our favorite Johnny, and here his eccentricity has gone beyond the horizons of existence. Again, Johnny plays with his eyes very convincingly, and the character himself is a match for him - a talented master crazy on the mountain, devoted to the White Queen and hating the usurper Red Queen, with a rapidly changing mood. Johnny is as good as ever. Bravo!3. The Red Queen performed by Helena Bonham Carter - And Helena has now decided to delve into a negative character (much stronger than in Sweeney Todd), and demonstrated a real tyrant on the throne, who rules exclusively with the help of fear. Sometimes it is funny, and her huge head matches it. Good girl!I will also note Anne Hathaway in the role of the spirited White Queen, she is too good in contrast with her sister, and she jokes well.The picture collected more than a billion cabbage leaves at the box office, which made it possible to release a sequel in 2016 (but we'll talk about it later), but for now old Tim Burton decided, again under the patronage of the Evil Corporation, to release a puppet cartoon based on his own 1984 short film, but we'll talk about it next time.And the picture ""Alice in Wonderland"" is good, I even passed the game on this picture several times, even though it is a child's one. For the first time, I overestimated this fairy tale too much, but now I will give her a fair one.My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Carroll's World Comes to Life,"The eight year old inside of me felt it necessary to re-read Lewis Carroll's books before sitting down to watch ALICE IN WONDERLAND. While I finished my reading believing the story to be precious more than nonsense, I also found myself in a state of curiosity. What did a Bandersnatch look like? Just how loony was The March Hare? And what did this world on the other side of the rabbit hole look like? While it might not have been the film I expected, I have to give this movie credit - it certainly gave me an experience far wilder than my own imagination.Deciding what to say about ALICE IN WONDERLAND was admittedly difficult. Admittedly, I wasn't wowed by the film, but a lot of that is on me - and not the fault of the film. The movie geek in me started doing the math months ago...Alice + Burton + Depp + 3-D = Holy moly awesome! The problem is, that my tempered reaction to the film isn't really a reaction to the film, it's a reaction to expectations versus reality.The reality is that we have been given a Wonderland that truly brings Lewis Carroll's imagination to life. From the lush garden of talking flowers to the regal intimidation of The Red Queen's palace, the set pieces of this film are rich with lavishness, whimsy, and indeed - wonder. Making it all the more complete are the tiny details, like the frantically flapping birds holding chandeliers aloft, and flamingo croquet mallets that apologize to the de facto ball before whacking him into play.Where the set pieces leave off, the actors come in and take over. Mia Wasikowska is an understated Alice. Some have reacted by saying that she seems to play things a little *too* subtle, but I find the slightly muted delivery more befitting of a 19-year old. When Alice first goes to Wonderland, she's wide-eyed with curiosity. Befitting a girl who has had thirteen years to stew on what she thought was a dream, she wanders through this great unknown with a bit more steely temperament.Alice being understated isn't such a bad thing this time around as it basically keeps her out of harm's way when she's in a scene opposite Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen or Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter. Both were characters that left me hesitant in still images, but when brought to life on the screen they thrive in this nonsensical world. Bonham Carter tears through every scene she's in with a reckless abandon, and Depp brings a nice duality to The Hatter. the temptation *must* have been great to play him like a raving loon. Happily, Depp instead plays him with a nice mix of fear and oddity. Suffice to say - he made me proud of my handle.If I do have a great disappointment with the film, it's the afterthought attitude towards the 3-D rendering. It comes into play very sparingly, and really isn't utilized nearly enough in this fantastical story - one that seems like it was written for a 3-D treatment. I have mentioned on more than one occasion that 3-D is by and large a gimmick, and ALICE did nothing to change my mind. Further, it's lack of use of the technology was one thing that disappointed me.In the years since I first heard this story, I've had many daydreams about what a Cheshire Cat's smile looks like, or how an army of playing cards might move. the way ALICE IN WONDERLAND brought these visions to life alone were enough for me to recommend this film. And while I will openly admit that I found the overall narrative wanting, I can forgive it for distracting me with visual delights that I have only been able to imagine since I was eight.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice In Wonderland A Decent Re-Imagining Of A Classic Tale,"Alice In Wonderland is a decent re-imaging of a class tale from director Tim Burton who does a good job of making this movie that might have flaws but I still enjoyed it for what the film was. Johnny Depp of course is excellent as always giving audiences a much different Mad Hatter than we've seen before. He's nearly unrecognizable under all the make up and the voice Depp came up with is fitting for this interpretation of the Mad Hatter. Depp brings his usual charisma to the part and his character may not appear for the first 30 minutes but luckily he's in it a lot more after that. Depp continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor in this one. Anne Hathaway is all right in her short screen time as The White Queen despite not having a whole lot to do. Hathaway does provide a little comic relief and she brings what she can to her small role in the film. Helena Bonham Carter is effective as the villainous Red Queen who seems to enjoy saying ""Off with their head"" when someone displeases her for any reason. Carter like Hathaway offers the film some humor and does what her roles requires. Crispin Glover is decent as The Red Queen's right hand man Stayne who likes big woman. He did seem to go a little over the top at times but Glover still turns in an okay performance. Newcomer Mia Wasikowska is impressive as 19 year old Alice who returns to the magical world from her childhood adventure. She holds her own against Depp, Hathaway, and Carter on screen in their scenes together. Wasikowski proves her talent as an actress with her performance as Alice who must find the strength within herself to put an end to the Red Queen's reign that has left a large portion of the imaginary world of Wonderland in ruins. The voice talents of Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman, Matt Lucas, and Timothy Spall are effective in their small roles that are more like cameos and extended appearances but they do what their roles require from them. Marton Csokas in a blink and you missed it cameo does what he can with his very brief part as Alice's father Charles. The rest of the relatively unknown cast are okay but no one stands out. The action which mostly happens in the second half and third act are well executed. The special effects are quite good even if you can tell most of it is obviously CGI. The world they created for the magical Wonderland however is just as impressive giving audiences a world where almost anything's possible. The pacing of the film was a little slow at times before the action started to kick into high gear, and some characters lacked development but there wasn't a whole lot I didn't enjoy about Alice In Wonderland. The second half set the stage for some action in the third act (the kind we've seen in Transformers, Iron Man, and X-Men 3 to name a few) which isn't necessarily a bad thing I guess because it's well executed. Overall Alice In Wonderland is a pretty good re-imaging of a famous tale that was better than expected. So if this sounds like a movie you'd enjoy, than chances are you'll have a good time watching it. Alice in Wonderland has a simple story, drama, action, some humor, a little suspense, and solid performances by the cast (especially Depp and Wasikowska) who make this movie worth the time to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
If you've seen the preview trailer....,"If you've seen the trailer then you know Johnny Depp looks really cool as the Hatter. You know that the Red Queen has a big funny head and likes to say ""off with his head!"" a whole lot. And then.........ummmm....well, that's about the entire movie. It's just a very mediocre, run-of-the-mill fantasy yarn that disappoints on many levels. I think everyone expected quite a bit from Tim Burton, but I was left pretty empty. The movie was so bland and uninteresting that I'm having difficulty writing a decent 10-line review. It all just struck me as a lame ""Narnia' knock-off. Definitely one of Tim's most forgettable efforts.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brilliant new take on a classic story.,"If you're interested in seeing Alice In Wonderland because you love the classic story, perhaps this isn't for you. Tim Burton's version is quite different to the classic Lewis Carroll and Disney versions in that the story is more or less completely different.The film follows Alice, now nineteen, as she returns to Underland, although she believes her first trip to the magical place was all a dream. All the classic characters are there: Matt Lucas as both Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, Anne Hathaway as the White Queen and, of course, the outstanding Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter.The film itself is pretty much 95% CGI, which gives it the 'Wonderland' look. It's simply a brilliant film to look at, nothing looks too 'computerised', even when taking into account the drastically varied heights of the characters compared to the actors portraying them. The acting highlights for me were Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter. They are by far the funniest characters, even if Hathaway's White Queen may not be intended to be all that amusing.As for the 3D aspect, as with most other productions being released in the format in recent months, it brings a bit more charm to the scene. Nothing too gimmicky is there either.I'd highly recommend a trip to your local cinema to see Alice In Wonderland, but make sure you see it in 3D for that little extra magic. Tim Burton really can do no wrong.http://ukmore.tk/",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Uneven but Wonderful Burtonian Fare,"It was difficult for me to decide upon a rating for this. After hotly anticipating Alice in Wonderland since July of 2009 when the first trailer came out, March 5th of 2010 finally came and I got to see it. Alice in Wonderland is quite different than most of the other editions of the Alice story and also one of the better ones, yet it is far from perfect. One might expect more from Burton, but all in all the film is satisfying. The 3-D is not quite as good as the 3-D in other films, but it is still quite nice. The film is mostly held up by strong performances and good art design, but brought down by an incredibly uneven script. It was difficult, but I finally arrived at the decision that Alice is in fact a good movie.Alice in Wonderland has been changed slightly for this edition. The film is a semi-sequel to Alice in Wonderland with a few elements of Through the Looking Glass incorporated. The story follows Alice Kingsley, beautifully played by Mia Wasikowska (try pronouncing that one correctly!), after she has been proposed to by a man she is not in love with. Alice is nineteen here and is now returning to Wonderland...make that Underland. In Underland she meets the usual cast of characters including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), the Cheshire Cat, Absalom/the Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb, and the Jabberwocky. A few new characters even join the now familiar crew.As I mentioned before, the film's quality is sustained by good performances and an excellent art department combined with special effects. Mia Wasikowska, who you may recognize as Sophie from In Treatment (probably not though), gives another great performance. Can someone explain why this is not household name yet? I surprisingly enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance very much as well. Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway act nicely as well. And now for the art department. The sets, which there are very few because most everything is CGI, are quite nice. The costume design is elaborate and accurate for the time period.Now let's talk about what was just so-so in the movie. The script is definitely what has caused some people to hate this movie. At the beginning, the script is very weak and slow moving, but eventually it speeds up. Unfortunately, it takes about an hour to do so. Also, Tim Burton does the exact same thing he does every time: dark, Hot Topic-esquire film-making. I'm sorry, but since when has doing the same thing every time meant being a great director? The film includes his favorite actors in pretty much the same parts. Isn't the Mad Hatter just a bit too similar to Willy Wonka? Of course, what Tim Burton does is enjoyable, but isn't it all a little too much already? Alice in Wonderland is not an easy film to explain. It's both great and so-so. Tim Burton has definitely put his magic touch on certain parts and the actors try very hard, but the film lacks a consistent script. I want to like it more, but I just can't. The 3-D provides some physical depth to the movie, but the movie lacks metaphorical depth.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Utterly Dismal, and Not for Young Children","I usually enjoy Tim Burton and was absolutely shocked at how bad this adaptation of Alice in Wonderland was. Although it had its moments, it was bogged down by a ridiculous ""sword and sorcery"" type plot, unintelligible dialogue, and dreary visuals.What was missing? Charm. And a playful whimsical quality that should be present in an Alice in Wonderland story. I wasn't drawn into the ""Wonderland"" world whatsoever. The ""Harry Potter"" type story was incongruent and turned Alice in Wonderland into Harry Potter having a bad acid trip.Worse, the CGI seemed cheap and the landscapes had no scope nor gave us awe-inspiring wonder. The Red Queen's castle was neat to look at, as were a few other things, but mostly, this was a wasted opportunity visually.Most importantly, the film was way too adult for the subject matter. Several gruesome scenes make this a movie I would not bring young children to see, when a movie like this should be precisely made for young children and those young at heart.A total disappointment.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Messy, Crazy, and Perfect","this movie is overdone, crazy visuals, over-dramatic characters and insane scenarios, a perfect representation of a story so many times made and so poorly done before.Burton did with this story what other couldn't, it give it some sense but not making it *as many said* moralist, is still the derailed imagination of a man over a girl's life, is still lots of fantasy and magic with a lesson hidden, I know... Alice in Wonderland is not supposed to teach us anything, but I think it should, it was the journey of Alice from the girl who fell asleep to the young lady invited to share tea with adults, this is still a movie about the passing into adult life. and this time is not a passing after a lost or suffering, but with the same view her father had, impossible dreams that will come true if you fight for them.Characters so well done, you still find the fairy tale characters, bad ones still dark, still no faces, good ones always expressive and colors and light. if you're older than that, there's so many layers you'll enjoy it the same, Johnny Depp was great, his mad hatter, brave and insane, and charming, wish he could get some recognition for this one, I liked him more than as Captain Jack.Mia, the girl is stunning, pretty and talented, her Alice is soft and delicate, yet she's a fighter, you can see she's not afraid at all, even if at first she hesitated, both as character as an actress you see a fresh face and lots of potential.Helena Bonham-Carter and Anne Hathaway did what they do all the time, both lost in the character, both amazingly well done.the effects and other creatures, even the furniture, were amazing, the first time you see this movie you feel you're inside that world, you want to follow the white rabbit and get lost in a world of insanity and fun.This movie brought me back to my first time in movies, magic that makes not only feel good, it changes you, gives you hope and that feeling of naive excitement you only feel as a child.I highly recommend it. is my favorite movie this year no matter what comes after.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alrite...I suppose,"Having not seen the original I went in with no opinion, despite others saying it would be 'magical'. Its fair to say Tim Burton pulled off an excellent 3D film, however it was just OK. Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing. It just shows his earlier films are so original they are hard to beat! My only two reasons for seeing this film were, firstly...Mr.Depp, which I must say is the only actor (once again) who could pull of the character remarkably. He always perfects obscure down to a tee. Secondly to see the film itself, as having never seen it before and having heard so much about it I felt it was about time to give it a go. I'd say go see it just to see what all the fuss is about, but on the whole, what really was all the hype about?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice in Blunderland,"Alice in Wonderland is one of several adaptations based on Lewis Carroll's books about a girl who wanders into Wonderland, a place filled with strange, comical fellows and some nightmarish creatures. We find Alice (Mia Wasikowska) on the brink of engagement to a man she does not like. Instead of facing her fears, she runs away. She comes across a hole, almost like a rabbit hole. She falls in and is thrust into the twisted world of Tim Burton, I mean Wonderland, or as the inhabitants call it, Underland.She is confronted by several characters, including Tweedledee, Tweedledum, the White Rabbit, the Dodo bird, and the Blue Caterpillar. They are excited because they believe that she is the same Alice who had been in Wonderland before and has returned to slay the Jabberwocky. Alice doesn't remember being there before except in her dreams. In fact, she continues to believe that she is still dreaming. Things get real for her when the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) sends out her minions to find Alice. She seeks help from the Cheshire Cat, who leads her to the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp).Without going too far into the story, Alice is faced with several challenges dealing with her belief in Wonderland and her role in restoring order to the land. The Red Queen has brought bloodshed and tears to the once harmonious land. Her sister the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) willfully waits in the wings until her champion (hopefully Alice) will take on the Jabberwocky.Wow. That was a mouthful. And you know what, I don't really mind the story. Much like the Disney animated classic, the story is so bizarre, outlandish, and colorful that I can handle almost anything as far as bizarreness and an over the top story. What I don't like is bad film-making and storytelling. That is where the film goes horribly awry.Starting with the character of Alice, I never felt like she really cared enough. Yes, she is proper and holds a sense of dignity, but at the beginning of the film she seems so headstrong and opinionated. She never questions what happens to her, only saying here and there that it is all a dream. What bothers me even more is how much she says she cares about others like the Mad Hatter, whom she barely knows! I don't understand.The look of the film might be my least favorite aspect. A filmmaker like Terry Gilliam can get away with a film like this. Take for instance The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. It has a lot of special effects and green screen work, but there are actual sets and tangible things, as well as bizarre creatures and settings. Burton goes almost completely green screen with the exception of a couple of the actors. It's very fake looking and very forced. Things that should be somewhat natural are distorted. Yes, I understand that Wonderland is a very strange place, but that doesn't mean that a horse has to be CGI. Horses can be used in movies.The colors in the film were too saturated and gloomy looking. The animated version and other remakes include vibrant colors as well as dark, and gloomy ones. Here we see very dark blues, bloody reds, and jungle greens. A lot of overcast skies and grey looking sets. The real world looks more vibrant than Wonderland.The acting too was a bit off as well. Depp's character is supposed to be crazy, but I think he goes a little too far with the accents. I liked his enthusiasm, but was not completely sold. The White Queen was a confusing character. She was almost floating around, holding her arms above her hips like a fairy. I was never sure what to make of her. She seemed so fake. As I mentioned before I thought that Mia as Alice was a bit boring. Her face did not have much emotion, though she looked perfect for the part. I wanted more out of her.Had I watched this film in standard 2D I would have probably given it a much worse review. The 3D visuals do help make the film look better, but it should make it look amazing. The colors popped a slightly, but were I to watch it in 2D the foreground and background would almost certainly blend together, creating a very flat and uninteresting surface.I didn't have high hopes for this film and still I was disappointed. I wanted more from the actors (though the voice acting was pretty good, especially Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat) and I was hoping for a more pleasant looking Wonderland. A word of warning for those planning on taking young ones to the film: the PG rating is very lenient. There is a lot of disturbing and frightening imagery that could upset children. There is some eye plucking, head rolling, and some scary looking creatures. It could be too much to handle. I'm sure Disney pushed hard for the friendlier rating, but don't be fooled.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Imagining Tim Burton,"It's a challenge for someone like Tim Burton to do an adaptation of the Alice books by Lewis Carroll. You see, Burton has never been and could never be recognized for his writing, most of which he doesn't do. What I mean is that he always starts from scratch, as he bases his movies on things to create especially breathtaking worlds. His art has always been more on the visual side than on the storytelling, and in many ways his ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a confirmation of this and of his talents as an author; his capacity to remain unchangeable through everything.He doesn't have to, but apparently he wants to and, if anything, his ""Alice"" is the new expression of a co-existent universe that persists among all of his films. This universe is also coherent, because visually it has a special, recognizable mood, always accompanied delightfully by Danny Elfman's original music. Seeing Alice opening that little door and entering Neverland is not very different from Ichabod Crane's recurrent dream in ""Sleepy Hollow"", or from Edward Bloom's arrival to Spectre in ""Big Fish"", for that matter.What else can I tell you about a story we all know? What else can I suggest than going in and see for yourselves what Tim Burton has made with it, visually? Cinema being a visual art and Burton being a visual master, the result is, and this should be a unanimous thought, one dazzling set after another, with a particular choice of color and light that should be related to the characters who inhabit each one. The most interesting of these choices might be the normal world Alice lives in; a boring, organized, aristocratic, choreographed London that Burton shoots with irony, occasionally transforming it into something more edgy with the thoughts of Alice's imagination (imagination is the key to every Tim Burton movie).If you don't know the characters, any review should say nothing about them so the movie ride becomes a bit more unpredictable and surprising. It's clearly a story that screenwriter Linda Woolverton (who wrote ""The Lion King"" among other Disney features) thought about once and wrote without expecting many changes, and probably Chris Lebenzon treated the editing process the same way.The story and its development, obvious and rudimentary, adds nothing new to the table. But the movie reminds us that the co-existence of a whole universe among all the Burton films is not only visual; this universe also exists thematically. Maybe the director was never able to sustain a complete story –he doesn't achieve it here- and maybe now I realize (I was telling Grillo) the reason I love ""Big Fish"" so much is because, like I said in my review, it's a ""collection of beautiful scenes that don't cease to amaze us""; therefore so many little stories that don't have to be explained and completely resolve, have more weight than the story of a man and his son that is the movie, which, by the way, is the movie's point: ""The man becomes his stories"".But that man, Edward Bloom, was one of Burton's outcasts, nostalgic and imaginative (again, the key to any Burton movie), constantly going back to his childhood years, where unresolved dreams and issues always awaited the mentioned Ichabod Crane, and an Edward who wanted to have real hands, and a Willy Wonka who wanted his father to be proud of him. In this way (and there's probably things I'm missing that will come back soon or revisiting the director's films), it's perfectly clear that the Mad Hatter (the most developed character in this movie; there always has to be one above the rest) has lost his head and is always looking for a sense of 'whatever you wanna call it' in his life; you can see it in his crazy eyes. With or without Alice. Before and after her.And some people still wonder why Johnny Depp is the absolute protagonist of the film.Special note: The portrayal of Alice by Mia Wasikowska, which will never be recognized, is one of the best performances you'll ever see in this genre. The idea of a child who wants to dream but knows that it should be impossible at a particular stage of life; a constant disbelief for everything she sees that can be perceived in her look and annoying tone of voice; a little girl who's becoming a woman but knows her father spoiled her too much and it will be difficult to change that and accept maturity. A girl without self confidence, even when she knows she has all the answers.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually fantastic,"I haven't read the original story, and to be honest I didn't really understand the whole point of the story in the first place. Especially after watching the Disney cartoon, it sort of left me a bit bewildered.However, in this version, I am happy to say it is an enjoyable movie, which looks great visually with some good performances in particular from Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. Mia Wasikowska as Alice is very likable and the fact that she is a lot older in this version (which explains itself later on in the film) and is not so much as a damsel in distress figure makes it more enjoyable to take this journey alongside her.The changes to the original story didn't bother me that much. I thought this was an interesting take on the tale and it actually added a bit more substance to what is a slightly meaningless tale in the beginning anyway. Johnny Depp's character as the Mad Hatter is good, though I liked him better in other movies. But it really is Helena Bonham Carter who lights this up as the villainous queen. She steals the show with her spineless and cold character.I did find the ending battle a bit somewhat anti climatic, but I think it doesn't really matter since this isn't a film about battles and major war (thought it sometimes tries to be) but more about the beauty of a new world and how you can learn things from it, even though it is quite confusing.This made more than a billion at the box office - wow I'm surprised! Not because I think it's a bad film, but I didn't realise this story had such an impact on so many people.This is a much more darker version on this tale, though I don't think it is dark enough to scare young kids, though they may be a little frightened of some scenes. I think adults will also enjoy this, though those looking for a faithful adaptation of the original story will probably have to get used to the new ideas, but it is imaginative nevertheless.Worth to see for the performances and the visuals. Story - hmmm..well it's in my opinion a higher notch above the original story, but nothing majorly spectacular.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
visually stunning,"I really enjoyed the special effects and the 3D format of this film. The scrip itself is pretty good (there are better Alice In Wonderland scripts) but Tim Burton's visual style is really unique and entertaining.Helena Carter was totally amazing!! Her timing and body language was perfect. The way she delivered ""off with his head"" make me laugh. It was a very memorable performance from a half human and half animated body.Anne Hathaway was kinda weak in her role. I think they cast her for her look (the pale skin, unique face, etc). She did a poor job and was the weakest character in this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In wild and wacky wonderland!!,"I t s was inevitable. After all, few filmmakers can match Tim Burton's skills in visualising a wild and wacky wonderland. The director of such beguiling tales as Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd transforms Lewis Carroll's classic children's story into a film of the hugely entertaining kind.All the author's beloved character including the Mad Hatter ( D e p p ) , Tweedles Dee and Dumb (both voiced by Matt Lucas) and the grinning Cheshire cat (gleefully dubbed by Stephen Fry) are brought vividly to life, with the added attraction of 3-D.Burton re-invents Alice (Australian newcomer Wasikowska) as a free-spirited teenager. Of course, she once again tumbles down the rabbit hole to emerge in a wondrous dimension ruled by the fearsome Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter, outrageously campy). Alice changes size from one moment to the next and the adventures in her alternate reality are so fantastic that the bookend sequences set in the real world pale in comparison.The film's climactic confrontation with the dreaded ""Jabberwocky"" is a bit of a let-down. But these are minor quibbles. A characteristic feast for the senses, Alice in Wonderland is for those who fancy the funky and the far-out.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton does it again,Tim Burton one of my favorite directors ever. Tim has a way of making films his own even if they've been remade time and time again. I have seen one of the other versions of Alice and it was good but not great. With Tim's version it seems like a different film in some parts because it is a Tim Burton film. He usually makes awfully dark Gothic films however the element of darkness is there in Alice it also has the element of color as well which I think is really good. The lighting is nothing short of fantastic and the fx are great. It's very well done with it's production design as well. But to have an unknown Australian actress to play Alice at first I thought interesting casting. I was not disappointed Mia was great as Alice and I felt she fell into the character. Nice work Tim!,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Far from frabjous.,"Alice in Wonderland is another big budget exercise in eccentricity for eccentricity's sake from the team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, an overindulgent and unnecessary retelling of the Lewis Carroll tale full of the director's trademark Gothic grandeur and featuring another kooky performance from the top billed star designed to further his appeal with disaffected loners and weirdos (don't be offended: I include myself in those categories).Help is also on hand from pretty but wooden Mia Wasikowska as Alice, assorted well regarded thesps, a handful of cult names from the world of British TV, and of course, Burton's wife, Helena Bonham-Carter, whose weak impression of Queenie from Black Adder II is sadly the best performance of the whole film.The clumsy narrative, which focuses heavily on elements from the nonsense poem The Jabberwocky, rarely engages the viewer in a satisfactory manner, achieving neither suspense, tension, excitement or, perhaps most notably, a sense of wonder; instead, the story plays second fiddle to the polished CGI visuals, which offer up the usual, tired, trippy imagery associated with the stories, but fail to either add anything new or make full use of the 3D technology (Wonderland looks positively flat in comparison to Cameron's alien world in Avatar).Not quite as bad as Burton's re-imagining of Planet of the Apes (thank heavens), but still a long way from the genius on display in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks (hey, I like it, so there!), Alice in Wonderland must have looked like the perfect project for all involved but the finished product is unlikely to have anyone grinning like the Cheshire cat.Oh, and anyone who that thinks Crispin Glover needs digitally altering to look creepy is seriously misguided.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I will refer to Tim Burton and shout "" Off with his head "" !!","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp .. A big step back! Let us agree in principle that it is the film depends entirely on the visual effects .. But is this reason that the film would be weak?! .. With the knowledge that the director is Tim Burton and heroes are the stars do not differ with them all! .. Of course not justified .. The film does not have deep enough to make it on the edge of your seat and you are waiting for the recent conflict between good and evil, came the events of the film is recurrent and potentially very most of the time, lending you a sense of malaise and fatigue, and then the end will come not compensate for the time lost and you expected in the narrow end of the movie! In terms of performance representations, I believe that the role of Johnny Depp did not fit him and I felt very representative of the secondary in the film, despite the large role of the area, but I did not feel the presence of Johnny mounts the same as in other films! Anne Hathaway, also its not feel it so much! Mia Wasikowska , frankly I did not like this girl a lot in its role as Alice! Helena Bonham Carter .. Is the only one in my opinion, commendable, performed the role of the Red Queen was wonderful and fun in all times and succeeded in Helena to underestimate the many periods of boring movie and I always wait for the appearance on the screen, her performance was truly fun! We come to the visual effects and that it could be the only intercessor of the weakness of the film, but unfortunately, even visual effects did not come the required quality .. yes, effects were good but not impressive .. For example, when you see avatar marvel at the visual effects beyond the border, but in our film this good effects , but did not work on the impressed , adding to the weaknesses of the movie! In the end, if enabled those who love movies legends and myths certainly suit you this movie, but if you're a lover Johnny Depp and avid for one of his creations, you will not find in this movie, if you're a fan Burton, and one hungry for creativity you will find creativity in this film, but You'll find yourself tell you That Tim Burton has more than this to offer! .. If you love a good story and scenario arbitrator and coherent relations will not find in our film this .. If you're a fan of the movie stars and waiting to be enchanted with their performances representative in the traditional shock of them would go in this film, if you are a fan of visual effects, the film will suit you, but will not satisfy you a way that required! Therefore, I think that after the film Sweeney Todd the wonderful Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, I should say at the beginning of my comment that Alice in Wonderland was a big step back for each of the Tim Burton and Johnny Depp! .. And how much I regret saying this!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointment,"So I, (like most of the other people who waited hours in the freezing cold for the midnight showing of this movie) had very, very high expectations for this film. Usually being satisfied with anything Tim Burton (with the exception of The Chocolate Factory, and Corpse Bride), I thought this movie would just be awesome! Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, it's gonna be a huge hit, I thought. Boy was I wrong! I can officially say that I am over the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp film affair, so, so over it. Johnny Depp actually became annoying when watching the film. He jumped from Jack Sparrow, to random Scot Accent, his performance, in my opinion was absolutely horrible. The film had nothing special to it, other than the visuals (which were amazing) but the plot just had no substance to it, no explanation, no reason. It just was. Although ""Alice"" was charming and quite adorable, it just wasn't ""Alice."" Bad casting in my opinion. I thought Anne Hathaway did what she could, but her actual character really had no substance. Overall a disappointment, frustration, and annoyance. Looks like we've got another 10-20 years until someone can (hopefully) get it right on this one, and make a decent Alice In Wonderland.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty to Look at,"Alice in Wonderland Starring: Johnny Depp- Mad Hatter Anne Hathaway- White Queen Helena Bonham Carter- Red Queen Director: Tim Burton Writer: Linda Woolverton; Based on the Novel by: Lewis CarrollWhen watching a Tim Burton film (Sweeny Todd, Beatle juice); there is uniqueness about his visual flare. The dark and light contrasting colors are quite striking. Seeing Wonderland at first was in fact beautiful to look at. Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland was a treat to look at, but nothing more.Alice (Mia Wiasikousk) who is misplaced in her society and is forced in her destiny. As she is interrupting her engagement, she slips into Wonderland meeting unusual creatures, people, and her to lead her own destiny. Meeting the longing of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) who is waiting for Alice to come back and lead the rebelling of the wicked and ruthless Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).Johnny Depp portrayed the Mad Hatter with as much personality has he could for the amount of time he was on the screen. All other characters were minimal to little character development.What was the strength and weakness of the film was the visual atmosphere, after a while in Wonderland, it wears thin the computer generated at time can be noticeable such as the dragon. It loses the involvement and enjoyment of the movie when seeing some creatures and setting when observing too much of. Sometimes less is better. Rating: ** ½ out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alright First Instalment Adaptation,"This is a fine first instalment adaptation for all viewers to watch. There was some room of improvement for the crew to create this film better. The storyline of this film was sort of weak. It needed more effort. The cast selection was exceptional. They connected deeply to the storyline and to their respective characters. This adaptation reveals to viewers what the power of imagination can do for everyone. My imagination is endless and huge.

"Very disappointing, visually impressive, but all adds up to nothing","I had had high hopes for this film, with a cast including such stars as Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter; such treasures as Matt Lucas, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen and Alan Rickman (not to mention a cameo by Christopher Lee); and directed by Tim Burton; this really looked like one to watch. When I saw the trailer, however I was a little apprehensive. It looked too... dark? Strange? Weird? I couldn't quite put my finger on it.My fears were confirmed when watching the film. The performances were excellent, all of the performances. Depp and Bonham Carter were especially good, and Lucas provided brilliant comic relief. The characters were also really well written, I could really feel their emotion and knew their past without even fully being told. The Mad-Hatter was really well written, the tragic insane man who sometimes is even aware of his own insanity; the angry and highly frustrated Red Queen who felt unloved... I could go on. The problem lies in the story, it just doesn't go anywhere and I know it's taken from Lewis Carrol's books, but the film just felt badly put together, it was just a collection of bits, put back to back and in the end went no-where. The start was promising and the ending was good, but in the middle there was nothing. Also, it just felt wrong. Burton is known for his visionary genius, and rightly so. Batman, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and others not only have great stories, but look and feel brilliant. Alice just didn't look right, it was far too dark and not at all what I imagined, I still can't quite put my finger on it but it just didn't feel right. I much preferred the Disney original.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
(visually) Stunning,"I'm not that familiar with the books and I don't really recall the Disney classic, so forgive me for not comparing those to the movie at hand. Of course I do know the overall story and I have seen the Disney movie, but that was too long ago, to really claim to know the differences and/or advantages of either product.What I do know though, is that this movie works more as a sequel to the Disney film. Alice is older now, but can't remember what happened to her when she was younger. Actually she is thinking those (few) things (she does remember), were dreams. There is a character arc there, though it isn't a big one. It's not like she is going to change completely in the course of her journey. And story-wise there are quite a few holes.Still visually, this movie is fantastic. While it hops along with a nice pace and has a few things happening here and there. And while that might not be satisfying for most people, it is enough to entertain quite a few others. The question that remains to be answered is: Which group do you belong to?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I recommend this movie for viewing,"This is one of the few late Tim Burton films that I really like. Tim Burton has not impressed me in recent years, and I think his films like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Planet of the Apes and Big Fish have failed. This movie is based on one of my favorite novels, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. Tim Burton's directing in the film is very good, and the fact that it has a lot of great visual effects and a pretty well-written story is something I really missed for a long time. I think Mia Wasikowska is a very good choice of actress, she did a great job as Alice and is very sweet in the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is something that no matter how you take the movie, you will be satisfied because she is so great and so funny as the Red Queen."" Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter got mixed reviews, but I personally enjoyed his performance, something I haven't done since his performance in the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lacking depth but visually stunning,"I've eagerly anticipated Tim Burton's latest releases from before I can remember, and with Alice in Wonderland marking his first foray into 3-D, this was no exception. Arriving early at the cinema, we were treated to a live satellite link-up from the world premiere hosted at London's Leicester square. Watching Prince Charles shake hands with almost everyone involved in the film was not my idea of fun but it certainly made an interesting change to the cinema experience. After the formalities he was shown into the cinema and the film could eventually start for him at the world premiere, and me in the comfort of Cineworld Didsbury.Unlike previous adaptations of Alice, Burton takes the viewer on a new journey, only loosely following aspects of Carrol's classic stories 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the looking glass' to create an entirely new experience. Although this may disappoint fans of the stories, there are still a lot of familiar characters to be seen as Alice is portrayed as a young woman returning to the world she first envisaged as a child - almost like an unofficial sequel to Carrol's work.Having only seen two films in 3-D prior to Alice in Wonderland; Coraline and Avatar, I was still unsure whether 3-D was more than just a gimmick, however, it certainly enhanced the visual aspect of the film, bringing life to Burton's dark and mysterious world.There is some fantastic casting within the film, especially Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and although the computer generated effects used to render the characters are impressive, I was left longing for the extravagant costumes that Burton fans are used to seeing in his earlier films - Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands come to mind. Despite this, we still see a glimpse of Burton's once awe-inspiring creations with a number of weird creatures that inhabit Wonderland, as well as some suitably creepy decapitated heads that serve as stepping stones in a castle moat.Putting aside a few moments that young children may find scary, this is definitely a family movie, with elements of humour clearly aimed at the younger audiences. One such moment comes near the end of the film when Johnny Depp displays his 'funderwhacking' abilities, and whilst that phrase may excite people who have yet to see the film, for me it merely conjures up a horrendous image that I would rather forget! Most people will have high expectations of the film due to the calibre of actors and actresses involved but I have seen all of them in much better performances, apart from Barbara Windsor - it's nice to not see her face for once, as Burton does not devote enough screen time to any one of the multitude of characters that inhabit Wonderland.Although Alice is not a landmark film by any means, I cannot deny that I was soon absorbed in the story, despite its numerous flaws. If you do decide to head to the cinema, make sure you see it in 3-D, as this definitely played a big part in my enjoyment of the film. I doubt I would watch Alice in Wonderland again but would certainly recommend it for families and young children.7/10If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:Coraline, Labyrinth, Laputa: Castle In The Sky, The Fall",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The acting was terrible and the writing was so rushed and not well told at all.I normally don't write bad movie reviews, but this time I had to.

Fantastic,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Tim Burton. I have seen several people bash this movie with phrases such as, ""I hate Tim Burton."" If you hate Tim Burton films, it follows logically that you won't like this one, either. I went into the theater hoping for something amazing, and this movie certainly lived up to my expectations. The dialogue was witty, the effects were beautifully done. The colors used throughout the movie really added to the story, from the bloody red of the Red Queen's castle to the charred black of parts of Underland. The music, composed by Danny Elfman, was an excellent complement to the film, adding to the mood without being distracting. The camera work was also great, with the subtle angles I expect now from a Burton film. I WILL say that it is likely that the 3D version will be hindered by this. I saw the RealD version, but I would imagine 3D would be annoying. Finally, the acting was great. Depp really brought the Mad Hatter to life in a way only he could - with the crazy aspects of Jack Sparrow and the quiet concern shown in his more serious roles. Bonham-Carter created the callous insanity of the Red Queen the same way she did Mrs. Lovett. Hathaway managed to create a ""good"" character who was, in her own way, nearly as mad as the Hatter. And of course, Wasikowska managed to portray both sides of Alice - the scared, confused girl and the confident fighter. All in all, I give it 9 stars and will definitely be buying this as soon as it comes out. Finally, to those who are iffy about seeing the movie because of the dance, know this: it is at most 30 seconds long and had been mentioned and promised numerous times throughout the film. It wasn't the completely random, movie-wrecking scene that many critics are portraying it as.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My friends and I had a wonderful time watching this.However, this movie isn't exactly for everyone. First off, you have to have fun with it. You can't too critical because there are some pretty random points that make no sense, but I found that even better. I guess being a Tim Burton fan has some impact.

An underwhelming effort from a great team,"This film is about Alice returning to Wonderland after she has grown up, and faces her true destiny as described by the magical scroll.""Alice in Wonderland"" is the first film I watched in 3D. When they played a 3D trailer of ""How To Train Your Dragon"" before ""Alice in Wonderland"", I thought 3D looked very good. Everything looked so real and so layered. When the actual ""Alice in Wonderland"" film came on, I was very disappointed. The 3D was not obvious at all, especially in real life scenes. This was not helped by the fact that most of the background in many scenes were blurred, which made the 3D less pronounced. There are only a few scenes that the 3D was obvious, such as when Alice falls through the hole, or when the White Queen prepares a magical potion, but you can tell these scenes exist only for the sake of showcasing the mighty 3D technology.Though ""Alice in Wonderland"" may have trademark Tim Burton fascinating visuals, it still cannot make up for the underwhelming plot. The story is less than engaging, with little ups and downs. The attempts to make jokes fall flat, while ""off with their heads"" are too overdone. I cannot help but feel disappointed by ""Alice in Wonderland"", which I am likely to forget in a short while.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Tim Burton movie that's just as fun for adults as well as older kids...,"When Tim Burton came out with his take on the classic kid's story Alice In Wonderland, very few people wondered if it could do wonders at the box office. It did. In big numbers. The results are mixed. While the CGI and settings of the film are pretty good, the plot becomes more darker and unsuitable for young kids who might find this movie to be too scary. They're right. Unlike what Burton did with the Willy Wonka story, Alice is a much better story. It's the best live-action Alice story ever and the newcomer who plays Alice is amazing. I saw it in 2D since they made it look 3D after filming was done. To date, this movie is Tim Burton's most popular ever, beating out Batman. A family classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not much Carroll, but a visual treat","This film reminds me of one of those recipes where you take all the pulp out of something like a red pepper or an eggplant, chop it all up, add lots of other things, stuff it all back in and bake the stuffed object at a high temperature for a goodly time. The result is interesting but doesn't bear much relationship to the original. Technically the film is a sequel rather than an adaptation of the original books by Lewis Carroll, but while much use is made of the physical aspects of Carroll's characters the essence of the books, the absurd logic and the teasing ideas is displaced by a fairly conventional kid's adventure story – Avatar for the under 12s.Nevertheless the whole thing is visually splendid and beautifully rendered in 3-D. Mia Wasikowska is a gorgeous 19 year old Alice and the supporting cast of great and famous British and (odd) American actors can hardly be faulted. Even 92 year old Michael Gough popped up as the voice of the Dodo. Anne Hathaway's make-up made her look more like a New Orleans brothel keeper than the White Queen, and Crispin Glover's Stayne was less comic than was called for, but by and large the main parts are very well done. Johnny Depp as the only mildly Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red (""off with his head)"" Queen were right in character and Stephen Fry positively purred his way along as the Cheshire Cat.We might have all read the books in this case, but Tim Burton was not out to give us a faithful adaptation. Disney as producers has not always done well with Alice in Wonderland – an interesting animated version which followed the books closely tanked in 1952 – and this time the studio was taking no chances. The few kids at the screening I saw seemed to like it well enough but there wasn't quite the enthusiasm I saw in ""Avatar.""",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good movie...if it wasn't for Disney,"At first, I didn't even know that this was a different plot to most Alice in Wonderland films, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a fresh take on the old classic. Initially, I wasn't sure it would be much, due to the appalling quality of films made in recent years. The film starts off quite slowly, with very little happening in the opening few minutes, and what does happen is entirely irrelevant to the plot. Once Alice finds her way down the rabbit hole, things start to get going. I enjoyed the dark atmosphere, being quite Harry-Potteresque at times. I liked the CG effects, with many of the characters either lovable or reflecting their actor's appearance while maintaining the fantasy element. This film's triumph though, it its casting. Helena Bonham-Carter makes for a superb Red Queen, and is by far the most amusing character in the entire film. Johnny Depp, who I regard as the only good American actor apart from John Malkovich, is also very good as the Mad Hatter, possessing yet another virtually flawless accent. Matt Lucas was a surprise for me, but I felt that he was an excellent choice as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, bringing just the right naivety to them.The film runs very smoothly for most of the beginning and middle parts, with some features that I thought would never make it into a Disney film. Sadly though, things take a turn for the worse when the climax of the film comes around. The battle scene is very mundane, predictable and just didn't grip me at all. I'm reminded strongly of the battle with the Basilisk in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, except that scene is now 8 years old and puts the fight with the Jabberwocky to shame. The CG effects in 2010 look rather pitiful in comparison to those in 2002. The Basilisk looked so much more believable, not to mention the entire scene was more suspenseful, despite the fact I already knew the outcome of it from reading the book.But the battle scene is nothing compared to just a few seconds of insanity that follow it. Johnny Depp's dance can only be described as a brain explosion on the part of the writers. I simply sat, staring at the screen, my only thought being ""what were they thinking?!"". It is truly one of the worst moments in any film, something that doesn't fit in with the rest of the film at all. Not even the music fits in with the Victorian setting of the movie. Johnny Depp should be ashamed of the brief seconds he spent dancing in this abomination of an ending. Speaking of which, I have seen many a cringe-worthy ending of American films in my time, but none as ludicrous or inconsequential as this. It is as if there were two sets of writers for this film. One for the middle, and one for the beginning an end. The two sections seem to bare no resemblance to one another, and may as well be from different films.In my opinion, this film was gunning for an 8 out of 10, if it wasn't for the final few minutes which went from bland to inexplicable. It begs the question, did Tim Burton have anything to do with this excruciating ending? Or did Disney take over when it was nearly finished, and attempted to tie any hint of a loose end up and turn this once promising film into another piece of Hollywood tripe to be thrown onto the dung-heap that constitutes the majority of American cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton is losing his brilliance one movie at a time.,"It was to hope a total reinvention of Wonderland, with the twist that Burton gives to his films, but sadly, this version on LSD of ""Alice in Wonderland"" is not much than that, because where previous Burton films shined, this one failed. There's not a chance in getting involved with the characters (as we did with both sweet Eddies - Scissorhands and Wood -), and the adventure they are living is as plain as a 32' LED TV.Alice's journey starts at the common place of social inadequacy and keeps the track of the character that finds itself in the way of its own faith and finally accepts it. Nothing new.But here comes the new stuff. For the first time Burton directs a story with a female main character. Due to his possible inability to make it strong and interesting enough, Alice is a poor character and it throws away the good chance of taking advantage of Mia Wasikowska's talent. The responsibility of keeping the attention of the public falls again on the capable hands of Johnny Depp, that this time, couldn't make The Hatter character enjoyable. But actually, with that twisted concept of it (those hideous eyes, the hair and the hysteric personality) no actor can make it enjoyable.It's a shame that all the commotion that the movie has caused is finally translated into an eternally boring movie experience that could have been resumed in over 40 minutes.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Why, Tim Burton?","If there's one filmmaker working today whose style is utterly unmistakable, it's Tim Burton. Since his debut, he's proudly and consistently upheld his many visual and metaphysical tropes with TLC. These tenets include: ostentatious design and execution of the delectably twisted and dark kind, saccharine sentimentality (with perhaps the exception of Sweeney Todd), and a dramatis personae of irascible characters both one with his darkness and yet completely unaware of it. But Burton's self-aware devotion to this Formula* has palliated his once-fresh perspective, familiarity subsequently turning odd and unconventional into a recycled bore and, thus, the complete opposite. The biggest offender of this cumbersome rehashing is the director's latest, a highly ambitious undertaking: a live-action adaptation of the Lewis Carroll classic, Alice in Wonderland.We start off with the mandatory flashback to the youth of our heroine, the eponymous Alice. Her ambitious father (Marton Csokas) gallantly interrupts an important meeting to tend to his post-nightmare daughter. She proceeds to describe her bad dream, foreshadowing her coming adventures in Wonderland, and questions her own sanity. Her father replies (and I'm paraphrasing): ""Yes, you're mad. But the best people are."" It's a nice sentiment, and one that fittingly pertains with the status quo evident here. It's almost distraction enough from the hilariously bad performance given by the ever-mugging Csokas. It's a brief turn, which makes the efficacy of his awfulness all the more surprising.Years later, Alice (listless newcomer Mia Wasikowska) is nineteen and doomed to an arranged marriage to a complete stiff. The ensuing events are banalities sparse in consequence, necessary to increase the wonder of Wonderland by contrast, but dull nonetheless. Ironically, the title setting is surprisingly unimaginative. Burton's Wonderland is one of generic outlandishness; large, colorful flora, discolored skies of a dismal murk, and vast landscapes defined by one prominent topographical feature. The visual effects are embarrassingly unconvincing, and the 3-D does little to help; as always, the newfound cinematic dimension is merely a gimmick, a nicety, and here it once again proves that we still have quite a long way to go before the technique effects an audience viscerally. Obvious and absent the awe and immersion that it's director presence suggests and should guarantee, Wonderland's uninspired design is another victim of the extenuation of the Burton Formula, and the movie's disappointing lack of scope and half-realization.Tonally, Alice in Wonderland is dead. It's neither comedic nor dramatic, due to an absence of intentional humor and urgency, respectively, and with the pacing of a snail, this renders the whole experience quite drab. Now, I'm sure the acidic eccentricities of Carroll and Burton sounds a treat, yes? Sadly, Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton only inherit the concept and characters of Carroll's legendarium, opting instead to incorporate their own story. What follows is a predictable hybrid of the established Wonderland scribes, absent the warmth and wit. Alice arrives in the mystical world, her ""destiny"" (and the movie's climax) is hastily affirmed, and thus everything beforehand feels like filler. Impending peril is intended to grip the story (what with the omnipresent tyranny of Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen), but last-minute and inconceivable resolutions whenever danger arises dissipates the drama.The cast lend some help in the way of salvaging things. Hathaway is underused, but nails the delicate-nature of the White Queen. There's also an abundance of British character actors at the movie's disposal. Like Harry Potter, it's a roll-call of workaday thespians: Stephen Fry (Cheshire Cat, actually acting, not just reading lines), Michael Sheen (White Rabbit, his voice unrecognizable, as usual), Christopher Lee (Jabberwocky, two lines of utter captivation), Timothy Spall (the Bloodhound, slowly becoming a Burton affiliate), Alan Rickman (Caterpillar, simply perfect), etc. Each could have literally phoned in their performances, but no doubt the gravity and beloved stature of Carroll's work was enough to compel faithfulness. They're what keeps proceedings afloat and only they encapsulate the spirit of the material.Needless to say, the show is stolen by Helena Bonham Carter. Thrusting herself wholeheartedly into the role of the Red Queen, she's clearly having a ball here. Bonham Carter invests in the part, going far and beyond the call of duty, turning a thin antagonist into a well-honed character; the Red Queen is greedy, selfish, nefarious, but also naive, and often comes across as someone burdened with long-existing insecurities (the writing conveys this, but Bonham Carter expands upon what is merely hinted at). Her childish totalitarianism makes for a diverting and inoffensive baddie, and also serves as the main source of the movie's genuine laughs.That other staple of Burton cinema, Johnny Depp, is on hands here, donning a Carrot Top wig to play one of Carroll's most immortal and recognizable creations, the Mad Hatter. On the capricious and whimsical side of the Depp spectrum instead of stoic and near-comatose, this turn is another addition to the equally-wearing output of a man dubiously revered for versatility. I don't mean to sound irreverent, as Depp is a talented actor, but it's been seven years since his last truly impressive performance, and his need to play characters of substance-less recondite is a waste of his time. Here, he's not quite teeth-grating, but he's still not exactly as fun as he could be. Like Bonham Carter, he attempts obliqueness, here by gauging the Hatter's glee on a trippy meter of eccentric and downright maniacal depending on the situation at hand. It's a minor victory for character depth, but it's a shame Depp insists on delivering a large portion of his lines in an unintelligible Scottish accent.Alice in Wonderland is bad. In fact, I'm shocked at just how much I dislike it. I hate to condemn a movie for primarily this alone, but my biggest problem with it is that it's boring. Burton will undoubtedly benefit from immediately distancing himself from adaptations and the Formula.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Displaying Muchness,"Greetings again from the darkness. A sequel?? How dare they? When I first heard that Tim Burton was taking on Lewis Carroll's story, I was very excited. What better director to take on this most peculiar work than the man who brought us Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Beetlejuice, Batman and others? The man is a visual genius. But a sequel??Early in the film, we find an almost 20 year old Alice being proposed to in front of a large crowd of high society types. She spots a rabbit in the bushes and excuses herself, chases the rabbit, and quickly falls down the rabbit hole. The wild ride begins.Mr. Burton's visual feast takes Alice (Mia Wasikowska) through many of the situations we (and she) are familiar with. The main difference is this is her ""return"" trip to Wonderland and she is no longer a little girl. She is told her destiny is to defeat the Jabberwocky so that the evil Red Queen's ruling power can be assumed by her sister, the good white queen. This destiny takes Alice through many sites and characters we don't often see.Johnny Depp is cast as her friend the Mad Hatter. His ""mad"" look is achieved through a bird's nest of red hair, giant yellow saucer-sized eyes and make-up that would make Lady Gaga jealous. The Red Queen, who captures the Hatter, is played wonderfully by Mr. Burton's wife, Helena Bonham Carter. She has marvelous voice inflections and is as quick with an ""off with their heads"" as she is a ""I need a pig"". Her sister, the White Queen, is played oddly but beautifully by Anne Hathaway. The sibling rivalry is a hoot.We are treated to voice work from three of the best ever: Christopher Lee, Michael Gough and Alan Rickman. Unfortunately, Mr. Lee and Mr. Gough have VERY limited lines, but it was nice of them to contribute. Also contributing are Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall and Matt Lucas.Once I adjusted to the fact that this was not a re-imagining of the original works, but rather more of a sequel or next step, the film worked fine for me. What I missed was the amazing word play of the great Lewis Carroll. Of course, anyone who actually understood his writings will probably be a bit bored with this version. Luckily, that affects very few!Mr. Burton's visuals are successful and will probably appeal to most ages. The 3-D seems to have been an after-thought and is most effective with the really cool Cheshire cat. The youngest kids will struggle to follow the Mad Hatter's accent-heavy dialogue, but the pictures and characters (Tweedle-Dee and Dumb) should be enough to keep them entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Extremely surprising! An oddball, but highly good to watch for fun!","Since around the 1980s and 1990s, Tim Burton has capture many attention's eyes from the screen to the public eye for his dark work since he created short films like Frankenweenie and Vincent, and for working nearly 7 times with Johnny Depp, it never gets old! But now...Tim Burton takes a new turn on a priceless classic movie everyone knows and love and that's Alice in Wonderland! Lots of people have complain about this being a remake to the 1951 animated classic by the Walt Disney man himself, but no. It's more than different. It's dazzling in it's dark twisted ways! In the 2010 new version, Alice is at an engagement party where a stuck-up snooty man asks her to marry him; Alice isn't too fond by that idea so she tells everyone that she needs a moment by herself and think about it; and where does she go? To find the rabbit hole, only to end up falling to a place called Wonderful! The legendary director mister Tim Burton himself has pick a wonderful cast; and I'm not just talking about Johnny Depp or his girlfriend for 9 years Helena Bonham Carter. There's also Anne Hathaway who came a very long way since her role in The Princess Diaries playing as The White Queen in this film. And newcomer Mia Wasikowska as Alice makes her part in the movie very well done and nicely.I've heard lots about this news for the movie since one year ago when they show trailers of it and it just blew me away, but when I saw it, I was surprised how differently it turn out to be.It's a little bit odd than most of Tim Burton's old work before, but you won't stop enjoying it till it's over. I rate it 9 out of 10 stars! Johnny Depp and everyone in it will be making you feel brilliantly mad!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Johnny Depp's Adventures in Wonder Land...,"(And Alice came for the ride).This is not a remake of any Alice in Wonderland film. Nor is it a film made from the book. It is a re-imagining of the Lewis Carol story that will not appeal to everyone. It clumsily splices the two books (""Alice"" and ""Looking glass"") together and the result is a film that somehow manages to hang together and is actually quite entertaining.This film has almost everything against it. A Gothic director who destroyed Charlie and the Chocolate Factor (though I am a fan of his other work). A non existent set comprised of green screens that would make even George Lucas have a fit . Matt Lucas' vocal talents. The list goes on but while this film should be the worst thing ever to hit our screens it turned out to be pretty good.This film features Johnny Depp as the mad hatter (who's part in the tale has increased fourfold) and Mia Wasikowska (chosen for her ""gravity"") as Alice. Both pull off reasonable performances, however, Depp's acting can be cringing at parts and Mia can be wooden.My only other snipe at this film is the fact that it's not all that child friendly. Mr Burton this is a children's story, not Pan's Labyrinth. Images such as a large creatures eyes being pulled out and a lake of heads are among those I'm not too sure are suitable for children but there you go.So if you're in for a bizarre fantasy story that doesn't really make sense why not give it a go. I doubt you're gonna want to see a hundred times but the film is certainly one of the collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Awesome Movie.

She is just the perfect Alice, and she fit in the character, I hope she can appear in more movies from now on. Johnny Depp did a great work too, as always, (4 me) kinda crazy and extravagant, but thats what i love about him. Helena Bonham Carter, well i almost didn't notice her acting for her big head, which was cool, and I also think she is a great actress. Anne Hathaway didn't appear a lot in the movie, but enough for her character.As always, Tim Burton is creating extravagant and crazy things, and he is one of my favorites directors.If you don't want to use your imagination, or see funny, wonderful and crazy stuff, then better don't waste your money.Guess I Don't have more to say...

Planet of the ALICE (another Burton Revision),"I wanted to say I loved it but I can't. It was pretty to view, and I have to admit that it was worth the price of admission. However after seeing Burton do Sweeny Todd such justice, with his darker vision, I expected more.To be pithy; here is why this film went down the rabbit-hole for me:Aside from the ""Queen"" the cast including Depp, Hathaway, and some good character actors, were not used to great measure. There was no real connection between them and the audience. As in The Wizard of Oz and Narnia we wanted to join the quest. Here we were merely hitch hikers through a living Nightmare Before Alice.And perhaps it's just me If I am going to see a retelling of a classic story, regardless of its popularity, then please retell it. I mean how many people would read Alice in Wonderland if it were published again word for word by a different author? Why are storytellers on film so different? I man after all were talking Tim Burton, not Gus Van Sant or Rob Zombie. You are truly a different caliber director.Without the beautiful effects it's a meandering Neverending Story. I think Burton is a visionary ""Gothic"" director. I just don't think he added enough of his staple to this. Perhaps if it were darker, LIKE TODD, it would have added something to a story that has been done to a Madhatter's TEA!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
an abomination,"I have been enchanted with the story of Alice in Wonderland my whole life. I read it for the first time as a child of 11 and was immediately under its spell; I read it twice more as an adult and it lost nothing of its charm.I was ecstatic over the prospect of a big budget new adaptation of this classic.When a friend of mine who had viewed it before me mentioned that a 19-year-old Alice escapes down a rabbit hole to run away from an undesired betrothal, my reaction was ""Huh? I don't remember that from the book.""Nevertheless, I went to see the movie with a sense of excited anticipation.Less than half hour into the movie my excited anticipation was dashed upon the rocks. This was NOT the Alice in Wonderland I knew and loved. The phrase ""artistic license"" popped into my head, but even that phrase would not describe the travesty wrought by Tim Burton.The last time I had such an angry reaction to a movie was when I went to see ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" Both movies took something well-known and loved by many and twisted it into something entirely different and unrecognizable. In the case of Alice in Wonderland, I couldn't help but ask: ""Why even bother calling it Alice in Wonderland?"" Tim Burton simply cannibalized Lewis Carroll's original beloved characters and created his own storyline involving dark conflict and warring factions. (If anything, there were more elements of The Wizard of Oz in this movie than of Lewis Carroll's classic.)If you're a technophile and are interested in nothing more than special effects (and there must be many of you out there judging by all the hoopla generated by this movie's being in 3D), by all means go see it. But if you, like me, are enamored of the original Alice in Wonderland story as written by Lewis Carroll, do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.All in all, as someone who has been so touched by the story of Alice in Wonderland, I found this movie a total abomination. An abomination. Lewis Carroll must be rolling in his grave.P.S. - If anyone is interested in seeing a truly loving (and accurate) re-telling of this tale, I highly recommend the 1999 TV-movie starring the adorable (and age appropriate) Tina Majorino.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Reducing Gold to Dross,"I looked forward to this movie since the story has been a favorite for years and I've also have been a great fan of Jonny Depp. I have to say I finished the movie disappointed on two counts. My biggest disappointment was in the the way the writers took Mr. Carrol's wonderful story of nonsensical lightness and turned it into yet another Hollywood tale of cops and robbers or cowboys and indians. The delightfulness of the original story has been hacked into unrecognizable pieces by conflating Carroll's two stories and the Jabberwocky poem. The emphasis on violence is particularly disturbing and makes it evident the screenwriters had neither the heart or wit of Lewis Carroll. It makes the film unsuited for small children. When these stories were given to these screen writers it was a case of casting pearls before swine.Mr. Depp's role as the Mad Hatter was interesting but not great. Largely it seemed a reprise of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Perhpas the Buton/Depp collaboration has gotten stale.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Style but Lack in Story,"Alice in Wonderland is a movie that takes you on a trip through a world of colorful imagination. It does not follow exactly the Disney animated version but all the same characters are present. The costume and set design sets this film apart and gives it a unique artistic style. But what makes the movie is Johnny Depp, as the Mad Hatter.Johnny Depp does a brilliant job creating a character that brings life to the film. His ability to use all aspects of acting from verbal lines to body language and gestures is fantastic. The Mad Hatters great lines, giving credit to Linda Woolverton for writing, brought a comedic touch to the film, while not distracting from the story line. The design of his costume is so intricate down to the eye color that it just brings his character to life.As the film progresses we are taken into a true wonderland of color and design that is much different than other films. From the costumes of each character, to the set, each had a story to tell. The use of color did not give it a cartoon feel, yet you still got the feel of being in another world.Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice, was not the best choice of actresses for the part. She performs well but in the beginning her performance is not as believable as it could have been. There is supposed to be a change in attitude in the character though the film. She shows that through her acting, but it was nothing spectacular by any means. She has the new age acting, where the acting is very life like, and almost purposely mistake like. The storyline is not anything superb but it flows and keeps the viewer involved, the design and feel of the movie is what sets it apart from most other films.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice in the Palace,"It's definitely one of the more commercially marketable Tim Burton movies, which may be a result of doing it with Disney. But there are a few little drawbacks for me. I like Mia Wasikowska as Alice in general, but there are a few times when she didn't seem to be emoting quite enough. She seems to act out the gravity of her situation well enough, in general, but, for instance, in the scene where she finds the small door and keeps getting big and small until she can get through the door, it simply felt like she was doing the actions because the script told her to. I may have been expecting too much, but it seemed like she was just going through the steps.Also, the 3D aspect feels a bit inconsistent. At times, there are some nicely impressive shots, but at other times it doesn't seem all that different from a 2D film. I had heard that Tim Burton shot the film with a standard camera and then had the footage processed into 3D (sort of like what they did with the Nightmare Before Christmas 3D) so that may have made me more critical when I watched it and maybe I'm being a bit too harsh, but there it is.Other than those issues, the visual aspect of the movie is actually quite creative, inventive, ... um ... made-up-I've, and ... Tim-Burton-I've. Don't expect the original Alice story. (Either one, since many people are content to forget that the Tweedles are actually from ""Through the Looking-Glass"", not ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"".) Tim Burton has restructured the story since he felt--and rightly so--that Alice's stories are more a series of short encounters rather than one overarching story. The restructured story now ties it all into one meaningful adventure, and I think it works quite well.On the whole, not my favorite Burton, but it's a good movie and I feel comfortable recommending it. (Though unless you feel you really have to see it in 3D, you should probably save your money and see the 2D version as it doesn't really take full advantage of the possibilities of the 3D format.)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"very entertaining, but some characters and plot lines could have been improved","Our favorite character was the Red Queen. Very well acted and costumed. The Mad Hatter looked great and was generally well acted, but his accent oddly shifted at times and he went from being mad to sometimes very sane which was confusing. The White Queen had these annoying hand movements we couldn't ignore and her palace and helpers were all rather uninspired. That character could have been a lot more creative. The Red Queen's pirate friend had awkward CGI movements and he too could have been a more creative character. I wont tell you what happens at the end, but we found it predictable, expected and even out of character for Alice. Overall, it was enjoyable, but had some issues.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Looking through the glass,"I went to see this in theatres today with a friend of mine from church. This movie brings back the childhood memories of Alice returning to Wonderland in her teen years and I never seen her do that. Johnny Depp did a good job playing The Mad Hatter (w/ red hair) How silly is that ? He made me laughed. In this story Alice is on her quest to rescue her friends from danger with the help from the White Queen. My favorite part is Alice ""trying to get back to her normal size"" and finding herself in the middle of nowhere where she can go on a quest in Wonderland where she meets her friends again. ALICE IN WONDERLAND is based on ""Looking Through The Glass"" novel and a remake version (similar) to RETURN TO OZ (Disney's 1984-Wizard of OZ Sequel). Its like Dorothy had returned to Oz to see whats going on at Emerald City.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
109 deadening minutes,"Like many in my generation, I first came across Tim Burton after seeing his 1989 version of Batman. That was the highest grossing film of the year and it was the most profitable Batman movie until 2008's The Dark Knight. But the success was not just monetary. It was also a critical darling. What could we not love about it? a dark and gritty story, Jack Nicholson playing a mad man with a purple suit, Robert Wuhl as an ace reporter and a magnificent (If not exaggerated) Danny Elfman score.Batman made Tim Burton a star director and it gave him power that he probably never imagined having. But the man could not handle so much power. Perhaps no other director is as polarizing as the creator of Edward Scissorhands (A darn good film). He commands the loyalty of legions of mall goths the world over but at the same time causes the irritation of pretty much anyone else.I wont go as far as to call him a bad director but the movies he's had the most control over seem to be his worst. The Tim Burton style that was so well done in 1990 has run it's course in 2010.I went to see this movie with very low expectations and while it was not an offensively bad movie, it was still a very tedious hour and 40 minutes. Everything that is wrong with a Burton film was back with a vengeance in ""Alice in Wonderland"". A very bad case of style over substance. And not very good style to boast.The one thing I was looking forward to was Danny Elfman's score. If Hans Zimmer could make ""Pearl Harbor"" enjoyable then surely Elfman could do the same for ""Alice"" right? answer is no. Even the score was amazingly sub-par.Seems like even Disney knew they had a stinker if they decided to release the movie on DVD after only 3 months. But don't get confused, not all is lost with this film. It has some very nice make-up, wardrobe, facial expressions, voice acting and visuals.Everything else? just plain tedious. Oh and the 3D? non-factor. I recommend you buy and read a nice book instead of seeing this movie. Don't even rent it, wait until it's on HBO or network television. You'll thank me later.I'm sure there's a market for this kind of junk but I am also pretty sure they are the Hot Topic crowd.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clever.,"This movie version of ""Alice is Wonderland"" is surprisingly intelligent.It takes the main elements of the classical story, set 13 years later against the tyrannical rule of Red Queen, thus setting up the archetypal ""quest"" story cleverly incorporating the book's Jabberwocky poem.Bookending this ""quest"" is the 'real world' story of a Victorian girl coming of age and gaining the courage to take control of her life against social pressures and expectations.In terms of literary ingenuity I think it's terrific - provided you're familiar with (and a big fan of) the original Alice story.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Soulless, by the numbers and drained of redeeming strangeness – hardly a 'wonderland'","If ever there was a match seemingly tailor made in cinematic heaven, the fusion of Lewis Carroll's cheerfully strange children's fable Alice in Wonderland and Tim Burton, celebrated for his equally bizarre and beautifully grotesque cinematic aesthetics would seem to be it. And yet. For so definitive a pairing, the viewer is never left without a sense of want for more - an elusive sense of lacking throughout. And then the reality of the experience ultimately settles in, yielding a bounty of profound disappointment - Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a project so handpicked for success that it could never have emerged as anything but what it is: the latest in a slew of films geared for great promise, yet ultimately saddled with being a fundamentally soulless, functionable yet frustratingly by-the-numbers piece of mainstream entertainment.For all the talk of the project being darker, quirkier and edgier than past incarnations of Carroll's cherished tale, it is a remarkable experience to see dark, quirky and edgy be distilled into such an innocuous, harmless slab of comfortable, conventional film-making. There is a perpetual sense of narrative boxes being ticked: the stifling, claustrophobic aristocratic home life in Alice's 'real world', the array of visual trickery, jaw dropping sets and colourful, memorable characters, all introduced in turn for the sake allowing them all their moment, the necessary exposition for the sake of elucidating viewers unaccustomed to Carroll's world, the reveal of the hero's perilous quest and her requisite struggle with acceptance and 'coming of age'. It feels unsettling to see Burton, a filmmaker previously associated with jolting or at least tweaking expectations, delivering plot point after plot point in so cozy, docile and gormless a fashion, as if delivering the familiar formula with additional pablum rather than shaking it up.This is not to say that Alice in Wonderland is a downright poor film - the standard of quality elements on display remains impressive throughout. It is simply the perpetual sense of the film as such an obvious construction, as if slapped together in a factory from a mould designed for maximum comfortable entertainment, which undercuts all its more laudable elements. Gutted is Carroll's penchant for clever wordplay, subversive mind games or surrealist touches, in favour of a tame adventure/redemption story, with even the stranger characters and settings seemingly inserted for the sake of crafting the illusion of innovation. Equally, the constant references to Alice's previous trip to Wonderland, rather than providing an insightful rumination on the echoing of cultural narratives, instead feel muddled and unwieldly, culminating in a clumsy parable attempting to outline the inevitability of one's actions while also championing (implicitly impossible) individual empowerment, making for an unbalanced thematic centre.Even Burton's Wonderland, while providing an enjoyable mess of colour and twisted forms, evoking dregs of fascination (the castle moat requiring passage over decapitated human heads is a nicely grotesque touch, albeit one out of place in the overall kid-friendly veneer), feels a tiresomely constructed affair, as if cobbled together by a novice attempting to 'do' Burton rather than the legendary director himself. Even the much heralded 3D effects, while fun, do little to add to any immersive sense of environment or fantasy awe. And Danny Elfman's score leaves one wondering if any traces of his previous flair for enthusiastic, memorable themes remains intact, as his latest work only serves to hammer out banal musical cliché after cliché, further accentuating the overall bland and innocuous feel.Similarly, the cast run the risk of coasting by on their ideal casting rather than mustering up enough motivation to truly sell their performances. As Alice, Mia Wasikowska encapsulates the overall feel through her performance: serviceably charismatic, balancing moments of wide-eyed innocence with hard worn maturity, yet tiresomely bland and lacking any real spark. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter delivers yet another cheerfully deranged loon, but the novelty of his eccentricities wears perilously thin, making his bulging green eyes and garrulously fluctuating accents still lack the necessary punch to distinguish his Hatter from past oddball creations. Likewise is Helena Bonham Carter's petulant Red Queen, coasting on apparent autopilot and lacking the vindictive leering to make her ""Off with their heads!"" really hit home. Anne Hathaway emerges in a more favourable light as the White Queen, subversively twisting the ethereal, gossamer royalty clichés with an undercurrent of irritable edge, and offering one of the film's few traces of subtlety. Such is a quality sorely lacking in the awkwardly stretched Crispin Glover's Red Knave, one of the most harmless 'creepy evil' characters in years, and Matt Lucas' comic relief twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, whose banter is so boring and banal one is left debating the purpose of their inclusion at all. The celebrity-voiced animals prove more endearing, particularly Stephen Fry's sumptuously oily and sanguine Cheshire Cat and Alan Rickman's gleefully grumpy Caterpillar, but one is left lamenting the peerless Christopher Lee's booming tones as the ferocious Jabberwocky being reduced to a single line, as shameless a piece of stunt casting as his pointless appearance in 2007's The Golden Compass. It is telling that the most enjoyable and fully realized character is the deranged March Hare, a consistent background player, who, through continually throwing crockery around and unhinged cackling, injects the film with crucially lacking dashes of spontaneity and energy.There is undeniable entertainment to be found in Burton's Wonderland: exciting battles, strangely stylized sets and quirky characters. But it is the near flaunted sense of artificiality, of the consciously constructed package of the affair, which leaves a continual disconnect between the viewer and true engagement or enjoyment. Perhaps the involvement of Disney should have suggested such a docile, friendly take, but for all averse to quality yet blandly assembled fantasy adventure, this is one rabbit hole worth staying out of.-5.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

As Mad as a Hatter,"Now, before I begin actually reviewing the film, it is important you know a few things. 1) I am a huge Tim Burton Fan 2) I am a HUGE Johnny Depp fan 3) I have been waiting on this film for 2 years if not more. There, Now we can begin.I'm going to try to be as unbiased as possible, but I cannot promise anything. I've been waiting on this film for what seems like forever, and I have to say I am absolutely thrilled with the final film. Last night, I got to pre-screen the film in 3D and it's absolutely breathtaking. I mean, it's no 3D Avatar, but the 3D is incredible. Wonderland is absolutely wondrous. The scenery is everything you could hope for and more. Both castles in the film are beautiful, I would love to see replicas somewhere down the road somewhere. Whether as toy models or at a Disney theme park somewhere.The Acting in the film is everything you could as for a Tim Burton film. And they Styling of the movie is amazing. For me, the film reminded me of ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" The acting was quirky like Charlie, while the style of the film was very dark as Sweeney Todd. I loved it!A lot of people say Johnny's portrayal of Mad Hatter was a lot like Willy Wonka, and I have to say I disagree. Wonka was insane. The Mad Hatter is mad. For me, the Hatter had his own personality. And once you see the film, I think you will agree. While in parts, there are similarities, I don't think that it's fair to say the character as a whole is Willy Wonka reincarnated. I guarantee if Wonka and Hatter were able to speak to each other you'd get to very separate individuals..just saying.Helena Bonham Carter was wonderful as the Red Queen. She was probably one of my favorite characters in the film. Utterly brilliant performance.And the rest of the cast was absolutely great as well. But for me, The Hatter and Red Queen stood out just a tad more for me.Go see the film. You won't be disappointed. Don't show up late, that is a very important thing.

"Visually stunning, the plot not so much","The characters especially The Red Queen, played wonderfully by Hannah Bonham Carter, is so likable despite of her being the 'evil queen', conversely the White Queen, played by Anne Hathaway, who is supposed to be the good guy, is having some really bad guy's vibe, her ""what you did is punishable by death but I won't because I took an oath not to"" is very sinister. The friendly Mad Hatter is eccentrically played by Johnny Depp, quite a familiar role for him. The Cheshire cat, voiced by Stephen Fry is also wonderful.The production design is beautiful, the visual effects are top-notch and the costume design is impeccable. The cinematography is terrific, the score is captivating and memorable. But the story isn't quite as imaginative and fresh and feels rather bland, the 'savior trope' and the 'good v evil' concept have been done to death.Overall, Alice in wonderland has a terrific cast, amazing visual effects, and overall decent production value but that isn't enough to redeem the trite plot.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
All flash and no fire,"I am a big fan of the Alice in Wonderland franchise. I love the books, the cartoon, the imagery, the toys- basically everything Alice. I went to see this movie with really high hopes. I had heard they were making the story a bit different, so I was very hyped up. Unfortunately this movie was awful. Not as bad as others I've seen but definitely not worth waiting for.Johnny Depp was as great as he always seems to be, as was Helena Bonham Carter. Alice was very wooden and looked extremely bored. There was no feeling in the movie whatsoever. Anne Hathaway...What can I say about her? Her character was alright, but her face and makeup were so hideous, she was a freak amongst freaks. She is what partially ruined this movie for me. I couldn't stand her movements and especially her makeup.The visuals were lovely and dark, very typical Tim Burton, but soon they became very overwhelming and just distracting. Too much CGI. I also found it hard to hear and understand what people were saying. Another sore point I have is how everyone has a different name. I mean Wonderland isn't even Wonderland- it's Underland. Alice doesn't remember being there, but why? No explanation is given. I mean, in Return to Oz Dorothy was given electric shock therapy, you know? Everyone seemed very one-dimensional and boring.One thing I did like, however, was how some parts of it flashed back to the cartoon Alice that most of us are familiar with. It was great seeing things ""live"" that before had only been seen in a cartoon. Alice also sounds remarkably like the Alice from the cartoon as well. The Queen of Hearts is an amusing character, and I ended up really liking her, although the way she says ""Off with her head"" is distinctly different and I didn't like it. This movie has you flashing to the cartoon but then changing key aspects.All in all, I'd say this is more of a rental movie, or dollar movie. Going to see it full price is sorely advised against. While you're waiting for the movie to start and actually grab you, you find the credits are rolling and it's already over- then you're left wondering,""What just happened? did I like it?"" And the answer to that is a resounding ""No"".",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bit of a disappointment,"Not a bad movie but not particularly good for Tim Burton standards. The special effects are no big deal, the one in «Charlie and Chocolate Factory» looked a lot better. The movement of the characters is not very good. The looks and aesthetics of the movie are not coherent, they do not convince. Anne Hathaway is not up to the job as «White Queen» and his performance is not credible at all. I would never paint there lips in black, they seem a bit out of place, even for wonderland. It just looks to much like an American movie trying to look European and the end is too much «Harry Potterish». Not bad if you are a kid or a teen, not bad for a Disney movie but simply is not convincing and has good as you would expect from Tim Burton.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

By this morning I'm just pi**ed.All the reviewers who say this movie lacks substance, plot, character development, etc are correct.Bottom line: if you've got the $$, take the kids for a mildly entertaining CGI 3D pop commercial Disney movie.

Visually Disappointing?,"I really like this movie, I do. It's fun, it's charming and it is SO Tim Burton-y.But the major problem with this film (aside from Mia Wasikowska's performance) is that is is very visually disappointing. I think the movie's whole aesthetic is to try to present this wondrous, crazy world to us, but most of the time it just looks... ugly. 
The special effects are really not that great, even by 2010 standards, and it's a little distracting at times. 
A few sets do look nice, however, like the Cheshire Cat's tree and the White Queen's castle, but aside from that, most of the design just falls short.Decent film, poor design. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Lacks the ""muchness"" that could have made it great","When Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I doubt he could have imagined that, over a hundred years after their publication, there would be countless attempts to create a definitive version of his tales in other media, efforts which have ranged from modestly successful to downright awful. Ironically, the strengths of Carroll's novels became the biggest challenges directors have faced when trying to adapt Carroll's work; literary nonsense just doesn't translate well into anything beyond the confines of its own pages, and this fact has more often than not been the doom of most of these attempts at adaptation.Knowing full well that this is the case, director Tim Burton has taken on the Herculean task of trying to give Carroll's novels a more traditional sense of plot structure and cohesion while at the same time maintaining some semblance of the whimsical spirit of the source material. What has resulted is a version of Alice in Wonderland which isn't an adaptation of Carroll's work, but a re-envisioning, and one that is, like so many versions of Alice before it, only modestly successful at best.Indeed, under Burton's direction, Alice is no longer a supremely nonsensical story about a bored girl who falls down a rabbit hole and subsequently spends her time wandering in a trippy dimension from bizarre event to bizarre event for no rhyme or reason. It's now a coming of age tale mixed with a bit of female empowerment; not a shock, considering the previous screen writing work of Linda Woolverton (which includes Disney's Mulan and Beauty and the Beast), the scribe of this version of Alice.Burton's Alice trades Carroll's scatterbrained storytelling for a comparatively straightforward plot in which 19-year-old Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska), a rather unconventional young woman living in Victorian-era England, returns to Underland, a place she once stumbled into when she was six but cannot remember anything about. As it turns out, the inhabitants of Underland have been actively seeking her out for some time in order to fulfill a prophecy in which Alice will save Underland from the tyranny of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).What bothered me most about the story was not the conventionality of the plot, but how uneven and under-developed many of the characters were. Had this version of Alice featured characters which were a little more fleshed out in terms of motives, personality and their relationships with other characters, then I feel the more unimaginative aspects of the plot line could have been more easily forgiven. For example, the story would have had a bit more dramatic punch had the filmmakers spent more time delineating Alice's past relationships with the inhabitants of Underland. It's made perfectly clear that many of these creatures and people are Alice's friends, even if she initially cannot remember who they are, but why? Why should she care so much about being the savior of these bizarre people? The lack of true inter-personality between Alice and the denizens of Underland only serves to undermine the gravitas of the story. Similarly, one of the more interesting side aspects of the movie was the deep-rooted animosity between the Red Queen and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), which is alluded to briefly at points throughout the movie but never expanded upon enough to give the climax of the movie the weight it should have had.It seems at times as if Burton was hoping the mere presence and big-screen acumen of cast members such as Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, etc. would make up for the deficiencies of their respective character's scripting. Instead, it only served to allow much of the cast (both live-action and CGI) to drown the movie in scenery-chewing ham, which at times is fun, but does get a bit tiresome after awhile.Regardless, the film is well-cast, and it is indeed mainly the actors that make this movie watchable. Relative newcomer Mia Wasikowska is probably the best of the live-action characters; she brings a very believable sense of earnestness and determination to Alice. As the swishy Mad Hatter, Johnny Depp is both effectively effervescent and melancholy but seems at times to be channeling Captain Jack Sparrow a little more than he should be. Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen and Crispin Glover's slimy Knave of Hearts are both pretty one-dimensional but, for what it's worth, are still fun to hate. Anne Hathaway is woefully underused as a head-in-the-clouds White Queen; she has some of the best comedic and dramatic moments of the movie in her limited amount of screen time. The voice cast of the CGI characters is top-notch, with Stephen Fry, Matt Lucas, Michael Sheen, and Alan Rickman the standouts.Burton's vision of Underland, though not as creative as I'd have liked, is still interesting; unlike the lush, vibrant scenery found in much of Pandora in James Cameron's Avatar, there always seems to be a permeating sense of decay in Underland, as if Underland under the Red Queen is a paradise that is slowly but surely sliding into desolation. The 3-D effects are solid and do make the movie more fun to watch, especially when the Cheshire Cat (my favorite character in the movie overall) is on screen.The movie has many strengths; it's funny at times, it's well-cast, the characters are enjoyable when they're not being excessively overbearing, and it's apparent that a lot of time and effort was put into the production values of the film. But the strengths just barely outweigh the weaknesses, which are a lack of character development, a stubborn reliance on conventionality and style over substance, and a final climatic battle that is both unexciting and painfully uncreativeand not to mention ends with one of the stupidest and most pointless moments I've ever seen in a movie.To paraphrase the Hatter, Burton's Alice in Wonderland is lacking the ""much-ness"" that could have made it a bit ""mucher"" that it wound up being.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ironically, it never feels real","I would say Alice in Wonderland is a moderate disappointment. First of all, the storyline is rushed, you never get the chance to reflect on what's happening before the journey is over.CGI, possibly the most critical element of the entire production, is beautiful from artistic point of view but unconvincing and artificial as an existing world, which is a major let down. Blandly put, it looks great only as a wallpaper. Technically it is at least two classes below Avatar (and the budget was somewhere around 150mln!), especially when you take in account rather mediocre use of 3D.Acting is mixed - definitely the Red Queen is the brightest spot here, although Depp still manages to deliver at his usual level. Unfortunately the central figure - Alice herself - is a major miscast. Her performance seems flat and bored. Furthermore, she doesn't handle the pure green box scenes in a way that more experienced and talented actors do.Overall, if you feel compelled to see it, save some money and don't go to 3D screenings.Strong 6\10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Curiouser and Curiouser.,"A great adaption of one of my favorite stories. Finally in the hands of a capable director, I loved this film. Everything was spot on, from the visuals, characters, acting, and design. There were some pitch perfect portrayals. Stephen Fry is excellent as the Chesire Cat (my favorite version of this cat). Mia is wonderful as Alice. Johnny Depp continues to earn my deep admiration as an actor. His Mad Hatter was spot on, as they say. It was thoroughly enjoyable and I found myself grinning like the Chesire cat at the end. All the way home. I loved the Scottish accents as well. Roger Ebert didn't like the action scenes, but I felt they were a great addition and not too long. It was such a visually brilliant movie. Go see it! You won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not great.  Less would have been more.,"First off. Go see the 2D version. The 3D adds nothing.Tim Burton is my favourite unpredictable director. Sweeney Todd and The Nightmare Before Christmas are both works of genius, but most of the rest have deep flaws. Alice in Wonderland is nearer the former than the latter (although my fellow viewers erred towards the latter).Tim has thrown the kitchen sink at this one. The effects (putting aside the 3D) are at times jaw dropping and some of his little vignettes are a delight (the Red Queen's guilty frogs in particular). And Mrs Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, can surely never have been better in a completely show-stealing role. She is hilarious.But it's too long and it's overloaded with ideas to the point that it begins to wash over you.I like Johnny Depp in this, but my wife didn't. He's mad. But then, he plays a mad hatter.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More wonderment from Burton & Depp,"Normally I wouldn't add my comments to a film that already has 573 comments as of this writing, but I see that reviewers have only given it a 6.7 rating. Alice In Wonderland is much better than that. A 6.7 is for a movie that had a couple of interesting points but was not expertly executed. Or was expertly executed but didn't have much substance. Alice is neither of those. It is an imaginative film presented magnificently.To backtrack a little, I didn't think I'd enjoy the prior Burton/Depp hook-up - Charlie and The Chocolate Factory - as much as I did, so I went into Alice In Wonderland with high expectations. That is usually a recipe for disaster as I am then setting myself up for disappointment. But those expectations were satisfied. The characters were rich. The color was richer and the sets were incredible.I saw this movie at home on DVD, not in 3-D in the theater, and I feel bad that I didn't make the pilgrimage to the theater to see it in its glory, but maybe on the next Depp/Burton collaboration I'll do it. Here in Long Island, 2 3-D tickets would be about $30, and I wasn't sure if Burton/Depp would deliver the goods. They did.Give it a shot. Sit back and enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
dreadful,"So much 3D, so little sense... The movie has hardly anything to with the classic book ""Alice in Wonderland"". That is, besides a few names of main characters, and a couple of misplaced quotes (for instance, it's the Queen who supposed to be able to believe in several impossible things before breakfast, not Alice). Alice is mutated into a kind of medieval ""La Femme Nikita"", completely ruining the rich images and references of the book. Incoherent beginning of the movie (where Alice suddenly show her feminist side) and inane ending (where Alice becomes a kind of startup manager in an emerging market) just add insult to injury.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton Could have gave us some more muchness,"¨You used to be much more...muchier. You've lost your muchness.¨ Those are the words the Mad Hatter tells Alice after she has returned to Wonderland, but now much older as a 19 year old girl who has no memory of her last visit there when she was a little kid. Tim Burton directs this classic Disney tale and he teams up once again with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. They have already worked together in Sweeney Todd, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Depp and Burton have a profound respect for each other and it is always a pleasure to experience one of their creative films. When I heard they were going to work together in this film I was really excited because I knew that Burton could do something memorable with Wonderland. He is one of the most imaginative and creative directors and Wonderland was way ahead of its time when it came out in 1951. I wasn't a big fan of the cartoon because it was missing a story, but the characters and the world that was created was very imaginative nonetheless. Burton had a lot of interesting material to work with here and he did a great job although perhaps I was expecting a bit too much. This is far better than the cartoon because there is a better plot and a decent story this time, but the characters didn't seem as mad as they were in the original. I was surprised that this time around they all made sense, but I guess you need that in order to have a good story. The visuals and the effects were also amazing so Burton was successful in recreating this world.The story takes place many years after Alice has visited Wonderland and she has no memory of her visit there. She is now a nineteen year old girl who is getting ready for a banquet which is thrown in her honor although she doesn't know it yet. Alice (played by Mia Wasikowska who could recently been seen in Amelia) is not happy about having to dress up for the event and she is still dreaming about a different world where she doesn't have to do what she is expected. She still has some of the same attitudes that she had in the original film. Alice soon finds out from her cousins that the banquet is thrown in her honor because Hamish (Leo Bill) is going to propose to her and that she is expected to say yes because he is a Duke. Alice doesn't have feelings for Hamish and she can't say yes and is suddenly distracted by a rabbit that is running across the yard and decides to follow it. She ends up falling through a rabbit hole and ends upside down in a locked room very similar to the one in the original film. She finds a key in the table but it only opens a very small door so she can't get through it. This is perhaps one of the most similar scenes to the original except that there is no talking doorknob this time, and Alice still has no memory of this place even though she goes through the exact same situation of shrinking and then getting larger. Once in Wonderland, or should I say Underland because the other was the name that Alice had given it when she was a child, she runs into the same creatures she had been with in the past such as Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), the white rabbit (Micheal Sheen from Frost/Nixon), the blue caterpillar (Alan Rickman from the Harry Potter series), the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), and the Red Queen (Helen Bonham Carter) among others. There are also some new characters like the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), Stayne the knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover from Charlie's Angels), Bandersnatch, and the Jabberwocky.What I enjoyed more about this film than the original one is that there was an actual plot to this story. Alice had a mission this time around and she was not just running after the white rabbit. There is much more action and Burton does a great job at recreating this world. Johnny Depp is great as usual and his character was probably one of the best in the movie and the reason why many people wanted to see Alice in the first place. Mia Wasikowska also does a good job as she has the lead role in the film. Burton still recreates certain elements from the original such as the entrance to Wonderland, the scene where the Red Queen is playing wicket using a flamingo for a stick, and the famous riddle that the Mad Hatter asks, ¨why is a raven like a writing desk? ¨ to which we still don't get an answer too because there isn't one really. The movie works and the visuals are great, but you are still left with a sense that there could be so much more done with this movie. Wonderland is a magical place, but to rephrase the words the Mad Hatter tells Alice it seems that this movie was missing something more...muchier. We could have used some more of Burton's famous muchness.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's not C.L. Dodgson's story, it's Burton's.","I have read through many reviews of this movie before I watched it. It seems that critics in general find the story poorly written, as if Burton took the original book and failed to make it into a movie. This certainly is correct to a certain point and if you expect this movie to be an exact transcription of the book, you will be disappointed. I wasn't however. As a matter of fact I have greatly enjoyed watching this movie from the very first to the very last second. And the sole reason for that is that this movie is a classic Burton all the way. It's a story about a picturesque world where dreams and reality blur. It's a story driven by a simple idea of believing in your dreams. And Tim Burton is a man known to be a nine-days wonder in such condition. While I was watching this movie, his dream has become my reality. This man can deliver the most grotesque out-of-the-way scene with nonchalant negligence. You can feel that he couldn't be bothered with realism of the story simply because for him, the story was real. And if you allow it, this dreamy fairy tale can become just as real for you... All you have to do is forget that there was some book written by a guy who called himself Lewis Carrol and let yourself fully immerse into one of the most beautiful portrayals of a dream-scape ever created.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Maybe you should ALL consider a career change?,"There's not a lot else to say about this film that hasn't been said, amazing visuals, very poor acting, no depth in the story telling, I found this movie boring, lack lustre, without any kind of good storyline, genetic, no laughs to be had here, I'm racking my brains to find anything to give this movie it's saving grace, and failing.I will say, I didn't mind the sound track.

Tim Burton's Alice is a Visual Masterpiece,"Let me start off here... Tim Burton's Alice could have been a true classic, but instead it is just a good, sometimes very good, visually- amazing film. I do get the mixed reviews, since it is FAR from perfect. First off, I thought the first 10 minutes with Alice in the family gathering in the garden was truly dull and mediocre. I was thinking if this was the way the whole film was going to be I would hate it. Thankfully, once she steps into the rabbit hole, it went uphill. We visit Tim Burton's reimagining of Wonderland, or in this case, Underland. It is amazing. The colors, the artistic settings and the extraordinary costumes, make-up, and visual effects make this a true enchanting place. The film also has some really good scenes, most notably the scene where she is trying to open the small door when she first gets in, and her meeting with the Mad Hatter at his dinner table. Scenes like those really make this a magical film, and for the first 2/3 of her stay in Underland, it is really good, but it then starts to get a bit messy with the plot of her having to finally slay the dragon. I thought the final battle sequence, although visually amazing, was so dull and lost my complete interest. Tim Burton had said that since he had never been emotionally connected with the original plot-less structure of the book and Disney film, he wanted to make this film have an actual purpose, which I think is it's downfall, not only because the actual plot turns out to be so clichéd, but because what I think made the original so great is how it has no clear plot and Alice goes wandering from place to place in Wonderland. The performances are great. Mia Wasikowska really holds her own, while Johnny Depp is also surprisingly tolerable as the Mad Hatter. But I think Helena Bonham Carter once again upstages Depp (the first time being in Sweeney Todd) and created a very memorable and funny Red Queen. I thought she was wonderful.Overall, the film is not the masterpiece it could have been, but its not as bad as some say it is. I did enjoy it for the most part, and the performances and the vibrant world Burton has created demands a view, if just for the amazing visuals. I really hope this is a frontrunner for the Make-Up, Costumes, and Art Direction Oscars next year.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton might have jumped the Jabberwocky on this one.,"It was lauded as the perfect marriage of director and subject matter. The eighth collaboration between director Tim ""King of Emo Goth"" Burton and the perpetually offbeat Johnny Depp - I could have sworn those two are twins separated from birth - for a movie adaptation based on Lewis Carroll's wonderfully nonsensical novels. What could possibly go wrong?The answer, in a nutshell, is Disney. I don't blame them for following a tried and tested formula but come on, not every movie has to simulate a theme park ride to be commercially successful! If you were expecting a dark, twisted flick Ã  la the decade old video game American McGee's Alice (which was scheduled for the big screen starring Sarah Michelle Gellar but cancelled, unfortunately) then you're in for a major disappointment. It comes as no surprise, then, that Tim Burton is under flak for selling out.In this version of Alice, our waifish protagonist (borderline anorexic Mia Wasikowska) returns to the now desolate Underland where her former companions question her identity and she her own sanity. She is attacked by strange creatures in passable action sequences and stumbles around aimlessly before being guided by the Cheshire Cat to the Mad Hatter (Johhny Depp chanelling Willy Wonka/Jack Sparrow). The first meeting between Alice and Mad Hatter is possibly the best scene in the entire film, featuring a depressing Burton- esque set mocking the gaiety of the original tea party. Coupled with a deliciously whimsical performance by Johnny Depp, we catch a glimpse of what the movie should have been.We are treated to more filler escapades before Alice is brought to the White Queen (Anne Hathaway acting really creepy), who tasks her to defeat the fearsome Jabberwocky, champion of the evil Red Queen (delightfully off kilter Helena Bonham Carter). Helena effortlessly steals every scene she appears in with her hilarious insecurity. After much griping by Alice, the two sides eventually meet on the battlefield to duke it out in a suitably climatic finish. I won't spoil the ending for you but it ends extremely predictably anyway. Hint: the good guys always win the day.Tim Burton's Wonderland is undeniably visually lavish but the entire film simply feels hollow, like the director was simply marking off his usual checklist. Gnarled trees? Check. Gothic makeup? Check. Johnny Depp? Check. That reminds me - thanks for the paycheck. Next movie please! The use of 3D felt forced and gimmicky; something tacked on in an attempt to imitate Avatar's success. The end result resembles a really pretty children's picture book that is also utterly forgettable at the same time.Halfway through the show, I started asking myself: what's the point of making this movie if you have nothing new to say? The magic behind Carroll's classics was the ingenuity in the way it stirred the reader's imagination but Burton's wonderland literally leaves nothing to the imagination, preferring to continuously bombard us with flashy images instead. Kids will probably have a Frabbulous time (it IS a Disney movie after all) but really, there's nothing much for grown ups.Goodness, I do believe Tim Burton might have jumped the Jabberwocky on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable update,"""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010) is a professionally produced adventure fantasy about a teenage Alice from the original animated fil, played by Mia Wasikowska, as she returns to Wonderful to unknowingly fulfill her destiny and reveal her true self. I was extremely skeptical of this film upon its original release having enjoyed the animated version as a child. I was pleasantly surprised that this film didn't try to completely remake the original. Instead, it took a familiar story and expanded on the possibilities. I really enjoyed this film.Tim Burton executed a great film that simultaneously reminded me of being a child while introducing me to something new. The acting was superb, and the graphics looked realistic. So much so, that I almost forgot the mesh between real life and CGI. There were noticeable hiccups that made little sense. For example, the heart shaped eyepatch worn by Stayne, played by Crispin Glover, alternated between red and black. I believe this was intentional, but very distracting. Overall, I found this film to be very entertaining and enjoyable. I would recommend this film to both those who have and have not seen the animated version, but inform those familiar with the original to curtail their expectations of the animation being brought to life.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Medium level,"Splendid, lushly and somehow reminding the distinguished old-school fantasy fiction of the 30th. That is, considering only visual effects. Yes, it is a feast for the eye. If only there were nothing more except Cheshire's smile (which awkwardly, but plausibly transform into the Moon), I'd already said it's a very beautiful movie. And here's also the Bandersnatch, both creepy and fascinating. And a mad tea-party in some stale, fusty marsh near the most picturesque ruins of a mill. The Knave and Horsey, so appreciative in the sunset.The only issue is... the sheer weakness of the plot, as plain as an eggsie: we have Alice arriving in the Wonderland, whose inhabitants she must help. Well, guess what was at the end. But if you think soberly - the best thing not to keep in your head when seeing 'Alice' is that you watch a Tim Burton film. It is not him, really: it is a Robert Stromberg film at most. He did his best, there's naught to grudge 'im with. The ones responsible for poor, pathetic dialogue, foolish pseudo-climax (the White Queen, oh, so good! The Red, oh, so nasty!) -- er, well, as I said, the ones responsible for that are the script-writers. (Who are they, btw?.. I highly doubt the history has kept their names for general).Is the film worth watching? Yes - 'cause it's an attraction. A matinée, as it were. (Haven't seen it in 3D, but no doubt the thing's good). If you think of 'Alice' as a movie (i.e., complicated characters, plot and so on), you are mistaken. That's just a 'toon for very little kids. (Of course, always exists another option: do not pay attention to the dialogue. Don't seek any sense in a young lassie's dream - there is none!)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Movie I've Seen In Years,"I have now seen this movie 3 times in theaters and I like it more each time. I very rarely like movies made outside of the 80s and I wasn't expecting much from Tim Burton after Planet of the Apes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I was very surprised at how much I loved Alice in Wonderland. I am a huge fan of the stories of Alice. From the book to the animated movie to the 1985 version. They're all special in their own way just like Tim Burton's version. I never thought that there would be an Alice in Wonderland as good as the animated version but with each viewing, I'm starting to get torn between which I like more and I love the animated version.I'm really surprised to see so many negative reviews for this movie. I thought both the acting and the story were top notch. The special effects were amazing. I could care less about the 3D which was great. However I enjoyed the movie more without it just like I did with Avatar. I see both movies compared a lot and Avatar always being considered the better movie. I don't agree with this at all. I loved Avatar but it had its downfalls. It's too long, too slow paced, very repetitive. I'm not reviewing Avatar here but that's my opinion of it. Just like my opinion of Alice in Wonderland being almost perfect.I wish that some characters were shown more. Definitely the March Hare who is now one of my favorite movie characters of all time. The Mad Hatter's dance still seems a little out of place for me. These are the only faults I could find and they're very minor. If you haven't seen Alice in Wonderland yet then do so right away. I would compare it most to Stardust and Willow and slightly to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. 10 out of 10 for me and I would only consider a dozen movies to be that good.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"I really wasn't that great, could have been so much more","Sure it was called ""Alice in Wonderland"" and had Johny Depp as a lead actor, but the movie really didn't live up to it's potential and I'm quit surprised that it had nearly zero appeal to me. I absolutely loved the original Alice in Wonderland, such a brilliant and creative film.This one just plain didn't make sense, not in a way that was intended to be creative and imaginative but it was confusing and many scenes seemed like they had no purpose or meaning to the story.Sure visually there were good aspects to it, and they had the big name actors and directors and such behind it, but when it comes right down to it a bad movie is a bad movie no matter what title or actors are a part of it.The actress who played Alice was not that appealing either, she lacked acing skills and seemed so out of place. Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter was just so ridiculous that it went beyond being Mad to being psychotic and delusional (As bad as his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory roll). Everything was just blown out of proportion and they needed to knock it down to a more realistic level, and had a story that at least made sense and tied in somehow. Some scenes were straight from the classic movie but slightly modified to be more appealing somehow but that all failed, honestly I was just waiting for the movie to end from nearly the first scene.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
THE BEST,"Best cartoon to live action I have watched so far!

"No doubt, about it this is Disneyated not Depp","This is a story about a brat (Mairi Ella Challen) that grew up to be a demure young lady (Mia Wasikowska) and lost her snot factor. Can she gain it back through adventure? The story needed some adjustment due to the age factor of the victim. Therefore, this is why we get more of a return to the Underland in place of the original Wonderland. The wit is replaced with action, the cunning with swordplay, and so forth.I do not want to give away any surprises but this presentation is uniquely made for the actors and to be politically correct for this day and age. Alice is facing marriage to the son of her defunct father's old business partner. She has been having a problem with being distracted by a rabbit in a waistcoat. She falls for the rabbit and we began to think back fondly on the story we were told as children.If she can adjust her size the adventure takes a sad turn into a swashbuckler; unfortunately, it is Alice, not the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Will Alice be eaten, scratched, beheaded, or otherwise dispatched? Alternatively, will she return, get married, and realize there is no place like home.I only saw the 2D version so I cannot comment on 3D. The parts were extremely well acted by many of the best-known actors of the time. No telling what the movie would be if the characters were a tad more traditional.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Mediocre, humorless, piece of art","There is not much to say about this movie except that it's pretty to look at. The story might be original but it stills feels like there could be more things then just ""Ooh's"" ""Aah's"". Also there is a huge lack of humor, sure there is a few funny parts but nothing to funny, although there is very little tension to break up, a laugh would maybe been able to compensate the lack of excitement.I found this movie pretty/boring, maybe it was the popcorn or the fact that the theater was icing cold, but you might like it if you are a fan of Mr. Burton.Oskar.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic story,"I enjoyed watching this action-packed story, and was blown away by the special effects. It is a truly cinematic experience. In our group discussion about the film we identified the main themes as friendship, fantasy and being yourself. The plot begins with a marriage proposal to Alice, who then follows a rabbit down a hole and embarks on a journey involving magical creatures and surreal characters, such as the mad hatter and the queen of hearts. It uses an interesting mixture of real acting and computer generated images. In a way Alice is a character I can relate to because she is learning about the world by meeting new people. I am really glad I watched this film and would like to visit it again at some point in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton Makes Another Lousy Movie. Not Good. Not Bad. Lousy,"Alice in Wonderland is directed by Tim Burton and stars Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsley, the ever so famous Disney not- princess. This story is the sequel to - that's right, not a remake - of the Disney classic Alice in Wonderland (1951). Alongside Wasikowska is Johnny Depp as the mad hatter, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. This story follows Alice at about age 20, on her wedding day, in fact as she falls down the rabbit hole yet again, to find that Underland (that's right, she ""misheard"" the name the first time) is under rule of the Red Queen, or the Queen of Hearts. Under her rule, Underland is now in dismay, and mostly in chaos.The best thing this film has going for it is the cinematography and directing. Tim Burton, of course, is a good director, and this film shows it. Honestly, this film is beautiful to look at. It's almost all CGI, and almost none of it looks fake. I could tell that a couple shots looked unbelievable, mostly with the White Rabbit, but other than that, it looks great. This is probably due to their big budget of $200 million. However, it doesn't seem that big compared to what they made: $1 billion.Now, the negatives are more abundant. The first one is the acting. Even Johnny Depp doesn't do that great, and he's an A list actor. Mia Wasikowska does fine. That's all; not good, but not bad either. Just fine. Anne Hathaway does pretty good, although her character is utterly boring. Helena Bonham Carter is definitely the best performance throughout the whole film. We all know she's a good actress, but compared to Johnny Depp, she shouldn't outshine him, which makes for a problem.The second con is the plot. The plot and dialogue, to be specific. This film's plot has a very convoluted plot, that, at times, doesn't make sense, and completely ditches the audience. My first time watching it, I thought that the Red Queen was a completely different person that the Queen of Hearts from the first movie. I didn't figure out they were the same person until more than half of the way through the film.The last thing I'll discuss is the ending. This isn't really a spoiler, because I won't say what she does at the ending, just what it's based on. Alice has to become a ""champion"" for the White Queen (fully dressed as a knight), and fight the Jabberwocky, a name mentioned in the original Alice in Wonderland poem. The Jabberwocky is a giant, dragon-like creature that can spew fire from it's jaws. Yeah, the ending is very, very.dumb.Overall, Alice in Wonderland isn't horrible, but it's far from good. I'm going to give Alice in Wonderland a C-, or a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yet another overhated film,"As someone who likes Disney's animated version of the Lewis Carroll classic but doesn't love it, my opinion on this controversial remake/reboot/sequel is more or less the same. The worst parts are definitely the bookends in the real world, which are boring, badly acted, and only worth watching for the real world parallels to characters in the fantasy world. Thankfully, these scenes don't take up that much time, and once we get to Wonderland/Underland, the film becomes a lot of fun. Sure, the inclusion of a plot may seem insulting to the source material, but the story is bonkers and nonsensical enough that it feels right at home in this story. Plus, Tim Burton's signature style meshes beautifully with the classic character designs and bizarre world, making for a visually spectacular film that you could almost watch on mute to admire the look of it. The effects, some Uncanny Valley looking characters aside, are still impressive, and the music has the usual vaguely intimidating whimsical charm we expect from Danny Elfman.For the most part, the cast does a really good job with the iconic characters they're given to play. Johnny Depp is all over the place as the Mad Hatter, which surprisingly isn't a criticism. He said he sees the character as being made up of different people and their extreme sides, and he captures that total insanity perfectly. Helena Bonham Carter and Crispin Glover make for great villains. Alan Rickman is awesome as always. And everybody else, at least in Wonderland, is great too, except for two. Anne Hathaway plays the White Queen as far too ditsy and sweet, coming off as a really bad precursor to Ariana Grande as Glinda. And Mia Wasikowsa was frankly a terrible choice for the lead role. She can't act or emote worth a thing, and her constant insistence that the fantasy world is a dream when it clearly isn't gets old fast.Overall, Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland is very flawed, but for what it is, I enjoy it immensely. Among Disney's live action remakes, it's definitely one of the better ones. Is it better than the animated classic? No, but it holds its own well enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Good, but sadly unsatisfying...","I have never seen the 1951 Disney animated feature which tells the story of Alice's first trip to Wonderland. You see, she has grown up now and this film tells the story of her second set of adventures in Wonderland. I'll give you a brief summary before I tell you my thoughts (summary haters please tell me why A Raven is like a Writing Desk It's been bothering me all day).Alice is now nineteen and it has been arranged that she shall marry Hamish, the son of a Lord, but she is not really interested in marriage. It is decided that he will propose to her publicly at a party thrown by his family. The unpretentious Alice is distracted as the big moment arrives and finds herself compelled to follow a white rabbit just as he comes out with the words. As you might guess, the rabbit disappears down a hole and is soon followed by Alice. Having made herself the right size by drinking a potion, she enters Wonderland, a place that looks kind of familiar, but she can't place from where. Here she meets many characters, including the Mad Hatter, The Cheshire Cat and the Red Queen. At first there is some debate as to whether she is the right Alice, and she has reservations herself. You see, if she is the right Alice, then she must perform a very heroic task and she's not sure she's up to doing that. I really don't want to give it away, so I'll leave Alice down the rabbit hole for now.This is unmistakably a Tim Burton film. All the quirks and outlandishness that mark his style of filmmaking in abundance. It is beautifully made with great attention to detail. I saw the 2D version which, I'm told by those who know about these things, is better than the 3D cut. Great performances all round, particularly from; Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, Mia Wasikowska as Alice, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. I should also give honourable mentions to Crispin Glover as Stayne - Knave of Hearts, Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the voice talents of; Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Alan Rickman as the Blue Caterpillar, Barbara Windsor as the Dormouse, Paul Whitehouse as the March Hare and Timothy Spall as Bayard.Although this film is beautifully made with some great performances, I found it ultimately unsatisfying. I think because I know the story quite well the awe and wonder of seeing it for the first time is lost and that detracts from the viewer's enjoyment. There are some great comic moments and some truly magical scenes, but as a whole it kind of lacked something for me. It's worth seeing, but I wouldn't rush to buy the DVD even so, recommended.My score: 6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mad as a Hatter,"""There is a place. Like no place on Earth. A land full of wonder, mystery, and danger! Some say to survive it: You need to be as mad as a hatter."" The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp)More than appreciating Tim Burton's visually stunning sequel to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, I couldn't stop thinking how perfectly Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter: The infamous character is clearly disturbed but a good heart dedicated to stopping the bad heart, big-headed Red Queen, played with relish by Helena Bonham Carter. Depp is one actor who could do six impossible things before breakfast.As arguably the most versatile actor in film, Depp almost always is superior (except as Dillinger, where he underplayed the flamboyant gangster), so my thoughts run to how an actor is the embodiment of a film, in this case the eccentric Hatter as the center of imagination and iconoclasm, just what Carroll ordered for his anti-establishment cartoon lampooning Victorian society and ushering in the age of individualism.The tea party is still there with the March Hare (Paul Whitehouse) and Dormouse (Babs Windsor), but it's less whimsical and more morbid than in Carroll. Alice in Wonderland loses the original's innocence as the film moves to the unoriginal conclusion with its dragon Jabberwocky (Christopher Lee) no different from scores of other dragons in other fantasies. Even Alice's (Mia Wasikowski) heroics are derivative. As always Alan Rickman's voice has the ability to mesmerize, this time as the slow but effective blue caterpillar Absolem.Burton has put all his weird makeup and love of bizarre characters into this film, which more than any of his other fantasies such as Edward Scissorhands and Corpse Bride echoes the epic struggles of good and evil in most kiddie, young adult, and cheesy romances over the ages.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Go Hide, Runaway Bride","I'll admit something before I start. I never enjoyed Lewis Caroll's classic. As a child I'd read different versions of Alice in Wonderland but they always left me somewhat unimpressed. Maybe it reflected the innocence in the young minds of 1865. Maybe Cartoon Network & the IT boom made us more matured than we ought to have been in our childhood. In any case, when I saw the trailer of Alice's escapades being re-recited by the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp 7th combo, it got just curiouser for me.I was actually impressed by the way the movie started & unwounded. Writer Linda Woolverton (one of the writers of the classic Lion King) chose to start with an older Alice (a smiling Mia Wasikowska) who gets to revisit Wonderland, which she visited as a child. ""Return to Wonderland"" - or something similar, would have sounded more apt a title. Thereon, Burton plans a setup at the end of which we see Alice running away into the woods and following the same talking rabbit down the (probably same) hole into Wonderland where the 3-D effects play their real role.I watched this film for Johnny Depp. I waited for the Tea Party episode which is probably the only scene I loved & enjoyed in this story. In the interim, Alice meets the usual medley of characters who were mostly ""transmogrified"" Actors, welcoming her back to Wonderland. Animating the real actors' faces for some of the characters, worked very much in favour of creating the right atmosphere. The Red Queen (a hamming Helena Bonham Carter) with a blown up head & Matt Lucas in the twin Tweedle roles were noteworthy. That was it. It went all down-hill after that. Some interesting characters like the puffing caterpillar (Alan Rickman) and the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) light up a few moments. But the story swiftly gets into action mode, focusing on a tale of tiff between the sisters, the Red Queen & the White Queen (a lost Anne Hathway with white hair & black brows) and ending the Wonderland story with a silly action sequence which seemed totally seemed out of place.Sadly, I wasn't impressed by the Tea Party episode & many other scenes. But Johnny Depp yet again remains one of the few things to watch out for. He's an actor with a gifted versatility which helps him slip effortlessly into any role. The Mad Hatter wouldn't have been half of what it was without Depp, never mind the screen space allotted to him. This, combined with the beautiful imagery with all its tiny detailing by Burton helped fill the void created by the amateurish screenplay which was void of the wit that made Depp-Burton's animated Corpse Bride (2005) & writer Woolverton's Lion King (1994), an enjoyable experience. Thankfully, the 3-D didn't mar the experience of the beautiful images to a noticeable extent and in some places even enhanced the experience. My personal 3-D favourites were the scenes when Alice falls down the hole & the one when the Cheshire Cat appears out of thin air in the forest.An action sequence to end a kiddie-flick? Come On! I still cant digest it. Maybe Burton lost sight of the child-adult line he wanted to cross-over like Christopher Nolan did with Batman. A messy final product ! But the scenes after Wonderland which completed the 1 Billion $ grossing movie are a face-saving grace and diluted the bad taste that I feared I would have.6 + 1 / 10(tempted to keep it at 6 out of 10 but a plus one for Director Burton's visual perception, writer Woolverton's fast paced story & Depp's performance which made it slightly more than a direct-from-book adaptation)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"On the Frabjous Day, He Will Futterwacken Vigarously...","Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is 19 and has suffered from strange dreams for half her life. She's an intelligent girl with little interest in the strict rules and etiquette of Victorian England; her unconventional thoughts bring disdain from those around her. She's expected to marry an arrogant British lord and she's unhappy with the direction her life is heading. On the afternoon of her engagement party, she runs off after a white rabbit and, after a short trip down a rabbit hole, finds herself in Underland. She discovers from the strange inhabitants that the land is under the tyrannical rule of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and it is believed she is the ""Alice"" destined to defeat the Queen's Jabberwocky and bring freedom from her reign.All right, just to clarify, I've never read any of Lewis Carroll's original stories and I've had minimal exposure to Disney's 1951 animated film. Still, seeing as how I haven't spent my life under a rock, I know enough of the basics. As I understand, 2010's ALICE is a sequel of sorts, not a reboot and reimagining of the original story. The story's not bad, I suppose. I was digging the movie for the first hour or so, as Alice wanders through Underland and we're introduced to the interesting characters scattered throughout. That's about all that kept me interested, the characters and world design, since the story itself was pretty thin.The casting for the film was fantastic, though some of them have been staples of Burton films and were a given. Most people speak of Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter; Depp does a great job but we all know he can play the weirdest of characters. This wasn't really a stretch for him and, after having seen his performance here, I'm itching to see him in a serious role again. Carter was fun as the Red Queen with her mega-cranium and her obsession with lopping off heads of anyone who so much as looks at her wrong. Crispin Glover was probably my favorite in the film (and almost unrecognizable) as Stayne, the knave of hearts who's flirtations with the Queen keep him in her good graces. We also run the full gamut of full-CG characters, from the hilariously manic March Hare to Absolem the hookah-smoking caterpillar (voiced by the awesome Alan Rickman, who almost seemed to be disinterestedly phoning in his performance here).Despite what everyone around me seems to claim, this is nowhere near Tim Burton's best film. Sure, it's amazing to look at; the characters are beautifully designed (I can't stop staring at the oddness that are the Tweedles...) and the landscape is equal parts twisted and beautiful. Unfortunately for the film, that's all it is. It's an enjoyable watch but it feels empty at the end. It doesn't help that, after all the strange and colorful interactions that fill the film, it ends with an action sequence. It totally weakened the last half hour and I lost interest at that point, and the CG for the Jabberwocky was the only CG in the film that stood out (in a bad way).Be warned: you should be prepared to watch the film in subtitles. Between the gibberish of the Underland language and Depp's tendency to slip into a thick Scottish brogue during the Hatter's moments of angry lucidity, there were some parts I just couldn't understand watching in theaters without the aid of subtitles to help (most of) it make more sense.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Grown Up Alice Returns To Underland""","So let me get this straight. In Alice in Wonderland, the story based on the Lewis Carroll novel, Alice is not a girl, she's a woman, she's not in Wonderland, she's returning to Wonderland, and Wonderland itself, in fact, isn't Wonderland at all, it's called ""Underland"". UNDERLAND?!? UNDERLA--?! That sounds like a made up world in a Fruit of the Loom commercial! I'm sorry. How the flying f*ck am I supposed to take an adaptation seriously when you can't even get one word, ONE F*CKING WORD OF THE GODDAMN TITLE RIGHT?! I'm gonna say it. CARE BEARS IN WONDERLAND IS A BETTER ADAPTATION THAN THIS! (audience boos) Yeah, come on! I said it! I said it! Who wants some?! Come on! Come on! Apart from at least giving us what the f*cking title promises, Care Bears in Wonderland, and not Underland, is still mad nonsense where everything is backwards! The villain of the movie wants to bring sense and order to it; that would be a legitimate threat to their world, so the fear in the movie is 100% justified! Here, the queen is just a jerk, but as long as she's as crazy as the rest of them, which she supposedly is, Wonderland- Oh, I'm sorry- Underland shouldn't care! Because, unless you missed what was constantly hammered in, both the story, the book, every interpretation ever made, THEY'RE MAD! THEY'RE ALL F*CKING MAD! So what should they care about any of this crap? And don't get me wrong. Care Bears is an awful movie. It's really bad. They do some stupid s*it, like making the queen nice, a whole bunch of other...crap, but in terms of which one is closer to the spirit of what Alice in Wonderland is?

Awful Remake of a Great Classic,"I am a HUGE Alice in Wonderland fan.I have been waiting for this movie to come out since I 1st saw the previews. It was made by Tim Burton so of course it was going to be awesome right? WRONG! I will say the very beginning was not too bad. It seemed like everything was going fine and it was sticking to the original story. Once she opened the door to wonderland after growing and shrinking it went down-hill.The effects were way too over done to the point where wonderland was not even believable. I really did not like how Tim Burton added so many new characters to it too. The white queen, the jabberwocky, the talking dog, etc Where was Dinah? (Alice's pet cat) from the beginning? The very merry un-birthday song? The singing flowers? (They only showed one for like a split second), Alice growing so big her arms and legs stick out of the white rabbits house? Bill and the Dodo bird? Tweedledee and Tweedledum telling their story of the little oyster's? ""The time has come the walrus said, to talk of many things.."" As a big fan I just feel like these were important and memorable points to the story that makes us love it so much.The cast was pretty impressive I must say. Only thing was that Johnny Depp's make up was a little fake looking in the tea party scene because they painted his face white but stopped at his neck so it just looked too fake. Also when the red queen's friends had their noses and ears falling off as if they were really just prostetics was a horrible idea I did not understand that. Though the cast was well and so was the acting, I felt like the white queen was not necessary and to honest could she put her hands down for just a min?! I almost feel like since Tim Burton put Depp in the movie that he had to expand and change the story up to give him a longer role because of course Johnny Depp couldn't be in this for just a few minuets like the original mad hatter was in the story. Honestly the mad hatter was not a huge or important character.I could go on and on about more but these are the main things I could not stand. This is the 2nd film Tim Burton had re-made and turned it into trash. I actually love Tim Burton and all of his moves from the 80's and 90's but now he is loosing his touch and I feel like he just giving into the modern cgi crap that everyone does nowadays. He was a unique director but I just cant connect with his films anymore its a shame. Don't get me wrong I know he probably wanted to add a little newness to it but it just didn't work at all. If he would of just stuck to the original storyline it could of made up for the crappy cgi effects.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Average story packaged in a cool CGI,"The story of this movie is a new retelling of the classic Alice in Wonderland. The story is far from groundbreaking but it's decent and had potential. I have two problems with the movie. The first one is Alice's acting. I think the movie would've been a great deal better if it wasn't for Alice's dull, cold, and distant acting. The character is not very well written and the bad acting made it worse. Alice changes her actions all of a sudden without giving us a proper reason behind this change or without walking us through what drove this change. The second problem is the Hatter's eyes. It may sound silly but they ruined the character for me. I don't think it was necessary at all. Other than that, the CGI is amazing and the acting of the rest of the cast is great so I give it that.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mesmerizing Visuals + The Red Queen = Enjoyable Movie!,"Alice in Wonderland is a fantasy movie based on the Lewis Carroll's book ""Through the Looking-Glass"". The point of a movie following the second book ? Whatever.... The story itself is done let's say good for an 1 hour and half movie. I expected a little bit more of it but at the end I was quite entertained and satisfied with the result. It was magical but not that magical, it was a happy movie and not made to be a serious weirdness but more of a crazy wildness.Tim Burton succeeded to transform Alice's story into an epic visual experience. The best part of the movie is that the visual effects (especially in 3D) were mastered wonderful. The beauty of the environments along with the 3D effects threw you into an mesmerizing world. As I said the visual experience was top notch but the acting was even better.The Red Queen portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter stole the show. She was magnificent and each scene with her was awesome. Seems like Tim Burton's ""fetish"" for his wife to appear in his movies succeeded this time on a big level. The Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp wasn't that Mad and I think I expected more from him though his portrayal is on point as usual. I didn't really liked Mia as Alice. Don't know why but I can't find her attractive enough to really enjoy her presence on the screen and her acting as Alice wasn't that great. Another character I enjoyed was Cheshire the Cat which was so cool to watch.The ridiculous moment of the movie were I was like ""OH snap! What the hell?"" was on Depp's dancing... I mean breakdance? modern dance moves? Why that? And that music? ...I think that simple scene ruined big part from the movie. The music was cut and edited well during the movie, but I still try to figure out why Tim Burton had not asked for an entire composed soundtrack. That would have fitted this world so much better.About the CGI, I noticed some mistakes, like the horse-riding looks so animated....which I think they could have just used a real horse. Some of the fight scenes were poor cut and so on, but in the end we could skip on that.In the end ... this movie is not such a great adaptation by Tim Burton, not such of an extraordinary movie but a wonderful visual experience along with one great performance by the Red Queen.I'd give it a 7,5 but I can't so I gave it an 8 to raise the bar.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fantastic movie,"The thought that was previously expressed, stating Tim Burton's ego and predictability ruined the movie, are outright rubbish. This was a brilliant work of art, a term I rarely use in reference to film. Danny Elman's music was as usual brilliant and spot on. The effects were amazing, but in the context of the story made you forget ..... suspension of disbelief achieved.Itis an original work based an an older story, not a rehash as so much of Hollywood's work is today. It is a new story of Alice. Art in film when so much that is called art is not. Brilliant. To say otherwise is rubbish. Even though I dislike Depp, I loved the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What should I do with this movie? Expensive nothingness,"I left the movie theater and was confused. I did not know what to think or feel about this movie. It is not because I was amazed or ""kicked"" by it, it just left confusion and strange emotions. I went with my 9 year old daughter and after 108 minutes of a fantasy story, we both did not know what to say about this movie. When we have left ""Avatar"" we spoke about it for an hour, when we have left ""Evan almighty"" we still giggled about the funny scenes. ""Alice in wonderland"" left nothing to be exited about, to laugh about or to think about, so we spoke about music and the upcoming birthday, we have treated the last 108 minutes as if they never happened. Definitely not a good sign. This was a nice looking (and expensive) 3D evening, that gave me and my daughter nothing. No character I could love, no character I could really hate, just a big nothingness. Disappointing.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better after watching Alice Though the Looking Glass,"I must admit I was hard on this movie. I rated it 5/10. This movie felt a little light compared to my expectations.So when the second movie came out, Alice Though The Looking Glass, I was not expecting much to like. Well it sure blew my mind! This is what I wanted. Easily Top 5 Movies of all time!But then it got me thinking, what was the first one about again? Its been a long time since I last seen it. Its not as bad as I remembered. Definitely a good movie.PS: I even see a plausibility to make the 3rd but by going back to one of her earlier Adventures, like when she was a kid. I see the plausibilities!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
entertaining new version of a children's story,"I liked this movie, but it isn't for really young kids. It would probably scare them. But for older kids and adults, it was very entertaining. The visuals were top notch, and the film included all the main characters Alice meets in Wonderland. I especially thought Tweedle dee and dumb were so cute and deserved more screen time. The other great character was the red queen. Her appearance was perfect and when we see her court are wearing disguises to make them look as unattractive as her, that was funny.The battle between Alice and the Jabberwocky was cool as far as visuals, but we knew how it would turn out. I also liked the humor involving Hamish. It just helped to make the story a little different than other versions.FINAL VERDICT: It's not to long and worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice film - shame about the title.,"I am late with this review; many others have said their piece long ago and it appears that many expected it to be a re-make of the famous story.If Mr Burton had called it ""Not Alice In Wonderland"" or perhaps ""Alice in Wonderland 2"" or perhaps ""Alice Revisits Wonderland"" or even, for as much as I care, ""Alice meets Abbott and Costello in Wonderland"" then maybe people would take the film on its merits and not on their ill-researched expectations.I would have stopped there but apparently that is not enough.. so here goes: OK, it had its flaws and a few of the performances were rather derivative. I would be astonished if Helena Bonham Carter ever swore she had never seen Miranda Richardson doing Queenie in Blackadder before forming her characterisation of the Red Queen. Nevertheless she and Alan Rickman and Stephen Fry and Matt Lucas were all great. The only thing I hated was the stupid Futterwacken dance (what was THAT about?).",,Anonymous,Fantasy
One time watchable,It's quite interesting to review this after a decade but seeing Johny depp like this character is a eye feast . But considering plot is routine.Talking of CGI is next level. At that time of avatar like movies launched. Disney produced the right choice for this. Production values are good. If you wanna watch watch this in free time. Not that much interesting. Some times you feel the plot is Deja Vu cause the story is very very routine.If you have subscription of Disney+hotstar consider it to see. There are other alternatives better than this type of screenplay and visuals. Finally one time watchable as I mentioned.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton computerises a classic...,"As a young child of around 7 Alice has nightmares of some real freaky sh*t. She tells her Dad, who is cool enough to say that ""Only special people see special things"", or something to that effect.This is good at the time but loses impact as he dies in between that time and Alice turning about 20.Alice is still a daydreamer and abstract thinker, but Mum just doesn't understand why she can't be normal like the other young girls who want to be proper and marry off to well-to-do boys who will provide for them as long as they behave, and she expresses as much on the way to a formal gathering.Alice herself is apparently destined to be with well-to-do Hamish, a bit of a pompous and smarmy git who very much assumes that they will be together once the proper arrangements have been made. One of these arrangements happens to be party they are attending, which is actually meant to be Alice and Hamish's engagement party.Once Alice herself is informed of this little change to the running schedule she bails to compose her thoughts, explaining to others that she has spotted a rabbit wearing a waistcoat.Oh my! Anyway we know what happens next don't we? Alice falls into a deep hole. Upon finding a bottle marked ""Drink me"" she drinks, seeing something marked ""Eat me"", she eats Alas there is no ""Blow me"" sticker so we can't see just how Paris Hilton she really is.Outside the small room everything is indeed ""Curioser and curioser"". Everything talks, and they live in an environment that must have been such a wet dream for Tim Burton to put together that I guarantee he is kicking himself for not thinking about making this film sooner.There is much discussion among the ""various talking things"" if she is the ""Right Alice"", some think she is the others are unsure, so they take her to the caterpillar Absolon, voiced by Alan Rickman in a perfectly apathetic and uppity drawl. Absolon tells her she is actually the ""Wrong Alice"".Now understandably Alice thinks this is all a dream and she keeps waiting to wake up, at times throwing caution to the breeze, you can't get hurt in a dream right? It turns out that her destiny is to kill the Jabberwocky, the pet (think Rancor) of the Red Queen, on Frabcious Day, which is rapidly approaching, which will restore the White Queen to her rightful place on the throne.In this acid trip of a plot I will leave it there, Alice comes across a big grinned cat, a big headed Red Queen, another big mouthed White Queen (although I think Anne Hathaway's mouth is just big, not a special effect!) and Johnny Depp of course is the Mad Hatter, due to contractual arrangements that state he must be in every Tim Burton film.I love Sleepy Hollow for some reason that I can't explain.I like most of the other stuff Tim Burton does, and I like this. The visuals are of course sumptuous and vivid, the action suitably crazy and amusing and the plot actually meshes together reasonably well.There is no one scene that stands out though as incredibly great, nor one performance or character that especially grabbed me, aside from Alan Rickman (who I think is a God thanks to Die Hard).So I'll just say this: If you like Tim Burton you'll very much like this. I think for everyone else with an imagination or a willingness to embrace the abstract and different, this is worth seeing.But I can't give a heartier recommendation than ""worth seeing"". At least it was better than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.One last thing, Computer Generated Imagery has meant that many films though impossible only a decade ago are now relatively simply to create. I only hope that it isn't making many directors lazy, though the evidence is pointing to the fact that the easy way out is now to ""tell a computer to do it"", rather than come up with an ingenious and clever way to do something.Georges Lucas and Romero, I'm talking to you and I'm watching you Burton! Final Rating – 7 / 10. A satisfying retelling of a classic story, just don't expect to be blown away.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice in 3-D land,"Most of Alice's return as an adult to Wonderland works pretty well, but there are flaws.The first portion of her original adventure is reviewed exactly for foundation: rabbit hole, etc., but once she encounters the caterpillar and other characters, the story goes its own direction, introducing a prophecy of an epic event involving the reluctant and skeptical Alice.The special effects are dazzling, the 3-D effect utilized for brilliant and stunning visuals. It truly is a ""wonderland,"" come to life. The characters are honed a bit to fit the new direction of the story's purpose. Tweedledee and Tweedledum, as a typical example, are evolved in this version from their senseless imitative behavior in the Carroll book now to Igor-type side kicks at Alice's beckon call. Most glaringly altered, of course, is the Mad Hatter, to fit Johnny Depp's approach. Depp's characterization is clever and well acted, but the Hatter's new altruistic and heroic nature is far removed from the selfish nut Alice met in Carroll's book.The two queens provide the conflict, and contrast well. Bonham-Carter's megalomaniac Red Queen (""Off with his head!"") is spot on, and the running gag about her head shape is fun. Hathaway's eccentric yet benevolent White Queen is equally humorous. The chess match war is composed impressively, and the dragon battle tops it all off nicely.Biggest negative: The opening/closing sequences in the real world don't work, and aren't even necessary. Alice did not need her Wonderland adventure to make decisions that she made in the end. Somebody must have said, ""We need a moral tag to close the story!"" To whoever said that, Burton should have proclaimed, ""Off with his head."" It just doesn't work to slam home an idea that the viewer already gets. If anything, it's patronizing. Another problem was abandoning the random nature of the books; the whole satirical point of the disjointed chaos is contradicted with this version's ""destiny to overthrow evil"" business.Overall, superior visuals and a nice cast give this some of the fun weirdness that you'll expect. But don't expect the original books; this one strays into its own Wonderland.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Alice in Wonderland is stunning to look act, but gives up on itself","Alice in Wonderland has always been a bit of an adult imaginary world that adults pretend to be for children. Its an eerie creation and Burton had his heart set right with the tone of the film and its spectacular visuals, which are beautifully and cleverly designed.Sadly, the film's initial hour promises much more than what we are offered in the end-predictable action and character resolution in fast mode. It seems as though they just gave up on the story and decided to finish it loud and fast, which is shameful as the movie gets so many things right.In all honesty, had I seen this film as a child I would have loved it and found it extraordinary. In my sadly judgmental maturity, I can't stop but feel this was a missed opportunity.Depp is great and Mia Wasikowska is a pleasant surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful movie and relatable for those who loves to imagine unordinary things,"A world made by your own imaginations with a mission that feels just like a dream, but oddly feels so real at the same time. Fantastically odd, isn't it? Disney present you, Alice in Wonderland. A fantasy movie mixed with adventurous yet adds Action to it, directed by Tim Burton and scenario written by Linda Woolverton.Briefly, this movie was about a nineteen year-old girl named Alice Kingsley (starring Mia Wasikowska) who comes back to a magical world called Underland, a place where she visited 13 years ago. She was told by her Wonderland ""friends"" that she is the only one who can get back She was told by her Wonderland ""friends"" that she is the only one who can get back the White Queen's throne (starring Anne Hathaway) and who can fight the Jabberwocky, A wild dragon-like creature owned by the worst, unmerciful, scariest Red Queen, White Queen's older sister (starring Helena Bonham Carter). By the help and support of her Wonderland friends, especially the Mad Hatter (starring Johnny Depp), could she ever win back the Justice that was taken years ago that she thought might only be a dream?Based on my personal opinion, this movie is for people age 13 and above. Most of the creatures in Wonderland might seem creepy and hideous to some people. Most of the scene in this movie is very sadistic to some people who don't like Action genre movie. One of the creepiest scene is when Dormouse took Bandersnatch's eyeball. It might sound so heartless to lots of people. Overall, I personally think this movie is relatable for those who have that imagination of them that is outside the box.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice in Wonderland creepy,"I thought this movie was pretty good. I didn't like the whole back story with Alice and how she becomes so sure of herself and everything in the end. That whole plot line could have been avoided with no ill effects on the movie. The special effects are amazing to say the least. Johnny Depp is weird as usual, but he is very entertaining. I could have gone without another movie with Tim Burtons wife in it. That's getting a little bit old. But over all, I thought the movie was well done and had very good performances by most of the cast. I think it will defiantly be an instant classic. You should def see it in theaters before it's gone.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A nice thing to watch but NOT to remember.,"Yes, Tim Burton is a director one should marvel about. He's directed such masterpieces like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the somewhat recent ""Sweeney Todd"", but like many other immortal directors he has a flaw. He's a visual genius who creates entire worlds out of scratch and quirky, involving characters that haunt our minds for many days to come...but he usually focuses too much on the visual aspect of his films and the result is that many of them lack the necessary luster in their story lines or character development, and its his characters precisely the ones who try to reach over audiences but who ultimately fail to do so in most cases. His latest box-office smash ""Alice in Wonderland"" is an example of one such film, where every scene is a breath-taking picture that fails to remain in our hearts and minds in the end.We shouldn't be too hard on him, though. I mean this IS Lewis Carroll adapted to the screen, and the film is based on both ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" two heavily surrealist books for children which never focus on plot but rather on frequently non-sensical situations. The film has an additional twist, also: 19-year old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland without a previous memory of ever being there before, where she discovers her ultimate destiny is to defeat a monstrous dragon commanded by the villainous Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter, who plays her role to comic perfection). To do so she'll need the help of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both played by Matt Lucas), the Cheshire cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), the Blue Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) and many others. The film is rank with quirky, Burton-esquire characters which are paraded before us one after the other and are seldom given a chance to actually make an impression.These characters do wonders with the few time that's given to them, though. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are especially hilarious in their lead roles, and most of the animated characters actually manage to make us laugh (the March Hare, voiced by Paul Whitehouse, is especially funny albeit the fact he's on screen for less than ten minutes). The film's point, much like the book, is to take children through an imaginary fantasy where nothing makes sense; but like many recent children' books adapted to the screen, an actual storyline has been introduced which tries to make sense and be profound but which fails entirely.A point which has critics and audiences in high debate is the CGI aspect of the film. Over 80% of the film is animated, and all of the flesh-and-blood actors have had their features exaggerated and altered with computer imaging; Burton's famous settings and Gothic magical landscapes are all animated now, giving them additional beauty and quirkiness but taking away every sense of wonder they had before. I mean, remember Edward Scissorhands' dark castle or Halloweentown? Now imagine them being CGI'd, paired with sweeping, fleeting camera takes. A pity, isn't it? The magical realism is lost, the artistic meaning behind Burton's film is diminished and we're left with an adventure comedy kids are bound to adore but adults are bound to quickly dismiss.Costume design and production design are perfect, as usual. Everything is meticulously detailed and it's a breath of fresh air to see actual art direction and production amongst all the CGI. The costumes the humans wear are a marvel of the imagination (but then again, it's Colleen Atwood, Burton's long-time costume designer, so what can you expect?). Danny Elfman's score is sadly forgettable, and I find this hard to digest since he's the composer of some of Hollywood's greatest scores ever. The plot is...well, disappointing even while factoring in the fact that it should be a plot-less movie. Why, Luis Buñuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" had a more intriguing plot and you ALL know how sarcastic I'm being by saying that. Burton's direction is interesting enough, but this isn't bound to be a film he'll be remembered for.Now, that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. It's VERY entertaining, as a matter of fact. I felt engrossed by the fleeting characters and the wonderful production design throughout the entire film, and once it was finished I had a sense that my time had not been wasted (much more than I can say for recent Hollywood flicks). It's a film full of blunders, though, and it's so much less than Burton is accustomed to give us that, even through its excellent points I fail to be much impressed. Oh, and poor Lewis Carroll; if he only knew how screenwriter Linda Woolverton has massacred his stories! See it, just for the hell of it. I liked it...but not too much.

A nice warped look,"I had many people tell me this movie was horrible. But they don't know what they are talking about. Lets split it up. First off, it is not the original, this takes place a lot later in Alice's life. I will admit that the whole story was pretty bland. But the characters and who that casted were perfect to the T; with a few errors. I couldn't think of a better cast. Then add in Tim Burton's mind and you got some great visuals. Mia Wasikowska was a decent Alice. Helena Bonham Carter played an excellent, yet strange Red Queen. Ann Hathaway was not a good White Queen, I will admit that. Crispin Glover was a very strange Stayne, but it was perfect for his personality. Matt Lucas had the perfect personality for Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Then Alan Rickman had the perfect voice for the Blue Caterpillar. A smaller part I enjoyed was by Paul Whitehouse who played the March Hare. His character was really funny. Now I wanted to mention my two favorite characters. Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat. The Hatter had a double personality. When he was calm and nice his voice was soft with a lisp. When he got angry it would be a strong Scottish accent. Depp had this perfect. The design and CG of the Cheshire was a joy and Fry had the voice perfect for it. So overall, the visual and the personality of the film was amazing to watch. It just really needed a stronger story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I don't usually like Tim Burton movies, but.....","I will start off by saying that I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton. I usually find his movies a bit strange but if there is one place you can be strange and fit right in, it's Wonderland.I am probably one of the few people who did not see this movie in 3D, but even in 2D it was visually stunning. Wonderland and all it's inhabitants look just as you would imagine, complete with giant toadstools, a blue smoking caterpillar and a Mad Hatter drinking tea.The story is not a remake of the original but rather a 'what happened next' version based around a more grown up 19 year old Alice and this is what made the movie so enjoyable for me. It was great to see the characters that we all love so much having a new adventure.I thought that Johnny Depp might over-egg his part as the Mad Hatter and he would be a bit too much like Willy Wonka in the Chocolate Factory again, but his character was actually really likable and understated. Mia Wasikowska made a very sweet Alice, Helena Bonham Carter hilarious as the Red Queen and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat really stole the show.I agree with other reviewers when they say the storyline of the movie isn't edge of your seat stuff, but for me it didn't need to be.

I liked to watch how Johnny Deep captured very well the Mad Hatter, but I think it was just that.

How To Ruin A Classic Fairy Tale,"Why-Oh-Why did Director Tim Burton have to go and get his grubby, little (Edward Scissor) hands on the story of Alice In Wonderland?The way I see it, Burton almost single-handedly succeeded in totally trashing this unique and unusual fairy tale by turning it into yet another one of his typically terrible, little freak shows.Unlike the 1951 animated version of this same story, where the characters were basically charming, likable and memorable, Burton's offering gives us characters that are really quite the opposite.In my opinion, Burton's remaking of Alice In Wonderland is about the same thing as if Rob Zombie were to go ahead and remake Burton's ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"", or something to that effect.Johnny Depp is another reason for my disliking Alice In Wonderland. Am I the only one who's sick to death of seeing this guy in yet another Burton film?I admit that Depp is a decent enough actor, in a generic sort of way, but the truth is, he is far too over-rated for my liking. And I think it's about time that Burton quit recycling him as if he were a dishrag.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This movie is not aimed at children.,"I thoroughly enjoyed Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. This movie is not a remake of the Lewis Carroll story. It is the story of Alice going back to her memories by falling down the rabbit hole once again. She does not go there to explore the wonders of childhood as she did the first time. She goes to find the adult Alice. Enjoyment is heightened if one has read the book.This movie is not a fable for children, but an introspective for teens and adults. Honestly, as a former teacher, I would recommend that children under 12 not go to this movie because it may frighten them, or they will not understand it. However, I highly recommend it to teenagers and adults. If the viewers not only watch the movie but listen carefully, they should enjoy a marvelous visual and intellectual ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Makes Avatar look stupid.,"After the first 5 minutes I was quite concerned that I wouldn't enjoy this film, but it's one of those that just gets better and better as it goes on. I walked out at the end feeling I'd seen something truly special.Whilst some liberties have been taken with the original story, Lewis Carroll will not be turning in his grave. This is a very pleasing take on the original with fully fleshed out characters, an excellent script and wonderful performances from both 'live' and voice actors.I assume that some of the reviewers on here haven't actually seen the movie and compare the 3D unfavourably with Avatar. In fact the 3D in Alice absolutely knocks spots off Avatar. The feeling of depth is amazing, the detail is jaw dropping and you find yourself dodging all manner of things during of action scenes.Camera angles are superb, lines are delivered perfectly and the whole comes together in an excellent and exciting ending which does the director great credit. Truly, this is directing on a grand scale - the king of hype James Cameron could learn a lot from Tim Burton.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice in Wonderland Review by Albert Chambers,"The film is about a girl called Alice and she goes into a fantasy land; it is a children's fairy tale story.Good and Bad PointsThe 5 good points about the movie are: It has good animation  Good sound effects  Very fast action  Good colour effects  3D effectsThe 5 bad points about the movie are: Some of the colours are dull and dark  It doesn't explain the story properly  It too scary for young children  Its very weird  This type of film will only appeal to a certain viewThe CastSome of the cast I do like are Johnny Depp, Matt Lucas and Stephen Fry. The one person who I hate the most is the director; Tim Burton because he is the one that creates the movies very weird and he has done it to most of the movies in the past e.g. The Nightmare before Christmas, Corpse Bride, Beetle Juice etc.The AimThe aim of this movie is a family (The Audience) to watch this movie, the aim of the movie does not make it a family movie because It too scary for young children and they will probably have nightmares although it meant to be a family movie; so instead they rated it a PG instead of a U so the parents have to be with the children while watching it.OverallOverall I rate this movie 4/5 or 7/10 because it is a very fast action movie and scary and that's what I like in this movie (but its still weird).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Lacking script, marvelous effects","Alice in wonderland, a supposed remake of the sweet Disney classic, yet it seemed much more like a sequel. Tim Burton made the sweet movie into a dark minded film. The movie as I said seems as a sequel since Alice returns to Winderland at the age of 19, and then she has to battle out the bad guys/monsters throughout. There is the new character of the White witch, but from previous knowledge the movie is a combination of ""Jawberjockky""(sorry if misspelled) and ""Throught the Looking Glass"". So the title is the wrong if this is the combination of those two poems/stories. The acting, well it was fine. Johnny Deep, Helena Boham Carter, and Mia Wasikowska played their character close to perfect. The effects were really great, specially the Chesire Cat. Now, talking about the Chesire, I have to say that it looked awesome in blue as a change from pink. He looks more masculine, and more darker. Unfortunately every positive has a negative and that is the script. It was a little to boring and it just seemed as if it was a bad episode of a TV show. The effects were really well played, and even thought the movie was post converted to 3D, the 3D effects were great. In conclusion, the movie was good, not great, but the script was not that good. I would say a rental is fine, but buying the movie is not necessary.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A slightly darker yet still enchanting Wonderland,"I'm a huge fan of the original Disney cartoon, so I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. What I got, was something that, truth be told, I really enjoyed. It was a wonderful adventure into 'Underland', Wonderland's bigger sister with darker undertones and a revamped sense of style.Alice in Wonderland is in classic Tim Burton-esquire style... colourful, bright, beautfiully dark and memorable. The characters were well portrayed and brought back memories of the cartoon. Stand out performances included Helena Bonham-Carter, who to me stole the show with her rendition of the Red Queen (everytime she came on I was mesmerized with her facial expressions, manner of speaking etc), and Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter who, although not seeming as mad as the cartoon version, still made the character seem a little crazy yet unexpectedly attractive. He gave the Hatter a lot more depth than expected, which makes you think twice about this seemingly shallow character.Mia Wasikowska who played Alice did a good job, she portrayed Alice as how I think Tim Burton wanted her to - confused, in denial, and then in control. I enjoyed her performance. The CGI animals were also very well done, in particular the Cheshire Cat voiced by Stephen Fry (so fluffy you just wanted to reach out and pat him), and the Blue Caterpillar voiced by the brilliant Alan Rickman.I saw this movie in 3D, but I don't think I would again. If you're going to see it in 3D... don't expect anything huge. This isn't an Avatar. In fact, I think I would've preferred to have seen this in 2D so I could appreciate the colours and brightness of the film.I have never read the books, but from what I saw, I really enjoyed. My advice to people wanting to know whether to bother or not, is to go see it, and make up your OWN mind. I liked it, maybe you will too.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't waste your money,"I will quote from a friend before elaborating further, as he sums this up perfectly. ""The verdict on Alice It was okay. I think that it sent a much better message to children (especially young girls) than older Disney movies (if you wish upon a star— basically sit around, hope, and it will happen). Nevertheless, the graphics, which look awesome in the advertisements, just made me want to see Avatar again. And other than the red queen,the acting was bland and the characters didn't really drive the story. Johnny Depp is so interested in characterization he doesn't connect, in a human way, with anyone else. (And what's with those eyes? Yikes!) I felt like Burton just forced a lot of ideas together without making them feel like they grew out of each other. It's not quite as disappointing as the last Indiana Jones, but"" Personally, I don't understand all the critics gushing over this movie. Have they all forgotten what a really good magical movie really looks like? It's basically Disney as usual with a few Burton twists, i.e. the Cheshire cat and the Red Queen's bizarre appearance, and other than that I nearly fell asleep. Given the ability of the actors that were signed, this was a fairly boring film. It tried soooo hard but somehow missed the mark. A little less CG effects and more attempts at film making and it would have been a better movie. After all, The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T managed to be a classic with so very little, as did Freaks--two very different, but equally effective, black and white films. And let's not forget, of course, Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast with the great Jean Marais as the Beast. The scene where he carries in his arms Beauty, who has fainted, down his hallway and the candles held by human arms open out as he walks by is timeless cinema magic. Burton, you wish! Ah, what to do? Burton is everybody's darling these days but I just don't see it. I'd prefer he would do cartoons and animation. That he is brilliant at. But flesh and blood isn't his cup of tea. 2 stars out of 10, in my book. Don't waste your money!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An In depth look,"Sitting in the theatre Friday I had prepared for the worst.I had allowed myself to have such high expectations their was no way that even Tim Burton could have meet them. I enjoy Burton's Films mainly because to me they are like curling up with a twisted children's book like Mary Poppins or The wonderful Wizard of Oz.His movies I describe as a living piece of art ripped from the very pages and brought to life deliciously. of these type of tales. Don't believe me? go borrow some of these books from your local library.When Burton does do a movie from a published source he tends to choose only the key elements of the story to bring to life, he mixes it with his own vision of the story and come up with an acceptable take.For Instance Sleepy Hollow. a few alterations and out of it came a deliciously dark tale that was visually stunning and well plotted.Story changing doesn't bother me so much, In fact I feel that if a movie is good enough it will encourage viewers to actually go find the book and read it. In this day in age that's an impressive feat. The lights darkened and the film started and I was once again swept away to Wonderland. The story was solid, well put together and well acted. The story takes an unsure 19 year old woman who after a fanciful journey learns to take control of her own life and to stand up for what she believes in during a period when women didn't have control. Each battle she overcomes in Wonderland is one she had within herself.I think a lot of people are missing that, which makes no sense to me since this story has been told 100's of time over the past century.As Alice goes through Wonderland Tim makes sure that all the key points from both of Lewis Carroll's books are in place. He introduces the characters to Alice who is clearly on a return visit.The colorful array of characters go from the Mad Hatter and the March hare to the Catepilar and Cheshire cat. All the familiars as well as some of the lesser known characters of the White Queen and the Jabborwocki. I was so afraid that Alice In Wonderland would only be about the Mad Hatter, just because of the Depp Factor, but fortunatly Tim remembered the movie was about Alice and her coming of age story.Johnny Depp does exceedingly well in this role compared to the gay pirate routine or the border line pedophile Willy Wonka. The Mad Hatter has depth despite his madness. Anne Hathaway does a brilliant job as the air headed white queen.. a relief from the 1985 mini series depiction of the same character. The Tweedles are awesome' and the Cheshire cat you want to take home with you.Tim's Wife even outdoes herself as the Red Queen. Delightful. Visually is everything you ever wanted Wonderland to be. I do believe that Tim Burton has not used castles in his films since Faerie Tale Theatre's Aladdin.Both Castles are directly from your imagination. Anything and Everything you could want out of an alice in wonderland movie is here and present. now the 3d aspect, not a necessity for enjoyment but definitely icing on the cake. The movie will hold its own in 2-d. Leaving the theatre I felt like it was money worth spent. I went to the theatre to see a work of art tribute for a 100 year old classic done by a very talented director. I got what I hoped for. A good solid story, great acting, stunning visuals and most importantly a desire to see it again.Your enjoyment of the film does depend on your outlook i suppose and what you hope to see. I hope the experience is as equally wonderful for you as it was for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not bad, but still needed to be more general and extra fantasy","This is not the best Tim Burton film yet, but certainly not the worst. I saw this film and had a BIG disappointment in the theaters over the beginning and the ending when she was real. But the film starts out to be TOO much like The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe (2005). And I thought it was the most longest drop in the rabbit hole I've ever seen in Alice in Wonderland movies even when she pounces on that bed. THAT WAS FUNNY!!! This film should be placed into the drama-comedy films, but shouldn't the Top 250s of IMDb movies. I mean, the movie was okay, but still needed to be more general and fantastic as the other Alice in Wonderland moves, I mean, she wouldn't fight and the movies aren't supposed to have thriller and horror in these commercials but they did. POOR Alice. I don't even remember if Alice really got tiny throughout almost start to finish and then big like Attack of the 50 ft. Woman. If this film could just be like that masterpiece, Alice in Wonderland (1985), I would've liked it. But not, it would've been genetic, boring, and unoriginal.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An interesting take on a classic tale,"For me Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland is an interesting take on Lewis Carroll's classic story. I really did enjoy the film, and it's a well made film. I can understand why most fans of the novel are angry, but this is a totally different take on Carrol's novel. You've heard that the story happens when Alice is 19 and returns to Wonderland. Right off the bat, that should give you a hint that its not Lewis Carrol's classic Alice In Wonderland, shes not a child anymore. If you expected this, then of course you'll be disappointed. Alice In Wonderland is a well made, amusing film that if you can get by the fact that Alice is 19 and thinks shes constantly in a dream, then you will enjoy this film. Not Tim Burton's best film, but definitely not his worst. A very enjoyable take on the classic story by Lewis Carroll.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Maybe this can be said, not perfect.","Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is more of a C. S. Lewis Carroll Alice in Narnia with Johnny Depp as your host. Alice, 19, must prove her worth by defeating the Jabberwock. The Reverend Charles Dodgson's critique of English manners and pedantry is food for boisterous chases. Burton thrives on transforming performers into funhouse-mirror reflections of themselves.As the homicidally petulant Red Queen, Bonham Carter has a double-sized head atop a normal-sized body. The White Queen, played by Anne Hathaway, has average proportions despite her unusual pallor. Alice in Wonderland is in 3-D (in many theaters), but Burton doesn't seem interested in Avatar-style immersion. The clash of Red and White Queens on a massive chessboard battlefield is breathtaking. If you haven't seen Blackadder II, you'll be much more impressed with Bonham Carter's bratty insouciance.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disney in a new perspective,"Always been a fan of Disney, but strangely enough ive missed this through my childhood. Heard about it alot and it reminded me one day that one of my favourite actors Johnny Depp starred in this one! So i felt i had to watch it.Starts out abit unique for being a Disney, like a more darker, gothic and deeper style all the way trough the film, but i definitely like the start! Really disney in a new perspective.Acting and manuscript is really good!It's definitely a special film! Definitely not your ordinary Disney!But its absolutely worth watching!Its extremely well made, of course since its a Disney! Very different then what i imagined it was going to be.Good start, but it got abit worse the last 30 min.But all together, a avarage fantasyfilm!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Starts off well,"Compared to the traditional and genre bound fantasy universes of modern successes such as the Harry Potter franchise, the world of Lewis Carroll, and Tim Burton's rendition of it, is truly original and imaginative. In here, genre conventions are largely absent - until the film's final part, in which Burton treats us to a standardized action showdown. This, in addition to the film's lack of recognizability, slowly devaluates a film experience which starts off well, with vivid creations and colours. As with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a few years ago, Burton isn't able to accompany his visuals with an anything else than a superficially engaging narrative. Johnny Depp, on the other hand, yet again produces a funny and well-modelled character from classic literature, and he is accompanied by amusing performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Crispin Glover.*Review written in 2011.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice with a twist...,"Finally gotten around to see the new interpretation of ""Alice In Wonderland"" and with Tim Burton at the helm nonetheless. I had really high expectations for the movie......and now I sit here with a slight feeling of disappointment.Why? Well the movie in itself was a typical Burton movie, with his unique style, touch of finesse, and impressions of the bizarre and remarkable. But somehow the movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression with me.The scenery, sets and everything were what you expect of a Burton movie, twisted, dark, bizarre and absurd. And I love that, he has a very distinct touch and sense of detail. That makes all his movies unique in their own way.The cast list was amazing, simply amazing. Of course it was Johnny Depp, as the Mad Hatter, who carried this movie, and his performance of this character was phenomenal. He always delivers a top notch performance no matter what. And Helena Bonham Carter, as the Red Queen, well she was good as well, something oddly crude about her performance in this movie, but it worked quite nicely. And of course Crispin Glover, as Stayne, he was also quite good in the movie. Alan Rickman was really well cast for a voice acting role, he has a very good and distinct voice. Now, I read that some didn't enjoy Mia Wasikowska in the role of Alice, I did however, find her to be quite enjoyable. She has a very serene and innocent radiance, and Burton managed to paint that out so well on the screen.The CGI animations and effects in the movie were, of course, off the roof. The animated creatures were very real and life-like. And everything was just loaded with small details.Tim Burton's re-invention of a classic is a good movie, and if you are a fan of his previous work, I am sure you will like this one as well. Now, I said that I was a bit disappointed, I guess it was because I had really high expectations to this movie. ""Alice in Wonderland"" is far from a bad movie, so don't get me wrong here. And it is good to see someone take classics and tell them again with a warped sense to it.Oh, and the dance scene with Johnny Depp, well personally I think that was one scene that should have been either left out of the final cut, or have been shot in a complete other way. It didn't go well with me at all.Great entertainment, but for me personally, this is hardly a movie that I will be picking up to watch again at a later time.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You'll Never Want To Come Out Of The Rabbit Hole,"""You're absolutely Alice, I'd know you anywhere.""Whether you love him or hate him, you have to admit Tim Burton is a visual genius. His films always have enough wild artistic imagination to keep audiences satisfied, and sometimes he can actually tell a decent story when he puts his mind to it. It wasn't a surprise when it was announced he would tackle Alice In Wonderland because the project always had his name written all over it. Now that it has finally arrived, audiences are eager to drift away into another world and leave reality behind them. Does Burton's latest effort give audiences the wild ride they are expecting?Absolutely.Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland is an incredible work of art that captures you from the first second the film starts until the very second the credits end. Once you enter the theater, you surrender yourself to Burton's fantasy universe. If you're fortunate enough to see the film in IMAX 3-D, you'll be blown away by the expansive presentation and depth the film gives to the viewer. This is one of the best IMAX 3-D presentations I've come across in a long time. The film uses up the entire IMAX screen throughout the course of the presentation, so we're not subject to the 'switching' of aspect ratios during the movie. The images are crystal clear and sometimes feel like they're right in front of you. The audio was just mind-blowing and it really presented the soundtrack well, especially since some of the music in this film is incredibly well done. Trust me, it never disappoints. Now, if you're seeing the film in a conventional theater in Digital 3-D, you should still have a great time. Hell, even if you saw it without the 3-D, the visuals are sure to take your breathe away. You'll forget your in the movie theater, and you'll feel as if you're along with Alice for the ride.Don't worry though: the visuals aren't the only good thing about this film. The performances are spot on. Johnny Depp was perfectly cast as the Mad Hatter. His performance should stick with audiences for quite some time. Depp brings such a wide emotional range to the character that audiences will surely feel his humor, sadness, happiness, and his down right creepy chaotic state of mind. Mia Wasikowska was also perfectly cast as Alice. Burton made the right move by choosing someone who isn't insanely popular, but talented enough to bring the innocence of Alice to life. Wasikowska does an incredible job of developing the character from an unsure depressed teen, to a confident and optimistic adult. Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway also did a great job playing the Red Queen and White Queen respectively. Even Alan Rickman does a great job with his brief cameo appearances as the Caterpillar.Now, while the film was insanely fun and felt like a genuine adventure, it does have one flaw worth noting. This flaw, which may not come as a surprise to many, is the story line. I was optimistic with the story, especially since this film focuses on Alice's return to Wonderland. But something about it was just off. It was a little corny at times and at other moments it wasn't completely coherent. The story also doesn't do justice to Carter's Red Queen character: she's so viciously evil, yet her main opponent is just her sister, The White Queen, who lives on the opposite side of a huge valley. By the third act, you go back and fourth between these two castles so much that you feel you want to explore other parts of Wonderland, but you don't get to. I feel as if they should have abandoned The White Queen, and just focused on rebelling against the sinister Red Queen. Finally, the story suggests everything is destined in some way...which doesn't leave much for the imagination.The overall product, however, was great. Without a doubt, audiences will have a fun time being sucked into Burton's twisted world. As movie-goers, we always ask for a film that will take us on a crazy adventure, and this film does just that. Even though there are some weak plot points, the film does such an incredible job of capturing the viewer that you can forgive Burton for his poor story choices. For the last two hours I was in Wonderland with Alice, meeting some crazy-ass characters. By the time I got out of the theater, I forgot it was 2:00 AM in the morning. When I drove away from the IMAX cinema, I wanted nothing more than to jump down the rabbit hole for a second run.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better than most give it credit, and an actual plot!","I can't imagine a fantasy world more suited to Tim Burton's visual stylings than the insane place known as Wonderland, created by Lewis Carroll. I've often heard people criticize this film, and I can't figure out why, because I think it's actually one of Burton's best movies. It is a marvelous thing to behold, and has some wonderfully over-the-top performances. I also loved how they used the CGI in order to accentuate those performances and make things look a little off. Instead of entirely fabricating a Queen of Hearts, they have Helena Bonham Carter deliver a hilarious performance and then inflate her head to insane proportions with the computer. Even when things were entirely practical, there was an otherworldly style to them, like Anne Hathaway's playful performance as the White Queen. The one grounding force of the film is Mia Wasikowska, who is charming and comes across as normal, but gets gradually changed by the magical oddity of Underland.The one downfall of this adventure of Alice in Wonderland is the inflation of the Mad Hatter's role, simply because Burton has a love for Johnny Depp. His character is relatively inconsequential in the story, but is forced in more often than anyone needs. There are even moments when the movie stops its forward progression so the Hatter can have a scene in the limelight. I'm all for broadening the characters in this story to make them resonate more, but I think it doesn't work that well here. Otherwise, this movie works great. But all of this should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have no affinity for the original animated Alice in Wonderland. What delights me about this movie is that it injects an actual plot into the seeming drug-induced nonsense of the original. Plus, it does all this without unwriting that movie, but implying it just happened in the past. I feel like I'm in the minority on this one, but Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a movie I'll gladly watch again anytime.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing!,"I've always been a fan of Tim Burton's so I was really looking forward to this movie. In the end I was disappointed.What I liked: The special effects were amazing! The acting is good all around. The score is nice.What I didn't like: The lack of action, it could have been so much better with more creature's. The lack of direction, Alice didn't seem to know What she was doing at all.In the end it's done beautifully but it's just so slow and boring that it's hard to really like.Johnny Depp isn't anywhere near as amazing an actor as he was ten years ago. Helena Bonham Carter is a good actress but she wasn't given much here. Anne Hathaway does good with what she's given but thats not much. Mia Wasikowska does good but it seems like she isn't given any direction at all. Crispin Glover does good but he doesn't have much of a character. All of the voice overs stole the show.

Mia W almost ruins this otherwise fun film,"""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010, 105-min, PG, D/Tim Burton) I watched the 3D version of this which added that extra visual oomph to this live-action fantasy. Mia W'ska stars as ""Alice"" in her first leading role, and I wasn't impressed. She had a really hard time apparently doing green-screen acting. Much of this film was cgi and obviously done in post-production so the live production would've mainly been acting with your imagination that there were make-believe characters in front of you, etc, and she just didn't pull that off well at all. But even during the live-action, non-cgi sequences she just came off as stilted/wooden, again, not impressive. I guess Tim Burton, a fine director, just couldn't direct her to success. Beyond that, the other principals pulled their weight and saved the film. One of the things I found amusing was how much this adaptation had in common with 1939's Wizard of Oz, esp Alice and Dorothy. Looks like writer Linda Woolverton took more ""liberties"" than normal with this. One final thing, cultural messaging was fairly muted till the end when she returns to her abandoned wedding and spouts a bunch of feminist ideology which is out of character for ""Alice"" as a young teen character, so the movie ends with a thud instead of charm.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Walt Disney would cut off the heads of those responsible for this work!,"Appreciable visual effects, despite they're not as surreal as those in the original movie.

Even so, I wouldn't say it was a failure, but it could have been way better. Still, it's a good retelling of the classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A beautiful remake of a classic fairy tale - Visually stunning,"This movie is thoroughly enjoyable for families and anyone with an appreciation for visual affects. You truly are transported from the dull, pastel-colored ordinary world, to a dark world full of magic and curiosity. Be warned that this is not the happy and whimsical animation of 1951, it's much darker, and in my opinion, better. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter were downright fabulous, though that's far from unexpected. I had never head of Mia but I approve of her performance. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is as enthralled by visuals as I am. It truly is just beautiful, even if you could care less about the plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not perfect, but a visual treat","I have been waiting for this film for two years ever since it was announced that Tim Burton was directing it. He is my idol and an immense inspiration for my artwork(Yes I'm an artist).I saw the mid-night premiere with my friends and it was beautiful. Although I got a little hurt from the internet trolls(who are pretty much the same ones who didn't like Burton's Charlie & the chocolate factory) afterward.Admitedly, the storyline is rather thin and predictable, but the visuals and the wonderland (sorry, Underland) characters make the film worthwhile. Mia Wasikowska was perfect for the role of Alice.Johnny Depp turns in another oddball performance as the mad hatter with a bit more gravity than most interpretations of the character. Helena Bonham Carter as the red queen is another major scene-stealer giving off the personae of a bratty toddler that fits in with the demented feel of Underland. This was the first time I appreciated Anne Hathaway in a role, her performance as the white queen is creepy and freaky. Crispin Glover also turns in an amusing role as Stayne(Knave of Hearts).The animal characters are given perfect voice talents. The hight lights being Paul Whitehouse's March Hare who is absolutely hilarious and Stephen Fry's Chesire Cat with a seductive creepiness. Barbara Windsor and Timothy Spall also turn in amusing takes as the dormouse(the complete opposite of most interpretations of the character) and as the Bloodhound.The style of Underland is wonderfully Burton-esquire with a Gothic feel particularly around the second act of the film. Overall, this is not a film for everyone especially those who are purist fans of Lewis Carroll's writings.This is more of a sequel than an actual adaption. younger children will probably be frightened a bit. It is not perfect, but it is a visual treat.I look forward to what is next for Tim Burton.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So this became my must watch film since then.So, obviously I had huge expectations. Did the film meet them? I'm afraid it did not; to me it looked like a Disney product painted by Burton, not like a Burton product distributed by Disney.It looked amazing, give me Wonderland over Pandora any day, and the 3D was awesome.The customs were brilliant and the score amazing as always.The acting was one of its high points as well; loved the March Hare it remind me so much of the animated version, Helena Bonham-Carter as the Red Queen owed Wonderland, our leading lady did a fabulous job, she has great potential to become something great, Johnny Depp as always fits perfectly in Burton's world, Anne Hathaway was over the top perfect, subtle, and her unique charisma contrasted beautifully with Helena Bonham-Carter's wicked character.The screenplay was weak, for someone that wrote such great scripts like Beauty & The Beast, and The Lion King, I was expecting something with more heart.Rating 6.50/10, but I'm willing to give it another try in a couple of weeks but in a 2D screening.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It is after an unique interpreation that mya be lost on DVD and on televison,"(2010) Alice in Wonderland
FANTASYTo enjoy this film, I had to first reframe my mind to expect whatever it was to expect for I already knew it was defined as a sequel! That upon seeing the film on the first 30 minutes was originally a boring experience and was hard to continue! But after awhile and seeing many films later, I was able to rewatch the film again starting from the beginning and was astonished how involved the second time around, for in my opinion the effectiveness might be lost without watching it on a 3D television set (which I do not own yet) Anyways, the story has an older Alice whose almost in her teens, old enough to be engaged but continue recollecting the incident that happened on the first film but continues to convince herself that it was nothing more than a dream, only to stumble the exact same hole again! She, of course goes into the hole but as the film progresses, she was destined to help the so-called 'white queen' (Anne Hathaway) for the purpose is it to overthrow the red queen for as we had soon learned, people who were always under her rule for such a long time were abiding her rules was a result of a powerful creature called the jabberwocky and unable to be killed by anyone else, especially the white queen because she's constructed to never kill which is why she allows others to kill for her! Some of the CGI effects look cheesy on a regular TV but are intention to be seen on 3D. I have no idea whether my rating would've made much difference whether it's watched on it's intended format or not but for the time being this film warrants a pass for it's original idea. This is the sixth of seven movies actress Helena Bonham Carter collaborated with director Tim Burton; and the seven of eight times Johnny Depp collaborated with Tim Burton.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It makes a rather ugly adaption but a rather lovely trash-binge.,"As a big fan of the original books, the best adjective for this is ""fanfictiony"".It's not an adaptation of Wonderland; it's Alice part 3.But is it fun? Yeah I guess. Burton decided to make his own take on and it's kind of what Shrek is for fairy-tales. Basically a new adventure but with imagery and concepts informed from another thing though ultimately it is a subversion.Grotesque and comedic, rather than the charm of of Burton's early work it just feels kind of garish. It's hard to take it seriously and I kind of enjoy it from above. It's silly and always has something going on so it's a lot like his adaptation of Charlie: it's not very elegant and a lot of it is just kind of juvenile in the bad way (""it's the wrong Alice!"") but there is so much more dull you could spend your time on.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hidden theme?,"I don't normally go looking for grown-up subtexts in kids' movies, but about half way into this one it hit me in the face: viewed at one level this film is 'about' the events leading up to the US invasion of Iraq. Suddenly, a whole lot of the Tim Burton storyline (as modified) began to make more sense. Just suppose (for the fun of it) that Alice stands for George W Bush; then the Red Queen is Saddam Hussein and the Jabberwocky would be Al-Quaeda. In the final battle scene there's also a hard-to-miss Coalition of the Willing. The impossibly beautiful and sanctimonious White Queen most clearly represents the United Nations - as perceived, that is, by the right-wing pro-war camp. For those of the opposite persuasion, of course, there is the smug satisfaction of knowing the whole heroic ""Alice-to-the-rescue"" thing is nothing but a delusional fantasy. There's something for both sides to take from this movie, which makes it a shrewd double-headed winner for Mr Burton. Having said that, I really enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Edward Scissorhands part 25?,"Actually it isn't, Scissorhands was original at least! It was a long time ago that I tired of Burton's ""style"", but at least in the past his movies had a good pace and interesting story despite being visual carbon copies of his earlier successes.Alice in wonderland is a prime example of Burton relying on his tried and tested money making formula, ""well if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", right? Well Tim, it is broke! This movie never takes off, it merely lumbers along at yawn inducing pace. The characters, sorry, people who appear on screen (there is nobody with character in this movie) are either boring, shallow or just plain strange and not the good Tim Burton kind of strange, the ""what the hell was that!!"" kind of strange! I direct you in particular to Depp's bizarre Scottish freak outs. By the end of the movie you don't really care who won or lost the final battle (battle being a term I use loosely) you just imagine Tim Burton raking his hands through YOUR money laughing hysterically. I actually can't think of particular sections of this movie to mock, purely because it was so bland, nothing stuck in my mind.The visuals, while mildly interesting, feel underdeveloped and we really have seen it all before. Mainly in Burtons other films. Which brings me neatly to the soundtrack, yes, you guessed it Danny Elfman, AGAIN! The score could easily be mistaken for any of Elfman's previous soundtracks and doesn't fit the movie well at all, it really makes you wonder why Burton continues to give this guy work???Being a fan of the original story and Tim Burton's early work, I really wanted to like this movie. It seemed the perfect adaptation for Burton. A chance to put his gloomy spin on a story that always needed a dark and twisted edge. Unfortunately it feels like all involved just sleepwalked their way through it. I honestly can't think of a redeeming feature in this movie. A very boring and poorly put together adaptation.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Completely taken by surprise!,"Having read many of the derogatory revues prior to seeing this film I was braced for disappointment. So what a pleasure it was to be taken by surprise and find myself totally absorbed in this clever and magical new trip into Wonderland. For me, the whole film throbbed with energy, vibrant imagery and above all, fun. The new 'slant' on an old story was, I felt, handled imaginatively and with a pleasing freshness.My wife and I went to see Avitar a couple of weeks ago and both considered that without the 3D effects it would have been a very ordinary film with minimal charm, just one more in a succession of computer generated movies. Not so Alice which for me had charm in spades, a far superior storyline and enough of the characteristics of the original story to satisfy my appetite for traditionalism. It also retained a true sense of 'Englishness' which was another nice surprise in a world where that has so often been lost. The effects were great and I take my hat off to all the cast who more than did justice to their parts. Maybe not the greatest movie ever made but certainly a visual feast with never a dull moment but, perhaps most importantly...it was a lot of fun. Thank you Tim Burton, WE REALLY ENJOYED IT!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too Sensible?,"It looks brilliant and most of the characters feel true to the book, even if darkened, depthened and Burton-ised. The story isn't really Alice in Wonderland but rather a sort of grown up sequel. It's very pretty, it's fun, it's inoffensive, and it's enjoyable. It's also simple and largely sensical which is really the opposite of Alice in Wonderland. It's a good film, it's a good idea for a return to Wonderland story, it's a great cast, but it's too safe and simple to stand out or feel like it fits in the magical nonsense of Wonderland.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice still dreaming,"I believe that when writing a script, it's important for the writer to establish the ending first to ensure the story flows cohesively. While the movie started off strong, it seemed to lose its direction due to inconsistent writing.What type of CGI effects were used? There was a noticeable gap in the movie-the scenes and story lacked a seamless connection. I'm still trying to determine the movie's genre-was it comedy, fantasy, sci-fi, or something else?I particularly enjoyed the soldiers, especially their unique running style. That was fascinating! I also loved Johnny Depp's scenes, like walking on the table, crafting a small dress, and cleverly fooling people.Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but it didn't quite live up to expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Johnny Depp + Tim Burton = a fun film.,"Welcome to a creepy fantasy world, courtesy of director Tim Burton and his favorite actor Johnny Depp. While some might be growing tired of the Burton/Depp combo, I am not, the unquestionable talent Depp brings to every role is a big plus in this film. Depp makes even the most ridiculous character come alive and seem believable. The visuals in this film are nothing short of fantastic, even when they are not in 3D (Hollywood knock it off with the 3D crap, it's an annoying and expensive gimmick.) Much like The Wizard of Oz, the fantastic characters found in Wonderland are reflections of people Alice knows in the real world. The wicked Queen of Hearts, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dumb, The Knave of Hearts, The Cheshire Cat, The Catterpiller, The Mad Hatter, The Rabbit, and the cast of my favorite poem, The Jabberwocky, all are wonderfully done amid a sea of stunning visuals and a magical story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Splendiferous Tribute,"I've reviewed Tim Burton's ""Alice"" at Trilllogic Innoventions. I am only here to speak in the name of fairness, which seems very lacking in cyberspace these days, as well as in the real world. I see too many artful works such as this ripped to shreds by those who love to bash. I read spiteful remarks hurled at actresses and actors, directors, screenwriters by individuals hiding behind aliases. Everyone's entitled to their opinions. That doesn't make it right to vent your frustrations at others simply because you can. I have never been afraid to stand alone on a field of battle and raise my vorpal pen against an army of naysayers. Fans of mindless Action will probably not appreciate this film. They will probably not be satisfied until 3-D technology advances to the point of reaching from the screen and actually clobbering them over the head. Those looking for dramatic emotional depth or sidesplitting belly laughs may be disappointed. It isn't about that and never was. A true fan of Lewis Carroll will appreciate this light yet intricate romp as a splendiferous tribute. Somebody unfamiliar with Wonderland should marvel at it too.

High fantasy action adventure in a brilliant display of CGI.,"The classic tale of 'Alice in Wonderland' brilliantly comes to life as a visual spectacle through the visionary and imaginative eyes of Tim Burton.'Alice in Wonderland' is an incredible display of colour, interesting characters like never seen before, and CGI galore! Action, adventure, humor and stunning visuals blend to bring us a fantasy adventure unlike anything we've experienced before. Trust Tim Burton to achieve this...Due to the high fantasy element, this might not be for everyone's palate. Nothing here is realistic and therefore not relatable. This is pure fantasy for fantasy enthusiasts only. Even fans of the original story might find it too fantastical. Then again, you can't help but marvel at the accomplishments here; again proving nothing in the industry is impossible anymore.Mia Wasikowska stars as the titular character and I thought she was very good. Johnny Depp was brilliant as Mad Hatter, as was Helena Bonham-Carter as Red Queen. You know the story, you know the characters, but we've never seen in on screen this incredible.

Like your favorite t-shirt at the bottom of your laundry basket,"If there ever was a strong case of plagiarism it would be Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, who incidentally acknowledged he never really liked the story to begin with. And boy, does it show.Aside from occasionally beautiful set pieces (all CGI) Mr Burton manages to take the story (both the 1951 Disney version as the original book) and butcher nearly everything that was good about it. Originally Alice dreamt up this world to rebel against the status quo she was raised in, only to discover that in random madness she would not find more sense or happiness then in the reality of her own world.No more random madness, no more 'coming of age' revelations, no, Tim Burton instead steals the story of Wonderland and all its characters, twists and turns it into something that only slightly resembles it and becomes like unwashed laundry; stale, muff and in need of a thorough clean up.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I can't help but read some of the reviews filled with hyperbole and flash and crack up to myself over these people writing in who deem themselves as legitimate film critics.It is a delightful bit of fancy if you are willing to embrace the ""suspension of all disbelief"" thought process.

So disappointing,"I have only ever written a couple of reviews, but people are so divided on this one that i felt compelled to voice my opinion on it.I was so looking forward to this, Tim Burton, Disney, Alice in Wonderland, what a combo! I was counting down the days until it's release.Unfortunately as soon as the film started I just kept waiting to be sucked in. I was on the outside of this film right up until the end, never included in the story, never involved. I wasn't routing for anyone, I couldn't relate to anyone. Each character had the ability to be fantastic (Stephen Fry as the Cheshire cat for example) but were just hugely underdeveloped and not used to their advantage.Alice was hugely irritating in my opinion, not a great actress and very boring, I didn't care for her or what happened to her. The tea party scene annoyed me too, the 'madness' wasn't fun to watch, just left me confused and as if I was missing something. 'That's the point!' fans will say, but it still has to be enjoyable, relate-able, surely?The white queen, very unlikeable, yet we were supposed to be on her side? I know everyone is meant to be crazy and off-the-wall but at least make her strong, kind, friendly? She seemed like a Lady Gaga impersonator on drugs.The effects were not as good as Avatar, it was as though they didn't really use the 3D. The Cheshire cat could have been right up in our faces, the Jabberwocky could have really scared us, but it just stayed there in the screen. And what's with the disturbing sexual tension between Alice and the Mad Hatter? Obviously there were redeeming qualities, the high points were Helena Bonham Carter as the Queen of Hearts, the only scenes which amused and entertained me, and obviously Depp is great as always, although this definitely wasn't his best performance. I enjoyed the montage of scenes of Alice as a child, that added something that had previously lacked.But still, at the end I was left thinking 'That's it?' Really disappointed, could have been so great! 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A gorgeous fairy tale world,"The special effects are gorgeous, but the story is just so-so",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underrated,"Far from flawless, but still quite magical- Alice in Wonderland provides an incredibly irreverent spin on the classic source material. To start off with the films flaws, there are certainly moments throughout where the CGI and special effects do not age quite so well. The pacing can also be all over the place at times, and the film itself can just be- well- mad at times- popping from one crazy moment to the next without any real explanation or fit. Yet despite all of this, the film does have a rather whimsical charm to it. The background scenery and atmosphere is delightful, and Mia Wasikowska is just excellent as our titular character. Not to mention Johnny Depp as the infamous Mad Hatter who is as odd as he is a delight, and honestly- perfectly cast. Its storytelling is a bit out of place, but its central premise is interesting, and I can see many parallels Disney must have stole to make Oz the Great and Powerful a few years later. Tim Burton does a wonderful job directing, as well giving Alice some much needed character depth. Being an avid hater of the original film myself, I was delighted to see how different and unique this one was. It wasn't just some lucid fever dream spun together, but a movie with a message, decent acting, and a heart. Granted, it can be a mess at times, but in the end Alice in Wonderland does everything it needs to to make its story believable and enrapture us in the world on screen.My Rating: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad but could have been so much better.,"I was really revved up about seeing this movie. The trailers and the designs had me pumped. When I left the theater, my feeling was that while it was pretty decent, it felt underwhelming. Burton seemed like an ideal director for this oft-filmed tale and yet it lacks magic or wonder. In all fairness to Burton, however, it's more the fault of the script-writer Linda Woolverton. It isn't a horrible script mind you. But it tries too hard to give more fantasy archetypes to a story that didn't really need any. For example, the caterpillar becomes the wise sage, and the Hatter is the loner who connects with the hero (think Aragorn). Also, when she throws in little nods to the books, it comes off as insecure as if to say ""OK. There see? I haven't messed this story up."" I liked Depp's Hatter in the first scene but after a while he devolved into more of the bland Disney prince with a few eccentricities here and there. Waszikoska (sp?) is not a very interesting Alice, but again the problem seems to lie more in the script than the performance.So what did I like about it? The CGI characters look really cool owing quite a lot to Tenniel's original drawings with a very, very subtle Burtonesque edge. In fact the CGI creations are the real scene stealers. The backgrounds are lovely to look at but I think Burton's real sets work better because they add an extra level of magic and awe (like his stop-motion sets). I might be one of the few that did like Hathaway as the White Queen. Say what you will about her performance, but it was just so over-the-top that it was one of the highlights of the movie.So all in all, this is a pretty hit-and-miss film. The dialog is pretty mediocre and some of the action scenes feel un-actiony. But on the other hand it is nice to look at and a good chunk of the actors try to work with what little material they have. If you want a really good version of the story, then I suggest either reading the books or watching the original Disney cartoon.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Fabulous , wonderfully timed, cast, and  real surprise from start to end","This movie was incredible in that it captured so much of the original, and was wonderfully cast, scored, shot, timed..

For a 34 year old, I found the humour to be present on every level, for any age, and that there was nothing that anyone could find offensive, much less tasteless. A real credit to the director for doing justice to the author, and delivering so much character to the actors, and indeed to all the animated events- not a whisker out of place.

Disappointment,"""Alice in Wonderland"" by Lewis Carroll, directed by Tim Burton (whom I love), starring celebrities like Johnny Depp (whom I adore), Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman and legendary Christopher Lee, with technical capabilities of year 2010 and a $ 200 million budget ... You can not blame me for having high expectations. And when you see this wonder of wasted potential you won't blame me for being disappointed either.The film is visually impressive and I really have no complaints, but everything else is lousy. Tim Burton didn't really fail, but we all know that he can do it much much better. Mad Hatter is one of Depp's weakest roles, Mia Wasikowska is sweet and she played Alice quite decent, and only Helena Bonham Carter really made an impression on me. The story is cute but lousy, it's not boring, but it doesn't engage you as much as such adventure should. You will not have the urge to turn off the movie, but you will not be upset if you need to leave it in half. However, I'm not sure how much is that the fault of unimaginative screenwriter and director (it certainly isn't Carroll's fault), and how much is this actually result of this being Disney movie primarily intended for children, which imposes many limitations. But the fact that the film is intended for children is just an explanation, and not an excuse for a naive, shallow and too simple story. A quality movie for children should be multilayered, on the first glance simple enough to entertain children, but with a certain depth that will intrigue adults. This movie doesn't have that. If you are out of elementary school you're too old for this.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It looked nice, very visually pleasing but the story put me to sleep. There was no real action to speak of. I didn't feel anything at all for the characters.

2010's Alice in Wonderland Review,"Disney's live action remake of Alice in Wonderland is what I feel is alright, far from being anything too spectacular, but still alright.I find the story a bit predictable as the scroll literally told us the audience what's the ending is going to be. It'll be better if the characters deviated from it or it didn't exist. It'll save it from being too predictable.I find that it is good visually. Several characters and Wonderland itself are CGI-ed in. I find that they did a real good job at doing the visuals.I feel like they did various things in this movie to set up Alice Into the Looking Glass and try to get us to watch it when it comes out 6 years after this one.While watching it, it feels like they are trying to make some sense of the classic story that doesn't make any sense at all. I felt like that made some equal nonsense.Overall, I feel like Alice In Wonderland could be improved in various ways, but still alright.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Depp is always on time,"Depp is always on time; he as always, steals the show as the Hatter, him sounding one moment like Groundskeeper Willie, the next like Sweeny Todd, and the dance he does at the end is hilarious and psychedelic. Hathaway is a little too Jack Sparrow for my liking, and doesn't really add anything to the film.Bonham Carter and Glover are fine as the villain, but they too begin to grate as the film goes on. Good job then to the newcomer who plays Alice. Although she has a big job to do, in keeping up with some bizarre visuals and some huge talent, she manages to keep the character interesting and endearing.Thankfully, it's a really good movie, with a very good narrative and good editing. Thankfully the connotations to drugs are not very obvious, but they are there, and although some of the 3-D is in your face, it does assist the film and Hinder it at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Alice? Yes, passed conditionally","I had been waiting for this film since his first announcement in 2008, so it was natural that I expected a lot from Tim Burton and the remaining crew, after the wonderful Sweeney Todd and the insuperable Big Fish, which for me is the best Tim Burton work so far. Failing to mention that I was very disappointed in finding out my running-wild myopia doesn't allow me to see 3D films (I still have trouble with my sight, and I came back from cinema one hour ago), I think the visuals are a delight, surely worth of the definition ""Wonderland"": tortuous trees, garish flowers, Cheshire Cat and Blue Caterpillar better than Disney's, disproportionate queens and fantastic architectures, the crew couldn't do a better work, not to mention the costumes, the cinematography and the casting - although I didn't like the soundtrack and the score. Mia Wasikowska is a good breakthrough for the film, Anne Hathaway had a role that had a high risk of over-acting and ridiculousness, which she pulled off quite well, and Burton-darlings Depp and Bonham Carter were perfect as usual. But, but... there's something I didn't quite like. I often had the impression this was a film on commission, not generated by the filmmaker's own creativity and desire to produce a new work, and that's why ""Alice"" lacked a lot of the poetry present in so many Burton films, the mostly loved factor, I think, of his production. I couldn't feel any true inspiration here, and it was a kind of letdown, because, if only it featured a tiny bit of inspiration, it could be a masterpiece remembered in years. I'm afraid ""Alice"" will remain only a minor movie in Tim Burton's filmography, and it will be mainly quoted for its outer beauty. I'm sorry I'm giving a Tim Burton's film a 7, but I think this is the rightest vote, considering the reasons I previously tried to analyze.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton makes Alice in Wonderland and it's better than you'd initially think,"Firstly, I'm no Lewis Caroll fanboy nor a connoisseur in any quality of the original novel so this review contains nothing in relation to whether the film was true to the book and what not, it's a movie review purely about the movie: Alice in Wonderland (2010) directed by Tim Burton and starring Mia Wasikowska whom since they've been brought up both do a very efficient job in my opinion for their respective tasks: Alice is strong-willed, has lots of presence and character and that's precisely what her role is about: a free-thinker in a world of formatted prudes who's not afraid to let her imagination and peculiar personality thrive. I also think that young Australian actress fit the character physically as she was not only pleasant to look at but conveyed that strong will while not being boorish either, just that fine line: a feminine tomboy with the slightness and freshness of a young girl.And now about Burton: he does well to recycle the Alice story and keep it exciting and bring enough elements to it that it's something new to look at, rather than just being another Burton or just another Alice iteration. 
The film is structured and paced just right running in at the standard 1 hour 45min. Each scene is memorable and distinct visually, the dialog very good and punchy, often funny, and it never lets itself become self-indulgent. All the secondary characters and sprites are very well crafted - Johnny Deep as the Mad Hatter, those two plump boys, the Jabberwocky (voiced by Christopher Lee as an easter egg), both Queens are fantastic (and hilarious in their own way: Anne Hathaway and her deliberately annoying princess-like mannerisms holding out her hands like a fairy and coming close to throwing up a few times - and Bonham Carter's anger tantrums and ridiculous head), the Cheshire Cat... the tiny frog subjects of the queen and their deep voices...Stylistically the film is quite awesome: from the very cool design for the card soldiers, to generally the sometimes barren sometimes hyper-colorful and rich dreamy landscapes with that thick hard contrast filter throughout, to the way they depicted for instance the phonies with their caricatured overly large features...All in all, a job very well done. Obviously however one looks at it, it's still mostly crafted on an original story and inspired by a few earlier versions.

A missed chance,"Charles L. Dodgson, Professor for Mathematics and Logic at the renowned Christ Church College in Oxford gave his two Alice-Books that he wrote under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll as Christmas gifts for Alice Pleasance Liddell, the little daughter of his boss and director of the College. Other books followed, letters, too, in which Carroll got more and more clear and serious about his sexual interest in the little girl. The family Liddle excluded him from the annual invitation, and forthwith he was isolated in his University, at least his job was not taken away - from fear of a scandal in Victorian England. In the preamble of ""Through the Looking-Glass"", he wrote: ""Child of the pure unclouded brow / And dreaming eyes of wonder! / Though time be fleet, and I and thou / Are half a life asunder (...). I have not seen thy sunny face, / Nor heard thy silver laughter: No thought of me shall find a place / In thy young life's hereafter / Come hearken then, ere voice of dread, / With bitter tidings laden, / Shall summon to unwelcome bed / A melancholy maiden! (...)"". The case is clear: Alice should always remember the love of her fatherly friend when some day - as Carroll is convinced - Alice will be ""laid"" (cf. laden) by male brutality in her future child-bed. Not only is it unthinkable for Carroll that an other man will come in Alice's life, for him, Carroll, love comprises only that subtle form of touching the hardly sprouted blooms. What a great idea would it have been if Alice was allowed to go back to her trip down to the Wonderland together with Carroll. Strictly speaking, according to the above quotations, she has no right and (most supposedly) no possibility to enter that reign of her youth anyway. Despite the concession of every artistic freedom, I see here in Burton's movie first a gigantic and unforgivable misunderstanding of Carroll's work, and second, sadly enough, a missed chance that would have open quite newer horizons for this movie than repetition according to the pattern of theme and variation.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Children were dancing in the aisles,"I was surprised, having read many unflattering reviews at how much I enjoyed the movie. I think it was a fun movie and I laughed quite a lot. It isn't deep, and there are parts I am sure were left on the cutting room floor. The ending in particular seemed to just chop and there were some confusing references which I was sure must refer to some lost bit of the film. The story was good though and not predictable as even some Oscar nominees have been.Oh yes, I always hoped Burton would make Alice a brunette, but that wasn't this story and if that doesn't suit some, so be it. Perhaps it is a love hate thing which depends on what one expected to see. It was a good way to spend a couple of hours and I was surprised at how fast the movie flew by, where some much lauded movies of late had me aching.I saw children dancing in the aisles after the movie and there was applause in the theater.

Tim Burton Triumphant,"Tim Burton gets to do here what he does best: fantasy with a dark edge. Just as he did with his modern fairy tale classic Edward Scissorhands, Burton takes a whimsically fantastic story and gives it some bite.Remaining true to the characters and situations of the books, which for those of you who haven't read them had some dark edges of their own, Burton eschews some of the preciousness of the Disney cartoon version and makes the story more accessible to modern teens and adults while retaining the classic period feel. Depp and Bonham-Carter are perfect in their roles, and Wasikowska as Alice holds her own with them. The special effects are great. I loved the Cheshire cat and the blue caterpillar (voiced by the always excellent Alan Rickman); they really had personality though they were CG creations.This is an amazing looking film that doesn't forget the importance of telling a good story. The screenwriter has done a great job of taking Alice's ""real life"" and weaving it into her journey through Underland, where she comes to a valuable realization and greater understanding of herself. A fine film for children and adults.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mythology from whimsy,"This version of the story really isn't a version but a continuation with the same title. However, this continuation treats Wonderland in a totally different light, with elements of Carroll's works thrown together into a mythology of Wonderland. Depending on what one liked about the original story, a viewer would either enjoy the new perspective or be incredibly offended.In the first place, two things are apparent: there are lots of special effects, and there is a lot of screen time for Johnny Depp. The effects are nice enough, in keeping with the level of quality of contemporary movies. It's better than average, although the color design seems drab. Depp doesn't display a good feel for the role, strangely enough. Maybe it's because we've seen too much of him and we can hear a bit of Jack Sparrow here, a trace of Willy Wonka there, but very little Chocolat anywhere. It's another Tim Burton movie for Depp.The story takes the whimsy of the original and creates a mythology from it. In this way, it becomes another Hollywood effort to turn an older and respected story into a sword and sorcery epic. In this case, the epic doesn't have the juice, since it squeezed all the satire out of the original and used the superficial husk that was left. The familiar whimsical elements are treated too seriously and fail to be entertaining. The story drags on too long and begins to look just like any other special effects movie, complete with roaring monsters, last-minute escapes and a chorus of women singing some unrecognizable words at a climactic moment.On a personal note, I can't fathom that the filmmakers didn't get the name of the beast - the Jabberwock. It's mentioned several times in the original poem, which they chopped up for no reason. The name of the poem in the original is clearly ""Jabberwocky"" but at no time is that considered to be the name of the beast itself, until this movie. As one of those poor young men who took the time to memorize the poem for his own amusement, I'm personally offended at the carelessness in weaving these components from the original work.Overall, it's an unworthy contribution to the name of Wonderland.

Pretty cool for a live action remake instead of bad,"Actually i don't find the animation or the characters to be creepy, even the Mad Hatter looks funny instead of cringeworthy, it is like turning the 1951 animated version of this movie and it also got another live action remake in 2016 called Alice Through The Looking Glass which contains the song called Just Like Fire from the band named Pink who also made a song called So What which was pretty phenomenal and a good rock and roll song in my opinion. Even though the Queen Of Hearts likes to say off with their heads because she likes to execute people by cutting their heads one of the ways of medieval executions with a giant white sharp thing, also Alice looks pretty cool in her live action remake.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton...off with his head!!,"Great acting, great visuals, great cast. Unfortunately thats it! This movie was so Disney-fied & it wasn't even thought provoking. It has no hint of darkness or chilling imagery, exactly what you would expect from an Alice film & much more a Tim Burton Alice film. Burton had such great potential for a great Alice flick, but he fails miserably here with a predictable 'girl power' plot, lame fight scenes & too much mad hatter. Sorry Tim but peppering a bad story with cool characters is not gonna make a good movie. & the mad hatter & Alice are allies!! How stupid is that! The jabberwocky fight scene was super lame. He didn't even put up a fight, & he wasn't scary looking at all & he was easily defeated. This movie was bright & cheery, not dark at all. How dare Tim Burton mess with such a classic. This movie should have been called Alice returns to Wonderland or better yet, The Adventures of Alice & the Hatter. This movie is a combination of both Lewis Carrol books & doesn't even include the disturbing walrus and the carpenter story & is more of a sequel of sorts. This movie is truly disappointing, you're better off renting it.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This is NOT Alice in Wonderland,"This is NOT Alice in Wonderland. It is a completely different story piggybacking on a timeless classic that should be left alone!! It is a Disney-Hollywood bowdlerization, which is a cross between Lord of the Rings and Shrek. If I had children I would give them the book and forbid them from seeing this garbage.This is NOT Alice in Wonderland. It's 'what if Alice was grown up and returned to Wonderland and saved it from a fictional dragon'. In other words it has a predictable moronic plot, in which the subtle mystery of Alice in Wonderland is reduced to a sword and sorcery B-grade epic.By the way 'I loved the special effects' (so what) 'Oooh it's in 3D too' (so what). Let's be serious. Lewis Carroll would sue Tim Burton to Timbuktoo if he was still alive.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Beautiful, Brilliant, Fabulous film","I went into this film without high expectations. I saw so many ways it could go wrong, and many of Burton's more recent films have left me feeling somewhat indifferent. However, all my fears were for naught. I adored the film, without reservation. Indeed, this is not only one of Burton's best films, it is probably the best screen adaptation of Lewis Carroll ever (with the possible exception of Jan Svankmajer's Neco z Alenky from 1988). It isn't often that a film ends and I immediately want to see it again, but that's how Burton's Alice in Wonderland affected me. The cast is flawless, top to bottom. The film's vision comes the closest anyone has come to capturing the frenetic, nonsensical impossibility of Wonderland (and I loved the whole ""Underland"" thing). I'm hearing all sorts of bizarre negative criticisms, though none with merit. This is a bold and triumphant film, one that finally addresses, without holding back, the darkness and complexity and maturity of Carroll's writing. I will add that I saw it in 2-D, and was pleased that Burton avoided letting the 3-D thing ruin the movie, as is so often the case with that sadly popular gimmick. The film is a giddy, hallucinatory, unrelenting dance of shadow and light, hilarious and heartbreaking, brash and underscored, possessed of all the marvelously contradictory oppositions that characterize the source material. For the first time, I think, it felt as though Alice were truly an integral part of the landscape, and not just some baffled Victorian tourist passing through. And the climactic battle with the Jabberwocky..just wow. I cannorecommend this film strongly enough. (--Meydiana Rizki)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Creative, Colorful, and Spectacular!","Tim Burton & Co did a fantastic job with this movie! So he deviated from giving a straight adaptation from the animation to live film... So what!? He still incorporated all of the characters from the film, updated the story to 21st century film techniques/technology, and also added ""The Burton Effect"". Disney often gets so scrutinized the moment they decide to tweak their new content! After all, how boring would the movie had been had they strictly followed the animation? We'd all know how the movie went from start to finish. I'm excited to see Through the Looking Glass!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ironically wonder-less,"A sense of wonder is something which director Tim Burton is no stranger, in fact few creative minds in movies today have had such an impressive run the with the bizarre and darkly whimsical. Perhaps then it is irony at play, as Burton's rendition of the classic novel is one his blandest efforts yet.To Burton's credit, as he did quite well with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory he introduces an interesting back story for Alice which frames her adventures in Wonderland. In this version, Alice is a twenty year old girl who, according to the many creatures of the underworld, visited when she was a little girl (an experience of which she has no recollection). Attending an aristocratic get-together with her family and the wealthy elite, Alice is expected to accept the proposal of a young man. Moments after his proposal however, she is off chasing that devious white rabbit and the adventure begins.Burton himself confessed to finding previous adaptations of the novel to be too episodic, with no clearly defined narrative and here he wanted to correct that. Somewhere in that quest however, this version has emerged more pointless and rambling than ever before; there are neither real revelations about Alice's previous experiences nor any real sense of destiny to compel the audience. There is simply the introduction of quirky or bizarre characters/creatures, one after the other and it all grows tiresome fast.Alice is played by young Australian actress Mia Wasikowska and she is by all standards, good. But left and right she is upstaged both by larger than life characters and the visually dazzling sets. She plays Alice with the proper spirit to be certain but she becomes utterly forgettable amongst the clutter. The real standouts are Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and even more so, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. Despite her bulbous head, she gives not only the best performance overall, but also the best villainous performance. (A difficult feat when you look like a Pez dispenser) As I said, Depp is great as the Hatter, and I actually wish he had showed up sooner, because the story is even duller before his arrival. One thing I will say is his whispering lisp seems to give way to a bizarre Scottish accent when he raises its voice. But perhaps bizarre is not exactly out of place in this film.What I would call my favourite part of the film is Burton's vision of the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), who I found to be mesmerizing. Also in the stellar voice line-up is Ala Rickman as the blue caterpillar, Matt Lucas as an excellent Tweedledee and Tweedledum and Michael Sheen as the white rabbit. Alas, even with such wonderful actors preset they only, at best, manage to upstage Alice. Alice in Wonderland which is in 3-D, was not originally conceived as such but was later converted. I am shocked. Alice has more in-your-face, things- flying-at-the-screen, gotcha moments than most 3-D films in conception. I do admire what was attempted here, but vision does not always equate to quality and when all is thrown down the rabbit hole, Alice in Wonderland is simply a mess.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is She the RIGHT Alice?,"Linda Woolverton and Tim Burton have taken a short, strange poem - which I love - and made it into an extravaganza of visual beauty and excitement.I love this film. Yeah, maybe it has very little to do with the original poem --- forget about all that and let yourself be taken on a joy ride through Wonderland, or Underland as the locals call it.Mia W. is fabulous as an independent creative girl who doesn't want to marry nobility. When she falls into the hole (as we all know she does) she makes her own way. Helena Bonham Carter - wonderful as always - as the Red Queen is also so much fun!

"Disapppointing, Considering The Hype","Wow, now I understand all the negative reviews here at IMDb. I'd have to agree with most of the folks here; this film was very disappointing.Yeah, being a Tim Burton film I knew I'd see some wild visuals with crazy characters but even those were nothing that special and grew tiresome after an hour.In fact, the whole film started to drag after an hour, probably because the story was so poor. I found it uninvolved; I just didn't care about these characters, and I should have. Burton took Lewis Carroll's famous story and made it too dark and unlikable. It's not the first time he's done something like this.It might also be time for Johnny Depp to take off all the eyeliner and assorted makeup and begin to do more mature roles. Yeah, I know: craziness is part of his ""schtick,"" but the guy just turned 47 years of age. As he did in ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Public Enemies,"" he can play characters that don't always look ""Willy Wonka""-like bizarre. The same goes for Burton, who seems to have gone one-too-many of the same thing. His writing and directing in this one lacks the outrageous fun he had in so many of his earlier efforts. Being over 50 doesn't mean his brain stops, but he needs to re-focus his creativity.This film offers no heart-and-soul and is sorely lacking in the humor department. Burton's comedic films (i.e. Big Fish, Ed Wood, Bettlejuice, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"") seem to fare much better. Why make this famous children's story so dark? I'm sorry but I was equally unimpressed with ""Alice,"" played by newcomer Mia Wasikowska. After seeing her in ""Defiance"" and ""Amelia,"" I expected more out of her in this one. With a lot more feeling, she could have half-salvaged this film.All-in-all, the film is slightly less than ""fair"" and much less when you consider the hype and the expectations most of us had.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magnificent and splendorous,"I began by distrusting very much this 3D form as not adding any aesthetic value to any movie but after seeing this one I ended up by adhering fully to it.

The visual images and sceneries are splendorous, magnificent and fascinating, the special effects extremely well succeeded and really thrilling and the animated characters very well imagined and truly effective. The human roles are very well performed by all the actors and actresses involved and their make-up imaginative and convincing.

career low for Tim Burton,"My immediate reaction after watching this film was 'worst film ever'. on reflection of course there's at least 'Mama Mia', 'Maiden Noyage' and a few 'Police Academy' films that are worse, but it's so far below the standards i'd expect from a Burton film i would probably enjoyed sitting through 'Police Academy 26' or whatever less excruciating. Mind you, it's probably so much better in 3D?On the plus side, the kids say they enjoyed it - they were never going to be that discerning given the limited number of years they've had to develop an understanding of what constitutes a good movie. The under fives were both nearly asleep about two thirds of the way through. Depp was fantastic as a slightly melancholy spaced out eccentric hatter, I really sensed his heart and soul had been put into that character one hundred percent. He does love playing the wacky Brit after all. The other big names phoned, faxed or emailed their performances, clearly finding no magic in the screenplay to work with. Which is no surprise. A special commendation is due to Bonham-Carter for her fine impression of Miranda Richardson playing Queen Elizabeth the first in 'Blackadder'.In trying to make 'Alice in Wonderland' meets 'Shrek' meets 'the Ring trilogy' the filmmakers have managed to throttle all the charm and whimsy out of Lewis Carroll's world, leaving the movie devoid of the dreamlike fairytale atmosphere that has up till now been a hallmark of Tim Burton's films. I would write more, but i'm finding it depressing and annoying to remember how little i enjoyed the experience.NB 'Planet of the Apes' was also devoid of a dreamlike fairytale atmosphere, it wasn't quite as crud as 'Alice...' mind.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alice in Wonderland,"Alice in Wonderland is one of the greatest stories of all time, with arguably the best story world ever invented. It is also notoriously difficult to turn into a film. And the reasons all have to do with the script. The most recent version of Alice, written by Linda Woolverton, is the latest disappointment, and a close look at the choices she made are very instructive to those of us who love the craft of screen writing.Alice is a classic fantasy story, and in many ways it set the form. A little girl, living in a highly organized, mundane world, travels to an upside-down fantasy world of illogic and returns to the real world freer and a little more grown up as a result. The overall structure of the original story is very tight. The problem comes in the middle, because the middle is structured according to the myth form, not fantasy.Alice is on a journey in Wonderland, which means that the story is highly episodic. Each scene is a new encounter with strange new characters. While these individual scenes are invariably fun and extremely creative, they do not build. This is the great challenge of any writer using what I call ""journey plot"" (see ""The Anatomy of Story""). It has stumped writers from Cervantes (Don Quixote) to Dickens (Oliver Twist) to Twain (Huckleberry Finn). The main reason the episodic element doesn't hurt the original Alice in Wonderland is that the book is so short. But that won't work for a feature-length film.If we look at what Woolverton did in adapting the original story, we can see that almost all her choices were designed to overcome this episodic quality. The problem is that while her choices decrease the episodic quality, they also represent paint-by-number storytelling that gets increasingly boring as the story goes on.It's ten years later. The new Alice is a young woman trapped in the same stifling world and facing the prospect of a stultifying marriage to a rich fool. The trip to the fantasy world is supposed to force the heroine to confront her personal weakness. But notice in this set up, the craziness of Wonderland won't force Alice to change because she's a rebel from the beginning. The single greatest feature of the original Alice in Wonderland is that the fantasy world is based on illogic. So it attacks the very way that logical Alice and the audience think, the way we construct the world. Because this new Alice is never shown to be part of the ""normal"" worldview, fantastical Wonderland is just a series of strange landscapes.To focus the story, Woolverton suggests the ending by showing a scroll in which Alice kills the Jabberwocky in the final battle. This sets up the vortex of the story that is supposed to sequence events at increasing speed. Now Alice's journey has an endpoint, so each stop is not a stand-alone moment but a step on the path to her final destiny where she will save the kingdom.But by turning Alice into an action hero, Woolverton has made a pact with the story devil. Action stories typically have even less plot than myth stories, not just because big action set pieces stop plot but also because the audience knows that nothing big is going to happen until the final showdown. And in this film nothing does. Woolverton is still stuck with the journey plot, which makes it extremely difficult to add plot through reveals. Without surprises, the plot must die.The other major technique Woolverton adds to overcome the episodic quality of the original story is to bring some of the major characters along for the ride. So, for example, instead of leaving the Mad Hatter after the tea party, he comes along as an important ally to help Alice kill the Jabberwocky and defeat the Red Queen. Bringing characters along on the journey and having a single ongoing opponent is always a good idea when you're writing a myth story. It allows the audience to care about the characters more intensely and increases the power of the opposition. But the value of these two techniques is largely removed when the heroine's goal is so predictable and mundane as fighting a dragon in a big final battle.Many people have expressed disappointment with director Tim Burton for this visually stunning but boring film. But visuals have always been what Burton is good at, not story. I find it fascinating to compare how a visual artist like Burton (Batman and Batman Returns) and master screenwriter-storytellers like Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David Goyer (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) handled the same Batman story material. Frankly, there is no comparison, and it's one more proof that movies aren't a ""visual"" medium, they are a story medium.Ironically, screenwriter Woolverton's efforts to unify and build the story stripped the film of the great strength of the original story, which are the breathtakingly original characters and scenes. And Burton's vaunted ability to create strong visual worlds totally misfired when he failed to base his visuals on the defining principle of the Alice in Wonderland story world, which is the brilliant illogic and nonsense that only a professor of logic could create.One day a screenwriter may solve the riddle of making a great Alice in Wonderland film. That will be a great accomplishment that I would love to see.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazingly boring and unrelated to the books,"This was a failed movie by many a reason, starting with the expectations raised by a Tim Burton movie and ending with the unsympathetic characters therein. There was a scene where 3D animated dogs and pups play together. They should have taken that and made it a movie and forget about the Alice in Wonderland idea.What was also incredible to me was the enormous distance from the books to this ""adaptation"". Go on, read the Wikipedia article on Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. The genius of Lewis Carroll was not in making another book about a delusional child, but the internal logic of the worlds and the mathematical and chess foundations of the work. It was something special. They completely trashed that.Bottom line: Tim Burton usually makes terrifyingly beautiful animation and script work. This was both banal and boring. I didn't really like Mia Wasikowska in In Treatment, but she was brilliant in that show compared to the cold ""I am just going with it because I don't care"" look in this film. Even Johnny Depp messed up with his inconsistent Scottish accent. No, really, however I look at it, this film is an utter disappointment.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Burton Doesn't Lose His ""Muchness"" with His Darkly Fanciful Take on the Lewis Carroll Classic","Mad as a hatter and wildly audacious, this fantastical 2010 adventure turns Lewis Carroll's classic tale of surreal logic displacement on its ear. Who better to translate this story into a female empowerment parable than the master of quirky darkness, director Tim Burton, and his favorite muse Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter? The excesses of Burton's imagination, guided by Linda Woolverton's (""The Lion King"") sharp-tongued screenplay, result in a particularly idiosyncratic adaptation. Yet, as dazzling and sometimes scarifying as the computer-generated images are, the film is not overwhelmed by the visual elements and retains the basic themes of the original stories.Combining elements of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" with its sequel, ""Through the Looking Glass"", the movie begins when a young Alice awakens from a nightmare in which she has visited Wonderland. The obviously precocious child questions her sanity to which her father assures her that it's fine to be ""bonkers"", all the best people are. Flash forward several years later, and Alice has become a rebellious nineteen-year-old on her way to a garden party where all the guests are to witness her being engaged to a patronizing fop named Hamish. She hesitates and asks for a moment at which point she chases a rabbit from her earlier dream into a hole. Perpetually shrinking and enlarging, she finds herself in not Wonderland but Underland where she sees all the talking creatures from her dream, but this time, they all question whether she is the real Alice. They all need the Alice of their collective memory, the one who would have no trouble defeating the monstrous Jabberwocky and ending the reign of the evil Red Queen.Once Alice joins the Mad Hatter's party, it becomes clear she is not in a dream of her making, that she is being signaled to make her own way in life and within Underland, ensure that the virtuous White Queen be restored to the throne, even donning Joan of Arc-like armor for the climactic battle scene. Australian actress Mia Wasikowska (""The Evening Sun"", ""Amelia"") makes a terrifically wary Alice whose sense of wonder is tempered by her palpable search for self-confidence. As you would expect, Depp has the showiest role as the Mad Hatter, all leering smiles and electro-shock orange hair, and he makes the most of it despite an incongruous dance solo toward the end. With her head blown up three times its normal size, Helena Bonham Carter has a field day as the decapitation-crazed Red Queen as she barks orders at her lackeys and demands to be pampered with pigs being used as footrests.The rest of the cast make the impressions needed within the dimensions of the story - Stephen Fry as the dapper but cowardly Cheshire Cat; Crispin Glover as the villainous Knave of Hearts tending to the Red Queen's absurd orders; Alan Rickman as the surly, hookah-smoking Caterpillar; and English comedian Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, perhaps the most Disneyesque of the characters conceived here. Only Anne Hathaway disappoints in an arch turn as the White Queen, appearing to channel her Princess Diaries co-star, Julie Andrews, in accentuated ""Mary Poppins"" mode. All the production values are first-class from Robert Stromberg's wildly varied production design to Dariusz Wolski's rich cinematography and Danny Elfman's bombastic music score. The movie does meander at various points, primarily to establish the next story turn, but fans of Burton's and Depp's work shouldn't be too disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Enough Nonsense,"Alice In Wonderland is quite ordinary, lacking the whimsicality of Carrol's books, and the zaniness of Disney's original 1951 production. Much like last week's Prince Of Persia, in place of an enchanting story, we get a soulless retread of the original, with an overabundance of CGI and little heart. Burton's Wonderland is more akin to an amusement park ride, jaunting from one green screen to the next, setting up one conflict after another. Skipping characterization in favor of nostalgia, Disney takes the blockbuster route, assuming that vague flashbacks and lazy alterations of the original work serve as a plot. The acting is toned down all-around, with Carrol's characters losing their carefree madness in favor of innocence. Depp's Hatter disappoints the most. He comes off as weak and sullen, when he should be as his name suggests, mad. The 'futterwacken' scene is an abomination. Bonhan-Carter fares the best, but her character comes off as foolish rather than conniving. Alice is a disappointment, suffering amnesia throughout the film to avert from her lack of characterization. We never get to spend too much time with Carroll's memorable side-characters, as Alice is reduced to simply being a tool that propagates our nostalgia, not interests our curiosity. On a positive note, The Cheshire Cat and Caterpillar were very well done. Overall, in interpreting this work to a new-generation, Burton has emphasized visual splendor, but lacks the storytelling prowess and imagination of Carrol's books. I don't blame Burton, as I am sure Disney had a hand in dumbing-down this film. Taking steps to make it appealing to the widest-audience possible, throwing creativity out for safety of profits, and advancement of 3D-gimmicktry. Much unlike the 1951 film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Imaginative visual imagery, little story to go with it","Tim Burton is one of those directors who can achieve greatness or blandness, and you're never quite sure which of those his next film will encompass. SWEENEY TODD, his recent adaptation of the musical, was tremendous, quickly becoming my favourite Burton film. ALICE IN WONDERLAND, his follow-up to SWEENEY, is undoubtedly one of his worst and could readily make up a double bill with the similarly underwhelming CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.The problem with ALICE IN WONDERLAND is that it's all about endless computer graphics with no real meat or substance to the script. There's no sense of gravitas to the story, no real characterisation, just repetitive scenes of Alice wandering a fantastic world and interacting with a series of animated characters played by typically British thespians.The cast itself is astonishing: Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas, Michael Sheen, Stephen Fry, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Alan Rickman, Barbara Windsor, Timothy Spall...the list goes on and on. But 95% of those actors are wasted and deliver nothing that unknowns couldn't. Johnny Depp, who gives an energetic performance as the Mad Hatter, fares a lot better, but Bonham Carter's villain is shrill and irritating and as the lead, Mia Wasikowska is fairly bland and unappealing.I admit that I found the CGI quite average; the worldscapes look good, full of colour and imagination, but the creations themselves just look like cartoons (take Tweedledum and Tweedledee as a case in point). The CGI works a lot better when it augments an existing performance, as in the case of Helena Bonham Carter's character. Some scenes, like those involving a CGI dog, should have just been shot live-action and it does feel like laziness sets in on occasion. You get the impression that Burton was so fixated on the visuals that he forgot to make a film of any real substance to go with them.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not like the book/game (which is SUPPOSED to be a sequel),"Lets get something straight, most people are reviewing this and saying its horrible because its not like ""Alice in Wonderland"" (the classic). What Disney and the producer fail to mention is this movie is NOT based on that classic. Which is why so many are confused.When it was in production the producer (at least at the time) said he based it on two things: A. the comic ""Return to Wonderland"" B. the game ""American Mcgees Alice""Both of these are very grim and macabre things. So when you see this movie this is obviously not the direction they went it. Which is why the movie flopped. You can't make a ""sequal"" to a classic movie and try to make it kid friendly but make it like its macabre counter part and then screw around with the story. It just doesn't work. Its like the threw everything in a blender.The theme they choose to was awful. Example the tiny bodies or Depps god awful character. I love Depp, hes always great in his roles but I don't ever want to see him again in this.So this is why I gave it a 2. It ONLY gets a 2 because they didn't do a totally bad job with the graphics. Other then that the movie was horrible. I only seen it because my friend wanted to.Save your money. If you really want to know what Alice does past the classics we know go read the comic or play the older game. You won't be disappointed.

Best and most Creative movie ever made!,"It was a piece of art with marvelous graphics, fantastic acting and exhilarating action! Depp,Carter,and Burton do it again in this pleasant remake where they add much more then the sloppy original. It was beautifully put together and delightful to watch. The graphics where so surreal that it made Wonderland seem real. Praise was given to young actress Mia Wasikowska! It is a visual treat for the whole family. Award winning script is also very important part of the movie. A thing people don't appreciate is Burton's darkness but I for one I do. It shows you that not everything is a fairy tale, there is always going to be the realism of the good and the bad!

A disappointing movie,"Before I start this review, I'd like to tell you about my expectations. I'm not very fond of Disney's productions, but I was looking forward to see a classic story in a new movie. I like Johnny Depp's acting a lot, and hoped he could give the movie a nice little twist. Tim Burton is in the top 10 of my list of favorite directors, and I like his dark setting.I was disappointed...It isn't the classic story of Alice In Wonderland, but some kind of weird sequel thing, though the title implicates something else. It doesn't catch you and it's kind of random. Of course some highly educated art-freak would blabber a lot about symbols and stuff. And yes they're there, but what does that help if they are told so boring? If you want a movie with a great message and stuff this is not it. It's just the same old Disney standard.The acting is well enough, but not a masterpiece... I won't give this much attention. It's okay to watch, and of course Depp makes it all a little more... special. I must admit I giggled a couple of times. The villain is pretty good, but can be a little too much from time to time.Unfortunately I didn't see the 3D edition, so I can't tell you about those effects. But I must say that the ones I saw was incredibly nice... Well, not certain parts of the movie, but overall astonishing. I especially like The Smiling Cat. This is a plus, definitely!Overall boring and not worth watching. Even Burton failed to make his dark atmosphere. Nice effects and okay acting is the only thing causing my 3 stars. A movie for children.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Tim Burton Film for people who don't like Tim Burton,"Wow--i waited for this for soo long and it just blew my mind of what an epic fail it was...it had absolutely no Alice in Wonderland nor Tim Burton spirit...Danny Elfman's music was at worst as well...No wonder it sucked...Tim Burton didn't even right the script !!! Tim burton for some reason wanted to take a very ""tim burton""-like story and make it into a wanna-be chronicles of narnia, with cute family scenes, pixar-like cgi instead of realistic looking models, and unexpected cheesiness throughout the film with rather dumb family humor as opposed to the dark crude humor of CATCF. It was not at all another psychedelic brilliant burton film, but a walt Disney kids cgi disaster.. JD is my FAVORITE actor and yet this was the worst acting i'd ever seen by him...his character was visually stunning and very memorable, but altogether it was very poorly done...the Disney cartoon was much more epic and well thought out... None, reapeat: NONE of the characters were creepy or highly imaginable, but stupid and annoying...I'm also a huge fan of Helena Bonham Carter and her acting was terrible as well as Anne Hathaway (who literally made me want to leave the theater when she flailed her arms around)...",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually astounding story of Alice at 19 developing into a champion and liberator of oppressed multitudes,"A worthy successor to the original book about the younger Alice, with original additions (such as proper names for animals and people unnamed in Lewis Carroll's book) that actually serve to enhance the mysterious atmosphere that permeates Underland (one of the felicitous, punny new terms). The time allotted for developing the minor characters did not detract from the furtherance of the plot but rather enriched the film and gave it more depth. They have just as much charm as those in the book the film takes off from. The pumping-up of minor characters such as Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Dormouse (who also gets a name in this film), as well as the enhanced role of the Cheshire Cat, give more colors to the tapestry--although some loved characters, such as the White Knight, are missing. The added characters, such as the stuffy, beaky lordlet proposing to Alice in the London portions and the Knave of Hearts who toadies to the Red Queen, add to the landscape more-believable opponents for Alice to shake off in her quest to free the captives of an evil regime. The actors are all high-level. The comradely bond between Alice and the Mad Hatter grows slowly and organically, with exquisite timing for the various threats they face as they help one another. At one point near the end, the loving sideways look the Hatter casts at Alice is a masterpiece combination of kindness, pity, doubt, fear, and affection never seen before in one face at one time. Adding the Knave as his counterfoil works well, giving another source of conflict as a subtext. The way Alice stands up to him is superb. The acting overall seems neither too subdued nor overdone. Aspects of the film that could have been improved: Some of the special effects went by too fast to grasp; we are not given a long-enough look at the wondrously set long table of the Mad Hatter's tea party; and some of the dialog, especially including the unfamiliar proper names, speeds by too quickly for clear comprehension. I would also quibble with the inconsistency in the resizing (or not) of Alice's clothing as she shrinks and as she shoots up tall. Overall, the set designs are in harmony with the combination of reality and fantasy that it is the goal of the film to portray. The multiple-hat-making session, the antics of the Dormouse, and several other scenes are laugh-out-loud amusing. The costuming is imaginative, varied, and often stunning, crying out for a major film award (especially note the scene in which the Mad Hatter is furiously making hats). The musical score enhances the dramatic experience at every turn, especially during the persecution and chase scenes. At some times it is too loud and overwhelming. But overall, it is magnificent, and it especially propels and undergirds the story as the film nears its climax The original book centered on a fantastical experience in another world for its own sake. This film, centered on an almost-adult teenager in a repressive society, is more a story of Alice's character development. Her inner journey from reflexive fear reactions to determined, courageous fighting against evil in some ways evokes the Bildungsroman genre. This film is ideal for taking girls from seven to any age of adult to see, especially those who are facing difficulties that tend to seem overwhelming to them. The film shines at building up a credible development of Alice's character as she succeeds in overcoming one after another of ever more daunting and seemingly impossible opponents, roadblocks, and limitations. After seeing a movie like this, it is hard not to emerge both euphoric and equal to any challenge.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"bizarre (and not-so bizarre) eye candy, an ideal cast, uneven results","Tim Burton should be ideal to direct an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's stories set Through the Looking Glass. And, as it turns out, he is. But this is not a real 'Alice' story like we've seen before. It feels more like a Wonderland story by committee, the sequel, where Alice returns at the age of twenty, has some disassociation from her first time down the rabbit hole, and is told 'it is written' or whatever that she has to face the Jabberwocky, and slay it. It's not that the story is entirely bad, but the way that the screenwriter Linda Woolverton puts it, nothing is really fresh the way one might hope for. The designs go some way to change things up, mostly on the human characters, and it usually looks pretty and bright and dark and ominous and surreal. Which is just right. But the story needed work, an injection of the 'less-business-as-usual' juice.It's hard to exactly pinpoint, but I can give some guesses. For one thing, Burton's film is in large part set in a CGI landscape. One misses the days when Burton would film on breathtaking sets like in Batman or Edward Scissorhands. I'm reminded of the criticism of the Star Wars prequels, which I have made from time to time, that the computer effects drown out the potential human elements or things of interest in the story. I might be able to cut some more slack to the film if it weren't so beholden to the HUGE CGI effects (one wonders if Wonderland all took place behind blue-screen, certain actors included). It's hard to ignore, however, how rigid everything seems, from the attack from that big dog-like creature with the missing eye, to the Jabberwocky itself, barely saved by an all-too-brief voice appearance from Christopher Lee.This shouldn't be entirely to Burton's discredit, however. Here, like on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one sees Burton still has some skills brought over from his days as an animator from Disney. Something is just missing after a while, though, a general focus of the effects assisting the story, of which the story is already kind of generic (some have compared to Narnia, though I saw more Lord of the Rings). After a while it's like Burton seems to be more interested in the little things, the garnishes that he lays about in his auteur fashion, leaving the big effects and ""sets"" to his crew. One of these garnishes is Helena Bonham Carter, wife and sort-of muse for his past several films. She just keeps getting better in his work, following Sweeney Todd, and here as the Red Queen she's reason enough to at least sneak in to see her scenes, as her giant head on a small body is ferocious and subtle and beet-red screaming. It's hilarious and intense a performance you'll see this week.Others who pop on screen are more or less lucky based on their skills. Of course Johnny Depp- playing a Mad Hatter who obviously gets more screen-time because of the star status of Depp, or just how much Burton loves looking at him- can play crazy well, as he does here, but it also gets a little boring after a while, punctuated by an out-of-left-field moment (yes, an out-of-left-field moment in an Alice movie) when he breakdances at the end, which has been alluded to but not as WTF as that! Alan Rickman, Crispin Glover, and Stephen Rea round out the cast as other notables, though their screen time is all too brief, left to their own devices they can only do so much as a caterpillar, one-eyed Red-Queen lackey, and Cheshire Cat respectively. They're just overwhelmed, ultimately, by the special effects.So why the high rating with these problems, not to mention a less than stellar girl playing Alice (Mia Wasikowska is a pretty face, but can't do much with such a thin character)? Because as a Tim Burton movie, flaws and all, it's still amazing to look at and sometimes just too weird to put off as a total mess. It's definitely more in league with something like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory than with Burton's best or his worst: it's an intense curio, made as a 'family film' but with such dark corners and outrageous beats that will throw off even the most hardcore surrealist. It's a flight of fancy that owes as much to its hit-or-miss Disney studio name than its iconoclast director.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth Waiting For....,"I wasn't sure what to really expect when I heard ""Alice"" was going to be made into a full length film...but considering that Tim Burton was going to direct, I knew it would be awesome to watch. Johnny Depp was perfect as The Mad Hatter and the other characters were done well too. I did think The Red Queen could have been a little more mean and well..we didn't get to see enough of the March Hare or the Cheshire Cat as I would have liked. Even though Johnny Depp was a main character, it was clear that Alice was the focus of the film, which made it even better. I am certain the true fans of the Alice story will find faults with the film..of course...but as far as it being great entertainment..it was and then some. Watching it in 3-D..which I did not get to do as yet, will be a real sensory treat for sure. Enjoy the film for what it is..not for what everyone else might think it should be.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unexpectedly good,"I have to say that I was waiting for this movie to come out and I didn't know what to expect. After I saw it, I was pleasantly surprised. I loved it! The action was great, Johnny Depp did an awesome job (as usual) as the Mad Hatter, the Red Queen delivered a superb performance, and quite frankly it was just fun to watch. Tim Burton definitely achieved the title of creepy for this movie because it was funny yet filled with macabre at the same time. All in all, I would absolutely recommend it for someone who isn't going in with a negative attitude, and honestly I would watch it with an open mind. Remember, this movie is for fun! I do have to say, I enjoyed it more than the Disney version. I give it two thumbs up and I'm really hoping to go see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Brilliantly fun, somewhat mad, generally uplifting adventure with Burton's signature touches","This was a fun and exciting movie, and it was excellent in IMAX 3D. If you are expecting the original Disney animated feature, there are a few very well done nods to it, but overall, this is a grown-up adventure fitting a grown-up Alice. There is lots of eye candy (and I mean that in a good way) for both adults and children, but many of the scenes are too intense, disturbing, or scary for younger viewers—especially without adult supervision.Aside from several ""gloomy"" sets, and two disturbing ones (involving beheadings and decapitated heads), Tim Burton seems to have finally left behind his juvenile fascination with the grotesque, heavy Gothic influences, and dark humor. Perhaps it was a positive influence from Disney, but the movie had an overall uplifting feel to it, despite many side trips through dark places. I hope that Burton will continue to ""lighten up"" in his future works, while maintaining his wonderful sense of style, surprise, and hyper-reality.Mia Wasikowska was a brilliant casting choice. Her character development from a dazed and confused innocent (almost annoyingly so) to her final state of mind was very well performed. She is a beautiful actress, and does a fantastic job—very believable.Johnny Depp was terrific—as always. His accents and mannerisms were zany, but avoided the creepiness of his Willy Wonka performance. Bear in mind that mercury poisoning was an occupational hazard of hatters in that period, and that tended to drive many of them quite insane. Depp's Hatter shifts between reality and altered reality masterfully, and the character is quite cunning and intelligent despite his madness.I finally liked Helena Bonham Carter in a role. Often, I feel her performances go over the top (in a bad way), but here she portrayed a different form of madness from the Hatter—a madness any powerful and wealthy person could find themselves in. Surrounded by sycophants and toadies, the Red Queen came across nearly as much of a victim as she did the primary villain. I almost felt sorry for her at the end. Almost.Anne Hathaway did a wonderful job (as always) in a role that was pretty, yet mildly disturbing. It reminded me a bit of the ugly side of high fashion crossed with the beauty of a dark winter's night. The contrast between light and dark, etherealness, and beauty and blandness were very well captured in both the scenery and costuming, but especially in Hathaway's performance. Her performance was very different from the other characters I've seen her portray, especially Mia in the Princess Diaries.Crispin Glover was creepy and came off a bit as a fetishist. In other words, his performance was typical of others I've seen him give. In a way, he was a straight man to Carter's outlandishness, or the canvas that gives the painting its form. For that, he did a good job, despite being creepy.I did not even know that Alan Rickman was cast in the movie, but as soon as the Caterpillar started speaking, I recognized the actor's very distinctive voice. I think Rickman did well in the role, but I kept picturing Professor Snape from Harry Potter talking and sneering. The Caterpillar's final speaking scene in the movie was the best. Rickman stretched his voice in different ways, and I finally heard the Caterpillar as himself.The Cheshire Cat, voiced by Stephen Fry, was probably my favorite non- human character, but all of the animals and creatures were quite well done. The White Rabbit, voiced by Michael Sheen, was terrific as well.This was my first time seeing a movie in IMAX 3-D. Frankly, 3-D movies in the past never have impressed me much, and usually gave me headaches. However, I think this movie actually was improved by the 3-D environment. Instead of being strung-together in-my-face effects for the sake of effects, this movie used the environment (including the huge IMAX screen) to fully engulf and involve me in the movie. Things all around the screen moved in very realistic ways. The story really came to life. No headache, either.In summary, if you are looking for an entertaining movie that the tweens, teens, and adults will enjoy, this is probably it. If you are looking for blood and gore, this really isn't it. If you are enamored with Tim Burton's old, darker stuff, then you might be disappointed, but if you like his newer works, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you will probably like this one even more. If you enjoyed the classic animated film as a kid, you will probably appreciate this movie now as an adult.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yet another grotesque mockery of an excellent book,"I had wasted a horde of money seeing Tim Burton's Alice. What a huge disappointment! Worst thing to befall an artist, nay a human being, is when he begins to worship himself. Half reading books he doesn't understand, he tells himself that he does and stuffs his creation with liberal untruths, unmorals and unvirtuous preachings because the original author's genius escapes him completely.I am not even talking about the fact that the transvestite looking Hathaway was completely eclipsed by the true beauty of Bonham Carter even despite the grotesque head. Of course that wasn't what the movie was trying to condition into its audience. 3-Dimensional experience of entirely 2-Dimensional characters was a key factor to making this film utter boredom and even Helena's efforts (the only person who tried) could not salvage this shipwreck. (Depp was cast in a role which entirely constricted his ability to do anything with the character and is probably devastated by his own performance.)",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What's not to like?,"So a mixed-age adult group of around 20 of us went and caught the 3-D version last night. Most loved it, some liked it, one thought it was OK. There were laughs in the theater, and some ""awwwwwwws"". My take: Tim Burton came through for me again. Although I like his bittersweet work, I was pretty worried when he started tinkering with ""Alice"" and ""Looking Glass"" - the travesty! Now I see the advantage (although some critics bemoan the loss of randomness and whimsy) of having a cohesive narrative, we all cared about the story and cared about the characters and how things would end up. To me it seems as those this ""Alice"" is a well-fitting sequel to the originals.Great casting with all, Mia as Alice did a fine credible job as the now older Alice. And Depp - due to some negative remarks I was suspicious of what I was going to see, but once again we felt he was superb - his faintly dark, sometimes sad, sometimes scary Hatter was one you didn't take your eyes off on screen, and he pull off another mad, complex, shifting portrayal with intelligence and aplomb. Much has been said about HBC's Red Queen and all the positive remarks are fully justified. As one friend of mine said, with Burton you have to watch carefully as he slyly slips in all these delightful little details within the sets and the actors - as always he is simultaneously tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and sweet.I would rate this a ten except for what I felt were a few weak details at the end, but nothing that would ruin the movie and certainly all us were happy to have seen it. A few dark Burton details suggest this is NOT for young children, and it wouldn't be appreciated, so rent the young ones the Disney cartoon version. Hoping to see it again and I will be buying it. As far as 3-D, well that was fun too, but I hope having seen it once I can take in more of the set pieces and a few missed lines. When I asked an older gentleman with us if he liked the film, he said ""What's not too like?"" Definitely worth the ticket price, I see some nay-sayers pick this to death and they are entitled, but what we felt was a little ""Burton"" sadness about life and growing up, and a lot of joy. For sure on the way out there was no complaining from the crowd, just a lot of chatter about the performances and sets.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Same OLD Jonnie Deep,"You have got to be kidding me right? First, the powers that be let him remake Willy Wonka and they don't even come close to making a watchable movie. Then, they allow him to turn the ever exciting John Dillinger into a snore fest and now this. Comeon Jon, you are getting very close to no longer being my favorite actor. I did like the young lady who played Alice though and felt that she has a nice fresh look that doesn't exactly fit in with the so called ""glamour"" of Hollywoodland. The acting by all the big names was forced and un fun to watch. Ann Hathaway just gets worse and worse to look at. I am serious, take a real look at her strangely shaped head and face in every movie she is in and you will admit that she is frightening to look at. That doesn't include the princess role (number one only). And Crispin Glover could have been just a little more weird as he is well known for off key roles. He pretty much played a it straight, much as any other ordinary actor would have. I do not recommend this film and was terribly glad that I paid for The Crazies and snuck into Willy Wonka, I mean Alice in not really Wonderingland.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not one of Burton's better films,"Most people will be aware of the Alice in Wonderland story, but this latest film by Tim Burton takes place with a grown up Alice. Alice is facing some tough decisions in the real world when she falls down the rabbit hole into the mysterious world below.The film is unmistakeably a Tim Burton film, but it isn't really up to the quality of his best films in my opinion. The biggest draw back is that you don't really feel any empathy with the characters. I have been trying to work out the reason for this and have a feeling it may have something to do with it being a 3d film. There are various sequences which showcase the 3d technology with creatures jumping out of the screen. The problem with this is that these shots are virtually always irrelevant to the plot. The film doesn't have a good flow and I get the feeling that if it was edited to remove the '3d effects' and extend the dialogue in the key scenes it would be far more satisfying.I wouldn't go as far as to say this was a bad film, but I feel it should have been better. You could probably watch any five minute sequence of the film and you'd be craving to see the rest of it. The only trouble is that after watching the rest of it you'd probably wish you'd stuck to watching 5 minutes.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But leading up to watching the film, I prepared myself for a different story. I went with a friend who wasn't informed about this, and didn't like it as much.

Perfect Burton not for Children.,"Let me start off by saying has anyone ever read both Alice books written by Lewis Carol? If you have not, then the comparison that some make to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and calling the ""Queen of Hearts"" the ""Red Queen"" has not read those books.Like in any adaptation, the source material is just the blue print to build the house on; and there is going to be a change in it when it gets to the site to be built. Well the same goes for the Alice in Wonderland.This Movie is not for children it is for older children. If your child had a problem seeing ""Coroline"", then this movie is not for the little ones. This movie is pure Burton at his finest! With all of the whimsical, Gothic humor and noir.There are many reviewers that dispatch this movie to the trash, but they either have not read neither of the books nor have understood that to be silly and to be part of a world that does not make sense Is what makes this movie what it is. Like in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when Mike T.V. says that what he seeing does not make sense Charlie says (paraphrasing) it is not supposed to make sense after all that is what candy is.Don't try to over think through every frame, but take it as a good story being told by a master story teller through glasses of Gothic noir. Oh yes, if you see it in 3D be careful with the little ones, there are some sequences that, as true to form for Burton, there are at times creatures that come up ""at your face"". Other than that little bit of warning, grab on to your our popcorn and get ready for a wondrous ride through Wonderland (Underland, see the movie and you will know) Yes, Jonny Depp he is the Mad Hatter after all he is supposed to be mad and zany even with orange hair.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The story is basically Alice revisiting, step by step, what she had already done, only the end differs and not for the better.

I personally thought Wasikowska (I didn't know her at all before this movie) could have done a more convincing job, in the title role. Helena Bonham character, even though was meant to be menacing, gets lost in the crowd! Excellent special effects, brilliant acting and kudos to Tim Burton for such direction.

"When logic and proportion, Have fallen sloppy dead,","Tim Burton. From 2000 onwards his directing career hasn't been the same as it was in the 90's. They've not all been terrible but it's definitely not the same hit rate. ""Alice In Wonderland"" probably isn't the nadir but it's really not good.Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) has long since prescribed her last visit to wonderland as merely a childhood dream. Years later, on the day she is due to get engaged, she again see's a White Rabbit (Michael Sheen) and again follows him to the crazy other world. This time though, she has been deliberately brought to the realm by some of the characters, believing that she is the prophetical ""Alice"" who will slay the Jabberwocky and restore the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) to the throne.Flicking through the reviews from the time the movie came out, I'm surprised to see the visuals so highly rated, as that was one (of the many) aspects of the film I didn't think worked. It comes from right in that period of cinema history when 3D viewings were deemed worthwhile - for me, I thought with only a few exceptions, that led to screenings that were blurry and with a grey sheen to them and I quickly opted for 2D whenever possible. Somehow, despite this being a 2D presentation, I felt that Vaseline effect was still there and it looked washed out, from a colour point of view.I thought Mia Wasikowska was pretty solid as Alice, and that some of the voice acting was pretty good. But the film is full of moments I didn't like. Oooouugghhh the celebration dance. In a film that's fully of cringy forced ""whimsy"" that is a particularly egregious moment. I really didn't like any of the Bipolar aspects of Johnny Depp's mad hatter, nor the stagey hand movements of Hathaway's White Queen.It's just an unenjoyable experience all round.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It was funny to see how they imagined Wonderland to evolve in time, yet keeping the same fictional characters. The visual effects give depth to the 'wonderland' feeling, and are remarkably well done.This movie is a classical story of a girl adventuring in a fantasy world and discovering the courage inside her, which will help her deal with the issues in her real life.

Terrible remake,"Alice in Wonderland somehow became a huge hit which spawned Disney's live action remake trend. I avoided Alice till now since I heard its bad, I seen some YouTube reviews. Alice is terrible, I honestly feel its worst than Lion King.The acting is fine, the actress who plays Alice gives the best performance. Johnny Depp was okay, he seemed cartoonish. Helena Bonham Carter was annoying, she was really over the top.The plot is weak and incoherent. Alice forgetting Wonderland was forced. Alice destined to slay the Jockerwocky was forced since she's an outsider and she isn't a warrior. Tim Burton's goal was simply to be dark and weird.Alice is too violent for the PG rating, it should of been PG-13. It got away with the PG rating since most of the characters are animated since Burton is a huge director.The visuals were praised back in 2010 but they didn't age well. The visuals are mostly terrible, I say 80% terrible. This movie looks like video game cutscenes.Overall, Alice in Wonderland is terrible. If you like Alice, that's fine.

"A ""trippy"" trip","After reading a few negative reviews from critics, and glowing reviews from ""non-critics"" and critics, I found this movie to be very enjoyable for most ages, though kids under 7 might find it too scary.Most of the actors that did voice work, such as Alan Rickman as the hookah-smoking caterpillar, Tim Spall as the Bloodhound, and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, did superb work. While the other actors did good work, these characters stood out for me. My only disappointment, and it was small, was with Matt Lucas as the Tweedles. My kids laughed at their antics, but I wasn't as amused.Of the ""real"" people in Underland, I found the Red Queen, the White Queen and the Mad Hatter as the best (getting to Alice in a bit). The Knave of Hearts, played by Crispin Clover, just didn't seem to really ""get"" the whole idea behind the fantasy. He's not terrible, but something just seems to be missing in his performance. (Not an opinion shared by my fellow movie-watchers, though.) That brought my rating down a point. The Hatter recites a part of my favorite poem from ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"" and he does it so well, I wish he'd been able to recite the entire poem. I'm not going to tell you which one. Johnny Depp is easily the best ""thing"" in this film. He gets the crazieness, the strangeness of it all, though Helena, Anne and Mia (Alice) are just as good.Alice finds that she needs to be assertive and for some, this is a feminist message. I don't know why that doesn't sit well with certain people, but it does. I thought it was a good message, not letting other people decide your destiny, especially when it feels completely wrong. This movie is worth seeing in IMAX 3D or even in 3D (seen it twice, and in both formats), though the Cheshire cat really comes ""alive"" in IMAX 3D. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the best Alice and wonderland!!!!!,I thought this was the perfect and best Alice and Wonderland film I have ever seen in my life since Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I loved the Mad Hatter i thought Johnny Depp was the best Mad Hatter I have seen in my life since the 1999. I am defiantly going to get this movie on DVD... I loved the cat that had the smiley face all the time. I loved Alice and the white rabbit. My favorite character was the white queen. The evil Character was the queen of hearts..I loved how she had a pig for her feet to sit on.. I loved how alice drank something and it made her big and small I loved the voices you heard when alice was about to enter wonderland I loved the people in wonderland I thought it was a fun movie and for people to see it and like it,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the best movie I've seen in a while,This has to be one of the best movies i have seen in awhile and that is saying a lot considering how picky i am and the fact that i usually think fantasy flicks are stupid but there something about Alice i think it is that their is a little of her in all of us and i think we can all relate to her in a surreal sort of way excellent acting and special effects thank you for entertaining me i have been so bored for such a very long time and for all those who give this movie a bad review off with there heads!This movie is great adventure for both young and old never a dull moment and the characters are endearing i felt myself actually caring about them,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Avoid the Noid,"Possibly one of the ugliest movies I have ever seen in my life. This here is the ditch that is Tim Burton's career now. Nothing is good here. The characters are all badly miscast, the visuals actually hurt to look at at times, and there are parts of the movie where you will be embarrassed by what you see on the screen. Anyone thinking of watching this would better spend their time watching low grade z level schlock instead, at least for the laughs.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Who needs expectations when you've got Tim Burton?,"I will admit, this film was far away from my expectations. I will also admit, this is not necessarily a negative thing.Alice in Wonderland 2010 is yet another combination of three fantastic people; Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter - three beautiful, creative, clever, imaginative and fantastic people who have created many things most people would not even come across thinking. However, the thoughts that immediately cross my mind when I think of Alice in Wonderland - a little girl, a beautiful world, craziness, colours, lots of colours. In this Alice in Wonderland? Not so much.Tim Burton adapted Alice and he adapted the wonderland. He adapted them to his crazy chaotic mind, to create something new, something wild, something.. well, fantastic really. A certain simple grimness went with the movie, which you will understand when you watch it. But it is something to embrace rather than shy away from. I have heard from too many people that the film was 'not up to expectations'. But why do you need expectations when you've got Tim Burton as a director? As for Johnny Depp - as always, he came up trumps as the Mad Hatter. Some could say that his role showed a little too much likeness to Willy Wonka in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory 2005. However, I beg to differ. Willy Wonka and Mad Hatter share many characteristics. They are both wild, wacky, and...well...wonderful people. Therefore, I believe Tim Burton and Johnny Depp knew what they were doing with the hint of Willy Wonka, not forgetting the hint of Johnny himself.. and it is perfect. Johnny is perfect, as usual. The film also includes actors you may know of such as Helena Bonham-Carter, Anne Hathaway, Barbara Windsor and Stephen Fry, plus many more. The casting, in my opinion, is perfectly done. Although I will admit the storyline could have been more complex and less predictable, the wonderful acting and 3D graphics help to steer you away from this point.If you are looking for a life changing, thought provoking storyline, this film is not where you will find one. If you are looking for a magical, fun family adventure and a beautiful experience, it is.Oh, and stay for the credits. I think they're beautiful. You'll see what I mean.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you can look past the hype this movie received and actually watch it, its not bad at all.","I admit, when I saw a couple years ago that in 2010 Tim Burton was directing Alice in Wonderland, I was excited. Too excited I suppose. I just kept thinking, why can't this movie come out sooner, 2010 is a long ways away. When it finally did come out I never got a chance to go and see it. Since it came out a few days ago on DVD I have since bought it and watched it many time. If you can look past all the hype the movie received and the high expectations, the movie is not bad at all. It has a good story line that ties in well together and considering the characters did a lot of ""green screen"" the acting is very good. And to all those saying that Tim Burton always uses the same actors, well maybe that is because they play good and believable roles in almost every movie they play in. All I'm saying is, give this movie a chance without thinking about how hyped up everyone got over it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton gets away pretty well with it.,"This is a film I had been highly expecting, because I knew Burton would have the visual talent necessary to make this film believable. But, as the release date drew nearer, it seemed the storyline did not suit the visual kudos.After seeing it, I can tell you that, even though several scenes are a bit incongruous in a Tim Burton movie, he did his best to deal with the script, which was basically a retelling of the story with a heroic fantasy premise, and make it an engrossing experience.I ended up actually caring for the characters, Helena Bonham Carter being my favourite cast member here, and this Wonderland comes true anyway, at least as far as visuals go. Even though the story felt like a bizarre interpretation of Lewis Caroll's original masterpiece, it did blend into the scenes and all the material taken from the books, making it feel less irrelevant, and adding a fresh touch to Burton's own magnificent visual creation.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Burton's Alice in Wonderland – The darkest wonderland ever!,"A man who always wears a darker glass will have a tendency to see the world in front of him in a slightly darker shade. But the realization of the absorbed frames have never been a conundrum for the man who set a trend of mixing goth, gore and dark humor, sometimes in an interestingly creepy manner. And we call him Tim Burton.His unmatched ability of giving adorability and cuteness to the living and non living darker elements is what sets him apart from the other directors. From Jack Skellington to Edward Scissorhands to the bloody big head-Red Queen, he has created his own aura of characters and leaving his fans craving for more.Making alterations to a masterpiece needs some real gut and Tim again have shown his abundant vision and took the story to another level with some really sweet characters that only he can visualize. Who can forget the Red Queen and her playing card resembling army? Tim is also lucky to have such a wife in Helena who easily portrays any complex character and becomes ready to appear in the same skeleton that Tim had derived.When it comes to the execution of the ideas, Tim Burton become crazier than you can ever think of. No one will forget the scene where The White Queen prepares the medicine with urine and some ugly looking fingers, for Alice.Once again he has created a modern cinematic myth with his favorite cast and crew. He replaced the actual mood of the wonderland with his no sunshine environment and some signature props like the windmill and the famous limbs. He might probably be the only man in the earth whom god have given so much ""dark"" powers and yet doing good things.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Did Tim Burton actually direct this?,"The main thing I felt after seeing this film was... Tim Burton needs to take a vacation.A long one.This so-called movie had virtually none of Burton's quirkiness and unique view of the world. The guy is making too many movies, and he's clearly on auto pilot. Alice in Wonderland was the most vacuous cinematic experience I've had in a long time. And this is coming from a long-time Tim Burton fan.Sure, the film was beautifully designed, but it's filled with so many visual effects and many of them distracting, that it was almost impossible to be engaged with anything that took place. It was obvious that the actors rarely shared the stage simultaneously, as almost everyone was digitally mutated in some way. In fact, the whole film was various effects layered on top of one another in EVERY shot, and some of them poorly realised.The script had no evidence of craft anywhere to be seen. The ""story"" just plodded along from one event to another, without any sense of drama or emotion whatsoever. Mia Wasikowska as Alice was so apathetically dull and looked quite anaemic (Was that intentional, and if so, why?) that she too made it difficult to care about what was going on.What an incredibly synthetic and robotic production, regardless of its extra ""dimension"".Maybe they should've considered adding more than one dimension to the script.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Darkest, Most Dramatic  Alice in Wonderland Ever!","I'd think twice before you get your child excited about a new ""Alice in Wonderland"" movie with the same White Rabbit, the same mad tea party, the same grinning Cheshire Cat and the same bad-tempered Queen of Hearts they've grown to love. Although these same characters are in this 2010 version, there is a major twist and, to young children, it is not a very friendly one! Instead of the 9/10-year-old little girl we all know, Alice is almost as old as me (however, like me, she's in her second childhood). Surely, youngsters won't want to see Alice severely injured by one of the more fierce ""Wonderland"" characters and this is just one of a series of scenes that would be considered more suitable for more mature people. I saw this movie in 3D this afternoon with my family and we all enjoyed it. Tim Burton has obviously tried his best to retain the world-famous catchphrases and musical poems from the classic book by Lewis Carroll but possibly couldn't resist putting so much of his quirky self into it. Everything is so dramatic in this film; I'm 20 and I found one or two bits scary. I would certify this film a 12A, at least, rather than the given PG classification.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pimping Alice,"Dark side director Tim Burton with screen alter ego Johnny Depp in tow would seem a safe logical and predictable choice to direct the surreal Alice in Wonderland in 3D and for his fans I'm sure he doesn't disappoint. But even though tweaked for today's audience with an age of consent anorexic Alice faced with a pre rabbit hole crisis there is a clear lack of creativity that makes this Alice a tedious waste of time.Burton with all the technical bells and whistles at his disposal employs his usual characteristic quirks while Depp dresses up in his latest Halloween costume making for a joyless and disturbing Alice bereft of charm and lightness of intent. As a shabby underworld Wonka Depp's Mad Hatter is a waste of time as is Anne Hathaway's White Queen. They are two big names who contribute nothing besides luring one to the theatre. The technical advances bring improvement to the rabbits the caterpillar and Ts Dumb and Dee but the Cheshire Cat is a disappointment literally lacking the 51 Disney's hallucinogenic color. Only Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen seems to capture the spirit of the original character.Since the turn of the last century there have been at least two dozen renderings on film of the classic children's story Alice in Wonderland. Like all children's stories it has amazing resilience in that its large core audience re-generates on a yearly basis by having it imposed on them by parents who underwent the same process. By the time this audience gets around to Cervantes and Dosteyevsky the numbers drop precipitously. Karamozov is a gamble but Alice is a safe box office bet. Time dictates updated makeovers however and like Betty Crocker and Aunt Jemima Alice has gone through a variety of changes not specifically intended for children. There have been adult, modern day, animated, musical and even x-rated versions. This take is little more than a tarted up and edgy Alice that is too dark for children and too childish for adults. This may add up to big box office drawing off both demographics but as a film it's an uneven travesty.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"NOT a movie for ""straights.""","If you consider yourself ""normal,"" have an extraordinarily complex mind for numbers, or find all things irrational a bore, this is NOT the movie for you. In fact, you should probably go find a nice copy of War and Peace and leave the cinematic venue to others more suited to it.

Regardless of the 3-D aspects; with or without iMax; irrespective of class, age, or breeding, this work is astoundingly complex in its simplicity.I know that seems like an enigma, but the Cheshire understands.

The greatest tea party that you'll ever attend.,"With Tim Burton written all over this imagining of the world of 'Alice in Wonderland' you know what you're in for, and the director doesn't fail to deliver the familiar atmosphere and traits that his fans or even casual movie goers have come to recognise. With a range of quirky characters and curious concepts to incorporate into his cinematic vision, Burton has created a surreal experience that is both brave and bold. In this departure from the original story, Alice (great casting in Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland, where she is recruited to end the Red Queen's reign of terror. With help from old friends such as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp in a quality turn), Alice gradually begins to rise to the challenge.Although the title of the film may prove misleading to those expecting a fresh adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic, audiences are likely to benefit from a less familiar and therefore less predictable story. With your anticipation heightened by uncertainty, 'Alice in Wonderland' should prove an immersing experience, from the stunning visual craft to the intriguing encounters with famous Wonderland inhabitants. I found myself comparing it to a video game, as Burton appeared to draw out sequences in which Alice would attempt to find a logical solution to a problem, encouraging viewers to think as the protagonist; while the film is an assault on the senses, it also stimulates them.If any fault is to be found in the film, in my opinion the blame would lay on the story. The mysterious nature of the primary character and the bizarre nature of those who support her don't provide a sufficient connection with the audience, making it harder than it should be to support them, a weakness emphasised by show-stealing sidekicks and a well-played villain courtesy of Helena Bonham Carter. Alice's meetings with influential characters such as the caterpillar and the cat, along with her attendance at the Mad Hatter's tea party, can initially break the film into segments and leave the feature feeling disjointed before the central plot arc comes into play. The quality of each of these scenes, however - featuring great characterisation and playing on the mythology of Wonderland as it is slowly unveiled to us - make up for any lack of a smooth transition between them.Overall, slightly older youngsters should get the most out of the comedy involved with the characters and their situations without being unsettled by the more frightening scenes and imagery, whereas those who aren't amused can explore the symbolism, themes and literary features revisited in Alice's latest adventure. If you're in to weird, get in to Wonderland.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice cartoon but has nothing to do with Caroll's Alice in Wonderland,"Special effects are nice, and it would be much more fun to watch this movie if it would come out before Avatar. The script is boring (well, it's Disney), supposedly made to suit both adults and children. Don't expect any Lewis Carrol's surrealism here: this movie is basically good/evil battle as in ""Chronicles of Narnia"", using Carrol's personages (it's not reaching the story level of Lord of the Rings). Nice cartoon, but for anyone searching for Alice in Wonderland ecranization which has to deal with the actual book(and style of the book), i highly recommend 1988 movie ""Neco z Alenky"" by Czech director Jan Svankmajer. I vote 1 because in my opinion this cartoon shouldn't use any elements of the book, and therefore shouldn't exist.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great film for Tim Burton / Johnny Depp fans,"The first time I saw the trailer for this movie it was very foreboding to me... It was filled to the brim with CGI, and on the foreground was Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter who looks like a dragqueen (I'm sorry, but he really does). My expectations for this movie got very low from that moment on.Now that I finally got to see it, I have to admit that its not all that bad. The story is consistent, Wonderland looks well-designed and they even added the Jabberwocky-poem in there which is awesome. However, I do feel that they overdid the CGI at some points. I know its a fantasy- film, but I think some nice imaginative puppetry would do the film so much more good.Some characters seemed a little undeveloped to me, and the focus lies way too much on Johnny Depp's role in my opinion. I like Johnny Depp and I think he's a great actor, but I don't think he added anything really crucial to the film or anything and his acting almost seemed like a quick rehash of his Jack Sparrow role from The Pirates of the Caribean. The Cheshire cat was not mysterious at all, since it is very clear that he's a good guy from the beginning. The Cheshire cat's character would work so much better if he only gave Alice subtle clues and riddles. My final beef has got to be the design of the Jabberwock. The illustration by John Tenniel makes the Jabberwock look like a very creepy creature, so why did they turn him into a generic dragon?Kids will not mind the complaints though, and I think they will have a blast with this movie as well as Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans. In the end, thats what I think this movie is more marketed towards, and not Wonderland-fans.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good adaptation of the original classic!!!,"I generally never give a movie a 10 of 10, unless it completely overtakes me in some way and leaves me talking about it for days. However, it does receive a high ""9 of 10"" due to the inspiration it has given me. If it can bring just a hint of tears to my eyes, it's a good movie and touched me to some level.The last time I read ""Alice in Wonderland"" was back when I was a child and many years ago. This movie has a similarity to the original plot, but Tim Burton has extended it out further for a deeper insight to ""Alice in Wonderland"". There are moments in the movie where it led me to a whole new storyline, but made sense to the whole Alice theme.I personally love the new version. I just find it rather amusing that Tim Burton have to take on the challenge of adapting his version of the story to Disney, since it is a Disney storyline we're talking about. The characters do look a little intimidating though, typical Tim Burton film.Still, he did a rather splendid job at that. Like with any Disney movies, there's a lesson or morale to be learned: Believe in yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A movie lost in Wonderland,"I sat through the movie and dozed off a couple of times. When it finished, I found I was not the only one and the kids behind me gave a moderate OK to the movie. I usually enjoy watching kids movies. Compared with other kids movies, this one failed pathetically.The story of Alice in Wonderland is well known. A little innocent girl lost in wonderland and experiences all sorts of wonderful magic. That was what made the story so popular to families and children.What we have here is however, a grown-up Alice who has out-grown her naivete, in the middle of a personal crisis and fallen through a rabbit hole into Wonderland. She is not curious about anything anymore and just wants to get out of there. Nothing thrown at her surprises her. She just deals with it because she has to. There also lacks a story line to stitch the events together. She just bumps into things and people one after another. The dialog was also poorly constructed and boring. The wonderful computerized animations did little to excite the audience (not quite possible anymore after Avatar).The whole production feels like the retiring Wonderland staff making a last ditch of effort before it closes down. If the title was not ""Alice in Wonderland"", I wonder if anyone would bother to see it.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brilliant reimagining of the children's novel we all love.,"We all know the story of Alice In Wonderland. A girl falls down a rabbit whole and meets a ton of strange creatures. Heard it. Seen it. But Tim Burton's version doesn't bother with the whole process of introducing these characters again. We've already met them in the thousands of other versions that exist in this world. Don't be fooled, this is not a sequel. This is a whole other story ""inspired"" by Lewis Carol's beloved novel. Mia Wasicowska plays Alice, a 19 year old misfit who is trying to find her place in society. On the day of her engagement to a lord, she is suddenly caught falling down a rabbit whole into a strange new world that she's only seen in her dreams with strange creatures who are telling her that she must slay a horrible beast, the Jabborwocky. Brilliant and wonderfully imagined, Tim Burton has delivered his greatest film yet. I guess the actors could have played the parts a little better but they were the best performances I've ever seen in an Alice in Wonderland film. B+",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An anti-climax and essentially a disappointment,"In the 1970's the door on New Hollywood was emphatically shut with blockbusters Jaws and Star Wars taking millions. Studios took it upon themselves to reign in the indulgent artistry of a director like Burton to focus on selling a product. This is what this film represents. It is the death of a once visionary director who suffers at the hand of marketability.To focus on the film it is grounded by an 'against-all-odds' story seen in most generic child/teen films of today. The problem is anyone who has read the stories will know that this isn't the setup. This wouldn't have been a problem had the new story been original and anywhere near good. Burton did say he struggled to make it a story but who ever said a story meant good vs. evil, the frame of the story just didn't suit the characters he initially presents and then in an act of disloyalty to Carroll are made as forgettable and generic as the film itself. The entire thing is centered, not so unpredictably, around Burton's proxy, Depp, who serves to fill every desire Burton see's fit in the most crass and at times atrociously cringe-worthy manner. (there is a moment when you feel a Jar Jar Binks cameo might save it, it's that bad) It's really too obvious that he should have such a significant role for Depps character who is mentioned no more than any other in the original stories and in trying to create such a role has greatly hampered the film.Knowing what you know about Alice in Wonderland and Tim Burton makes this film intensely disappointing in every conceivable way. His vision was lost, having said this you have to question if it was ever there with the narrative being as poor as it is. It is true, escapism for the audience is possible at times, largely due to the novelty of 3D but it isn't enough and the precedent set by the '51 film makes Burtons seem a little easy and feeble. The screenplay is cheesy fueling the fire in your head that this film is for one purpose only, money. Burton said he wanted something that was more than a series of events but went too far in creating a story I think no one really wanted or expected from Alice in Wonderland. It is true of course the success of the film at the box office is undeniable but in the modern era of film I feel we are crying out for some director with an alternative vision, with the resolution and much needed luck to evade studio criteria so that they may take us to somewhere we haven't been before. The novelty of 3D gave Burton the advantage but he still fell short of delivering a film that was memorable and encapsulating for its audience. It all felt set up to win over younger audiences and that seems to be what mattered.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One step short of brilliant,"Based on two books written for children in the late 19th century this film is one adaptation out of many. The story line works well enough, if you're into fairy tales and the sometimes odd angles they take. Personally I love a good fairy tale, especially if it's a bit dark and twisted, so this works well for me.This adaptation is then done in part computerized graphics, part acting, part cross-over. Added to that is a layer of 3D effects that make for a solid immersion in a world that is strange for most - but terrifyingly believable as well. For me the way the scenery was designed matched perfectly of what I remembered from the books - which I read as a child, years ago.The computer graphics are wildly colored and often heavily exaggerated but it fits the story and therefore works out really well. Music doesn't really jump out, but fits. Acting is fitting, with only a very small number of very small kinks. The choice of rolling events works very well, with only one or two falling out of place/style.All in all, I had high expectations when I walked into the theater - I generally love Tim Burton's work, especially when it combines with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter because the three of them always make for a well matched team, and I also love the original Alice in Wonderland story and its sequel. And although that usually means the expectation gets shattered while actually watching the film it wasn't in this case - this film offered all I wanted and more.So, apart from one or two out-of-place/style scenes, there's only one word describing this film and that word is brilliant.9 out of 10 rabbits in a deep hole",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mr. Burton... what happened?,"When I first read Burton is doing his own version of Alice in Wonderland, I thought that this is a match made in heaven. Insanity of Tim Burton coupled with inherent insanity of Alice's story meant that things just couldn't go wrong..especially since it was a given that Depp and Bonham-Carter must be in it, too.Well, something did go wrong. And it's a little bit hard to simply point out what.I might just as well start with the story. I never thought I would say something like this about a Burton movie but it was too.. well, normal. I always thought that one of the biggest virtues of ""Alice in Wonderland"" was how it subtly yet efficiently tapped into one's primal fear of not being able to trust his/her own senses and of losing one's mind. Once Alice drops down into the rabbit hole she gets dislodged from reality, things stop making sense, there's nothing to hold on to, no referential point to start from, no friends by her side to have for comfort and aid. Nearly everything that happens to the (original) Alice feels random and disjointed, every situation is weird and almost every character is inconsistent - sometimes they are friendly, sometimes hostile, sometimes indifferent, but almost always utterly insane. Alice's story is wonderful, yet profoundly disturbing.Burton's Alice in comparison is rather tame. For some reason he opted for a different, grown-up Alice, who essentially revisits Wonderland not to come to terms with growing up, but rather rebel against an arranged marriage and norms being forced upon her. And this is where most of the problems lie. What we have here is a weird mesh-up of the old, familiar Alice story and the oh-so-cliché prophetical-hero-saves-the-land-from-evil plot we have seen so many times already. The sense of discovery is gone, but what's worse that sense of disorientation and overall insanity is almost completely subdued. Characters Alice meets are pretty well known by everyone, but this time around they are almost without exception friendly and helpful, some even getting very obviously romantically interested in Alice. She herself is mostly neither scared nor surprised, almost throughout the entire movie she blatantly accepts everything around her simply by repeating that it's all a dream. I don't know if it's a matter of bad casting, bad directing, or was done completely on purpose to further reinforce the fact that this Alice is now much more mature and down-to-earth, but if Alice essentially does not care about strange things around her, why should we?There's very little Burton has to offer in his version of Alice. Nothing new or Burtonesque or even very interesting happens; it's like reading the very same, familiar story but with some other artist doing the illustrations.Things are somewhat saved by excellent performances of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter. Depp's version of Mad Hatter is joy to behold to people who like to pay attention to tiny details; his accent shifts constantly, and so does his personality, and some of these shifts are often rather subtle. But even though watching someone who knows how to act doing what he does best is pretty enjoyable, this Mad Hatter still isn't, well, Mad Hatter. The character of Mad Hatter should above all be... mad. Insane. Unpredictable. This one is at best mildly eccentric, but also noble and rather lovable. In fact, this could be said for almost every character in Burton's Alice - they are not insane, they just act a bit strangely, and not by much. And they all have a good heart. I know this is a Disney movie and everything, but come on - even in the cartoon the characters were very true to those from the original book, why are they now so consistently friendly and loyal to Alice? Where's the fun in that?Bonham-Carter's Red Queen is spot-on, on the other hand. It's hard not to have flashes of Miranda Richardson's Queen Elizabeth from Black Adder (the character which was, after all, based on the Red Queen, and let's not forget Miranda later actually played the Red Queen in Hallmark's version of Alice, and she played it rather close to her earlier role), but still, Helen's Red Queen is a rather welcome comic relief. Her interpretation of ""Off with his/her head!"" never gets old, and what should be an irritating and whiny character somehow ends up being a fresh sight in an otherwise rather pedestrian movie.White Queen - played by Anne Hathaway - is a bit hammy and over-the-top, which I guess was the point, but it failed to work on many levels. She does get some funny moments though.I must mention the all 3D thing, too. It simply does not work. In Avatar it was great, but it wasn't merely because of better technology; it was also the fact that Avatar is a bright, colorful movie, and since 3D essentially darkens the screen somewhat, the experience is not diminished. Burton's Alice is often dark and gloomy (we are talking about Burton, after all), and when you put on your 3D glasses the movie simply becomes too dark, like you are watching it with sunglasses on. It really puts a dent on your viewing pleasure.So - ""Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland 3D"". In my opinion, at best this is a mildly enjoyable movie which will be somewhat appreciated by fans of Depp/Burton/Carter, at worst it's a boringish, pedestrian and rather underwhelming experience. Bottom line, it just isn't Alice. Tim Burton somehow missed the point, and let's hope that what he has in store for us will surpass this entry by far.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pure magic!,"I have to say that I'm not familiar with neither Disney animated version, any other film adaptations or the books themselves. I knew the basics of the story, I enjoyed some Tim Burton movies very much and I liked the special effects in the stills I saw, so I decided to go ahead and give it a try.Alice In Wonderland is a film you WANT to see in Imax, as in my opinion which I'm not afraid to proudly stand - the 3D is more impressive than in Avatar. Not the special effects, don't get me wrong, the 3D itself, some sequences are really impressive.I mentioned special effects - here, I'm pretty sure there are no competitors for an Oscar for 2010! Simply perfect!The plot is crazy but that's how it's supposed to be, the characters the same with Johnny Depp in another flawless performance leading the group as a Mad Hatter. Lots of great creatures, talking animals etc. that you'll love.The world Burton created competes with Pandora pretty equally, it's the matter of opinion, but the magic is seen everywhere. The costumes and makeup are sure Oscar nominations.But enough about MAKING, let's say something about the MOVIE.Well, alright. The movie is a little bit more than 1.5h of pure magic. I caught myself watching this spectacle with open mouth, smiling all the time. What we see is again the work of great imagination, and perfect film-making.Awesome adventure!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Has the great Tim Burton visuals, but basically everything else fails","Before I went to see this version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" on the silver screen last night, I knew it was Tim Burton's latest film, and also knew that it featured more than one talented cast member who had appeared in previous films of his, including Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, who have both appeared in several of them. I had still never read the book by Lewis Carroll, and had only seen the most famous adaptation, the 1951 animated feature from Disney. Since I have very rarely found any of Burton's movies unsatisfying, his own version of this story sounded promising, but I then saw that it wasn't getting the best reception. It's a good thing I knew that before going to the theatre, or else I probably would have been in for an unpleasant surprise.Alice Kingsleigh has been having strange dreams/nightmares since she was a little girl. At the age of nineteen, she attends a garden party where Hamish Ascot, the son of one of her late father's former business partners, proposes to her. Unsure of whether she should marry him or not, she soon notices a White Rabbit in a waistcoat going by and decides to leave everybody else at the party and chase after it! This leads her to a hole, which she falls down! At the bottom of this hole, she finds herself surrounded by doors, all of which are locked except one which is too small for her to go through. After a struggle, taking potions that make her shrink and grow, she finally makes it out of this room and into a mystical land called Underland, which appears to be the location of her recurring dreams! She meets a series of bizarre characters on her adventure in this land, including the White Rabbit, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the Cheshire Cat, the Blue Caterpillar, the Mad Hatter, etc. Alice is in Underland to slay a giant creature known as the Jabberwocky and bring down the evil Red Queen!Around the beginning of the film, before the part where Alice falls down the rabbit hole, I was already bored. Alice seemed like an uninteresting character, as did all the others, and the story seemed so lifeless and boring. This could have all changed after Alice falls down the rabbit hole, but sadly, it doesn't. There are excellent visuals and sets for Underland, the kind of dark visuals one can expect from a Tim Burton movie. Some of the characters are CGI figures, and this animation is also amazing. Unfortunately, these are pretty much the only things I liked about the film. I didn't care much for any of the characters, including Johnny Depp's portrayal of the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of the Red Queen, even though I admire these two performers. It seems that both characters are supposed to be comical, but aren't very funny at all, and the same goes for most of the characters in Underland. They're generally just unfunny and bland. I occasionally smiled at some of the gags, I can't deny that, but for the most part, the humour fails as well. As an adventure film, it's not very exciting at all, and I found myself hardly caring what would happen.In the typical Tim Burton fashion, this adaptation of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" has amazing visuals and bizarre aspects, but unlike most of the other films I've seen from him, this one is not very entertaining. While his visual style consistently impresses me, it certainly isn't usually the ONLY thing I like about his movies, as I'm usually pleased with most other aspects of them as well. However, that wasn't the case with this film, and the stunning visuals are not enough to carry it. Not only that, the talented cast is oddly lacklustre here. I remember seeing both ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Corpse Bride"" on the big screen in 2005 and not being disappointed by either of them, but this year, when I went to see Burton's latest theatrical release, I was not very happy when I left the theatre. Now, I've certainly seen much worse than this, and many people who have gone to see this fantasy flick in the past month or so clearly weren't let down, but this is my review, and I have to join the naysayers, as much as I wish I didn't.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a cornucopia of visual delights,"Given his flair for the whimsical, the surrealistic, and the preposterous, Tim Burton would seem the ideal choice to direct a modern movie version of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" And turns out he is. (Terry Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro, whose ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was already a variant of sorts on the story, are two others who might have done as well).Lewis Carroll's darkly humorous Victorian Era classic chronicles the adventures of a spunky, imaginative young girl who tumbles down a rabbit hole into a fantastic world of talking animals, size-altering potions, and memorably eccentric characters, a land ruled over by the evil, bulbous-headed Red Queen, played with petulant haughtiness by Helena Bonham Carter. The screenplay for the film – now called simply ""Alice in Wonderland"" - by Linda Woolverton draws from both ""Wonderland"" and its first sequel ""Through the Looking Glass"" (as most previous film versions have done), and captures both the darkness and the humor of the material.All of Carroll's beloved creations are here, some played by actors in costumes and makeup, some generated entirely through CGI, and some – like The Red Queen – produced through a canny combination of the two. There's the mad Mad Hatter (played by a typically loopy Johnny Depp), the growling Bandersnatch, the slyly smiling Cheshire Cat, the virtuous White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the roly-poly twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the dragon-like Jabberwocky, which it has been prophesied Alice will slay, thereby liberating the people of the kingdom from their tyrannical queen.Burton breathes new life into this oft-told and oft-filmed tale thanks to a team of visual and special effects wizards who come as close to capturing the world of Carroll's imagination as any group of filmmakers could ever be expected to, given the enormity of the challenge.As the heroine who must learn to accept the impossible before she can know who she truly is, Mia Wasikowska manages to keep Alice life-sized and appealing even in the midst of all the larger-than-life pyrotechnics going on around her.A masterpiece of art direction, costume design and special effects, this ""Alice in Wonderland"" is the next best thing to the books themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Misunderstood,"I am not sure the expectations of most people going into a Tim Burton film. It seems there is a certain expectation and when they don't see what they thought they were going to see, they are disappointed or confused. I think that this film is a prime example of that. Burton has become such an iconic director that his celebrity, not what his talent, precedes him and sets an expectation.Of all of Burton's latest films, I feel Alice is the most in line with his earlier work. It is a warped commercial vehicle that does exactly opposite of what you expect, which is the fun of going to see his films.This Alice is a grownup version, as played wonderfully by Mia Wasikowska. She is caught between the young girl who is expected to do as she is told, yet like the younger Alice, walks her own path. Wasikowska's fresh face is welcomed; a more well known actress probably would not have worked as well.Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter is warped, just as one would expect. Everything from an off center eye to breaking into a Scottish accent when remembering the past or in battle, Depp gives the Mad Hatter a sense of uneasiness. This is best exhibited in the scenes between he and Wasikowska. There is an uneasy attraction between Alice and the Hatter, one that has been lost from the books in the other adaptations. Here, Burton goes for showcasing that attraction and it pays off.Bonham Carter devours the Red Queen, relishing every single minute and she is a joy to watch. Crispen Glover is perfectly cast as Stayne, her main man in many ways and himself eating up the scenery. In a surprise, Anne Hathaway's White Queen is purposely too calm and serene, almost to a chilling affect. Hathaway's gestures and manner of delivery give an uneasiness, that is fun to watch.The rest of the cast is voice talent; Matt Lucas as Tweeledee & dumb, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit and Alan Rickman as the Blue caterpillar. All are perfectly voice cast and give weight to the creatures they play.The special effects are wonderful to watch, I only wish I had seen it in 3-D. The effects are wonderfully warped, as usual with a Burton production. If anything, his warped artistic flair is perfect for this kind of story.As with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Sleepy Hollow, Burton is far more faithful to the source than previous incarnations and coupled with his visual style, Alice is a fun film to watch over and over.Alan Rickman ... Blue Caterpillar (voice)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"For shame, planet earth.","Burton certainly isn't immune to making a dud, but this could very well be his worst (though Apes gives it a run). A kind of cinematic disaster in which everything about it is wrong - tone, effects, plot, storytelling, humor, target audience, characters. But as bad as all of that is, none of it holds a burned-out candle to the disaster of the visuals. Without exaggeration, it's one of the straight-ugliest things to ever enter my eye-holes. And yet it's one of the most profitable films ever.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shockingly Entetaining,"My family and I went to see this film despite my skepticism, I believed it was going to be another boring movie that entertained just our children; especially since the original didn't quite grab my wife or my attention. We found ourselves wildly entertained by this movie's engaging dialogue and unique creatures with strange but believable cinematography. It really captured our imagination and was shockingly entertaining. I found myself wanting more. Not to mention our children really enjoyed the special effects and interesting story line. It's a rare movie that both child and adult can really get into. I think Depp's performance was brilliant because he was truly mad but not in a weird uncomfortable way. I believe this part was probably his best acting performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bitter disappointment... or just far worse than expected,"It's just natural that great directors manage to acquire a good reputation and a sound name in the industry of cinema. However, sometimes that means a genuine quality and faithfulness to his/her own ideas and creativity (as it is the case of non-trendy directors such as David Lynch, Wim Wenders, Godard and many others), but sometimes it is just used as a commercial power to hype their movies. Still, maybe a movie can be that hyped and fully associated with special 3D CGI effects and still be good... but I soon feared that it would not be the case of this Alice in Wonderland.This was not a film for Tim Burton to make anyway - as much as hight is the quality of most of his works, he never truly managed to create a original narrative structure in his works, forever linked to the emo archetypes in some sort of sweet dark fashion.Alice in Wonderland is, however, a surrealist piece rather than a fantasy, therefore lacking the easy handlers of sword adventures - even though the monster and the sword indeed appear in Through the Looking Glass (the book), as a very short-story written in a medieval way that Alice finds and reads. It's a small detail in the whole book though and I'm certain that it was never intended to dominate the whole opus, or change the surreal tone of the story.Unable to pursue the essence of surrealism (well, he might not even tried to) Tim Burton followed the easiest rout and transformed Alice into a Joanne D'Arc involved in a fight of good versus evil. Just plain as that, so frustrating as that - yet, a formula guaranteed to please huge audiences.In visual terms it is equally disturbing - the 3D caused me headaches, while I noticed that some major problems were happening in the movie, like the whole perspective being often distorted, colours suddenly changing and the background losing all resolution all of a sudden.If taken just as fast entertaining this movie can still be viewed, but cannot be compared to other Tim Burton's movies. It's just sad to see that happening.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tim Burton Shines Again!,"Tim Burton keeps on making great movie after great movie. He never stops at doing that. Every Burton movie I've ever seen are very darn good close to perfection. His trademark of great visuals are evident in this movie. The land of Alice is just breathtaking. I really loved the final battle scene during the end where the battle takes place on a checkerboard.Alice is about to marry some dude she doesn't care for. She escapes from that moment and falls down a hole. She ends up in a mystical land where everyone believes that she's the one to slay the Jabberwocky, an evil dragon-like character. But, she believe she's the wrong Alice.The acting is great. This is the first Disney movie I have seen with a female as the main character. She certainly shined. My only complaint had to be with Johnny Depp and the Mad Hatter. I had to watch this movie twice to finally understand the role of the Mad Hatter. Of course, Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic as the Red Queen.Overall, this is a great fantasy movie. I recommend this to all people especially fans of the original Alice works and Johnny Depp. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
nothing new,"The story of Alice in Wonderland is a surreal trip that has been done a million times. Tim Burton's same-old same-old over-the-top extravaganza loses itself in self indulgence and meanders away from the point of the tale. There's no need to re-create this classical story in some bizzaro world image of Burton's own. The lush visuals and signature performances by a glittering cast are a rich banquet of sweets--I was initially escalated by the sugar high but came crashing down after the buzz wore off, leaving me hungry for something nutritious. But nowadays, spectacle seems to take precedent over substance in films. I would like to see Burton ply his unique perspective and directorial skills on something truly meaty.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sorry a 6?? Extremely Underrated film, Visually stunning, phenomenal performances!!! Burtons BEST!!!!!","Another example of people judging art that haven't a clue how to. Only a complete braindead person would give this work of art a 1!! I saw 1s , SERIOUSLY it's not only hard to believe it's an utter travesty to rate this anything but a 7 and higher. The 3d is phenomenal I like every Tim burton film hes made in 3d!! This is so amazing, only flaw is Anne Hathaway but she sucks in EVERYTHING but the rest of the cast and the directing rockets this to the top. Seen this film at least a dozen times and I see new things everytime. My mad hats off to the WHOLE cast and crew for this beautiful work of art!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horrible movie,"Really not a good movie at all. Very, very, very disappointed in Johnny Depp for accepting this role. He is a brilliant actor and although he did what he could for this role, this movie is quite horrible. It's the ONLY movie I have ever walked out of in my entire life. Mia Wasikowska (Alice) and Depp did the best they could and did quite a good job in an acting sense. And you have to give Johnny Depp credit for acting the best he could in such a horrible role, but the movie itself was quite disappointing and very bad. The only bright spot would be the good job that Tim Burton did with the graphics and colors. But the movie overall was boring, pointless and just very bad. Don't waste your time.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
At last I understand the story,"Although I always thought the story of a little girl entering an imaginary world where the strangest things can happen, there didn't seem a single movie being able to make this story enjoyable. And having read it as a kid in several versions, I always loved it. Most of the movie adaptations I saw were rather boring or made it too complex to be entertaining. And although I do not always like Burton's surrealistic style, I surely enjoyed this movie and not only the visual aspect (which is superb). And although this story is different from the original story and its sequel (Alice through the looking glass) there are many references to these stories including almost all of the original characters. Especially Johnny Depp is really great as the Mad Hatter. And although the story is not by any means new, elaborate or refreshing it is fantasy just the way I like it to be with colorful characters. Not a masterpiece but a movie I would give a view every once in a while. I really loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
