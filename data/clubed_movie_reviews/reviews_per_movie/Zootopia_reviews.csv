One of the best of the recent Disney CGI cartoons,"As much as I liked movies like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, it made me curious about other CGI animated movies. I didn't actually see this movie in theaters, but I did rent it and was pleasantly surprised. Not everything is in black and white in this movie, and various stereotypes are broken. And things are not always what they seem. I loved the main characters and they all get my standing ovation. This, along with Wreck-It Ralph and Big Hero 6 are my favorites of the non-Pixar Disney CGI films. If you like anthro animals and want to see them in a somewhat modern setting with no humans, look no further!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Didn't expect the story to be that great !,"I surprisingly shocked by how great the story is, and the plot twist was pretty good too.. i didn't expect that comin'...

An entertaining and adventurous experience for the young ones and an empowering and relevant message for the more mature ones.,"""A little bit of kindness goes a long way"" would be a perfect quote for this film.When Judy Hopps, a country rabbit, shoots for her dreams as a part of the police force in Zootopia(Zootropolis), things weren't what she expected it to be. She was forced to face reality for what it truly was. Sound familiar?It may have delivered a couple of messages that people have already heard dozens of times, but that doesn't take away the strength it gives to those who believe that what matters the most is trying to do things right in their lives and in society. I wasn't expecting to find this to be a source of encouragement and inspiration, but that's what it delivered. The ""true"" conflict presented was also as relevant as it was when this film was released. A divide that caused unrest among the ones that should be working towards improving society.One small crutch from the plot was its use of circumstance to move the story along. But overall, this can be overlooked since after all, it isn't only with wits or pure strength alone that would allow a person to find solutions to the problems that they face in their lives.Using cartoons as a medium to convey the kind of messages it did was also a brilliant move on the part of the producer and creators of this film. It would be a good and effective learning material for parents or older people to use to teach young people as a way to prepare and make them understand how the world works.Brilliant movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Zootopia : The Inspiring Movie,"Zootopia is a 3D animation movie produced by Walt Disney. Zootopia is a big city over there. Like its name, this city contains all animal characters such a zoo as well. We can find so many animal characters here and of course they bring their own characteristics. They are rabbits, foxes, goats, sheeps, wolfs, lion, sheep, rhinoceros, and any others. And the main character is a bunny or we know it as a rabbit called Judy Hopps. Ya, just a little rabbit who has wanted to be a policewoman since she was child while there was no rabbit be police. There is no matter if the citizen are just rabbits, but the problem is the citizen are not only rabbits but all of animals are over there. There are many big and strong animals such rhinoceros or lions who are more appropriate to be police than just a bunny. She had been underestimated by every one for dreaming to be police, even by her parents. But it was not a problem for her, even she must pass many difficulties, she just kept trying and trying and finally she got appreciation to be the best police since she could finish a mission of a case and found something new on it.1. Animation
The animation moving is very smooth such as another 3D animation movie. The characters are drawn well, suit to their characteristic. We can know directly how is a character's feature even just see them, not watch them. It run a same way when some characters turn characteristic, from good to bad or vice versa, we can know it directly by their expression. It eases children to know how feature of the characters are, so they won't be confused by watching this movie especially when some characters change their appanage. This movie has a beautiful color, contras but still in harmony and it makes gazer, from children to adult, be able to enjoy this movie well.
2. Score
For me, every single sound in this movie is nice, very nice. From the dubbing, sound effect, and of course the sound track. The sound track, Try Everything by Shakira, is very representative that movie and it suits when it played while Judy Hopps was enjoying her journey from her hometown to Zootopia. So, we, as gazer, can enjoy both of picture and the song.
3. Plot twist
This is the most unexpected part of this movie when Mrs. Bellwether changed into a bad character. In the beginning, she was very good and helpful to Judy, but it turned out that she was a mastermind of all of ""disaster"" in the movie. This part gives us some breaks when we have a bit been bored think who is the mastermind of the problem.
4. Moral Value
Same as its soundtrack, this movie reminds us not to give up on everything, just keep trying and trying, trying everything and making something new. Life is all about problems, problems always come and leave. One problem has been solved and another problem will come to us, of course, that's a life. And for facing our problem, just ignore people say for braking our dream, just keep trying and prove that we can do for reaching our dream. And don't be afraid to fall on our journey, believe in ourselves that we can, we can, and we can.
This movie was very impressive to me when I watched in 2016, I was in senior high school. I had a dream that it was very difficult for me at that time. It made me doubt that I could reach my dream. By watching this movie, I cried and created an advice for my own, ""Believe in yourself that you can reach what you want as long as you want to try more, more and more, nothing impossible in this world."" Moreover, the plot twist reminds us for not to ease believing someone and not to judge a book by its cover.For me, this movie has almost no lack. This film is very recommended for watching by everyone, from children to adult, even elderly, because of its own picture and its value. For children who haven't been able to understand the value, they can enjoy the beautiful picture, the cute characters and moments, and of course the song. And for another, they can remind themselves by value of this movi",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the Most Excellent Animation Movies,"This is a wonderful animation film that definitely surprised me! Expecting it to be another average Disney film, I was delighted to find it was not quite so. First of all, the animation is extremely well done which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The amount of details is astonishing and watching it twice was not a punishment for me. The plot is also surprisingly well thought-of, being funny yet dramatic and it keeps you on your seat while also making you laugh multiple times. Although a city full of anthropomorphic animals that dress and act like humans has been extremely popular since animation existed, I believe this Disney movie takes it to a new level. It really does feel like everything took years to develop as the environment is complex and believable and the animal characters resemble their real-life counterparts remarkably well. It's amazing how they could produce a movie with simple jokes suitable for kids yet still silently addressing real-life issues at the same time. At last, I definitely recommend this movie for the whole family as I deem it enjoyable for all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
You certainly don't need to be a kid to love this movie,"A staple of children's movies is to give animals human characteristics, whether it is our feathered friends in the ""Rio"" series or our furry friends in the ""Alvin And The Chipmunks"" franchise. What is different about ""Zootropolis"" - called ""Zootopia"" in the USA - is that this is not one breed of talking animals existing in a human world, but every breed of animal inhabiting a world in which there are no humans. The colourful representation of this world, the engaging variety of characters, and the clever script with a message of tolerance and inclusion make for a wonderful movie from Walt Disney Productions.The basic story is a kind of ""Lethal Weapon"" pairing of two unlikely partners in crime- fighting: a female rabbit called Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and a shady fox called Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). In pursuit of a missing person (sorry, animal), they encounter all sorts of adventures and a cast of characters ranging from sloths who will not be hurried to a Mr Big who turns out to be a tiny version of ""The Godfather"" concluding with a singing gazelle (Shakira). I took my five year old granddaughter to see the movie and she loved it, finishing up dancing in the aisles.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

My review of the refreshing animated film Zootopia,"In my opinion Zootopia is one of the best children animations since Rango as it attempts to tell a competent and interesting story instead of just projecting ideas and messages with only leaving stereotypical characters and thin story arcs left.Zootopia focuses on its two main leads, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde and fleshes out their characters and why they are the way they are.Their relationship is well-realised except for one aspect that is a ""spoiler"" but it happens in so many movie's that you'll know it's coming. The twists aren't nearly as predictable then in other Disney films which is refreshing and the story overall is very investing and is able to have a message about racism without it feeling shoe-horned in. In terms of animation it is nice in it's simplicity like Judy's apartment and the way the action sequences are filmed are full of energy and are all throughout the film. Some wide- shots of the city are unexceptional but the rain forest and polar setting within the film looked excellent and water in CG animation is simply now perfected. The humour lands about 80% of the time with only some jokes being meh. The movie is clever in reflecting real-life and how the way something is in real-life can be covered in a sheen through publicity and an emphasis on that through advertisement. The film's messages are clever and well- thought out and while obviously there aren't in your face about it.The film is not flawless though. There are about 5 lulls in the story that affect the pacing, dialogue sequences between the two main leads should have been a lot snappier (which ironically enough most of them took place straight after the Sloth sequence). Towards the latter half of the film plot conveniences show up and aspects are pretty dumbed down. And lastly, the song that was shoe-horned which is extremely mediocre but awful compared to most other Disney songs made for an awkward feeling in it's badness.Overall Zootopia is a great animated children's film and a pretty good movie on it's own. It's flaws deter it quite a bit but with every scene either having humour, fantastically directed and animated action, great character development and sometimes even scares Zootopia's quite large amount of flaws are outweighed by it's consistency to entertain and just be an investing film. There are some modern animated films from the 2010s that technically are on the same level as this film but the attempt to do something different and it's succession is why I like it a little bit more but it's too heavy on slow moments and it is quite flawed so this is why I'm giving Zootopia my ""GOOD"" rating-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
What a Great Surprise,"I hadn't planned on seeing this film (I feel we are over-saturated with animated films these day, most of them mediocre), but I looked on as my kids watched it. This is a really fine film. It takes on issues of prejudice and cultural diversity. Zootopia is a city where animals live side by side, predator and prey. It is not a utopia because law and order is necessary. A little female rabbit messes with the male dominated police force. She is put on duty as a meter maid and realizes sexism along with her species is under attack. She is feisty and eventually hooks up with a con-man fox (the least trusted species) whom she enlists to help her solve a kidnapping case. Actually, it's otter napping. In the process, she reveals her own prejudices and hurts her partner. The movie has stunning animation and intelligent dialogue and lots of social references. Very good stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"The Best Film Of The Year, So Far.","From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen & Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely & delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice & stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far.Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the story of Zootopia takes place in the titular metropolis and follows a bunny cop named Judy Hopps who, despite her par excellent performance in the class, is assigned parking duty by her superior. But when she volunteers to undertake a missing-predator case, she is given 48 hours to solve the mystery or resign, following which she blackmails a sly fox into helping her, and uncovers a sinister conspiracy.Co-directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore, the duo put up an intriguing world on the screen that does have a fresh quality but there is still a deep sense of familiarity to it. However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline & moments of pure hilarity. The writing staff also deserves a mention, for their screenplay brims with numerous pop culture references, parodies many renowned classics & handles its topical themes with care.The 3D animation is absolutely top-notch, for the images retain its crispness, clarity & vibrancy from beginning to end. The animators put up a vast number of characters on the screen, ranging from the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, yet they are all given a well-defined arc. Cinematography further enhances the overall look n feel of the story with its fluid camera-work, splendid use of colour palette & spot-on lighting. Editing provides just enough screen time to all the relevant characters while moving the plot forward at a blistering pace.The cast is wisely chosen, and all the actors do a competent job in lending their voice & soul to the mammals they play. Ginnifer Goodwin brings a bubbly side to the new cop in town and confidently plays her role. Jason Bateman plays his part with finesse plus his voice really fits his cynical con artist character. Also, the chemistry between the two is a highlight in itself. Michael Giacchino's ebullient score seamlessly blends in & compliments the narrative while Shakira beautifully wraps everything up with a catchy, uplifting & wonderful song that smartly summarises its themes & message.On an overall scale, Zootopia finds Disney stepping out of its comfort zone to tackle a bold, ambitious & risky project, and it is one gamble that pays off tremendously well in the studio's favour. Also, its arrival couldn't have been better, considering how its elements of prejudice & stereotypes mirror the racial hostilities present in our very own current social environment. An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour & thought-provoking themes that amazes, entertains & enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far. Strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The jewel of Disney's 'second renaissance',"As someone who has been an enormous Disney fan all my life (the only films that don't do much for me are 'Chicken Little', 'Home on the Range' and 'The Black Cauldron', if it counts also 'Planes'), Zootropolis may not be as good as the best of classic Disney or the 'big four' of the Renaissance era.However, it is for me the jewel of Disney's 'second renaissance' (their return to form era starting with 'The Princess and the Frog', and if it counts -might not as it is Disney Toon Studios- their only misfire from that era is 'Planes'). Despite a couple of issues 'The Princess and the Frog' was still enormously entertaining. 'Tangled was Disney's best since 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (not sure how much of a popular opinion that is though), until the even better 'Wreck it Ralph' took that title. 'Winnie the Pooh' was immensely charming and sweet with its one problem being that it was too short. 'Frozen' despite what people say to me was the best animated film of 2013 besides 'Ernest et Celestine' (and the amount of hate it gets and the detractors' attitude towards those who loved, or even liked, the film has been blown way out of proportion). And 'Big Hero 6' was fun and touching with one of Disney's most endearing characters in recent years in Baymax.Onto the review properly for 'Zootropolis' now. The animation is fantastic with rich colours, vivid, beautifully designed and colourful backgrounds and lovingly designed characters whose movements flow fluidly and never robotically. Some of it is even very inventive and imaginative in the set pieces. Michael Giacchino's score is cleverly orchestrated, energetic and catchy, not as good as his scores for the ones for the Pixar films 'Up' and 'Inside Out' but it complements 'Zootropolis' very well indeed.'Zootropolis' has some very smart and hilarious writing, cleverly balancing sly references, witty humour and also genuine pathos and heart with few if any awkward tonal shifts. The visual gags are similarly inventive and a joy to watch. The story is so consistently well paced and involving and is told with such energy, charm and heart that some may forget the storyline being predictable. To me, it had enough originality to not make it matter that much. What was also impressive about 'Zootropolis' was how it dealt with such heavy and wholly relevant themes and issues, one of most daring along with 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and deal with it with a light touch. Some did find the message (one that's easy to identify with) forced and heavy-handed, it wasn't an issue to me at all, to this viewer it was incorporated well and respectfully.The characters in 'Zootropolis' are interesting - all serving a point to the story- with colourful personalities, none of them felt bland, none felt shoe-horned in, none felt annoying and none felt unnecessary. Love the sassiness and charm of the protagonist, and while the twist wasn't a surprise as such the villain did serve a good threat and more interesting than the recent Disney twist villains. The voice acting is just terrific from all, especially from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. Can't go wrong with Idris Elba, JK Simmons and Maurice LaMarche either.All in all, with the one small exception of the forgettable and slightly grating main song from Shakira (which was not enough to bring the film down personally) 'Zootropolis' was a superb film, not only of Disney's post-2009 films but also one of their best post-Tarzan and towards the top end in the Disney animated film ranking. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Perfectly Fine But Uninspired,"A cute animated film with a great and relevant message about the harm inherent in profiling others based on pre-conceived and ill-informed beliefs.

My kids (5 and 7) liked it, but it didn't wow them, and they seemed to forget it pretty quickly after leaving the movie theater, as did I.The funniest part of the film is the segment set in a DMV run by sloths, but since this scene in its entirety was shown in trailers for the movie a year ago, its effect was dampened by having already seen it.

Best Of  The Best.,"A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer.She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this yummy bunny Judy.Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The characters are both layered and striking. The visuals are gorgeous and yet rooted. It is wildly entertaining and has a contagious way of handling things.

Another bland Animated movie: 5\10  lowered to 2\10,"Well, as always, critics and people will love this movie, cause it's Disney!(which I deeply love). In reality it's because there haven't been great animated movies in a decade and people are not even noticing how much the standard level is more and more lowering(except Tangled and Toy Story 3, the others were good ideas, with cheap, bland and boring results).GRAPHICS: Once again, we have an animated movie that try to reach even more graphical perfection: the world is wonderfully detailed but its pretty clear that every character of every movie created in CG will look the same. The way they move, the eyes, the facial expressions, are so graphically realistic and at the same time done with exaggerated animated acting, that it's always like watching bad mimes who are playing a part. Rating: 9\10 for the world, 3\10 for the characters(and that's almost the maximum for CGI).CHARACTERS: The fact that Disney can't create great characters anymore is depressing. The characters are boring once again; they are just created to give the most banal and predictable comedy one can watch on a TV sit-com. That's exactly the kind of humor in animation and comedy movies by now. Or even more easy: ""Look! an hamster who moves like an hamster! funny!"". The fact that an animal has its animal characteristics is the minimum I expect from Disney animation, and even more in the aesthetic normality of the world Zootopia, not treated as a joke. Or even worse, all the pop-culture references, cause they are funny! Ratings: 4\10STORY: The story is kind of good, with a dark tone, and somewhat interesting, but again, the characters are so bland in their predictable personality that I didn't managed to care very much. The point is that, in great artists hand, this could have been a nice movie. Ratings: 6\10And then we got the today moral lesson. That's not a fault for this movie to be honest, because it seems every animated movie must have a moral. And I still don't understand why . Animated movies are an aesthetic art, just like another movie, and not an educational lesson. It's because adults are so dumb nowadays(I'm sorry, but we all know that) that think if something is not educational is not for children. I have an information for you: children are smarter than adults, and they need to be treated as such.Disney, please, don't waste too much time coming up with lessons and a movie created around it, give us some GREAT CHARACTERS AND STORIES like you used to do, and the great lessons of life would come along.FINAL RATINGS: My vote is 5 on a total scale(of all time), and a 7 in the last ten years scale; but the whole feeling of the movie (the characters, the humor, the dynamics) is always the same of every recent animated movie, so I lower it to 2(since I know everybody will give it 10\10).",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Zootopia (2016) Unexpectedly Amazing.,"When 2016 came around, everyone was excited for Disney's Moana. It was supposed to be the next Frozen, critically acclaimed, winning a ton of awards, and being beloved by everyone. Nobody really cared for the other film coming out first, Zootopia, and many thought it was a joke. Surprisingly, while Moana only received a lukewarm reception, Zootopia became a worldwide sensation, coming very close to Frozen. Zootopia is a wonderful film that tells the story of a young rabbit named Judy Hopps as she tries to solve a serious chase that could mean the end of her career as a cop. With a fast talking fox named Nick Wilde, Judy uncovers a dark secret that could change her world as she knows it. The setup seems silly at first, but the film delivers with strong characters and a meaningful plot that puts forth a discussion about prejudice, and what we can do to change this attitude.

"Both Fun and Funny, but also Very Predictable","Zootopia is about a city in which all animals live together in organized society, and follows a rabbit who, after becoming a police officer, begins to chase after a criminal who is believed to have kidnapped multiple other animals.The plot isn't really all that unique. In actuality, it's just another crime movie, only with animals instead of humans. Now that's not to say that the animal factor is never used. There are plenty of times when the characters act like animals which helps influence parts of the movie, but it tends to be primarily used for humor. Otherwise the movie is presented in such a way where you aren't really thinking about how predictable it is, but it is still extremely predictable. There are a handful of parts in the movie, especially one part towards the end involving a conflict between two characters, that feel really forced, and don't fit in with the rest of the movie, even if the whole thing already is predictable. At least it was predictable and reasonable, but at the end there was just no reason for it.The characters are interesting enough. They have their distinct character traits, and they still feel relatable and real enough, despite being animals. They seem like they have more to them than just their specific traits, but otherwise not a whole lot to mention here.The movie is surprisingly very funny. Now I knew that this movie would be funny, of course, most comedies are, but I was surprised at how often I found myself laughing at this movie.The movie touches on a handful of bigger topics, as I'm sure you've heard, but it just touches on them. It doesn't always go too far into them, and I think that if they handled these topics a little differently that maybe I would have enjoyed it more.Overall Zootopia is good. It's very funny, lots of fun, but unfortunately struggles with being predictable and a little forced at times.

Each of the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the standouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable character and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist unlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your typical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids films. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively unlike others which beats you over the head with theirs.Zootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I like, I just wish more of them were like this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Was pretty good, but thought it needed more humor...","This Disney movie interested me when I first saw the previews way back when, but never got around to seeing it. Then I got my wife Disney+ as a Christmas gift and saw that it was on their streaming service so we gave it a watch. It was cute and mildly amusing; however, I found that it could have been a bit more funny as the crime began to overshadow the humor a bit in this one. What I mean is, figuring out what was causing the animals to go mad was the more interesting portion of the film rather than the fact we have a bunny cop and wise cracking fox trying to figure it out.The story has a bunny whose dream it is, to be a cop in Zootopia. She ends up becoming the first bunny police officer and she is basically given the job of meter maid, much to the delight of her parents who are scared to death for their little girl. She soon though gets wrapped up in a case involving a missing otter and must enlist the help of a con artist fox to find out where the missing otter is.The movie is more funny during the first part than the last third. The voice acting is good as was the animation. The areas of Zootopia really popped as you had snowy zones and a rain forest. The best part of the film, though, to me was the sloth run DMV which so accurately depicts how it is inside the real department of motor vehicles! I also like the mob boss who was really into icing people!So, in the end, this Disney film was pretty good. It is nice to have a Disney animation that does not have songs and such within like the police chief alluded to. The film seems to have been a very huge success so I am sure the inevitable sequel will be coming, but unlike some films, this one warrants one as you can have many misadventures for two officers on the job!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Beautful Animation that Manages to Develop a Great Story and Universe,","Zootropolis is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a stellar voice cast. It's a very fun movie that the entire family can enjoy, with humour for all age groups to chuckle at, and a story that is straight forward, but manages to be very compelling. The plot manages to be inspiring as we watch someone fight to become something they want to be, despite the fact no one believes in her, she aims to prove them wrong, I found that very uplifting, as Disney manage to give a talking bunny human qualities. One thing I felt the film was lacking was development in Nick's character, who I found to be the most intriguing, the one the audience would want to know the most about, however, they are far too focused on Judy, I never end up learning as much as I would like to have known about Nick. The best thing about this film is the universe, which the animators clearly put a ton of work in to developing and giving proper scope to, we are given such a good feel for the world of Zootropolis, a society in which all animals like like humans, that by the end of it you will find it hard to believe it is not one bit real. Funny, heartfelt and beautifully animated, Zootropolis is another win by Disney Animation, a must see for the whole family.In a world where all animals live as one, a rabbit police officer tries to prove her worthiness to the force by uncovering an otter who mysteriously disappeared. However, a mischievous fox gets in the way of her investigation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I stayed away from some trailers and I wanted to experience this movie myself and I was ABSOLUTELY touched by this movie! Zootopia is a fantastic film that has breath taking animation, AMAZING characters and a very clever story! I absolutely LOVE this movie! I love Judy Hoops and Nick Wilde who are both played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman! These are a great example of characters in animated movies! These two characters weren't your average Dreamworks movie characters, these characters were VERY well written and very mature! I also loved Idris Elba as Chief Bogo. His character was also very well written and mature. In fact, this entire movie brings great and mature messages for both kids and adults! Certain things that happen in Zootopia deal with everyday crimes, segregation and racism, even some signs of drug use in this film! Yeah and I mentioned that this was a Disney movie! Zootopia is not only a Disney film that kids can enjoy, the entire family will have a blast watching this movie and to be honest, adults might enjoy this film more than the kids! Zootopia surprised every single body part inside of me and this is definitely a film that will become a Disney masterpiece and a classic as time goes on and a film that EVERYONE can watch and have fun with and i'm gonna give Zootopia a 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
May Just Be the Best Disney Movie Ever,"To put it in the most succinct way possible, Zootopia is an absolute marvel both in scale and in execution. Disney's 55th animated film may honestly be it's best. I realize this sounds like hyperbole but I cannot lie, Zootopia may frankly be the most complete, organic, emotionally resonant, socially relevant, incredibly funny film to ever come out of Disney aka the studio that has pretty much monopolized on our entertainment.If ever there was a textbook definition of an upstart it would be Judy Hopps (Goodwin). Undaunted by the discouragement around her, Judy dreams of becoming a police officer in Zootopia, the city where predator and prey live in harmony. It's easier said than done, in fact not one of her species, nor any species smaller than a wolf, has ever made it through the Police Academy. She however finds a way and achieves her dream...only to become a meter maid. As she struggles to become an asset to the force, trouble brews in the city as predators start to disappear. Judy has a hunch concerning one of the predators and recruits the unwilling Nick Wilde (Bateman) a fox with a knack for getting into trouble.One of the first things I immediately noticed about this film coming in was the humor, which while certainly filled with corny animal jokes, is organic to the characters and the situations. There are no unnecessary and useless comic-relief characters or smug jabs meant to up the snark-factor. In-fact some of the humor is so subtle yet brilliant that it kind of washes over you. Take for example Judy's neighbors, two male bushbucks which immediately inform her they're loud and are heard sparring in their apartment. This joke will go far over the heads of children and adults alike but it's still there in the details.There's also detail in the complex relationships between the characters. Predator and prey are said to get along in Zootopia but Judy slowly realizes that that bond can easily be disrupted. Predators are a minority in the city generalized as aggressive and in the case of foxes, sneaky. There is certainly a subtext here and Disney has no problem with mirroring contemporary notions of racism and sexism and intertwining it's themes with the narrative of the story. In any other story a rabbit and a fox would be mortal enemies but in this case Judy and Nick become fast friends as they solve a convoluted crime.There are many moments I found myself rolling on the floor with laughter while simultaneously in awe at the mosaic the dream-makers at Disney have created. Any other year, a movie of this kind would have been a high-watermark of entertainment yet in the era of #blacklivesmatter and unabated police brutality, Zootopia has reached new heights. Zootopia has latched onto the zeitgeist of modern America like few movies ever have. To my recollection, only Spider-Man (2002) has achieved a similar balance between light and airy entertainment and seizing the moment to become something more. Just replace the uncertainty of post-9/11 America with the uncertainty of post- Ferguson America and you got the perfect movie for the times. One that is equal amounts of hope and optimism.I love this movie. It's beautifully rendered, smartly executed, and shockingly timely. The vocal cast is unparalleled with Goodwin and Bateman providing the best performances in an animated movie since Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter in The Incredibles (2004). Disney is world renowned for it's ability to give quality family entertainment and do so with a stunning sense of grace. Zootopia only continues that trend and does so while resonating with audiences in a manner few films dare to. Watch Zootopia with the entire family then, on your day off, watch it again; it's that good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
No one can deny that all Disney movies are terrific.,"Zootopia is a perfectly hilarious and remarkable movie not only for children,but also for adults.A rabbit Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) peacefully fights for the rights of weak animals.(A good theme from the great Disney).There are several animals with various characters and different traits exactly as there are numerous individuals with different characters.The script is didactic,great and funny.Just like us Virtuous Christians And Good Mormons,we never discriminate against Jews,Muslims, Blacks.... et cetera so is this movie's terrific theme:""Don't have prejudice and discrimination about others.

I expect a lot more from Disney now,"Walking into the theatre, I expected to at least be entertained by Disney's 55th animated movie, after the crazy streak that is Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Big Hero 6 and Inside Out. Thank you Disney, for taking my expectations, crushing them so hard and renewing my faith that Disney is still steadily improving. (However, I am likely to be disappointed after this movie, just goes to show how much this movie elevated my expectations. It's that good, to me at least).Why do I like this movie so much? That is because within its entertaining buddy cop facade, it shows a lot more and has a lot of relevant messages to tell. It unfolds at an engaging pace and will manage to surprise viewers.Protagonist Judy Hopps (voiced by the bubbly Ginnifer Goodwin) has big dreams and wants to prove the world wrong - that a tiny bunny can take on the big mammal job of a police officer. This is certainly something that connects well with the audience. She wants to break the small-animals-can't-do-tough-mammal-job stereotype. Ironically, she is eventually roped into a battle with her own subconscious stereotypes of others. Meanwhile, you have the flip side in Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman, who has no problem playing an animated version of himself), who succumbs to his stereotype. What seemed to be a message that ""you can be anything"" slowly turns into a (surprisingly) timely lesson on tolerance in diversity, discrimination and racial politics.The two lead characters Judy and Nick, have great chemistry and you'll find yourself rooting for them throughout (some even want more chemistry *ahem*. A lot more). Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Elba) and Ben Clawhauser (voiced by Nate Torrence) were nice additions to the cast, though the lack of focus on them is understandable. J.K. Simmons and Jenny Slate also lends their unique voices to Mayor Lionheart and Asst Mayor Bellweather, both of which are remarkably well-suited.To make it more fun, the movie is also riddled with references (both in pop culture and biological), hidden jokes and easter eggs. However, adults will probably have a lot more fun with these as they cater to the older audiences, like with the Godfather reference.Last but not least, the animation is beautiful. Everything, from characters to architecture to effects, looks spot on.All in all, this movie was awesome. It is guaranteed fun for the whole family (though kids might be a little scared at certain points). I enjoyed it thoroughly (maybe even felt close to crying) and I certainly would like to see more, sequels or series, just please keep the voice actors. Kudos to Disney once again.*Fair warning though, be careful with Google*10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"I can say this movie is ""cute"" because I'm a bunny","Zootopia is a cute movie (and I can say ""cute"" because I'm a bunny) that deals with some complicated social issues.

The voice acting is strong and the animation is well done, so even without the heart of Pixar, this is a solid Disney movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Sly foxes and dumb bunnies come together to make the slickest, smartest animated film of the year","You owe it to yourself to see Disney's new animated film Zootopia, a film so timely and relevant it's almost startling. You owe it to yourself to seek it out in a time in America where craziness, hatefulness, and fear is being further instilled in the general public by the very same people who should be fighting against it; the very same people who should be forcing us, as a collective, to rise above simple-minded assertions and mass generalizations about the people around us. You owe it to yourself to see this film simply because it's a brand new Disney classic.The film takes place in the vibrant, diverse world of Zootopia, a place where predators and prey live together in harmony, and are free to be whoever and whatever they want to be. These reasons are precisely why the land attracts Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a small bunny with dreams of being a police officer. Living on a farm, her parents fear this because, not only has a bunny never become a police officer, but they feel Judy should confine her aspirations to selling carrots on the family farm, something Judy has no interest in doing. After successfully completing police training, Judy is thrust into the force alongside other, more muscled animals such as rhinoceroses, rams, bulls, and elephants. Oh my.Judy's boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a buffalo, forces her to be a ""metermaid"" while the other animals take on the bigger crimes, specifically a case involving fourteen missing predators. Judy tries to show herself by issuing over two-hundred citations in just a couple of hours, but to no avail, as Chief Bogo wants to make sure she knows her place on the Zootopia police force. When Judy winds up catching a weasel after robbing a store, she is just about to be fired when Chief Bogo tasks her with finding a local otter who has been missing for over a week. If she can find the otter in forty-eight hours or less, she can keep her job, but if she doesn't, she'll be forced to resign. Judy enlists in the help of Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a fox, one of the most looked-down-upon predators in Zootopia, who has been doing number of odd jobs since he was young, after blackmailing him in order to get him to cooperate. Together, the two work to find the otter, but in turn, discover something bigger. Oh my.Zootopia wears its intentions on its sleeves, but not in a way that distracts or simplifies its core themes. As you can probably tell, this is a film about both racism and sexism, two features of society that, while probably never going away so long as humans roam the Earth, do not have to be such amplified forces of hate. Screenwriters Jared Bush and Paul Johnston carefully construct a world, predicated upon a particular dream, and within that world, populate it with a variety of characters, some labeled as normative, others quietly labeled as the enemy that many are waiting to step out of line. It doesn't take a scholar to see that rabbits represent women in society, while predators represent minorities.It does, however, take considerable screen writing talent to create a film that can be enjoyed and understood by both children and adults on a fairly similar level. Even Pixar's Inside Out was a film that sort of teetered a bit more to the adult crowd, with its lofty morals about children coping with their emotions, despite the fact that kids of all ages could at least enjoy the film as surface-level entertainment. Bush and Johnston pen Zootopia carefully, but bluntly, to the point where you can't ignore its profound, but simple message of inclusion and acceptance of peers. Oh my.Countless animated films have made themselves about preaching the gospel of acceptance and loving thy neighbor, but few have done it with the kind of thematic relevance, consistent wit, and zealous energy as Zootopia. Rather than sticking too a cleverly storyboarded, intricate plot, Bush and Johnston also have no problem playing around, allowing both Judy and Nick to free-roam in a sandbox full of original characters and allowing conversational/situational humor to prevail. This is why we get uproariously funny sequences involving three-toed sloths at the DMV, in addition to immensely creative, blink-and-you-miss-it chase sequences between a rabbit and a weasel. The film is not short on ideas nor energy, and the remarkable thing is how the film can go almost one-hundred miles an hour in every department and not even come close to running out of gas by the end credits.Zootopia is a contemporary Disney classic and should be treated as such; it will certainly give Pixar's questionable Finding Dory a run for its money in quality, awards, and overall relevance when it comes out this summer. This is a film that finds a way to be both sweet and simple, yet so urgent and topical, with an A-list voice cast, that you feel it's a soft rallying cry for unity, which is all the more reason why you shouldn't ignore it.Voiced by: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K.

Pop-culture references were also funny. What I liked more was how the characters were portrayed - you can believe they are actual people(?) living their lives.

Executed nicely; Political undertone obvious,"The characters complimented each other really well, the story line had me guessing, and there is comedy and entertainment for people of all ages. I would recommend this movie, but also advise that the political undertones are pretty evident, and analogies can be drawn easily to real life. But just like most political agendas, their is a lining of hypocrisy. While they support equal treatment to all animal species, there is a clear divide between the farming citizens and those living in Zootopia. The farming citizens have ""settled hard"" and did not follow their dreams or even believe in them. They are also perceived to be behind the times, still holding prejudices against animals of other species. The city of Zootopia is perceived to be the city of acceptance , knowledge, and overall advancement of the animal kingdom. While the main protagonist learns that prejudices still exist in Zootopia, in the end the animals of Zootopia learn that prejudice is bad and have a dance party together lead by the Gazelle pop-icon voiced by Shakira. For kids, I believe the undertones will go over their head. If not, it can spark a good conversation. However, the conversation should also include how those who choose to farm and not pursue dreams that others may have are in no way better or worse either. It should also be noted the bunny, who was (self-perceived) as less prejudice than others, was in fact more impatient with animals (the sloths in the DMV) than the fox was, while the fox is perceived to have accepted prejudices. Otherwise I thought it was very funny. To me, Michael Bateman's (the fox) deadpan, back-to-reality sense of humor helped balance the over enthusiastic persona of the bunny.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

So many animations these days are purely just dumb moments that will keep a child quiet for 90 minutes. Although Zootopia is equally engaging for both adults and children due to how well written it is. Something that is over looked is just how incredibly hard it is to write a great screenplay for an animation.

A lower-rung Disney effort.,"Bright, bubbly, breakneck: all defining characteristics of Disney's latest animated adventure. Sanctimonious, serious, seldom funny: other key traits that suffocate this family film until there's very little left to enjoy. With multiple ecosystems and a plethora of cultural subsets – mirroring our own society wouldn't you know – the anthropomorphic animal-world is conceptually interesting and beautifully animated, but the story told within this universe is disappointingly dull. The simple predators-and-prey-living-together plot device should've been ripe for subtle metaphors amongst zippy action and constant laughs, yet the film's themes – breaking down stereotypes, looking past race, being inclusive – are hammered home so heavy-handedly it feels like you're getting in trouble. A major issue is the lack of humour (or more accurately: successful humour) which, save for a truly hilarious sloth-centred sequence that had me in tears, is woefully misjudged and/or drowned out by the persistence of shoving a point down our throat. The muddled tone makes for a confusing viewing too; the unapologetic innocent nature of proceedings suggests this is aimed squarely at the toddler demographic, yet the Godfather and 'Breaking Bad' references are directly at odds with this. The infectiously optimistic bunny at the movie's heart, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), is a sweet and likable protagonist, however the mischievous fox who partners with Hopps, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), has more depth and charisma.

Expected nothing. Got Everything.,"When I first saw the teaser trailer to this movie I thought to myself that this looked like the most generic Ice age looking stupid pandering garbage ever. However, seeing as it was a Disney movie, I decided to give it a chance. I was never so glad to be so wrong in my life. This has rocketed itself to my favorite Disney movie ever unseating Princess and the Frog. It is rare for me to say that this is a near perfect film. In fact, it is far easier for me to state the things I didn't like. So here they are.1. Mr. Big. I don't like the godfather, therefore, i did not like this character. 2. The ambiguity of Nick and Judy's relationship at the end.Those are literally the only two issues i have with this movie. I loved this movie from start to finish. And people who know me, know how rare that is.Nick and Judy are some of the most wonderfully voiced and written main characters I have come across in a long time. They aren't over-loved Mary Sues or destined/chosen ones, they are real breathing characters that earn everything they get. (not to mention the gorgeous animation)The parallels in this movie for stereotypes and racism are also something to lauded. It is done in such a way that it seems natural and teaches you a lesson without shoving it in your face.Everything in this movie works.

Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are utterly incredible, as is Idris Elba, a role I never thought I'd see him doing.Mr Big was without a doubt my favourite character, the Marlon Brando thing he had going on was hilarious.Definitely see and buy this film, it's a cracker 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Absolutely delicious,"Am I sick or a little bit obsessed, or that young rabbit cop named Judy Hopps does indeed have a sexy ass? Either way, this film is a story that captures you and makes you fall in love with it, no matter what age you are, from 7 to 77 and over. Zootropolis is one of the most charming Disney productions ever. It's funny, entertaining, it has a compelling story, clever writing, with a lot of imagination. You can see it several times with the same pleasure, you do not get bored at all. Far superior to ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" (2016) and especially to ""The Wild Life"" (2016) Robinson Crusoe (original title), appeared almost simultaneously. I look forward to the second part.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Amazing Movie, Bad Twist.","Zootopia is a great movie. Amazing characters and soundtrack, well animated, great theme.

Wow...,"Okay. Let me be honest here. I knew I would enjoy this film since I saw the trailer, but I did not think I would like it THIS much! Now, like most of my reviews, I am going to keep it brief. I do not want to spoil this movie because, unless you have already seen it, I would say its worth seeing. This movie really changed my perspective on Disney. The film had my attention the entire time, I was never bored at any part. In fact, I was so caught into this movie, that when I went to set down my drink, I missed the cup-holder and dropped it! It did not spill but anyway, not to get off topic, it was an overall great film. This is one of the few movies that will receive a 10/10 rating. I was impressed, would recommend to anyone, not just kids. So, in conclusion, one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen, would watch again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Delicious dark chocolate, Zootopia looks colorful, tastes dark, but will be among the best films of 2016","Some movies perfectly personifies the past (Saving Private Ryan), some movies predict the future (Fight Club), and some (like this one) perfectly nail the current issues so accurately you feel like they financed, wrote, and filmed the movie yesterday. Read the following sentence slowly because you might not believe it the first time you glance through it: Zootopia is the best film under the Walt Disney Animation Studios banner since Emperor's New Groove, and is arguably the most important animated film since Princess and the Frog. Yes, the clock has to reach back 16 years before you can find a Disney Studios animated film as strong as this one. Between the layers of intense subject matter and a surprisingly strong mystery plot lies a beautiful message for the kids and tweens that needs to be heard, especially today.Nothing on the surface can actually prepare you for what happens once you enter the setting of Zootopia. However, the surface is quite delightful to look at. The animation is spectacularly detailed and contributes mightily to the storyline about animals living together. The main city itself branches off into several subdivisions, each with its own distinctive personality. Unlike most Disney films, Zootopia itself is so massive its practically begging for continuations through film and television. It's an expansive visual feast of colors and colorful characters, similar to the creative world of Wreck-It Ralph. However, once the movie gets going you will quickly realize that although it is a children's movie, there is plenty for teenagers and even adults to laugh at and to be moved by. The mystery is slightly more mature than what is expected, and we even reach quite dark territory once the second half kicks into play. This is a children's movie, but has an incredible script full of heart, soul, drama, and necessary comedy to offset the bleakness. Using Pixar's collective creativity technique (which has been rusting lately), we have three directors and nearly a dozen writing credits attached (two wrote the screenplay, many others contributed to the story). It is a miracle that so many contributors to a single script made a film that flowed so well.Disney and Pixar are the best at coming up with the required vocal talents to bring the animated films to life, and this is no exception. Jennifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are absolutely perfect for each other and play to their strengths: Goodwin with her charming all-American bubbliness and Bateman's sly hustling ways. They dominate the film but luckily you'll learn to love them immediately through their strengths and their flaws. And in keeping with recent tradition, you won't know who the true villain is until later as the stakes start getting higher.Rich Moore (most experienced of the three-director team) should be a bigger name because his directing credits includes the early 90s Simpsons and some of Futurama's greatest episodes. What those shows and this film has in common is the electric mix of well-paced story, strong characters, and shades of drama and commentary that speaks to the current issues. Zootopia explores racism, sexism, classism, and diversity fears better than any of the trailblazing Disney animated films before it. That being said, it's not a knock on Princess and the Frog, Mulan, or Hunchback of Notre Dame---the truth is Zootopia would have never been fully greenlit by Disney in the 90s, and perhaps even the 2000s.Disney has gotten gutsier and ballsier in recent years with the Too Big to Fail attitude; and although the company definitely remains officially mum on the current political turmoil, Zootopia can and should be its resume and cover letter concerning what side of the fight they are on. Zootopia is a daring animated film that will frighten you (especially the youngsters), will emotionally hurt you, and will leave you thinking long after Shakira's gazelle character lets out her final note. It's the perfect concoction of mystery, comedy, action, and social commentary that not only allows it to become an early entry for Best Animated Feature, but (dare I say it), a Best Picture nomination.Zootopia on the surface, beneath the surface, and everywhere in between is essentially flawless. It has something for everyone, although the youngest ones will struggle as it gets darker. Through its importance as well as the engaging, ever-revolving plot, I give this film the highest marks. Zootopia will stand as one of the best in all of 2016, and among the best works of animation this entire decade. Disney has unveiled its stance through adorable animals while simultaneously proving that it remains the animation king of the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Nicely noir inflected and appropriately allegorical.,"Disney's dip into detective drama genre is nicely noir inflected and appropriately allegorical, even if its central metaphor occasionally falls somewhat short considering the parallels it draws become increasingly tenuous, while the animation is lively and likely to remind you of the studio's cel-shaded past. What brings 'Zootropolis (2016)' close to being great is the compelling dynamic between its two central characters and the way in which they traverse the typically convoluted, yet satisfyingly so, narrative. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"uninteresting plot and horrendous moral ""lessons""","This movie is often seen as being an excellent action-humor combo containing a great moral component. I will briefly try to explain while it is neither of those things.First, I'll start by admitting that the humor present in the movie can work if you put yourself in a certain mood. It is combined with a great visual production aiming at putting you in that exact light-hearted mood, which works fine. The problem is largely the plot: it is uninspired (recycled) and things seems to happen as if they came from a magician's hat. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the random/surprising elements where entertaining. The problem is that, while it somehow works in the beginning, where the evolution of the plot make us discover Zootopia, the story becomes quickly bland an uninteresting as the movie enter an action phase.As for the interesting moral components this movie is credited for, they are inexistent. The whole lesson of the whole thing appears to be that you shouldn't listen to your prejudices, and you should be accepting of everybody. We could also add the classical: you can be anything you want if only you would try hard enough. I would start by saying that these ""lessons"" are so obvious and in-your-face that they cannot have any effect on children. They are what the movie SAYS, but in fact the movie DOES something very different. What it does is to make a link between a character's specie and his personality (in direct contradiction with the lesson about prejudice and promoting inclusion). It also treat most supporting character as pure stereotypes based on specie, which reduce their humanity in the eye of the viewer while using it as joke material. So what the movie in fact does is to tell you that large chunk of population have very few value, while those who deserve respect are the ones who ""work hard"" to obtain and maintain power over others, be it by wise manipulation or socially recognized opportunity to exert physical domination of others (police). This also implies that those who the film laugh at are deserving of their situation, as they didn't work hard enough to raise above the masses.In short, this movie is a montage of jokes with a plot to support those jokes, which tries to compensate for its lack of substance with ""lessons"" that are nothing more than virtue-signaling.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the Best Movies of the 2010s,"Zootopia tackles a tough topic in a nuanced fashion and is just as entertaining for adults as for children. Judy and Nick are two of the best characters Disney has produced, who would have thought a fox and bunny make such a good team? The animation is very adorable, you can tell the artists worked very hard to maintain the individual species of animals' characteristics while anthropomorphizing them. Zootopia has plenty of laughs but also some very tearjerking or heartwarming moments. I enjoyed the character of Nick Wilde in particular, he takes Disney's ""Charming Fox"" mantle and wears it as well as Disney's Robin Hood. The voice acting is very good, I completely forgot Idris Elba was in the movie until the end, he IS Chief Bogo in the film. Zootopia is a wonderful entry into the Disney Animated Canon and definitely an instant classic. I think it may have been the best movie I saw all year and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. And again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Okay Disney, I officially forgive you for Chicken Little.","Because in terms of the setting, it's kind of like that, but good.Disney's latest CGI feature outing is beginning to make me question whether or not Deadpool is going to be the best movie I watch all year, as Zootopia is giving it a pretty good run for its money. While watching this, I was struck by all of the things it tries to do differently. Despite the fact that there are predators and prey coexisting, it feels no need to paint one side as better or worse than the other. In fact, it tries to teach that in societies with an ""us"" and ""them"" concept, that there are good and bad individuals in both groups. Among other lessons it tries to convey are that things are done for reasons other than the obvious, authority and social roles should be challenged when the need arises, respect should be earned rather than blindly given... I could go on for a while, but I'd get pretty boring and preachy.So instead, I'll leave behind my after-school special bit and explain what else works. This movie certainly knows how to reference pop culture, in that the reference is innocuous at worst for those who don't get the reference and still manages to work in context without joke behind it (as opposed to loudly declaring ""Hey, this thing exists! Now those of you who know the thing, laugh in recognition!""). The characters are also very enjoyable, my personal favourite being Nick Wilde. He's slick without being oily, clever and quick with a pun, but not mean-spirited. In fact, out of the entire cast, he's probably the most level-headed and least presumptuous. Judy is also a great example of an underdog (or should I say underbunny?) who defies the odds and social norms to achieve her dreams, but she's also prone to fallacies and misconceptions, making her likable yet flawed without either feeling forced.However, there are some things about the movie that bug me a little. Why is it that only the mammals evolved to become how they are today? What about the birds, the fish and the reptiles? Why does the movie go so far to build Zootopia as a place with so many different zones, but only visit a few? And finally, why does it have the hardheaded police chief cliché? If Judy and Nick hadn't pressed him to listen to reason so hard, the movie would have had a much more grim ending. I just wish that there could be a police chief character who had more awareness than a sack of wet concrete.All in all, though, Zootopia is a great movie that's worth a watch because of its top-notch story, solid characters, superb soundtrack, and thought-provoking messages. If you like this, I'd also recommend Arashi no Yoru ni, which is very similar, minus the modernized setting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the best animation movie ever,"If you want to had a good time with your kids or simply with your love, this movie is just for you !Zootopia is an excellent film: intelligent, subtly subversive and beautifully realized.

The universe is rich, funny, convincing, inventive, luminous; In two words: so beautiful! In addition, the film does not forget to pass on its self-criticism, referring regularly to its character of super-prod-Disney and typing cheerfully but without malice on its predecessors at bottom purely ""entertainment"" ""Among others).

Looks like the obligatory Disney hype train is upon us,"Remember the Academy Award winning film Crash and how everyone thought it was the worst Best Picture winner of all time? How everyone hated it because it was very one sided on its views on racism and how even though it was against stereotypes it itself was stereotypical? That's how I feel with Zootopia, which has a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, but not to the extent of Crash. While Zootopia has good cast and a fun feel it suffers from a bland story, ho-hum characters, and a very uninteresting take on racism. Nothing in the film really ever makes it stand out from other Disney film. If it didn't talk about racism then no one would be singing it's praises.Zootopia starts out with an unnecessary backstory right at the beginning about how the world works in a play that the main character, Judy Hopps, is in. Zootopia is the city in the universe of this film where Predator and Prey live together in harmony. Judy Hopps is the first rabbit to join the police force and is trying to solve a recent case where Predators are being kidnapped. With the help of a red fox con artist, Nick Wilde, they uncover a conspiracy that'll shake the people of Zootopia. Too bad I wasn't shaking because I didn't really care for the characters or the story of Zootopia. I'm not trying to be harsh but I can't hide the fact that I don't get easily invested in stories that are beat to beat generic stories. If you have ever seen a detective film then you have basically seen Zootopia. It does nothing new with what's given and feels like Crash with animals.I hear that many people love how the film talked about racism but it didn't get extremely in depth with it. Just because you talk about prejudice doesn't make your film amazing. When Zootopia talks about racial prejudice it never bring up anything interesting or new. It just says ""racism is bad"". Agreeing with a certain political or social issue doesn't mean the film is great. I liked Blue is the Warmest Color but I would still give it a 7/10. Just talking about social issues isn't enough to make your film one of the highest rated films of the year. A movie that talked about racism perfectly is Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. It said that racism is a complicated subject matter and that some people say something is racist just to get their racism out on others. It never agrees with one side and lets you decide what is right. Zootopia never goes deep into these issues as much as it should to make an interesting story.The best part of Zootopia the cast by far. Ginnifer Goodwin has always been a good actress and she brings a lot of enthusiasm to the character of Judy Hopps. Same goes for Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde. I absolutely loved his character at many parts of the film and gave me a smile each time I saw him on screen. The other great actors in the film are sadly wasted, J.K. Simmons is an actor that I have appreciated ever since Spider-Man and I started following more of him after his Oscar- winning role in Whiplash, so I am always extremely disappointed whenever any film wastes him like in the tragic Terminator Genisys. Idris Elba plays a very generic chief but it never goes anywhere new or fun. I personally would have loved to see Elba have more fun and do more stereotypical Chief moments in Zootopia. But there isn't a terrible performance in this film. Disney never disappoints when it comes to voice acting and Zootopia is no exception.Zootopia, while disappointing, is still a fun film that Disney fans will definitely get a kick out of. While it would be great to see Disney tread off the seemingly long and winding generic road they are able to squeeze as much magic in their films as possible. If they do ever make a sequel or decide to talk about other social issues in future films hopefully they can do something risky that will truly make the film exceptional. Maybe not the go to movie to see this year but definitely something to check out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The best animated Disney film since Toy Story 3,"Zootopia is a great family-friendly, animated film. It has really good adult humor and is fun to watch from start to finish. The animation is really good, too. The idea of a movie where animals live and act like humans in an earth-like world is a great idea. Sometimes really good ideas for movies are just good ideas and don't really do that well on the big screen. Inside Out, for example, is a great idea for an animated movie, but, in my opinion, it didn't actually deliver. This is not the case for Zootopia. You will find yourself laughing out loud many times throughout. It's a very fun movie, and you should definitely check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A children's guide to multiculturalism,"We were prey and predators once, antagonizing each other. But it was thousands of years ago, now we're all evolved, peaceful and equal. And if anything falls out of that paradigm then it's definitely a result of some malicious interference.That's basically the message of Zootopia. Calling it utopian is hardly insightful, but there's no better way to describe it. An upbeat and positive story of a little bunny who wanted to be different and to change the world by making it a kingdom of kindness and equality once again - that doesn't seem remotely realistic, even if the story was not about animals but humans. Still, with nice visuals and enough goofing around, it's exactly what would keep kids captivated for enough time so that their parents could get their much-needed precious rest. By being somewhere else or doing something else.And I mean it. Zootopia may be full of surprises for the young generation, but it's not a film that can provide a second layer an adult viewer could enjoy. There's no subtlety, instead, everything is explicit and for show, so any attempt to demonstrate some character development is somewhat staged. The difficulties are temporary and solve themselves without much labor. So, at the end of the day, even rooting for the happy ending is not too engaging because it never really seems that it could happen any other way.It's hard to blame Disney for a lack of the real-world complexity. After all, it's what they do: flicks for kids. And those flicks are more or less fairy tales where the good wins simply because they want us to believe in goodness and uphold it. However, there's a thin line between teaching the good and claiming that it's the natural way for everyone, which could be corrupted but is still something we all perceive equally. And while the fairy-tale thinking, despite being obviously naive, bears no big harm, the white lies of the latter approach create a much more distorting illusion. An illusion that we're all the same inside and that we all want to be the same.Come think of it, there might even be a second layer in Zootopia. Unfortunately, that layer looks like some sort of leftist propaganda, telling us that whoever we are, we have no other destiny but to stay united. That no matter who you are, a predator or a prey, a Muslim or an atheist, a Syrian refugee or a German burgher, living together is something that all of you must want and love. And if you wanna separate and set your own order of things, even if you're a vast majority, then there's something wrong with you and you're definitely a bad guy. No dude, stay put and love your neighbors, even if they bang at your wall and yell all night. And don't you dare expecting them to apologize for it!For more than half a century the real-world us were being told that there's no other way, and those who disagree should be branded fascists. So it's quite symbolic that I got to watch Zootopia just a few days after the British people showed the world that an alternative is possible. So nice try Disney, but sometimes it's better to ask difficult questions rather than to make up overly simple answers. And a word of advice to the audience: if you so desperately want a Disney's fairy tale about the world's issues, watch Tomorrowland instead. It's equally simplistic, but at least it leaves you the freedom of choice without stamping the moral labels on it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Zooland,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I just don't like this movie. The first time I watched it, it just annoyed me but I thought I'd give it a second chance, try and see what people love here. Still don't see it.On the upside, the animation is pretty. The voice acting is solid. There are even one or two moments of laughter.That's it though. The rest of this movie still falls apart to me. It feels too predictable and by the numbers. There's a message about equality which is nice but there's no subtlety to it, instead it gets hammered over your head again and again and again. There's no surprise here and I never feel invested in the characters or world. It's fun but not real deep.Maybe the most annoying thing to me is that I want to like this world and these characters and I just don't.

Furry Family Fun - Another Disney Hit,"It would be an understatement to say that I was extremely excited to see this film. Not only was the trailer hilarious (that sloth scene slayed me) but I am a huge fan of animated films, and this one in particular had plenty of positive buzz around it.Zootopia is a film that goes beyond a child's world of talking animals and deals with some pretty heavy themes, including failure, bullying and prejudices against those who are different (in this case, it's the predators who are the unlikely victims).Judy Hopps (voiced by the adorable Ginnifer Goodwin) is a bunny with a big dream. Much to the rest of the animal world's amusement, she vows to move away from the humble carrot farm she's inherited from her parents to become a police officer in the big, bad city. She spends the rest of the film trying to prove what she's capable of to everyone she meets, particularly when she teams up with the misfit rascal fox named Nick Wilde (where a deliciously sarcastic Jason Bateman lends his voice).Not only is the animation phenomenal, my kudos also goes to the screenwriters who have created a magical world of evolved creatures that actually don't extend too far from our current reality, making this film very humorous, heartfelt and relatable. This is another Disney gem that will become a family favourite for kids and adults alike.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Totally overrated.,"There was not even one funny content, sloppy dialogs, and the story totally flat. I doubt it was a comedy. I wouldn't suggest it for children, as the plot is hardly understandable even adults. By understandable I mean exciting. This movie just happened. No memories left. No magic left. It's hard to write anything cause the movie was empty. Disappointing. I love Lion the King, Tangled, WALL-E, Hercules, but this movie is a disgrace! It is full of humor for adults, crappy humor by the way. Children sitting behind me asked their father: ""Can we go home, please"", and it was just 30 minutes of movie. They started asking repeatedly after one hour. I totally agreed with them. I wanted to go home and watch Lion the King. I wanted my evening back. Nice marketing Disney! Sadly.

Zootopia may not be the best animated picture of this year but it depends on other releases of this year.But the Sloth's scene is epic and unforgettable classic,"Zootopia (2016): Walt Disney studios are one of the most earliest animation production companies.From Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) to Zootopia (2016) they have been producing best quality animated movies.Every year since 2013,Walt Disney is winning the Academy Award for Animated feature film.This year Zootopia has already won many hearts and critics top choice and most likely to continue Disney's winning streak.So how is Zootopia?Plot: From the biggest elephant to the tiniest shrew, the city of Zootopia is a beautiful metropolis where all animals live peacefully with one another. Determined to prove her worth, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) becomes the first official bunny cop on the police force. When 14 predator animals go missing, Judy immediately takes the case. Partnering with a smooth talking fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), Judy must piece together all the clues as to where the predators are and who is behind it all.Plus Points:1)Animation: The city itself is the best part of the picture, a gorgeous melange of design elements. Zootopia is a well designed fictional city with divided territories for every species.The shrew's city and Sloth's DMV office are beautiful and detailed.2)Story and Screenplay: A diversified Animal Kingdom is the cutest plot with brilliant message.Screenplay is highly entertaining with brilliant humor and characters,Judy's passion for being a real police,Nick Wilde's sly nature and Chief Bogo's secret crush on Gazelle and Sloth's office,all have their own mark to keep us entertained.The scene in Sloth's office is epic and one of the most hilarious moments of all time.3)Music: Music is good and timely placed.Minus points:1)Predictable: Though this movie is entertaining when it reaches the end we can easily predict the twist.It is so clichéd and spoiled the fun.So,Zootopia may not be the best animated picture of this year but it depends on other releases of this year.But the Sloth's scene is epic and unforgettable classic.My rating 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The Perfect Film for A Better World | Review of 'Zootopia',"This is a great family film that everyone needs to watch because of all the teaching moments within the film. Let me phrase that: the entire movie is a teaching moment. Zootopia is a film that is all about inclusion, about putting away the stereotypes and prejudices aside to live in a better society and how negative they are, how much they blind someone to see something but hatred and anger.The story is just amazing as it follows Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) a small town bunny who wants to be a part of the big leagues as an officer with all the other large big animals that work together to solve crime in the big city. But she's a bunny, what the heck can a bunny do as a crime? It's a stereotype the resonates so strongly with the audience, with anyone who was thought of as being too weak to do what the ""big boys"" do. Judy is breaking those barriers, breaking those stereotypes to show that even though she may be tiny, she can do their job twice as good as they can. And boy, does she do it. She is suck a great character and the film has so much heart to it because of who she is and how she develops in the film. She's so single minded on her quest to do something right, to prove herself, that she becomes lost within the prejudices that now surpass the. It's a growing moment for her and the audience because they see her mistakes and they see her fix them.As for Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman), he faces many of the same challenges as Judy, but his are based more on the prejudices of a fox. He's a predator, and no one gives him the chance to be anything more than that, so he stopped trying. This is something everyone faced in their life, bullies to geeks, jocks and cheerleaders; society has a way of bunching the few alongside with the few bad apples. Nick represents that side of society that many people don't realize is even there because it is just part of how culture tends to work. And the fact that this film is addressing that makes is such a profound film.This movie should be applauded on the story itself, because these writers and the directors, together they were able to create this very time- appropriate story that has a very powerful theme to it. It is simply such an amazing story about inclusion that doesn't play nice. This is may a kids movie, but that did not stop the writers from adding in some very dramatic scenes to highlight the negativity that comes from watching life through stereotypes and prejudices, how dangerous and hurtful they can be to an individual. It's all about not to judge the book by its cover.Story and amazing voice acting aside, A movie filled with heart, laughs, and plenty of teaching moments for a better society is amazing, and to make it even more amazing were the graphics of the film. Animated movies just get better and better, and Disney works amazingly with their graphics putting so much work into it, they deserve the recognition for their hard work. Everyone deserves something for this film because all together, this film was just an amazing piece of animation that had such a strong story. This is the perfect family film and is the perfect film for everyone of any age, gender, or race because of what it teaches: inclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not As Deep Or Clever As It Thinks It Is,"I guess this is about prejudices and discrimination of all kinds but I don't think it's very smart or incisive, or even particularly clever or witty. It picks the prejudices it wants to deal with and mostly sticks to those, while also undermining those same messages by reducing many others to those same kinds of stereotyping (rednecks, Italian mafioso, etc) and there doesn't seem to be any indication this is intentional or meant as subversiveness.Maybe it doesn't matter that much, this movie isn't meant to be a deep and thorough undertaking but it still hurts the film when its messages are blatantly obvious and screamed in your face and then slyly ignored when there's plot needed and a joke to be had.The rest of it is pretty standard modern animated pop-culturally aware farce.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A beautifully portrayed movie,Zootopia amazed me with its script. The film focuses on the life events of judy who is an underrated police officer. The story line is told in a way which keeps the audience gripped to their seats. I was especially pleased with the voice-over provided for the characters. The film also has good animation which need not be said for a Walt Disney movie. The whole concept of the movie is interesting as it tells the story of civilized animals.Walt Disney ceases to amaze us with its animation and script as this is worthy of mention. The villain didn't exactly take me by surprise though. But it is no flaw. Overall i would have no trouble watching a second part for this movie which explains my interest for it. 😉,8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wrong metaphor,"Predators will ALWAYS BE PREDATORS! The story was all about breaking stereotypes and respecting others in spite or because of their differences. I can absolutely get on board with that. However, the vehicle used to convey this message was predators and prey living together in harmony. I gotta tell ya, I don't see it happening till Christ reigns on Earth for 1,000 years. They conveniently dropped almost all instances of the predators eating. Some of them were carnivores, which means they eat MEAT! When Judy Hopps makes a statement to the media that biological instincts could be the cause of the savage behavior, it's a gross understatement, not an irresponsible opinion. Sure, children may possibly learn appropriate lessons. However, they may also become confused by the same token. I actually really enjoyed the show. I just don't see, as an adult and parent, how the lesson can be effectively taught using broken nature. Parents could do worse than discussing it with their children.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A pretty important movie!,"'ZOOTOPIA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 55th feature film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. This one revolves around a world of anthropomorphic animals; where a cop bunny teams with a con artist fox, to solve a missing animal case. It was directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and co-directed by Jared Bush (the trio also co-wrote the movie, with 5 other writers). The film stars the voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Octavia Spencer and Tommy Chong. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and I have to agree; it's one of the best films of the year (so far)!Judy Hopps (Goodwin) had always dreamed of becoming the first rabbit police officer (since childhood). When her dreams finally come true, she's assigned to work at the Zootopia police department. Zootopia is a large metropolis; of all kinds of different mammals. Judy is (of course) initially met with a lot of skepticism (and prejudice). She tries to prove herself, by solving a missing otter case. She teams up with a clever con artist fox, named Nick Wilde (Bateman), in order to do so.The film is beautifully animated, and full of colorful (likable) characters. It's both funny and surprisingly touching; but what's most beautiful about the movie, is it's insightful message about bigotry. You can never judge anyone by their appearance, or social background, and what better way to illustrate that message to kids; than with a world full of various types of animals. I love this movie, because of that message (it's one that means a lot to me), and I don't usually love Disney animated films. This one is pretty important.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Heartfelt film with a strong positive message for both children and adults,"Disney has been on a winning streak lately, releasing great animated movies like Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen and Big Hero 6. The studio manages to add another gem to its line-up with Zootopia: a great film that tells a heartfelt story, while intelligently covering some delicate themes.The film follows the endeavors of Judy Hopps, a rabbit who wants to be a police officer in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. The twist is that all animals are sized like they are in the real world. Being a small rabbit, Judy is often confronted with difficulties while trying to fulfill her dream, but she never gives up. After graduating at the top of her class, she ends up in the metropolis of Zootopia, where she is tasked with parking duty. Of course, Judy is not satisfied with this trivial activity. Thanks to her determination she manages to get assigned to a disappearance case. Since she does not get any help from the police force, she ends up trying to crack the case with a wayward fox named Nick.The story unfolds itself to be a heartfelt journey through some visually stunning environments. Zootopia is divided into several districts, including a desert, a rain forest and a snowy suburb. This ensures the movie never looks boring, as Judy and Nick travel through different parts of the city to solve their case. A lot of time was put into developing the city and all its details. The rain forest district, for example, stays humid thanks to an abundance of sprayers, ensuring the inhabitants feel right at home.While going through their journey, both Judy and Nick learn a lot about themselves and the world around them. Their characters are very well developed and undergo a logical and heartfelt evolution. This is where the movie really shines in my opinion, as it touches on some very delicate issues such as race and discrimination. It avoids being too preachy, but at the same time raises some really interesting questions, both for children and adults alike. These questions are all the more interesting when considering the recent racial tensions in the US and the refugee crisis in Europe. I had some very interesting conversations after the movie ended.Of course, there is also room for humor. There are a lot of puns and predictable funny moments alluding to animal stereotypes. The jokes are very well worked out though and they never feel cheesy.Overall, this is probably my favorite animated Disney movie since the Disney Revival started more then five years ago. It has great, lovable characters, a beautiful set-up, some great laughs and most importantly: a strong positive message for both kids an adults.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Zootopia,"In a large city of animals, one would expect many problems to arise, seeing as they have stark differences about them. The huge metropolis being divided into sections, the tundra, rain-forest, desert etc. allows animals to live where they need in order to survive, however there are two themes presented throughout the entirety of the movie. The first being a predator-prey relationship they strive to put behind them, Zootopia also presents the issue that if you were born a certain animal, you were expected to behave in a certain way/pursue a certain path in life. This is presented head on when Bunny Judy Hopps is introduced. Although she is expected to be a carrot farmer, she dedicates her life to being a police officer. She is then presented with the challenging question that seems to be taking everyone by storm. Does being a predator truly make an animal a more violent/untrustworthy citizen? With a sly predator by her side, will she be able to debunk this question? The film Zootopia has a positive message as it pushes the idea that no matter who you are, you can achieve whatever you want as long as you have the passion for it.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It's entertaining but it's neither as smart nor as deep as it wants you to think it is,"Zootopia is a movie that knows how to keep you engaged from start to finish. Something happens all the time, the characters are funny, the setting is creative, something is always moving to attract your attention, nothing overstay its welcome until something else happens to replace it. I wasn't bored for a single second while watching it. And that's all the good things I have to say about it, for everything else is one big mess.Starting with the fabled racism topic where herbivores are afraid of carnivores and discriminate them. That's not racism you guys, racism is something that applies to races of the same species, not throughout different ones. When a man considers himself superior to a fruit fly, that is not racism.Even if we are to assume all animals in the move are supposed to be the same species and just happens to look completely different, and eat completely different things, it's still not working out because we are never given an explanation to why the ecosystem hasn't been messed up beyond repair.For example there is the joke about bunnies multiplying extremely fast. If carnivores are no longer a threat why isn't overpopulation an issue? And yes, it's a joke, it's not supposed to be taken seriously. The same can be said about the whole theme. It's not really explored, it's just tongue in check and a lazy excuse for a conflict.Then it's plot which, holy smokes, is it riddled with plot convenience or what? Every single event the heroine takes part in just happens to be part of the same conspiracy and working to her benefit. When things get really grim she just happens to have an epiphany. Also that carrot recorder is panacea. There is nothing you can't fix by secretly recording someone against his knowledge. Which by the way it's illegal to use without a warrant and can't be used in court. Also, they can easily sue you for invasion of privacy. But what do I know, this movie is supposed to be smart.And then there is also the issue of the furries, which is there to attract people with very peculiar preferences. Calling this a movie for kids, so I should not be very critical, is lying to yourselves. Just because it has cute talking animals does not mean it's childish, for it's full of pop references and sexual fetishes.As a whole, I had a blast watching it. If I were to score it on enjoyment alone, I would have given it a perfect score. But I am not a pleb, so I won't. The script is lazy, the themes are not really explored, and since I am not a furry, I was a bit creeped out by the bestiality innuendoes. It's entertaining but it's neither as smart nor as deep as it wants you to think it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...What a fantastic movie! ""Zootopia"" really does deliver on all levels. Take away the animation, the striking visuals and the Disney magic ... and you're still left with a very good story. I like movies like this. It wasn't made just for the sake of being made ... all the fun animals and personalities, etc. It's intelligent and will keep adults just as entertained as the kids.Judy Hopps, a little rabbit growing up in Bunnyburrow, dreams of being a police officer when she gets older. Even though she is pressured from her parents to stay home and become a carrot farmer, she is determined to make her dreams come true. Fifteen years later, she enters, completes and graduates from the academy and is sent to the thriving metropolis of Zootopia where she is delegated the heavy responsibility of ... meter maid. However, it appears destiny has much more in store for her as she teams up with a fox named Nick to solve a baffling mystery that runs much deeper than they think.This is one of the better CG animated movies I've ever seen. It delivers a good crime story with humorous anecdotes, engaging action and top notch graphics. The acting is well done with a convincing plot and characters. The movie moves right along at a great pace ... except for the sloth scene, which was downright hilarious.""Zootopia"" is a very high recommend.

Yet another great flick by the lovely animators at Walt Disney! :),"I just got around to watching this. And I watched it on New Year's eve on top of everything. I've always adored animated movies, and besides a few exceptions, I've not encountered a single one that I didn't enjoy. Or if I did, I don't remember, which is a good thing, no?!Let's get to it. What's so special about Zootopia? It's an animated feature film, and meant for kids and adults equally.The animation is marvelous! Especially if you consider the scene where our main character, Judy, travels to Zootopia with the song ""Try Everything"" playing in her earbuds! That scene was a beautiful site for the eyes!Now, the plot is, and I hate to say it, not THAT original.. because we've seen similar movies before. It's the same formula. And if you consider the message it sends across, well... that's also, something we've all heard before. Many times!But just like any other animated feature film by Disney, it is amazing. It's a heartfelt story, with all it's twists and turns, and a great musical number by Shakira, which I didn't know of prior to watching the movie, so I got really surprised by that.All in all, it's a great experience, and WILL definitely make for a fun experience with your friends, family, children... anyone, really. It's perfect for a solo watch too.I hope to god that they don't milk it and make a second part (or any follow ups) and let it be that one stand alone animated feature that's damn near perfect on it's own.

Nope,"Sluggish plot that is kind of predictable, a violent detective story that was not exactly for kids, but most of all it was chock-full of multicultural leftist propaganda that will leave you thinking you just watched a govt infomercial.The entire movie was a thinly-veiled message on tolerating the more 'aggressive' members of our society (who were all more 'ethnic' animals) and learning to trust/adopt rather than deport them.I think Frozen marked the beginning of the shift toward the left that Disney will be doing for the next films.

Even a young child will understand the message upon viewing.This is truly a masterpiece, and I am in tears from watching it. The cinematography was top notch. The plot and screen writing were great and unexpected (for me). The message rings truer than anything else I've heard.This movie is clearly made by people who care.

One thing I loved the most about the movie is that it has a great rhythm: I mean the scenes are fast going, they don't lose to much time.Another thing I found great was that everything was connected: no loose scenes. For instance,(SPOILER) saving the small mouse had an important consequence in the future; the acting scene in the beginning was connected with (almost) the last scene.

Made me to remember the novel ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell,"Animal Farm is an allegorical and dystopian novella by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945.

"Buddy cop movie, with 3D animated cute err... animals","The movie was amusing and I watched it till the end. The problem with it is not really the film itself as it is with its genre: let's take a story that would be slightly ridiculous if we did it with real people, because it would feel lazy and hard to suspend belief, and make it 3D with cute animals, because this way one can get away with anything. And then market it to both adults and children, because it's a cartoon, but has some adult salt and pepper here and there.In short, it's a recipe movie. The animation is good, the voices are good - I mean, just look at the cast - with an appropriate huge budget. It even has heart, but painted there with such a heavy hand that I felt someone stuck down my throat a cute fluffy animal. Nothing above the ordinary yet, although I believe the standard is going to drop dramatically with each summer animated Hollywood film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Parable on Manufactured Intolerance,"In the idyllic kingdom of Zootopia, with six different types of ecosystems to accommodate every taste and comfort, animals have shelved their differences and both predators and prey cohabit peacefully. There is one shortcoming though; the police force lacks a rabbit. This is soon plugged thanks to the policy of inclusiveness pursued by the mayor and Judy Hopps becomes the first rabbit officer, much against the wishes of her parents who want her to become a carrot farmer. But the police chief, a buffalo, isn't too impressed and assigns Judy, the lowly job of parking enforcement.Don't let this yarn make you yawn. Serious trouble begins to brew in this Utopian metropolis; 14 animals go missing and rest of the film is about how Judy, aided by a clever fox, gets to the bottom of the sordid mystery.Zootopia is a thinly disguised parable on intolerance, xenophobia, stereotyping, discrimination and such contemporary social malaise that we see all around us. The 3D animation is astonishingly beautiful; I wanted to stay forever in that enthralling world.Zootopia is not really a film for kids; I saw many of them getting restless. The content is too adult to be subjected on the innocent kids. But it is utterly delightful viewing for the adults, especially for those who need to be reminded on what is wrong with our world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Lovable and flawed,"There are things I love about Zootopia, as this movie is really good about hitting the right marks. Idris Elba voice-work? Check. Relevant and funny social commentary on race and contemporary race relations? Check. AN EXTENDED GODFATHER JOKE?!? Super check! Heck even the size differences between the products and appliances the animals use and the way they are integrated together is pretty genius. And ohhhhhh the little details in the animals like the way the wolves cock their heads ti the side when confused is great!! So where does this movie mess up? For one thing it does the common kid movie trope of having irrelevant emotionally manipulative scenes complete with sad music for no reason other than to try to make the audience feel upset. There are some pretty big plot holes, like how did they not hear the wolves howling in the panther scene? How did they cut in front of the entire DMV? Also towards the end the movie seems to give up and just give away all the remaining mysteries as easily as it can in the narratively weakest way possible. But overall this movie is funny, decently animated, and a lot better than your average kids movie. I give it a 7.5 out of 10 and recommend people to definitely check it out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Just watch it and be entertained on several levels,"Disney really knows there way around a good story, one that have meaning and takes up a ""difficult"" subject so that both kids and adults get something out of it. We were all entertained, the entire family had been looking forward to this and we wasn't disappointed at all.You can see this just for the animation, that is really awesome and beautiful, it is also very rich both in color, but also in realism and diversity, the world of Zootropolis and it's different areas are really one great spectacle to watch.You can also see it for the characters, really just a lot of different representatives from vast areas of the animal kingdom, the main ones would maybe not be the obvious choice (a rabbit and a fox), but they meet so many others and it is a great experience to watch the diversity. There are so many characters to love in this, from our main characters Judy Hops and Nick Wilde, to Flash the funniest sloth I have ever seen, but there are so many other lovable characters.You could also see it for the story and the subject, it really is a great one, it has it all and my kids got as much out of it as I did, it really speaks to your senses and emotions, maybe a bit subliminal, but if you think about it again and again something got to give.Maybe see it for all of the above, it is an enjoyable animation all the way and with all it entails, just watch it and be entertained, you should be on several levels.Location, seating & time: Bio City, Nordisk Film, Taastrup, Denmark - Bio 1, row 9 seat 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 - 17.02.2016 at 10.00",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Flawed allegory,"""I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.""J.R.R. Tolkien would have cordially disliked this movie, to put it mildly. This is an extremely preachy movie, which attempts to distill the racial issues of the USA down into black and white. Two takeaways from this movie:It is perfectly okay for black people to refer to one another as the n-word (IMDB says that is a prohibited word), just as long as non-black people do not:Clawhauser: ""O. M. Goodness, they really did hire a bunny. Ho-whop! I gotta tell you, you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.""Judy Hopps: ""Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny 'cute', but when other animals do it, that's a little...""What a terrible analogy, as ""cute"" is not a disgusting, reviled word. No one should be calling anyone the n-word, but that's not the point the movie makes. It is telling us that as long as you are the same race as someone else, you can treat that person as horribly as you like. Just as long as people of differing races are nice to one another the world will become a utopia.The second takeaway of the movie is that non-blacks are responsible for all the ills and suffering of black people. Somehow someone white is seeding all the discontent and suffering that black people experience. They are manipulating black people into being ""savages"" (to use the exact term from the movie).The problem with this totally binary view of the issues of racism and inequality in the USA is that it is inaccurate. It absolves the minority of any responsibility whatsoever. It says that they can maintain the status quo, continue calling one another the n-word, continue murdering one another (93% of murdered black people are killed by another black person), and all of that is perfectly fine. What the movie teaches is that under no circumstances may a non-black use the n-word, rub a black person's hair, or manipulate black people into killing non-black people.While Disney is to be commended for at least attempting to address the subject (and this alone is the cause célèbre prompting many reviewers to trip over themselves to gush about this film), they should at least address it in an evenhanded, responsible fashion.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I only can tell that i love every part from this movie (yes including the Shakira singing and everybody dancing part what is necessary in a Disney movie...) and this become one of my favorite animation. The only thing is that in my opinion you shouldn't watch this with a 6-7 year old folk because he may be scared and maybe don't really understand the plot.

Almost on par with Inside Out on how clever it can get,"Zootopia is the latest animated feature by Walt Disney Animation Studios. Even though the trailers weren't particularly exciting for me, I had been told it is excellent and worth seeing by just about everyone who had seen it. For the most part, I think they're right. I would say that it is almost on par with Inside Out on how clever it can get.Set in a world populated with anthropomorphic animals, a young rabbit cop named Judy (voiced by Ginnifer.Goodwin) is forced to work hand in hand with a sly con-artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman) to uncover a conspiracy involving the mysterious disappearance of some of the ""predator"" animals populating their city of ""Zootopia"".Despite the film's seemingly cute look, it delves pretty deep into some dark subject matter and themes such as discrimination, prejudice, class status and even attempted murder. However, it still manages to maintain that Disney family charm and never goes so far as to alienate younger audiences. The film's animation was great to look at and brightly coloured, and the world of Zootopia felt alive and vibrant. Jason Bateman, who I am used to seeing as a straight man in most comedies, was great as the wise cracking Nick, as was Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy. If you enjoy clever Disney films like Inside Out, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Zootopia is brimming up like a carnival where all sorts of animals live in harmony together and basically coexist to comically impede the story with their cussing and nagging letting their animal instinctive jargon to make things exciting.The story-line begins way back in time, and then quickly takes the plot up in the vanguard the moment Judy Hopps reaches Zootopia with her dream job. She has to solve a case that unravels into a bigger game at play as the movie progresses. The intricacies entailed and the mind-boggling revelations at the bottom of it all are thrilling to experience. Nick Wilde makes the story smugger appending some classy humour to the tale. At no point does the fun stop.Animation is simply the best when you can see how much effort has been put into trivial things that we often ignore like the twitching of the nose, the feet movement, the mobile phone that shows a picture of a carrot (well played!), the reaction of them bunny ears to the noise around and every minute detail surrounding the demeanour of the movie characters. Well researched I must say, and well executed! Characters of Hopps and Wilde have been given so much thought! The anthropomorphology they score with their expressions will give you the chills. They are simply that perfect! The sloths are simply the best. Watch out for the Flash! :D",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fantastic movie for kids and adults alike!,"I got a $50.00 PlayStation gift card from my daughter for fathers day and I couldn't find any games I wanted and my grandchildren were running around screaming as usual so I bought Zootopia. Great film for both kids and adults alike. Funny, serious,a twist at the end even I didn't see coming. The grandchildren were so quiet and peaceful...this only happens when they sleep. Anyway, I highly recommend this film for ANYone with children, grandchildren and even if you're an adult who's a kid at heart, watch it. Rent it. It's a movie that just makes you smile and bond with your kids. A lot of people must have shared my opinion because it more than doubled what it cost to make.

not like any other disney film,"Pleasantly surprised what this film was about and the message behind it, with how it can relate to the real world with prejudice.

Road to Zootopia,"Set in an alternate universe without humans in which all mammals live harmoniously in cities, the world's first rabbit police officer forms an uneasy alliance with a fox to solve a mystery in this Disney animated feature film. The movie does a surprisingly good job mixing and a balancing various genres: it is part comedy, part adventure, part mystery, part fantasy, and in amongst all that it has some nifty messages to offer with the species prejudices on display coming quite close to racism in human society today. None of this is particularly subtle with the dialogue frequently spelling out the film's racial agenda, but it is thought-provoking nonetheless and the way the rabbit objects to be called cute even offers a poke at workplace sexism. Solid as the film's messages may be, the film's best achievement is how genuinely funny it is, full of audience-winking quips (""life isn't some cartoon"") and eccentric supporting characters, especially a yak voiced by Tommy Chong. The rabbit's neighbours (only heard; never seen) have some particularly amusing things to say; ""it might be worse!"" comments one of them through the wall after hearing our heroine philosophise about tomorrow like Scarlett O'Hara. And on the subject of movie references, the film features one of the best 'Godfather' spoofs of recent years too. Not all the jokes hit home (especially the final one before the end credits) and the resolution and ending feel a little rushed, but generally speaking, 'Zootopia' is entertaining from start to finish with the deeper things it has to say being merely icing on the cake.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Really good animated family movie,"This is a really, really good animated family movie. It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.Almost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.The movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.The animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.Overall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Smart and inclusive animation with a social conscience,"Yes, it's a Disney movie about talking animals. And yes, it's deservedly kicking butt at the global box office.Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a rabbit from an idyllic rural community. Her risk-evasive parents just want her to be a farmer, but Hopps has bigger ideas. She's heading to Zootropolis to chase her dream of being a cop. While on traffic duty she meets Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a sly fox skilled in the ways of the hustle. When Hopps lucks into a missing person case, she teams up with Wilde to uncover the mystery. It's bigger than they thought. Turns out predators are regressing to their aggressive primal state, frothing and speechless; and there's a cover-up which goes right to the top. Fox and bunny must work together to solve the case.The ""Zootopia"" of the (better) US title refers to Hopps' belief that the city is a place of infinite diversity and complete harmony. To quote the Hail, Caesar!: Would that it were so simple. Zootropolis is a place of tensions and prejudices between its animal citizens. One of those prejudices is carried by Hopps herself: she carries fox repellent spray wherever she goes. There's the first Big Theme of the movie: entrenched assumptions about the dangerous otherness of others.The city itself is split into clear sections – desert, ice, jungle etc – like a Super Mario Bros map. It makes for a nonsensical but utterly beautiful environment. It's populated by all manner of creatures great and small. The movie directly addresses Disney's historic fascination with anthropomorphising beasts. There's even a slightly awkward visual acknowledgement of cartoon animals' lack of genitalia.For a feature cartoon we get an unusually coherent plot, channelling some enjoyable buddy cop and detective thriller tropes. And the script delivers mercifully few ironic, immersion-breaking wisecracks.Caricatures abound, of course, but Hopps and Wilde are nicely sketched characters whose backstories of being bullied mirror each other's. They also mirror the broader social issues the film addresses.This is a timely film, what with Mr Trump sowing the seeds of fear and hatred and appealing to base rage as a release valve. Zootropolis's final manifesto is unapologetically liberal: one of finding common ground as a way of accommodating diversity. We are evolved, it says, so that we might seek an alternative to resolving difference through our most basic animal instincts. Existence precedes essence, not the other way around.Hopps gets a Big Speech at the end where she spells out the themes and moral messages of the film, just in case they went over the heads of younger viewers – or possibly adults who genuinely believe what they've seen is 'just for kids'.So, while a barrel of fun and full of jokes (many of them visual, rewarding repeated viewings), this is a surprisingly thoughtful and sober film. It has its fair share of slapstick, but isn't stuffed with interminable action sequences. We definitely don't get the Marvelisation that almost spoiled Big Hero 6 in the final act. The big and clever showdown here is resolved through the use of imagination; and imagination is the key to empathy; and empathy is the key to a tolerant society. Nice writing.Inside Out was about human consciousness. Zootropolis is all about social conscience. Maybe it doesn't hit the heights of Pixar's masterpiece, but it wouldn't look out of place in the filmography of that lauded studio. Zootropolis may be a struggle for very young ones, but it is consistently entertaining and valuable viewing for smart nippers and adults alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Nice family film,"The animation is great as expected. But the film is definitely geared more to older children and adults. My 5 year old was completely lost before we here even half way into the film and it left me plagued with questions from her about what was supposedly going on. She did however enjoy the jokes but she had picked up on most of these before seeing the film from the trailers.Am I the only person here who has picked up on all the 48 Hours and Another 48 Hours references (the old Eddie Murphy films)? I know it was an old early 1980s film that I've not seen in nearly 20 years but there were a lot of references to these two films, especially the second film. I am not 100% sure but there seemed at times to be a nod towards the Tom Hanks film Dragnet a few times too.Over all I enjoyed the film... lots of references to 1980s crime dramas and films... made me feel like I was watching an animated version of 80s cinema/TV.

Beautiful Message,"Stereotypes and judgements are something that our society has dealt with for years and still dealing with now. Many do not notice they are doing those things while they are. Zootopia adds the funny, loving, and a very important lesson all in one very creative movie. I loved every aspect of this movie. I was not drawn to this movie at first and never got to experience it in the movie theatre. Personally, I thought it was too kid dish. While babysitting my cousins I played the movie of their choice and was drawn in from the moment it started. I loved the funny aspects it adds while also teaching such an important lesson to kids. Kids need to know that no matter who or where you came from you can do anything you put ur mind to. There will be ups and downs, but you will get there eventually. It does a wonderful job showing how the bunny overcame all those aspects and still believed in herself and solved one of the most important cases in Zootopia. I will have to say that the sloth scene gets me a little. Terribly funny but terribly hard to get through without getting frustrated. This movie does so good that you are drawn in and no matter the setting you watch it in you feel like you are the part of the movie, because everyone can relate to at least one part of this movie personally.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It was pretty good,"First off let me just say the paranoid freaks talking about leftist this, Marxist that and liberal Democratic agendas are hilarious, your world must suck worst than mine! However: they're funnier, I have to point out, than most of the jokes in this film, BUT... Most of the story line in general I shrug off as unfairly simplified for children. It's a cutesy pie way to simplify our situation in America, I expect nothing less from Disney. It feels like this is a movie to be watched and then discussed with children, and with adults, just after.The anthropomorphism of the animals is both over-cooked (way overdone and nothing new) and kind of funny at times (naked yoga animals and Department of Mammal Vehicles, was it? Lol). I agree with some of the comments: its hypocritical criticism of the stereotyping of ""the other"" while blatantly regurgitating stereotypical characters is kind of annoying and not cleverly done.The obvious and surface message of acceptance is great but like others have mentioned it's ridiculous that even in animation cops can get away with anything and some characters are exempt from accountability of their ""bad"" behaviour... Then again, that's what happens in life.I've always wished Disney would begin a separate animation studio for serious adult animation. Dealing in an artistic and entertaining way with important contemporary themes in beautiful, innovative and surprising ways. If not Disney then SOMEONE! PLEASE!My weakness is animals and detailed fantasy worlds, hence the eight out of ten. One last thing, to those parents of kids that are scared of everything: if you're raising your kids scared of an animated kids film then you're doing something terribly wrong.

Hard to rate,"We enjoyed Zootopia. The story line was good, the dialog was good, there were a lot of things to laugh at, and the graphics were over the top.The only problem we had was we thought ""Zoo"" and ""Disney"" would promise a video that our six-year-old would enjoy. But this was way over his head, and he is an articulate and smart little guy.We were trying to figure out who the target audience was. It didn't seem to us that kids under 10 would get that much out of it. Ten to twenty year-olds might be bored with it. Adults would enjoy it for the reasons listed above, but in that case it would make sense for it not to be animated.This isn't the first movie we felt the same about recently.

Yes, yes it is... but.... the message is hammed in and it's such a basic message that even a child knows. Racism is bad, don't judge people on racial stereotypes. It's a good message and the movie does deliver it in a clever way, but it could have been better, the children in the theater were getting bored and antsy mid way through which is never a good sign for a movie aimed at kids (marketing wise)To me this felt more like a movie aimed at adults but because of the Disney name had to wear kid friendly camouflage.Give it a go but expect to like it more then your kids will.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An Embarrassing Example of What a Movie Should Not be,"Disney does not make movies for children anymore. They make movies for adults now with some of the most repulsive undertones in them (such as into the woods, for example). This movie is embarrassing and unnecessarily crude. Disney is starting to make animated films that are not appropriate for children. The whole ""nudist"" thing was disgusting. For your information Disney I have the right to judge whoever I want, and that includes people who think it is okay to run around naked. I will not be taking my children to this insulting adult film. It's amazing how far Disney has fallen. The cartoon Robin Hood from 1973 was a story about furies and it was perfectly decent, but this film is just awful. Sure the animation is great, some of the characters are cute and humorous, but as far as the story goes it is rehashed from several things, including the Godfather. I'm tired of Disney making their animated films for adults and not children. This movie, along with The Good Dinosaur, are just the animation flops this year. I can't understand why Disney has such trouble making good animated films (Inside Out was good but the other Disney animations this year were terrible). Stop trying to be a world politician Disney, by forcing your opinions on everyone else and attempting to brainwash children by placing these opinions in movies that are supposed to be for children. I can only hope that the live-action Jungle Book and Finding Dory and Moana will be better, but I seriously doubt they will.If you like furies then you might have fun with this film, but seriously I thought the movie was overly crude.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The funniest and most relevant animated feature in years!,"""Zootopia"" (for some reason known as ""Zootropolis"" in Europe) is a Disney computer animated film that takes place in a mammalian utopia in which all its animals, predatory and non-predatory, live together peacefully.A sophisticated merging of utopian science fiction with a gumshoe detective story, this relates the unlikely partnership between a pint-sized rabbit police officer and a red fox con artist as they uncover a conspiracy involving disappearing animals. It's also a hilarious movie, maybe even more so to adults than children, with one sequence that could be considered the funniest sequence ever put in an animated film. (Those who've seen ""Zootopia"" know what I'm talking about.)This has everything a great animated feature could have: intriguing plot, adorable characters, uproarious comedy, emotional resonances, and a moralistic theme. And some of the best animation ever seen in a cartoon feature. Voiced by Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons and Octavia Spencer, with Ginnifer Goodman perfect as the voice of the rabbit cop Judy Hopps, this is Disney's 55th animated feature, and an indubitable masterpiece in the art of animation. Cartoon enthusiast or not, this is required viewing for every movie lover.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A very refreshing movie which brings in something brand new from Disney,"Zootopia promises to entertain you right from the beginning till the end. This is probably one of those rare times when Disney has taken a shot on suspense and it has done brilliantly well on it.Story (10/10): Full marks to the story which is probably the most profound story I have seen after Inside Out. Zootopia talks about the struggles of the only bunny cop - Judy Hopps - town has, and the challenges she faces while performing her duties due to various stereotypes. It is very hard to stay put against the disgust and bullying of everyone, which is beautifully depicted through Judy Hopps characterization. The writer has created a complete contrast character, Nick Wilde, a fox, who gives up against those same stereotypes. He, ironically, helps her in solving the case involving mysterious turn of events in the city. The story has very interesting twists and turns almost every now and then which keeps you wondering what will happen next. The other characters like Chief Bogo, Bellweather, Bonnie and Stu Hopps are very well conceptualized where they all are bound by their preconceived notions, ambitions and greed that pretty much is a microcosm of what Zootopia town has been.Animation (8/10): The level of animation has been good. The creativity that went behind projecting the city and its various facets is outstanding. Although Hollywood has moved slightly ahead but Zootopia stay puts.Direction (9/10): The trio of Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush have done a great job in keeping the story moving and bringing in twists and turns all the time which keeps the audience glued to their seats. Bringing in Shakira for the song, ""Try Everything"" and the novelty in the end credits is simply brilliant.Overall (9/10): Overall, it is a very refreshing movie which brings in something brand new from Disney.

Fun despite being somewhat contrived and moralising,"Clever, albeit preachy, 'Can't we all get along/you can be anything you want to be' parable from Disney. This is essentially a 'meet cute', buddy-cop movie starring a rabbit and a fox. There are endless throwaway jokes (I personally liked Bunnyburrow's rapidly increasing population sign), and animal themed puns and word play. The imagery is great with a lot of clever sight gags, again riffing on the 'anthropomorphic animal' theme (the sloths at the DMV was inspired). Not the best (IMO) of the recent crop of animated films but, well made, fun, and watchable (if you don't object to being repeatedly hit over the head with a 'message').",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
This movie is pure gold,"This movie was absolutely amazing. Everything about it was so perfect. I love how this movie is something that adults can enjoy and appreciate -- it's not just some superficial kids cartoon, it's genuinely deep and intricate. Something I love so much above everything else that was amazing about this film is the moral that relates so much to what's going on in the world now, but is also universal. The moral of this film is unity, acceptance, tolerance, anti-racism, anti-sexism, doing what is right, resilience, respect, challenging assumptions, persistence, equality, and that we are all ultimately the same and are one. This movie was beyond anything I'd imagined it to be. I had heard some great stuff about it and decided to watch it and I'm so glad I did. Kids will have fun watching this movie and learn valuable morals. Adults, on the other hand, will immensely enjoy watching this movie, will appreciate it for what it truly is and will understand its real meaning.

The best in the TTT era of Disney,"Long ago, that is long ago in movie making calendars, in the year 2007, they made a lovely witty film in the Disney Studios. It was called Enchanted, and it had a brand new concept at its base. It had the normal Disney conventions turned upside-down. It was fresh and charming and it gave the entire Disney universe a brand new attitude. I really loved it, I still find Enchanted to be one of the best ever made by the studios. But than, somebody important fell in love with this novel approach to the world, they also realized they could now remake every film they ever made with this new attitude, that meant a whole lot of new scripts written with the same twist in the plot and the TTT era was born. TTT - namely Turned Tables Trend. Thus came into the world The Princess and the Frog, Frozen, Tangled, Alice in Wonderland and many more. Many of these were real nice movies, but they all have the idea of retelling the story in a new, more modern way. Where, neither good nor evil will be exactly what we thought it would be. Like all ideas, it wasn't good or bad as is, it was a new idea - for the Disney Studios, it meant, in a manner of speaking that they did arrive into our modern world. But sometimes it became all consuming. That's how bad movies such as Maleficent and Into the Woods were born, when the idea of twisting the plot became everything and nothing else was important.Now all that was mostly about the history of recent cinema, but I'm both a history buff and a cinema buff, so I do apologize for the digression. All I wanted to say, that for me, this is the best movie made by Disney since that trend took over. It's the best because while this concept is still there, it doesn't control the movie - the story does. It does mean that the end is not so very unpredictable, but I don't mind that all that much. It's a very good story, great voice acting, wonderful jokes. I just love it. But please Disney - try something new, every now and again, how about something old fashion just for the novelty of the idea.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Don't miss it,"I know I'm writing a late review for this. I came to know about this movie when everyone is telling me ""Zootopia is such a great movie"". Finally with lot of recommendations I have watched it with high expectations and it has reached to my level of expectations. One word I can say, it is truly a 'Masterpiece', Walt Disney Animation Studios just nailed it after their successful venture Big Hero 6, couple of years ago. This is 55th Animated feature film from their classic animated series of films. Unlike other animated films, Zootopia has a perfect mystery plot with a message added to it. In fact if you take the story with out any animation, it has really good potential. Clearly we can say that it is an perfect commercial action-mystery oriented script with heavy animation touch. Graphics, Dubbing & Cinematography were undoubtedly top-notch. Zootopia on the surface, beneath the surface, and everywhere in between is essentially flawless. Through its importance with a riveting plot & eye-candy graphics, Zootopia will stand as one of the best works of animation for this entire decade.

fun with nice message,"The animals have evolved and live together. Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) wants to be a policeman rather than a carrot farmer like every other rabbit. She becomes the first rabbit police officer in the metropolitan city of Zootopia. Chief Bogo dismisses the rookie and makes her a meter maid. She encounters hustler fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). A few predator animals have gone missing and Judy jumps on the case of a missing otter. With no support from the police force, she coerces Nick to help.This world is wonderful. I love the various climates in the city and the different sizes of animals coexisting. The central message of trying is nice. The sloths at the DMV are hilarious. When the predators get shunned, the movie takes it to another level. The fear and message of tolerance is compelling and very timely. The characters are fun and the story is engaging.

Fun for the whole family.,"""Life's little bit messy. We all make mistakes. No matter what type of animal you are, change starts with you."" Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin)In the land of Zootopia, where all anthropomorphic animals are ostensibly equal, little bunny Judy aspires to be a cop. And she makes it. And she learns her idealism of making a difference is a messy business, like life itself. While this 'toon is clever by any measure, it goes for the heart of living by emphasizing the humanity of endeavors rather than visual techniques (although there's plenty of that).Although our political language is laced with the need for diversity, Zootopia actually shows young people in an allegorical adventure that all species, all races, all kinds of people can prosper together given the right motivation. It is still messy, but it is possible that animals (people), predators and prey, can exist in harmony with a little motivation.The conflict that anchors this exciting actioner is that some previously docile predators have become savage. Officer Hopps, with the help of a sly fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), traces the source of the change to a plant that could only be likened to heroin (not Cannabis, which has been lionized so to speak recently). The thrill of the chase is trumped by the witty dialogue, almost screwball comedy quick (e.g., the answer to ""What do you call a three humped camel?"" while not quick and brilliant, is an amusing example of the pervasively comic tone).The slowest sequence may be the funniest: The two ""detectives"" end up at the Zootopia DMV, run by all sloths. About his friend, Nick says, ""Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast?"" Well, nobody's fast at this bureau, including the jokes, which depend on the sloths' glacial reactions.

And eventually, the movie's energy (embodied by Ginnifer Goodwin) peters out. Now that I think about it, the movie could've done with more of her and less of Jason Bateman.That said, it does start out pretty well.

Painfully Didactic & Political,"A great example of how didactism bores rather than inspires, regurgitates rather than re-imagines. There's a clear political message, and the unabashed way which it is presented won't change any minds, but at the least may spark political debate. Though its singular treatment preaching the current ""hip"" left-wing social platforms without nuance does nothing to elucidate any new ideas or attempt to shed new truths on issues that allow people to re-evaluate their current ideological stances. As such, its effect is similar to that of the person talking politics at the cocktail party who relies on volume rather than substance in order to bolster their (or more accurately their party's) talking points.All in all, though there are some witty scenes and stereotypical romance & coming of age story lines, the overpowering pedantic verbal diarrhea exposes it as a thinly veiled political commercial rather than a great piece of art.

 Zootopia is a city where any kinds of animals can live together in peace. There might be a city or country modeled for creating the story. As for me, I thought of New York or Vancouver, where people with various background come together. However, people are not always happy when different ethnic groups meet. This is true in reality, and this is a problem that the protagonist, Judy, and her friend, Nick, face in the film.

Zootopia review.,"What a wonderfully delightful movie. Some of the the best characters I've seen in a movie and so funny. The sloths are hilarious. Zootopia is going to smash the holiday box office open as it is intelligent and fun the whole way through. The big thing to consider for this movie is whether it is suitable for young children. I had already read some reviews that were saying 5 and 6 years olds may find some scenes scary. And that could be true. I didn't think the boo scenes were that startling, there is really only one jump moment in the whole thing that made everyone leap out of their seats. The part I found most intense was the language. It is not swearing but the characters are rather forceful with their words. If you are uncomfortable with characters aggressively scratching or pushing each other while they say things like ""you jerk, shut up"", then this movie may be too old for your child. The one thing I can say without reserve is that all adults should go see it. You will love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Zootopia,"Zootopia is one of the best animated films to come out in the past decade. Its funny, charming, thought provoking, heartwarming and delightful. The animation is spectacular and the voice acting is stop notch. I absolutely adore the characters, Nick and Judy might be the best Disney duo of all time and I love Jason Bateman and Jennifer Goodwin. It was really refreshing to see a crime mystery storyline in a Disney film and its done well, I was genuinely invested in the mystery and the twist villain actually worked for me here because I didn't see it coming. The film is hilarious with genuinely funny jokes and funny character interactions. The films take on prejudice and stereotypes is brilliant and it delivers the message of accepting people for who they are extremely well without feeling heavy handed. I really think Zootopia is a film for all aged and there isn't much I don't love about the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Not my favorite animated film, but I enjoyed it.","I love animation films. This is not exception. From the great animation to the good plot and storytelling, I loved this film. It sends a very strong message of not giving up on your dreams, and not to allow bullying to get you down.This was a great mystery adventure, with action and suspense.

Zootropolis,"Bunny rabbit ""Judy"" is determined that she is going to be the first of her kind to make it into the ranks of the ""Zootropolis"" police force. Her boss, ""Bogo"" is not so enthusiastic, so it's lucky that an otter has gone missing and that she can promise his wife that she will track him down! As she delves deeper into the mystery, she encounters the street-smart fox ""Nick"" and together they gradually uncover a plot to turn the city's predator population into dangerous menaces and that that scheming runs all the way to City Hall! It's now up to these two to put aside their mutual suspicions and work together if they are to thwart this dastardly plan! The story itself, here, isn't really anything new - but along the way some effort has been made to create some fun characterisations. Not least the painfully slow sloth doing the vehicle checks, the sheepish assistant mayor ""Bellweather"" as well as just about every beast from jungle and pasture alike. The script is often quite funny allowing the partnership to evolve at quite an entertaining pace and there are plenty of escapades en route to the slightly left-field denouement... Unlike many of it's Disney contemporaries, there has been investment in a solid story and it comes across well in this enjoyable and characterful family drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Safe, slightly heartwarming, and pretty funny. Closer to Shrek and Madagascar than it is to any Disney classics.","This movie is really disappointing to me. I've seen some of Disney's best, and this isn't it -- but it easily could have been. When I saw Zootopia's teaser trailer months ago before ""Inside Out"", it looked like a solid premise: ""animals live like people but retain some of their wild traits"". It doesn't take an amazing premise to make an amazing movie. ""Frozen"" and ""The Lion King"" are awesome movies not because of the setup for their story, but because of how the story is told. They feel like care was put into their world.Zootopia takes a lazier, more adult approach to creativity. You can see this same problem in ""The Lego Movie"", most kids' movies, and many episodes of ""Family Guy"". The laziest humor you can have is referential humor, and Zootopia's references cheapen the clever jokes it also has. Given this animal world, there's room for a lot of funny jokes and puns based on traits audiences are familiar with. One that Disney gets a lot of mileage out of is how many offspring rabbits tend to create (the main character has around 180 siblings). And those jokes are really funny because they only make sense in the world of Zootopia.It's a lot lazier to make an iPhone, make it look like an iPhone, and change the Apple logo to a carrot logo. On another phone, we see a photos app whose interface and logo look a lot like Google Photos. In ""Toy Story 3"", there's a ripoff of a Macbook, and it *enhances* the story - these are real toys in the real human world, interacting with a real brand of computers. What is so exciting about Zootopia is it gives its writers and animators a chance to make its own unique world. Any relationship with the human world should serve a logical purpose within the animal world as well. Otherwise, it's like the animal world of Zootopia doesn't even exist. (This is done well, for example, when a train car has three sets of doors, for big, medium, and small animal). ""Wreck-It Ralph"" puts more care into its world than Zootopia does.There's an extended reference to ""The Godfather"" which has lots of references and not much original humor. It's disappointing to have boring references like this alongside creative, funny jokes that build off of Zootopia's world. I laughed a lot at the lame costumes at a school play in the film.Perhaps the most tasteless joke in the entire movie is that lemmings follow each other. They don't, and they never have. This myth was created BY Disney in the 1950s. Not only is it weird to have fake animal behaviors in a movie seemingly obsessed with cataloging real ones, it's insulting to be reminded of Disney's past animal abuse. There are animals that move in herds, and a joke that bison or sheep all scrambled in a herd to buy a ""pawpsicle"" is not much of a stretch from the existing joke.Like its comedy, the rest of Zootopia is uneven. Jason Bateman puts in a great performance as a mischievous fox. He channels the conniving behavior his ""Arrested Development"" character had in that show's final season. The animation is rarely jawdropping. Dreamworks or Sony could have animated this movie, and very little would be different. Even the fur of the animals doesn't look that fluffy or fun, except in rare scenes. I was more blown away by ""Frozen"", and that was over two years ago. ""Frozen"" had incredible bright lighting, shimmering water reflections, and sparkly snow and ice. In Zootopia, there's a good montage of all the climates its city has to offer. Also, there is an ""Avatar""-style serene misty floaty jungle type of place, but other than that, it's a pretty normal city with a fairly normal visual style.The story kept me interested in the movie but is not one I want to go back to. A rabbit cop is tasked with solving the disappearance of an otter. There's some interesting, yet obvious subtext that is expressed reasonably well. It's relevant in the era of Donald Trump, but says little that hasn't been said in countless other movies. When movies like ""Frozen"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" have an average story, they can fall back on their incredible visuals and thrilling music. Zootopia has no traditional musical numbers, and the vocal song that plays through the rabbit's phone early in the film isn't nearly as catchy as ""Under the Sea"", nor is it as rich with meaning as ""Let It Go"". I like its message, saying that trying new things and making mistakes is an important part of life, but didn't find it as engaging as some pop hits like ""Raise Your Glass"". The instrumental soundtrack (from the composer for ""Inside Out"" and ""The Incredibles"") was more up my alley. I specifically noticed how cool ""Ticket to Write"" was - it has a laid-back, tropical vibe.Good animal stories can be told. Disney made The Lion King. Other companies made ""Cats Don't Dance"", ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", and ""Finding Nemo"". The TV show ""Polar Bear's Cafe"" has inventive animal comedy. What saddens me with Zootopia is that you get bits of cynicism, that the filmmakers are so above it all. ""We didn't make our own Google logo because we didn't have to"". ""We copied human sensibilities for pop stars because that's what people recognize"". The implication is that kids are too stupid to know the difference between attention to detail and sloppiness, and the cynicism and references to real life are there to keep parents from wanting to leave the theater. As if a well-made movie with an easy-to-follow story is something that no adult would want to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

One of Disney's most political movies I've ever seen.,"Zootopia was another great Disney film, and the better of the few that they've made in the past decade. Yes, Disney and Pixar are two DIFFERENT entities. So to conclude, I decide to give Zootopia a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. The film had fantastic characters, animation, and adult (semi) references, but its lack of clarification on its exposition, and forced relationship issues just bogged down the movie a little too much, to the point where I felt the need to dock the movie for those issues. In the end Zootopia is one of Disney's most political movies I've ever seen, but the use of fluffy little animals still doesn't give it enough momentum to make a change in the real world. It does make for a good kids movie, though.Read more at theVade.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

But my 6 year old burst into tears - way way too much violence, fright scenes and explosive action scenes for a Disney Movie, even with parental guidance. I think its very sad that children movie makers feel the need to get children's hearts racing, just to keep them entertained. It was very over-stimulating for my 6 year old. The story plot was good enough without the need for all the over the top action scenes. It was the same as an adult action movie but with animals instead of 'stallone'.

An Animal Metropolis for All,"The new Disney Animation generation is still on a hot streak, thanks to the success and acclaim of their past, recent hits, Frozen and Big Hero 6. Their latest entry, Zootopia, gives a good omen that the studio is keeping Walt's vision alive to make great animated films like this.Fresh from her home in Bunnyburrow, bunny Judy Hopps (voiced by Gennifer Goodwin from ABC's Once Upon a Time) arrives in Zootopia, a place where prey and predator both live in peace and harmony. Judy is there because she's fulfilling her lifelong dream of being a police officer for the Zootopia Police Department and trying to ""make a world a better place"". The good news: She's the first rabbit cop on the force. The bad news: She's assigned to parking duty.On the job, she then meets Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), a fox and a con artist. They don't get along at first, but soon they decide to team up to take on a case involving some missing mammals. It leads them to places such as a nudist spa, a arctic shrew mob boss' home and the DMV controlled by some sloths (in one of the most funniest scenes I've seen on the big screen in quite a while) to get clues in a period of 48 hours to crack the case.This thoughtful and very funny film is good at the start. But, it gets more poignant and meaningful midway through. The missing mammals plot even has a twist at the climax that is worth a shocker for the audience.The animation is simply splendid. Even the look of the city from its skyline to the areas surrounding the place looks lavishing. Kudos must go to directors Bryon Howard and Rich Moore. There's even homages to The Godfather and Breaking Bad and in-jokes to the past Disney films already mentioned in this review.The voice cast, especially Bateman and Goodwin, are excellent. Other notables in the cast include Idris Elba as Judy's police buffalo chief, J.K. Simmons as the town's lion mayor, Pixar vet Bonnie Hunt (A Bug's Life, Cars) as Judy's mom and Saturday Night Live alum Jenny Slate as the sheep assistant mayor.The film sends home a message that no matter who you are and what you are, we're all in this planet together to make it a ""better place"".Until Pixar's Finding Dory arrives in June, Zootopia is currently in the top ranking for the year's best animated film. Take anyone you know to see it. And if the movie theater allows, take your pet too.Rating:***1/2Parent Advisory: Zootopia is rated PG for some thematic humor, rude humor and action.

This is nothing like any other Disney animated movie at all,"I'm sure many people saw this as just another CG animal movie, and moved on. This is nothing like any other Disney animated movie at all. It doesn't follow the ""rules"" as we know them. It's fantastic, and should be seen by a much broader audience, including adults. Heck, I'd say a lot of what is going on here is actually aimed at the older audience. This movie has a lot to say about society and culture, and how anyone who dares to be different is treated. 
The animation itself is incredible. Super colorful, with many varied environments. CG animation has truly reached a point of super smooth perfection, and I can't see it getting much better than this.
The story makes this pretty unique over so many other CG animated movies. This is pretty much a detective story. A caper. Crimes are happening, and they need to be solved.

Entertaining enough for all ages,"Zootopia is an easy movie to describe. That's neither a compliment nor a criticism, but for the most part this is a pretty straight forward movie. It's about an underdog who rises up to the top (after facing many difficulties, of course); we follow this underdog - Hopper - as she investigates the case of a missing person - a case which get larger and larger as the movie goes on. It follows a very standard formula (the storytelling technique is nothing more than the cop finds the first clue, which leads to second clue, which leads to third clue, etc, until eventually they find the big bad villain). It probably sounds familiar as this is the basic storyline to most detective movies, especially animated ones. But instead of conforming to complete conventionality as you might it would, Zootopia boosts itself by adding in some refreshingly new ideas for such a movie. It's a movie with a valuable message laid out throughout, about not stereotyping or labelling people, and looking past outward appearances. Although it debatable gets a little too preachy at times, you still have to commend the movie for trying to teach the younger end of the audience a very valuable lesson.The movie never quite hits any of those belly-laugh moments that you often find in a Pixar movie (although one particular scene with a sloth is hilarious), but the humour is good enough to keep older audiences entertained, although most of the humour would certainly work better with a child.

"A fast, fun and memorable animated tale","One of the most recent additions to the billion dollar box office club, it's safe to say Disney would be quite happy with the performance of their animated hit Zootopia.A film filled to the brim with colour, life and a pace that barely allows you to question the ethics behind an animated film having references to Uber, Breaking Bad and religion (not to mention a nudist club), Bryon Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush's film is an animated tale perfectly suited to today's climate of acceptance and feminist driven protagonists and with its skewering to those a little older than the average Disney target, Zootopia is thankfully a film adults can find themselves enjoying while the rugrats take in the sights and sounds of a world run by animals of all shapes and sizes.Zootopia begins in a seemingly run of the mill fashion as determined little bunny Judy Hopps (voiced with energy by Ginnifer Goodwin) decides she's going to shun her carrot loving heritage to become a police officer, but Zootopia quickly morphs into a fairly intriguing mystery as Judy finds herself teaming up with the on face value dastardly fox Nick Wilde (voiced to perfection by Jason Bateman) to solve the disappearance of a raft of animals from the city. It's nice to have an animated film steer away from the overused hero's v villains stereotypes that have infested the animated staples of recent years and while the film reverts back to a sadly rather generic finale, Zootopia has done enough in the lead up that we don't really mind to much at all.Perhaps slightly undeserving of some of the high praise it received upon release at years start, Zootopia is still undoubtedly a whole lot of fun for the whole family even though some of the younger members of the clan may not exactly get what on earth is going on at times. With efforts like these it's even likely that one day soon the Disney animated staple may in fact overtake their Pixar branches title as king of the CGI world.3 ½ Godfather rats out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Lovely looking animation - just don't read into it too much.,"This 2016 Walt Disney computer animated film is the 55th Animated Disney feature. It has a rating of PG making it suitable for any age group, and it has a runtime of 108 minutes. Depending where you live geographically you may know this film as ""Zootopia"" or ""Zootropolis"". Directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore (with co-direction by Jared Bush), this is a buddy cop movie in a world where anthropomorphic animals co-exist.Judy Hopps becomes the first rabbit police officer to graduate to the Zootropolis Police department, during her first assignment she gets hustled by minor con-artist fox duo Nick Wilde (red fox) and Finnick (Fennec Fox). Her boss, Chief Bogo is ready to fire her when she takes on an impossible case; to find and recover Emmitt Otterton and thirteen other animals who have gone missing. She enlists Nick Wilde in the investigation as he may have been one of the last animals to see Mr Otterton. The investigation takes the two on a journey of discovery, about themselves, and the coexistence of animals in Zootropolis, and about who holds the power and what they are doing with it.This is a fun and enjoyable Disney film which ticks all the feelgood boxes that Disney films regularly This is a fun and enjoyable Disney film which ticks all the feelgood boxes that Disney films regularly tick. It is colourful and engaging, while having a story which can be followed by all. It is not too complicated that younger audiences cannot appreciate the fun of what's going on; and it's not too simple that an older audience can't be entertained by the complexities of the buddy cop plot. Among all the professionally written and delivered characters on show there were plenty of gags and homages to other films, take Mr Big for example, the Marlon Brando style ""Godfather"". There were also some cleverly transposed animals in positions you could easily imagine them; for example, a Lion being the major/leader of the pack or Flash the Sloth in a government position where everything happens slowly. While commenting on this I must also point out, as good as it is visually and as good as some of the characters are perceived - if you read into the film from a morality point of view (which a lot of people do), then you will find a bit of a mess here too. For example, there is a lot of virtue-signalling and morality being suggested in this film, which then goes on to make some of the delivery that is occurred a little hypocritical. There are veiled discussion of racism, sexism, and xenophobia on show, which then get easily dismissed for the purpose of happy closure in the feature. Historically Disney does not have the best track record when it comes to morals and isms in its features and unfortunately this does have its issues too. Rather than focus on those failings and commentate on how this makes Disney hypocritical of its chequered past I am going to sidestep them and just focus on the film. It is fun, it is colourful, the voice acting is good, and it kept me entertaining for the runtime. I do not regret watching it and heck, when I put my 4-year-old cousin in front of this he loved it too and never took his eyes off it. That is what this film should be judged on, and not judging and over-analysing it. At his age I was the same too, it was colourful and entertaining. So, as a spectacle and vehicle to pass time it is good, great in fact. It is pretty, it is entertaining, it has giggles, and it has fun and occasionally cute animals that are voiced wonderfully. Therefore, it is a film I am happy to recommend to audiences young and old. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Wild for Zootopia,"Maintaining a creepy mustache is a lifestyle choice. One of the unfortunate consequences of said lifestyle choice is being forced to feel awkward whenever you go see a children's movie, alone, in a dark theatre, filled to the brim with excited youths. Zootopia makes almost all of that awkwardness worth the trip.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is an ambitious, young bunny, looking to prove herself as the first rabbit police officer in the bustling metropolis of Zootopia. Seen as little more than meek prey by her coworkers, peers, and even her family, she must learn to overcome these prejudices, and work with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a cunning fox, to crack an impenetrable case.From Disney, you'd expect nothing less than top notch animation, and Zootopia undoubtedly delivers on that front. The colors are vibrant, playful, and inviting, as we move from dense, jungle rainforests, to blisteringly icy tundras, to urban cityscapes. The lighting, especially, is awe inspiring, specifically during Mr. Big's (Maurice LaMarche) daughter's wedding. It makes the entire sequence feel ethereal, if not like an altogether blatant homage to The Godfather.The voice acting, too, is excellent. Idris Elba is an intimidating presence as Chief Bogo, and Ginnifer Goodwin is totally endearing and lovable in a role that could have, in lesser hands, devolved into something saccharine and obnoxious. The real standout, however, is Jason Bateman, who consistently reminds me how he is one of the most versatile and underrated workhorses in Hollywood. He delivers a brassy, jaded performance, that is somehow imbued with the charisma and charm of a young Robert Redford. Bateman's Nick Wilde is a total dick, but goddamn it if I don't love that dick.As it claws tenaciously at greatness, Zootopia is tethered to the realm of merely good Disney films by its script. Sure, there are a handful of legitimately funny jokes (and one bizarrely out of place Breaking Bad reference) peppered in for some strong laughs, but the plot is generally predictable, and sticks to tried and true Disney formula. If that formula were perfectly executed, then all would be forgiven, but a sloppy, rushed third act, and an unbearably heavy-handed message that is handled with all of the nuance and discreetness with which crocodile might attack its prey, really hamper the film. It is almost cringe inducing at times, yet a slightly longer running time, and a little dialogue revision would have done the film a world of good.Don't let me scare you off, though. Zootopia is a fine film that definitely earns your money. Whether you're a parent looking for a cheap diversion that'll entertain you and your kids, or a student looking for a harmless, inoffensive flick to watch after midterms, you could do far worse.

Disney Animation's Best In A Long Time,"There's no denying that Disney Animation Studios' output in current years has been hit or miss, with Disney's best animated features being those helmed by Pixar. I am happy to report that Zootopia can stand toe-to-toe with most of Pixar's films. It starts with a great script. This script is funny, very funny. But it is also relatable, heartfelt and timely. There has been much discussion and praise of the films messages of embracing diversity and not giving up on one's dreams. While that latter message is a common theme in most family fare, the points the film makes about diversity couldn't be coming along at a better time. Many of us watch the news and see the stories of unarmed minorities being harmed or killed by police officers, or protests over the Oscars' lack of nominee diversity, and we realize there is truth and relevance to many of these issues. But how often do we stop to think about how our kids are responding to these things? They often watch, read and hear the same news we do. The main theme of Zootopia is not judging others based on their ""species"" and avoiding common misconceptions and stereotypes about anyone who may not come from the same origins you do. Admittedly, the movie beats this point more than a dirty rug (a skunk-butt-rug perhaps? You'll see.). But it doesn't interfere at all with the movie's enjoyment factor. Aside from an extremely witty script, we have a well-cast group of actors bringing life to a plethora of unique new characters. In the lead is Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, Zootopia's first bunny cop. One thing that set Disney's classics apart was their creation of unique and memorable characters. Think Genie from Aladdin, Dopey from Snow White, the White Rabbit from Alice In Wonderland or Timon & Pumba from The Lion King-characters that have thrived in the pop culture ether long after their movies' releases. Judy Hopps is one of Disney's best new characters in years and she deserves to be every bit as memorable as those others I mentioned. She could have thrived on the cute factor alone, but she is much more three-dimensional than that. She has experienced real bullying and prejudice in her life but insists on enduring through whatever others throw at her so she can become a cop and ""make the world a better place"". She's clever, funny and even a little flawed, making her easy to connect with and root for. Jason Bateman costars as the sly fox Nick Wilde, who must learn throughout the film to look past his cynical view of the world and his own selfish attitude. As a Jason Bateman fan, I was glad to see him lending his famously sarcastic tone to this project. In his character's first few scenes I wasn't sure he was the right fit, but once Wilde and Hopps partner up, his range kicks in as his character faces a new emotional journey. The supporting cast includes Idris Elba, Bonnie Hunt, Tommy Chong, J.K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Maurice Lamarche, Jenny Slate and Shakira as a pop star named Gazelle who treats us to a fun concert during the end credits. Nate Terrance gets one of the film's best supporting roles as Clawhauser, the police department's front desk officer-a fat, goofy, over-the-top, donut-loving cheetah. He and Judy get one of the best scenes in the movie when he uses a certain word to describe her and she responds with a friendly ""only bunnies can use that word"" attitude. It is obvious what real world scenario this scene is mirroring, and it is a very clever part of the movie's diversity message. All these characters are part of the movie's great mystery-why has there been a disappearance of multiple mammals, and why, in an evolved society where all animals live in supposed harmony, are some animals turning ""savage"" and attacking others? I certainly won't spoil it here; and while the big reveal may be a tad predictable, it fits the film well. The pacing is near perfect, never does the movie feel like it's dragging or rushed. The sloths at the DMV scene featured in the film's second trailer is probably the funniest scene in the movie. However, there is a little more to it and even though I had already seen it multiple times, it still brought me to tears laughing in the theater. Thankfully, there's plenty more great lines and gags throughout to keep the laughs coming. Obviously, with any animated feature, the quality of the animation is an important factor. Zootopia looks great. It may not be jaw-dropping like The Good Dinosaur, but all the images are well drawn and crisply rendered. There is also nice attention to detail throughout-little things like the carrots on Bonnie Hopps' skirt, Judy's activity tracker watch, and Mrs. Otterton's thread-pilling sweater. Characters' fur looks to stand out and flow naturally. It is clear directors Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush and their animation team set out to make a visually satisfying movie experience that doesn't skimp on animation quality. Disney should be proud of their latest effort. Zootopia works well not just as a animated movie or family film-but just as a good movie period. I certainly wouldn't oppose going to see it again. It works on multiple levels and should be appealing to the whole family. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"I was expecting another Plains, I got an excellent film","I see the publicity in supermarkets and I think to myself this must be another Plains with the race background scraped and a cops and robbers theme pasted over. This film is nothing like that. It has a well developed story, characters that have their own personalities, although some of the smaller roles are filled by stock characters. And the best of it: the main characters do evolve. Overall the film is fun, although there are some tense moments that might scare younger children.I discovered only after the film how long it is, but at no moment I felt the need to check how long till the end, which is not easy predictable as most Disney productions. Sure, there is a happy end so the end is not that hard to guess.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Full of imagination,"This animated movie can be appreciated both by children and grown-ups. It shows a cast of anthropomorphic animals living in a big town who are shaped and conceived like humans also in behaviour, virtues and vices. Their facial expressions and body movements are truly human and very varied. Their conception is full of imagination and originality. The story is very human also, simultaneously funny and thrilling: a conspiracy that tries to convince the town inhabitants that a biological change has occurred in predators till then peaceful making them again wild and dangerous. This conspiracy is investigated by the strange pair of a sly fox and a zealous rabbit police girl which results in some funny episodes. An enjoyable movie to spend a couple of hours watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Vibrantly humorous and infectiously uplifting, ""Zootopia"" is the quintessential Disney's animation and a surprisingly good crime drama.","After the tale of two princesses in wintry landscape, action sci-fi with cuddly robot, and now enchanting buddy cop movie with bunny and fox, I will never doubt Disney again. There's something legitimate magical there, as it never fails to bring an ageless spectacle of witty humor, great visual and charming characters. ""Zootopia"" is not only a nice story with social commentary, it's also a detective, dare I say, thriller, which is unexpectedly crazy and brilliant.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a spirited bunny with one goal in mind; to become a cop, despite whatever her size and other might tell her. Her chirpy nature makes it near impossible not to cheer for her, and this might be the most delightful bunny in decades not named Bugs. Her peculiar partner in crime is Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) who is a con man with possible golden heart hidden inside his shifty golden fur. He's a contrast to Judy, a more realistic type and using sly wit to overcome striking prejudice.These two have excellent chemistry, in a crime thriller style no less. Disney is well known to incorporate action nowadays, but full-fledged detective work, it's mental that this works tremendously well. The pacing moves in haste, and still giving enough hints for the noir to move nicely and the audience to follow it closely. The atmosphere can be dark at several occasions to create dread, yet never too overwhelming for its family friendly nature.Visual is good as expected, it's a nice set-up for animal kingdoms, in the urban environment. There are multiple references for pop and modern culture, in fact some of the jokes come in form of familiar daily life routines. The other bulk is in the expense of Judy as she hits speed bump along the way to accomplish her dream. Still, what could be somber tone is delivered with delectably mocking tone.This is also a forum to delicately show social values without being too heavy-handed. The movie tries to present this serious element and fortunately, it benefits from the mild colorful production to deliver the message in friendly and approachable way. It has the captivating city vista from Big Hero 6, nifty little homage just like Wreck-It Ralph and even better cop drama the last Die Hard movie. The way it balanced everything together is nothing short of amazing.The streets of ""Zootopia"" offers light amusement, great humor, glossy noir theme and adorably inspirational characters in every scene. In the risk of being utterly corny, Judy and company will hop into your, old or young, heart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A story of overcoming prejudice,"This movie has not only just funny and exciting but also social messages. Although Disney has expressed stereotypes (ex: foxes are wily, lions are kings) a lot of times in most Disney movies, this movie shed light on such prejudice or discrimination. Prejudice in this movies can be compared to racial discrimination in real world. Bunny cop and a buddy fox overcome such a prejudice and discrimination as well as incidents. I wonder who becomes hopps (the bunny cop) in real world.If this movie was not an animation, it brought us gloomy and depressed impression in the end.All the Disney movies, especially recent ones make us consider social problems. I love Disney the better after I watched this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Truly a film for everyone,"When it comes to being a parent, part of the deal is to watch kids' films. Sometimes this can be a painful experience - let's just say that my kids and I differ radically in our assessment of Alvin and the $*&^£!*ing Chipmunks. On other occasions, however, the experience can be joyful. I went into this film with low expectations, and unexpectedly had a ball. I honestly found it laugh-out-loud funny, and so did my kids. Moreover, we often laughed at the same scene for different reasons. My kids have never seen the Godfather, for instance, and neither have they (yet) had to deal with a government department whose speed of service would be improved by replacing everyone with sloths - but there were elements in these scenes which worked for them as well as the bits that worked for me. It is very difficult to produce a film that really is for everybody, but this is one of the very best.To be sure, the ""moral lesson"" is clichéd and obvious, many of the characters were simple stereotypes, and the plot twists were more than a little predictable. Such things matter little to kids, however; and I can live with them when things are handled with zest and panache. The action is fast-paced, the acting first-class, the animation state-of-the-art - and the sight-gags are both brilliant, and scattered in such profusion that you probably don't have time to catch them all on one viewing. All in all a wonderful film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney's bravest and most relevant film,"Cute, talking animals are, of course, nothing new when it comes to Disney. Whether they are an anthropomorphic swash-buckler or a wide- eyed human's sidekick, I couldn't name one of Disney's animated output that didn't feature a cuddly creature. Their latest, Zootopia, may seem much more of the same then, with it's richly- imaged world of upright rabbits, polar bears, hippos and the like, all living together in harmony in the titular metropolis. You can put away your preconceptions however, as Zootopia is without doubt the corporate giants bravest and most relevant picture to date, and one with a strong message for its young audience that will hopefully rub off on at least a few viewers.Young, determined bunny Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) grows up in the rural Bunnyburrow, a small town in a larger world where predators and prey have evolved to live together peacefully. Her parents hope she'll grow up to appreciate the quiet life of selling carrots and raising a family, but she has other ideas, and hopes to one day travel to the big city of Zootopia to become a police officer. Despite facing prejudice due to her gender and her size, she eventually graduates from Police Academy top of her class, and is soon in Zootopia fulfilling her dream. But when she arrives, her colleagues instantly doubt her ability as the precinct is traditionally made up of more formidable animals, and is quickly assigned to parking duty by Chief Bogo (Idris Elba).Frustrated at the clear-cut discrimination, Judy decides to be the best parking attendant there ever was. It is while she is stamping every vehicle with a ticket the second they're in violation that she learns that prejudice goes both ways, meeting the seemingly down- and-out fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), the exact kind of prey Judy suffered physical harm from as a child. Her suspicions turn out to be true, and Nick is indeed a 'sly' fox, but comes to learn that he acts like a fox because society treats him and expects him to be like one. Begging for a chance at something more challenging, Bogo gives Judy the task of tracking down missing person Mr. Otterton with an ultimatum that she must resign if she fails. Suspecting his street-smarts may be of an asset to her investigation, Judy blackmails Nick into helping her, and uncover a series of bizarre incidents where predators are returning to their primal state.While it may sound like a heavy-handed educational piece on the folly of racism and pre-judgement, it actually isn't, as Zootopia is also an explosion of imagination for the vast majority of its 110- minute running time. Judy's arrival at Zootopia, as she is whisked through an array of eco-systems, designed to sustain the many different kinds of inhabitants, is a complete joy. While some jokes fail to hit the mark, like the Godfather gag that may have been funny thirty years ago, others are ingenious. It may seem obvious to employs sloths at the DMV, but the scene is still laugh-out-loud even though they played it in it's entirety in the trailer. But Zootopia isn't memorable for its comedy value, but the way it delivers its message. Without being preachy or overly-sentimental, the film actually feel frustrated at society. We have surely evolved past pretty prejudice and stereotyping, so what drives the hate? The film hints at fear induced, which is a bold statement on its own.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A very subtly brave movie,"It's perhaps not the best Disney movie ever made, but still a very lovable one, and technically absolutely fantastic. (As all Disney CGIs ever.) The characters are lively and lovely, the story is somewhat predictable, but the lore takes it all the way. A ton of cultural references spice it up for adults, from tongue-in-cheek references to Frozen to Godfather and even Breaking Bad. That's all I can tell about it in general. It deserves a 7 out of 10, for it could've been much more than it actually is, yet the storyline could've used some more polishment.A subtly brave movie I called it, and for a reason. It is a movie which actually dares to criticize multicultural society. The whole set is an utopia, a Zootopia, a city where predators and prey live happily together - also, it's an obvious reference to the Bible - but in fact it's only a hollow ideal. Different animals may coexist, but differences can not be set apart. Stereotypes exist for a reason. Foxes are sly, sloths are slow, rabbits are good at multiplying, and so on. This movie doesn't teach kids to act as if there wasn't any difference between members of different social groups. It doesn't propagate Hollywood's usual and banal clichés about racism and prejudice. It doesn't teach that even acknowledging differences is racism. No, it takes a more rational approach. What Zootopia teaches is this: good persons and jerks come in all shape and color, but stereotypes exist for a reason and the world is not a big happy family, even despite having surpassed violent antagonisms.I personally loved Zootopia for this. I am glad that political correctness and social justice warriors did not stop this movie in the making. This is exactly the voice we need in today's madness when liberal and conservative fundamentalism both try to claim the world for themselves. Also, while the city Zootopia is a biblical symbol, there is a much more stronger biblical message at the end. ""Sanctify what you are."" A very nice moral teaching. A fox can't be not a fox. But he can be a fox for a good purpose.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Brilliant,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Zootopia"" (2016) is by far the best animated movie i have seen in many, many and (did i just said MANY) many moons. Script is brilliant. Directing is on the spot and perfectly matched the brilliant script, which has many references to classic movies / shows / or some pop culture references, which youngest audience members probably won't be able to understand, but adults will be in nirvana watching this brilliant animation. Voice acting was also superb - there aren't superstars in every role, but that isn't a letdown, because every voice in here is brilliantly matched to the character, not the other way around. And there is a sequence with Flash - a killer scene.Overall, i do not know what other animated masterpiece should be born in the rest of 2016 that would claim Oscar for best animation in next years Oscars. This is a big winner, which i think can easily gain nomination for the best original screenplay. ""Zootopia"" is colorful, superbly funny, excellently paced and amazingly written animated movie which is easily my favorite movie so far this year.

During that, she get to know a fox named Nick Wilde, that helps her to solve the case.The movie counts with a special participation of Shakira, singing her last single (until now) made for the movie, Try Everything, that tells a message of overcoming difficulties.Disney has excelled this animation, bringing at the same time a good message, an engaging story, good characters and a great soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A joy to watch! 7/10,"Review: I was quite impressed with this animation movie from Disney, because it looked great and there was actually a decent storyline which kept me glued to the screen. The various characters kept the film interesting, and the attention to detail was truly amazing. After watching the bonus material on the disk, it's shocking to see how far the production team went to get each of the animals exactly right. From all of the individual hairs on the animals bodies, to there various mannerisms and face expressions, it really is a touch of genius, which is made Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) dramatic journey in the police force, a joy to watch. Personally, I think the movie got better once the fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) was introduced to the film and I liked Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), who gave Judy hell when she first joined the force. There really is something for everyone, and judging by the profits it made at the box office, these new Disney characters went down a storm around the world. I was more impressed with the look and feel of the film, than the actually storyline but I'm sure that I will enjoy the concept more, when I watch it again. I just hope they bring these characters back to the big screen soon. Enjoyable!Round-Up: It's not very often that a movie has 3 directors but in this case, with the amount of different elements involved, I can completely understand. The first director, Byron Howard, 47, brought Bolt and Tangled to the big screen, and he also directed, the short, Tangled Ever After. Rich Moore brought Wreck-It-Ralph to the big screen, and he directed 17 episodes of the Simpson between 1990-1993 and 5 episodes of Futurama. He plans to release a sequel to Wreck-It-Ralph but that won't hit the big screen until 2018. You know how long these animation movies take to produce! Anyway, this is the first movie directed by the final director Jared Bush, and judging by the final product, they worked very well together. With John Lasseter, 59, in the production chair, the creator of Pixar, this movie is definitely one that you can watch time and time again. It currently stands as the 24th biggest movie of all time, so I would definitely say that it's worth a watch.Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $1BillionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, the voices by Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Bonnie Hunt and J.K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer and Alan Tudyk. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
More layers than a rainbow cake,"I really wasn't in any mood for a Disney cartoon. Somehow I can always see behind the sheen of the screen and notice all the usual Disney mechanics at work. Then it happened - the word of mouth is great and I kept getting shoutouts from friends why I haven't checked it out. So we did last night and this is the second good film I have seen this year. Notice I didn't use the words ""good cartoon""?The world of Zootopia is so meticulously designed with its own logic that mirrors our societies. I came out feeling that it is a world that is built on metaphors and it is a real place. The emotional beats are spot on and pitch perfect. Thematically, this is strong. Its themes of empowerment and the dangers of stereotyping so timely and so effortlessly delivered. Unlike all the other typical Disney cartoons, this latest outing is never preachy and laden with so many rapid spitfire puns. We laughed ourselves silly at so many inventive scenes and the unlikely friendship moved us.This one has more layers than a rainbow cake. The kids will probably get it at one level but you know what?

Heartfelt and extremely fun.,"Zootropolis is directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore & Jared Bush and stars the voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Nate Torrence and many, many more.Judy Hopps is a courageous rabbit who has only one wish, to be an officer in the Zootropolis police force. Though, after a day in the city, she learns how tough it is to strive in enforcing the law. After attempting to prove herself to her boss Chief Bogo, who doesn't believe in Hopps, she hatches a plan with mischievous fox Nick Wilde to crack a conspiracy case much bigger than themselves.Zootropolis is a stunning combination of fun and heart. It has laughs and it has drama. It's beautifully animated and carefully thought through with a story filled with adult themes as well as the usual child-friendly humour. The movie picks at a lot of the problems our world is currently suffering from, so the timing couldn't be more perfect.Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman have admirable chemistry as our misfit pair of heroes and push the story along gracefully. There are a lot of fun characters that instantly become highlights such as Flash the Sloth and Clawhauser the ZPD receptionist. There are many references to other movies and TV shows including Breaking Bad and The Godfather which are very secretive for the younger audience but hilariously obvious for the adults. I love everything about this movie.The original score by Michael Giacchino is pumping with life and energy. Including many instruments catered to the scenes, this is another fantastic frame of work by Giacchino that will please fans and audiences alike. It's fun, action-packed and features loads of refreshing sounds & melodies.The animation is smooth and incredibly detailed throughout, with an extreme amount of colour and being. There's lots going on around the main characters and will open the eyes a little more than any of Disney's previous efforts.My verdict; Zootropolis packs a punch with a talented cast, a fun screenplay, crazy action and a whole lot of awesome music by Giacchino. This is yet another brilliant piece of work by Disney and will undoubtedly do wonders in the domestic and international box office. This is just as much one for the adults as it is for the younger audience.Zootropolis, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Lovely movie with cute animals and amazing animation,"Not surprisingly, another animated film is among the best I watched recently. The anthropomorphic animals of Zootopia are among the most lovable creatures ever created.Main character Judy Hopps is the first bunny cop in town and she is not taken seriously by her colleagues. In Zootopia predator and prey live side by side, but they tend to stick to their ""natural"" inclinations, therefore most cops are big and aggressive animals. They resent bunny Judy and give her a hard time.Judy get acquainted with grifter fox Nick, then starts working on a missing person case. Nick is blackmailed into helping her and the two develop a friendship.The animation is just astonishing, with amazing details, such as the busy Zootopia main station where different animals get different treats according to their size (giraffes and mice can cohabit, but with precautions).The plot is funny, with plenty of little jokes but also a serious message of tolerance. I would have given it a 10, but I do not agree completely with the naive message that ""anybody can do anything"" and ""biology is irrelevant"".Overcoming prejudice is just as important as understanding and accepting that there are limits to what each individual can do - while still trying to to do our best. Otherwise we fall back into super-hero territory.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Disney stays hot with entertaining, very socially relevant ""Zootopia""","For a studio that in modern times has taken a lot of flak for past racist cartoon depictions, Disney has come a long way with ""Zootopia."" It's as though someone at the Mouse House must have off-handedly said how great would it be if they could make a kids' movie about racism and classism and one if not all seven writers with story credits on ""Zootopia"" raised their hands and said ""challenge accepted.""Indeed, the CGI-era non-Pixar team at Disney has done just that, hitting its stride big time after ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Frozen."" (This critic has regrettably yet to see ""Big Hero 6."") ""Zootopia"" has all the best trappings of an entertaining animated family film with ample wit and heart.Yet while most animated films featuring talking animals simply for marketing purposes, the writing team (again, too many names to name here) offers an explanation of sorts. Much like 2012's ""Wreck-It Ralph"" built an entire film around video game characters existing beyond the screen, ""Zooptopia"" — which borrows all four writers from ""Ralph,"" including its director (Rich Moore) —crafts a world in which animals have evolved beyond survival instincts (and humans don't exist) and try to live together in harmony. By turning species characteristics into stereotypes and creating a predator-prey distinction, Disney lays the groundwork for an incredibly socially relevant movie.""Zootopia"" follows Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny who has aspired for her entire life to become a police officer in the mammal metropolis of Zootopia despite everyone telling her she's supposed to be a carrot farmer. But the story isn't so cliché that it results in some ""anyone can be anything"" tale. It goes well beyond, testing Judy's idealism and can-do spirit after she meets sly fox Nick (Jason Bateman) and starts to investigate a missing mammals case.The references to race and class are not subtle, and they go beyond serving as accompanying themes to movie. While kids will certainly not pick up on all of them, the filmmakers' intent is clearly to draw on examples of racism and prejudice from our world and introduce them in ways that kids can grapple with. There are elements of mystery and themes of friendship and believing in yourself, but ""Zootopia"" stands out for making this concerted effort to highlight divisions and differences and how they do not define us.The seriousness of this subject matter does not subvert the kid-friendly tone of the film, however. There's definitely a certain maturity to it (and even some scary moments), but the creative team has put together a colorful, vibrant world with various amusing characters and silly moments.Yet it's heart that really elevates ""Zootopia."" The big issues and themes allow it to go into somewhat uncharted animated territory, but also the characters of Judy and Nick are thoughtfully constructed. Judy is perhaps the perfect heroine and her journey is so incredibly sincere; Nick has the potential to be a bit more of an archetype, but he has many complex shades that help convey this notion that no character can be put in a box. The story really goes out of its way to make that point too.""Zootopia"" isn't George Orwell's ""Animal Farm,"" but it might be the most socially conscious and intelligent offering in the 20 years of this CGI era. The fact that kids and adults should enjoy it equally only makes it the more impressive. While Pixar has the clout, look at the last five years and Disney Animation's body of work is more impressive (and without any sequels). We should look forward to both with equal eagerness.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

""Zootopia"" is a film about all animals, herbivorous and carnivorous, supposedly living together in harmony but that harmony is disrupted by a strange conspiracy and a bunny cop and a con artist fox help each other out to find out what that conspiracy is. This film is great for children and adults alike. Adults are going to enjoy this film with all of the references laid out in the film. The kids are going to like it just because it's a cartoon. On the slick I think this film was shedding light on how destructive racism and other forms of prejudice can be and it was also teaching a lesson on treating others with respect and treating others exactly how you would want to be treated. The actors in this film did a great job voicing their characters. It was very fun trying to figure out what celebrity was voicing what character. This is a good film that's great for all ages. You will not be disappointed with this Disney film, I wasn't and I hate Disney films!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""What a Film!!!!""","When I watched Zootopia's Trailer I was not convinced I don't know but It looked so boring to me. But when I saw the whole movie I was literally shocked....It was damn amazing and it turned out to be one of the best animated movies ever. As in the terms of Story it was good in concept it was also good, Screenplay damn good.I loved all of the character Judy Hobbs, Nick Wilde, Duke Weaselton and ""Mr. BIG"" all of them were awesome.It has something which connects all type of audiences with it. Overall an awesome adventure can't wait for Sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Almost totally wild (but ultimately all too tame).,"After a dynamite first hour which is bot eye-popping and vastly entertaining this charming ""little movie"" goes on...and on. The films being at least a half hour overlong might be acceptable if their was enough good writing to sustain the running time. Unfortunately the film slips into a violent ""suspense / action mode which all but destroys the jolly likability of the early scenes. The script also becomes oddly slapdash, rushed and careless.... (random ""coincidences"" about blue flowers and blueberries just ""happening to be in oddly convenient places are insultingly lazy...and the big 'surprise' of the main villain's identity is far too emphatically telegraphed for it to be more than a yawn).I am very surprised that most critics saw fit to just let this slip by with raves (there are in fact even worse bits of laziness (isn't the very trite ""Godfather"" homage just a wee bit stale by now?).Anyway...this is no ""Frozen"" or ""Big Hero Six""...and one imagines Mr. Disney in his prime would not have let this one out without a great deal of tinkering.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"While lacking emotional value, Zootopia still boasts hilarity and an underlying message that applies to everyone.","Zootopia starts out as a world chock full of anthropomorphic animals that go about their lives like ordinary humans, and, thankfully, the story told within that world is nearly as intelligent as the animals that populate it. Also fortunate is the incredible way that the animals begin to feel like human characters walking about the screen; their characters are so real that it is easy to forget that they are animals.This case could be made with many movies that use anthropomorphics, but not only does Zootopia do it especially well, it also plays a clever twist -- not all the animals are civilized! Interestingly, the human race is the same way; many of our own behave like animals inside whilst appearing as human on the out. These are animals, but free animals, not ones in a normal ""zoo"", and are expected to rise above the oppressive nature humans experience along with freedom. All personas displayed in Zootopia revolve around this idea, one reason Zootopia is thoroughly captivating.Like any good story, these themes are woven through the movements of said personae, one of whom is the principal character, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin, Walk the Line), an eccentric rabbit that dreams of being a cop. Hopps has the motto anyone can be anything, and she uses this to motivate herself to become a cop. Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman, Horrible Bosses), a fox reluctant to fight for justice after being pegged as a scandalous cheater all his life, must join together to solve a mystery while fighting an uphill battle against the ""speciesist"" Chief Bogo (Idris Elba, Prometheus) of the police department and the clueless Mayor Lionheart (J.K. Simmons, Spider- Man), both of whom Hopps works for.Concerning Chief Bogo, any and all actions of his speciesism that occur within the film can easily relate to the racism that happens among humans today. Of course, he still isn't actually the villain; he's not even villainous. He's more of an obstacle that Hopps has to overcome. Bogo's intentions are good. It makes sense that a small bunny shouldn't be able to be a cop. But when he is only holding her back because she is a bunny, that's speciesism. The cynical Nick says ""You can only be what you are. Sly fox. Dumb bunny."" These types of speciesism in the film are almost identical to the racism or stereotypical boxes that we as human beings put each other into, making Zootopia all too real.Plus, the world of Zootopia is still entirely realistic, despite being animated and not live action! Characters have PB+J cell service on Carrot phones, with songs on them sung by the likes of The Beagles. Zootopia is gorgeous, and if the character and set design weren't enough the details supporting them are as in depth as they are in our universe. Every stone, every rain drop, every popsicle stick is painted perfectly, transcending the norm for animation.As technology continues to grow, the animation will obviously get better along with it, illustrated by the progression between landmark films like Snow White and Toy Story. Zootopia proves technology is getting closer and closer to making that next landmark film. Even characters moving in the background offer to the scene exactly what they need to, something so often missing in animation and as frequently in live action. Zootopia stands as some of the most technically masterful material out there, surpassed only by all of Pixar's productions, particularly their most recent effort, The Good Dinosaur.Like Dinosaur, however, Zootopia doesn't have a perfect story. Several times it becomes annoyingly predictable, and even worse, disappointing because of many cool points spoiled in the trailer. The political statements it makes are intriguing, but they begin to overshadow the story, becoming the focus of the narrative, even though such things should be displayed in the background and be representative of a magnificent story. Furthermore, just Like the political aspect, Nick Wilde takes over the story; the fox would have done better as the protagonist, boasting a dynamic character with more depth than Judy Hopps.Fortunately, the writers built in hilarity and a fast pace atoning for the weaknesses of the film, keeping witty remarks and pop culture references always right around the corner. The Godfather, Frozen, and best of all, Finding Nemo, are either referenced or spoofed in great fun. However hilarious Zootopia is, though, it's icing on the cake (albeit a cake lacking emotional ingredients) to the thoughts that it provokes about society today. ""Anyone can be anything"", and that makes sense in the world of Zootopia and on Earth.A small, apparently meek rabbit can become a cop if she works for it, even though it may be easier for a larger, more intimidating ox. Similarly, a predator isn't necessarily going to hurt you even though other predators might. That's not to say predators aren't dangerous, if they choose to be, because they can be! They have sharp teeth or long claws that can kill in seconds, but some of those predators choose not to kill. Why? The same reason that being a Muslim doesn't correlate to being a terrorist. Adults will watch and enjoy Zootopia because of its intense philosophical meanderings. Kids will fall in love with the precisely designed and adorable characters. Although all demographics will realize the lack of emotions and flawless stories Disney sometimes produces, everyone will undoubtedly fall helplessly in love with the visuals, quick pace, and the vast and uncompromising world of Zootopia.C: While lacking emotional value, Zootopia still boasts hilarity and an underlying message that applies to everyone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Subversive, heartfelt, excellently written. Just wonderful.","Disney's Zootopia is the kind of animated film that passes with flying colors in just about every damn category it needs to, making it a thoroughly endearing classic that will stand the test of time and delight countless new fans as time goes on. It's the best of its kind since last year's Inside Out, and one that will be hard to top this time around. It's got the most treasurable kind of story, one that has all the fun, flash and zip that the kids will take a shine to, some hilariously subversive and cheeky humour for the the adults to chuckle at, and some vital, important messages within its themes that adults will knowingly relate to, and the kids will subconsciously perceive. Never preachy nor pandering, all of its ingredients are mixed harmoniously. And let's talk about that animation, good lord. Every year these films get more cutting edge and eye boggling, and this one busts the blueprints in its attempts to dazzle, with every kind of texture, glint and rendered gold on display. Animals of all shapes and sizes run, scamper, dart and dive throughout the film, to the point where I felt that only with multiple viewings could I appreciate every loving detail and subtle joke. Ginnifer Goodwin gives perky vocals to Judy Hops, a small town bunny who dreams of being a big city cop. Just leagues away from the tiny carrot farm she was raised on lies Zootopia, a sprawling metropolis where the denizens of the animal kingdom live in civilization, or rather, their brilliantly realized version of it. She is told time and time again that she'll never become a cop, but pays no heed. And whadd'ya know, she becomes a cop. Left to rot on parking duty by stern bison Sergeant Bogo (growly Idris Elba) she fumes and longs for real action. Soon she meets wily fox and street hustler Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman in possibly the best vocal performance in years), and both are whisked away on an adventure through Zootopia to find some bad cats (and every other creature imaginable) who are up to no good. The city itself is a marvel in every sense of the word. Divided into detailed, vast and climatized zones including Tundra Town, Little Rodentia (laughed hardest at this sequence, purely inspired) and a subtropical tree house lined Rainforest area. The cast has buckets of fun, including JK Simmons as Mayor Lionheart, Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake as Judy's endearing parents, Tommy Chong as a yak hippie, Peter Mansbridge as Peter 'Moosebridge', and more. Shakira shows up essentially as herself in animal form, with an original composition called 'Try Everything' which gives the film a lot of its charm and heart. Bateman just has to be commended for a performance so full of real conflict and shades of grey its hard to believe hes playing a fox in a Disney flick. Despite being in the most hyper real of all genres, hes walked right out of real life and nails every note. There's so many highlights I could write for pages, but I won't spoil the fun, of which there's no end. There's also a very grounded head on the film's shoulders, saying some important things about not giving up on your dreams (sounds clichéd, I know, but not the way the writing addresses it here), and never assuming one thing about a specific group of animals just because of the way a few of them behave. Subversive stuff for a kids movie, and I'd have it no other way, as the undercurrents of film forge minds and opinions for the young ones. Simply put, it's destined to be a classic, and comes up a winner no matter how you look at it. Oh, and try not to bust a gut laughing at the sloth sequence, I dare you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Cute"" movie","Allow me to preface this by saying I work in the film industry. As someone who works in production, I've seen a lot of movies. And by a lot, I mean A LOT, so what I'm about to tell you may not be your experience, and you should by no means decide on seeing a movie based on one guy's opinion.With that being said- I've been a Disney fan all of my life. I grew up with the classic animated musicals, I found Nemo Incredible and Wreck-It Ralph Frozen(not really, but titles are fun), so naturally I thought Zootopia was going to be a surefire hit. And it was. Kind of. It had all of the elements- the odd couple duo, the social themes and let's not forget the breathtaking animation(and by God, it was beautiful).However, there was something missing.It seemed that Disney phoned it in this time, I could see every plot point coming a mile away. It was predictable, rushed(typically Disney leaves little jokes hidden in the background, and despite the clever layout of the city, that was lacking. Michael Giacchino's score couldn't even save it.Perhaps my standards were too high. If you expect perfection, a B+ feels like an F.So go see it if you want to, don't if you don't, I don't care.

Disappointed,"This film had great animation and a pretty good theme, but it was lacking in so many areas. My father and I went to see it because we heard it was good, and about 30 min into it we wanted to leave. It was boring. The part that would make the most people laugh was put in the previews to advertise the film. Honestly, my dad and i were at the drive in and by the end of the movie only 2 kids lower than approximately the age of 10 were still awake. (I guess thats why parents liked it so much). It had action, which at some parts would be a little scary for kids, but the whole time the film seemed to be lacking something to make stand out. Personally, My dad even agreed that Frozen was more entertaining and he doesn't like princess movies. The theme of Zootopia is a great one to teach kids though. It touches the topics of bullying and to believe in oneself. If you still want to watch it, i suggest waiting for it to come out on Netflix to save some money.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Regular Disney fare,"Zootopia is nothing like your regular Disney fare. Sure it's got cute talking animals, some childish humor, and like almost all Disney movies it is gorgeously animated and has a lesson to teach, but not just to kids. This movie absolutely blew me away from the moment it began. The messages and lessons that this film has to tell are so beyond it's years, there were many times that I just forgot that I was watching an animated film about a bunny who wanted to a cop. I believe that this Disney has struck gold with this movie, not just in the terms that Disney will make bank loads of money from ticket sales and merchandise (cause it will), but because they created a truly well crafted, well written, and beautifully, breathtakingly animated film that is sure to delight children and entice their parents.

One of the best animations of All-Time,"Without a doubt, Zootopia is one of the best animations of All-Time and certainly one of the greatest from The Walt Disney Company. The characters, especially Judy Hopps, are absolutely great! You can't help but love them, and viewers of all ages will certainly be able to relate. This is a movie which can be viewed by any, and enjoyed by any. I believe it will go down as one of the best to date, and I am quite confident that there will be plenty more in this series. I will go as far as saying that Judy Hopps will become a great addition to Disney as a whole. Her creation is absolute genius. Without spoiling anything, I will say this, you will leave the theater feeling pure joy. And might I say, surprised to some extent. The story is written beautifully and engages the viewer more than any animation I've seen within the past few years or so. This is most certainly the best animation of 2016 yet. Disney has done it again, and believe me, this is going to be a big one. Please give it a watch because you will love it. Don't let your age stop you, this is a fantastic movie for anyone of all ages and proves yet again, Disney is one of the best studios in the business when it comes to producing films that everyone can enjoy and relate to. Zootopia gets a 10 out of 10 in my book. And I feel absolutely confident saying such, and believe me, that's a rating that I do not give very easily at all. But this one deserves it.

Nice surprise,"Used to be Pixar was the far better animation studio at Disney but recently they've been knocking them out of the park with their own Disney Studio Productions! Zootopia is a great illustration: it's fun, witty, has the several layers of interpretation and looks really good.In a nutshell, it's a great animation for the entire family. The only thing one could poke is the cast: it's fairly unknown and not really inspired. Jason Bateman is the only stand out, Nate Lawrence is good in a role that almost sounds like Jonah Hill. The rest, including the title character and an underwhelmed Idris Elba is a little -meh-.But it's probably the only point that one could expect better from.

My favorite Disney movie of all time.,"Five words: Best Disney movie ever made! Why you may ask? Because I love everything about the movie. I love the characters, the story, the animation, even the message about human races, or animal races I should say. When I saw the trailer, I thought it would just be another good movie by Disney, but boy was I wrong. It was fantastic! Amazing! Awesome! I just can't stop loving this movie! And I think the message is strong about treating each other equally, and we needed this message and I'm glad Disney made this movie about the message.And thanks to this movie, I read the good side of fan fiction. There's so many well written Zootopia fan fictions, some I just can't stop reading till the very end like a real book. But how did this movie got me into fan fiction? It's because of the ending where Nick said ""You know you love me."" and then Judy replied ""Do I know that? Yes, yes I do."" it maybe in a friendly way, but it's more than that in my opinion. As an inter myself, I think Judy & Nick would be a great Disney couple in the sequel, IF they make a sequel.If Disney doesn't make a sequel, than I'm going to be upset on Disney.

Good movie but.,"Just watched the movie at the weekends, if talk about the movie it is a good one, not so special typical common story, sometimes get bored and only special thing is, it is an animation movie. When I was watching the movie I felt so familiar with the story line, a weak person become a cop then ignored by everyone, then become a hero with the support of another bad guy, finally with a few setbacks they save the world. This is the most common story line in movie history. So the movie makers sell the same story line using animation so the only special thing in the movie is animated characters. It's like directors ran out of ideas they just sell animation. So if someone ask, is this a good movie, yes it is. Is it worth to spend my time and money to watch this? No, there is nothing special, it is just an animation movie with a most common story line.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The preachy virtue signalling became too hard to swallow,"So I enjoyed the film. The action, some of the characters and the invention of the makers was really good.However, I did begin to feel the nausea of preachy moralising becoming a little too hard to swallow or rather overtaking the film about half way through.Yes, it's good to embolden children and individuals that they can be what they want to be but it shouldn't be at the behest of others. I've no problems with women being in the army and on the front line but they should be able to do exactly the same as what a man can.Bending the rules or turning a blind to physical inadequacies are fine in the classroom but get to the front line when someone is incapable of physically carrying a fellow wounded soldier or lugging that ammo crate around and your well meaning positive discrimination leads to a less than effective fighting force.Even so I was cool with Hopps getting through the selection (albeit off the literal backs of others) though I started to feel the embrace of political correctness when the front desk guy was remonstrated for calling her cute (with it's less than subtle nod to the n word).Okay, that's still fine as the world we are being presented with in the film is fun and entertaining. The sloths are hilarious and it's all bright and shiny.But half way through the messaging that we are wrong to judge people and the moral posturing began to get a little overwhelming. Yes, a utopia of rivers of chocolate and laughing children and never needing to lock your front door is all very nice but it seemed to be preaching that anyone who didn't think this utopia was achievable was evil or in some way morally corrupt.It didn't seem to be a case of acting on what's right in your heart, tempered with your head, but acting on what the liberal intelligentsia are telling you is right. Having stomached so many 'informed' people preaching that voting for Brexit was because I was a racist thicko, I find it hard to ignore when I feel the air of posturing creeping into the narrative.I've seen many reviews acknowledging what the film is about but that it's subtle and non preachy. I certainly didn't feel that. Maybe I'm more sensitive to it but I didn't go into the film being aware of the moralising that was in it and hence what I felt was an organic reaction to the film rather than having any preconceived ideas.A fun film that made me laugh in the first half/two thirds but one where the lasting impression was that I'd just been lectured/preached to.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

It makes fun of racial divisions, political ridiculousness, and the important lesson for children that you do not have to be what society claims you are.It is so refreshing to have someone make a film for children that isn't the usual ""everyone is a princess"" drivel.I would give this film 11 stars if I could!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Average movie carried mostly by great visuals,"Zootopia (in a summary) tells the story of a character whose ambitions do not fit well in the world she lives in.If that sounds cliché, then you would be right.The movie also takes on the (heavy) task of delivering messages around racism, acceptance, and fear of the ""different"".Unfortunately, the movie under-delivers on both the story line, and the depth & impact of its messages.The protagonist's optimism and resilience is not justified when *everyone* is depicted to be pushing against her dreams, including her parents. Worse still, the story collapses when a typical cheap/easy element is added in, to resolve the build up. It's as if the screenwriters spend all their effort and wit building a story up (easy), and have none at all left when it comes to resolving to a satisfactory conclusion (always the hard part).On the positive side, the tone of the movie is cheerful, with great artwork and visuals.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Zootopia: when Disney found sweetness again,"Imagine a world where all the animals live freely. But do not picture them barking or howling. They are walking, well-dressed and paying rents in a so organized system that it even includes a Mayor. This whole idea is developed in Disney's new movie, Zootopia. In this world of animals behaving like humans, there is a bunny that stands out for her life goals. Avid defender of animal rights, Judy Hopps dreams about being a police officer to create a better city. The only problem is a bunny has never done this before. Small and cute, Juddy defies stereotypes and becomes the first police officer of Zootopia. Despite her great efforts, Judy only seems to be considered for minor tasks as traffic officer. This will change when she meets Nick Wilde, an underrated smart fox that becomes Judy's main companion in the adventures that eventually evolve in a story full of action, mistakes and a sensible moral.Zootopia is a movie that keeps Disney's old formula: sweetness. The characters are well built, so much you can connect to them form the beginning. The plot is consistent yet full of lessons easy to pick out from a master script.

I know it's about ""something that unlikely to be awesome, apparently can be one"" character but why a bunny? It's cute but boring. I mean if this character is created 50 years ago, it could be better. We've already known a lot of bunnies with their diverse personality like Thumper, Bugs Bunny, Roger Rabbit, Easter Bunny, etc... enough with bunnies. Judy Hopps, Mike Wazowski from Monster University, Theo from Turbo, and Po from Kungfu Panda 1 has a lot in common: passion, dreams, stereotype, and unlikely background to achieve their goal, but Mike, Theo, and Po are more 'fresh' because they're a monster, a snail, and a panda that hasn't appeared in so many films.

"A rare gem everyone can enjoy; not quite perfect, but enjoyable","Zootopia is one of the highest grossing animated films of 2016, and for the right reasons. It has unique characters, a clever plot which explores important themes, and stunning animation. It seems people are not seeing the movie for what it is; something that may not necessarily be suited for young children, with themes that should be portrayed in films for an older audience. Regardless, this is a terrific film that the entire family can enjoy, and deserves praise for this.The film revolves around a young rabbit called Judy, who has from a young age aspired to be a police officer. And, from a young age, she has faced adversity in the form of racial prejudice; well, translated into the animal kingdom. This racial prejudice is the key theme of the film, explored through different species of animals rather than different races.To Judy, living in the country on her parents' farm, Zootopia is a far-off city where ''anyone can be anything''. These dreams are completely dashed away when she is accepted into the Zootopia Police Force. Here, she faces discrimination from all corners, including mainly officers at the police department and her boss Chief Bogo, a mean, apathetic buffalo. This comes from the stereotype (another key theme of the film) that rabbits are ''dumb''.Her dreams are almost shattered when Chief Bogo threatens to fire her (for a silly reason), giving her one chance to solve a missing animal case.Teaming up with Nick, a fox con-artist, the pair begin an adventure that changes Zootopia and its prejudice forever.The movie is to be applauded for the impressive way it explores discrimination. Never before has an animated film so stunningly explored these themes in a way that leaves viewers thinking about its meaning long after watching the movie. How it does this is simple; reiterating through Nick and Judy, both victims of prejudice, the harsh stereotypes that are employed by Zootopians. Through Judy, we are able to empathise with her as her experiences unfold. Through Nick, we are able to see how, bullied at a young age via stereotypical discrimination, his life was shaped.In Zootopia, predators are the minority seen as dangerous. Clearly this fear is just another stereotype that is explored cleverly, attempting to show how fear based on stereotypes is commonly unsubstantiated.The characters are unique in this film too. From Judy's protective parents who early on blatantly state how they are happy because they gave up on their dreams, to the resilient and studious Judy herself, Nick the seemingly sly con-artist who really represents far more, the Chief who is an obvious biased and the assistant mayor who is apparently under-appreciated by the mayor himself, although she ends up representing far more than just that.Zootopia features amazing animation, which truly brings to life the characters. In a movie featuring animals this is a necessity and Zootopia definitely fulfills this criterion.But every movie has its flaws. As great as Zootopia is, there are certain aspects that are underestimated in their influence. For example, the film is clearly scary at times. While not obvious at first, certain scenes featuring the ''savage'' animals have the potential to frighten the younger viewers. This is probably a little paranoid, but remembering that this is a kids movie it is important to note.Even more noticeable is the plot. Sure, an adult could follow it with ease. But children are going to have difficulty understanding what is happening. Certain plot developments will not make sense; more so than other animated films because this is a detective story. Of course, for the most part children do not understand plots regardless of their complexity, and thankfully, while not teeming with it, the film does have humour that will entertain the kids.Prejudice within the film is arguably its best feature. However, at the same time it has its flaws, namely that it is explored rather brutally; the Chief is quite rude to Judy, the Fox bully at the start is mean (''you think you will ever be more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny?''), and Nick's flashback is somewhat graphic. Although these are all eventually resolved, it seems its exploration was harsh.You see, the truth of the matter is that Zootopia is a complex film. It explores themes that usually do not form a part of animated films, through a typical partner-cop detective story, with scenes that may appear in a horror movie filmed as live-action. To the most part it succeeds at exploring prejudice, however its detective story can be confusing at times, and as for the savage scenes, it's clear after a second look that they may appear frightening. Again, perhaps that's paranoid to think, but still.Push this all aside, and Zootopia is a great film. The reason it has been received so well is because it is a film that both kids and adults can thoroughly enjoy, a rarer combination nowadays. It is to be praised for how well it handles prejudicial themes, stereotypes and discrimination, alongside its clever, witty characters that really allow viewers to connect, and quality animation which truly brings the film to life.Zootopia is one of those rare gems that the entire family will be entertained by.

Surprisingly good,"And just when you thought graphics couldn't get any better, out comes Zootopia.......The vote of 9 is not because this movie is brilliant in the leagues of say the IMDb top 50 but because of its heart. I think 2 stars will be just for that beautiful song 'Try Everything' by Shakira.The colours are absolutely dazzling. I was surprised because I had left my monitor in my regular (for internet/text) dim/dull setting and I thought I had enabled the 'movie' mode where it spruces things up. I enabled that too, and boy was I in for a treat.The main character is a rabbit who wants to be a cop in a world where the cops are all the large animals, and she would become the first ever rabbit to become a cop. And the story is about the unusual alliance she forges with a wily fox to help her in her adventures in zootopia.The voice actress is Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love). I remember her positivity and big heartedness from then. And that is what you get here too. A lot of the mannerisms of the rabbit they have taken from Ginnifer. And the rabbit itself is sooo gorgeously beautiful. She had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen in my life!Zootopia - They have really gone out and developed a whole world for this movie. You keep seeing tiny tiny surprises all the time. The attention to detail is fantastic.Though there was one thing (sort of like the elephant in the room), that they really avoided. What do the carnivores eat? Because even chickens and cows are citizens, what is then left to eat? I saw them eating things like ice-cream, coffee, etc. But what do they actually eat??This movie is highly recommended. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

An enjoyable movie for children and manchildren alike,"Zootopia was good for most people. It turned a bunch of Zoomers into furries.I could not get into it though. I just don't know what it was but the movie was very jump cutty. But I think the lack of good music made it kind of a boring movie. Like the try everything song at the end was ok.All the animals fall into animal stereotypes and I'm just not into it.Zootopia is an insanely beautiful CGI cartoon that has very nice character designs with lots of detail and personality.However this movie has a message, and it's not a good one. This entire movie recognizes race and species as one of the same. It's not one of the same. Race and species are 2 different things. It should have focused on one animal and several species. Cause equating race and species which leads to dehumanization. None the less, no one should discriminate to each other on any basis.But whatever, it's a baby movie so you might enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Its really inspiring to see how each animal can use their strengths to bypass their weaknesses and come out on top.

Disney Animation Studios you've done it again!,"Everything this movie wants to do, it does and it does properly. Now going into Zootopia I had high expectations, I was still riding the Disney Animation fan bus that had recently impressed me so much with the likes of Big Hero 6 and Wreck it Ralph to name a few. And once again Disney nailed it out of the ballpark. This film follows a bunny working as a police officer in the metropolis of Zootopia, a city where all animals live together in harmony.... and I'll leave it there because this is undeniably a film that rewards you the less you know going into it.As expected, Disney brings forth yet another BEAUTIFULLY animated movie with vibrant colors, distinct environments and smoothly animated sequences that managed to drop my jaw quite a few times. The story is deep without getting caught up in itself and the masterful writing is able to produce so many absolutely hilarious scenes; funny for both adults and children. As well it is able as explore mature topics that are very prevalent in our world today and it does so in a way that is so perfect it conveys its messages flawlessly without becoming dark, or losing its tone. The characters are incredibly well acted, especially from the likes of Jason Bateman as the suave Nick Wilde and Ginnifer Goodwin as Officer Judy Hopps, both of whom have great chemistry with each other making for superb dialogue between the two. Overall this film is so well made, it has a heartwarming, deep story full of laughs, it's animated superbly with great performances from its voice actors and it is definitely worth the watch. Truly up there with the best of Disney's animated movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
They did it again.,"'Zootopia' or in Germany called 'Zoomania' (no seriously, what's up with this unnecessary name-changing?) is the new animated movie from the creators of 'Frozen' and 'Big Hero 6'. I haven't seen the latter, but since 'Frozen' is my favourite animated movie of the last years, I have to say the Team, here, too, did a great job. 'Zootopia' is a charming children's story for young but also old. The main character is rabbit Judy Hopps, who works more or less against all odds as the first rabbit-officer in the allegedly tolerant city of unlimited possibilities Zootopia (or Zoomania or Zootropolis). Of course nothing goes as planned as she'd initially hoped. With not quite so much help of the cunning fox Nick, Judy struggles to uncover the missing of several animals. The world of 'Zootopia' is in the process not so different from ours. The human-like animals run around with ""iPhone's"" and drink ""Starbucks"" coffee or just simply behave human. At the same time, they keep their natural instincts and along with the human part result in an interesting and charming-funny combination, without giving away to much, now. 'Zootopia' is clearly a movie for children but promises small surprises for older audiences, too. The supposedly Mafia-rat à la Marlon Brando/Robert de Niro or 'Breaking Bad''s Walter and Jesse hidden as animal ""Drug"" Dealers are great easter eggs for grown up's, that for me elicited one or two massive laughs. For a change, I'm actually glad to have seen the movie in German since they got the German voices of Robert de Niro and Walt and Jesse for the individual roles, which sadly isn't the case for the original movie. 'Zoomania' isn't just funny, sweet and simple amusement. It also contains heavy topics like racism and equality. However, these are handled in a child-friendly way and are in no way forced upon us, as I had feared initially. Joined with cute humor, Zoomania is not only entertaining, but is also, in my opinion, an important movie for young and old.Conclusion: Anti-racism/discrimination children's film, that will and should also find favour with older people. For one thing it offers appealing characters, for another thing a neat story that encourages oneself to overcome one's fears and follow one's dreams. Who cares if you don't have any younger relatives to alibi-watch the movie with. Just watch it. I think we are past the belief that all animated movies are children's movies but rather child- oriented, with a lot to offer for grown-up's. 'Zootopia' in that case currently the best example.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Buddy-Cop Movie,"Welcome to this newly created world. Everything lives in harmony and it seems to run perfectly. Let's take this amazing world and make a Buddy-Cop movie out of it and smash some Buddy-Cop clichés into it.Starting off with our Checklist:1. The Police Chief is an Asshole.2. Maincharacter is told repeatedly how he is a looser.3. Mismatched Characters become partners. (Yeye, Nick is not a Cop but he becomes one in the end so I will count it)5. The partners have a falling out.6. The partner/s give/s up his/their Badge/s.7. Two buddies are discouraged from pursuing the case8. But they keep pursuing it anyway, even off the job9. Suspects forcefully interrogated.10. Conspiracy plot that could go all the way to the top11. Corruption.12. Maincharacter gets reinstated instantly after cracking the caseI can probably find more but these were the ones that just came off the top of my head.So why do I still give it a 7/10. It's simple, because making a buddy-cop Movie without clichés is impossible. Everything that is important is how you package it and Disney created an interesting world and characters around those clichés making the viewer forget them. It is not a movie I would watch over and over again, but it is really enjoyable to watch once but it won't stick. Most will forget the movie in a couple of years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Try everything"" even this amazing film that will not disappoint at all","Zootropolis (UK) or Zootopia (US) is the new fun family Disney animated adventure that finally explains why in all animated films the animals act basically like humans. The film centers on ZPD Cop Judy Hopps who is the first rabbit police officer in Zootropolis and hopes to make the world a better place. However, when she is demoted to parking duty she meets a slick Fox hustler, who becomes the key for Judy to solve a case in the city that will prove her worthiness as a police officer.Zootropolis is a brilliant, exciting and hilarious film to see, very enjoyable for all audiences, and will make your day. It is absolutely fuelled with funny jokes that will even really tickle adults as well. It is visually stunning and so beautiful you would want to visit the animal kingdom itself. It is also supported by a great song ""Try Everything"". Like ""Everything is Awesome"" it fills me with an appreciation for life.Like any other animated film, it is filled with heartwarming messages of reaching for your dreams and believing in yourself, but also some more really grown up messages potentially trying to mirror society, such as diversity and understanding. This made the film seem really mature, creating a real impact to me as a viewer. Of course this does not make it inappropriate for children at all. I'd like to see much more animated films with depth.Although I only really got into the story by half way through, so it needs to pick up after a while. But the narrative is one of the strongest points of the film, as you will gather when you see it yourself.The problem with these films is that at the end, it puts you in such a feel good mood, you don't want it to end. One day I hope to see a Disney animated film that is 3 hours long.A very strong enjoyable film, with much more depth to it, not the best animated though but a very good one, 8/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Drivel,"Animations can be wonderful even when pitched to children. Toy Story 2 is a great movie plain and simple. I don't mean for an animation it's great, it's great as a story. The open act of Up is as moving as any act in any live actor movie as well. Just because these two examples (of many possible) are cartoon figures, doesn't mean they can't have depth and move us.Not so here. We have the same perky female lead we are now having our faces rubbed in time after time. She's weak but takes on all because, by gosh, there are no limitations to what you can do other than in your own head. It's not that I'm opposed to this message, but rather Disney has pushed this out so often that we either get it or don't so let's move on. Isn't there another message possible?Or gee, let's get radical and have a movie that entertains rather than preaches. What a concept!!!So because it's a plucky female lead, we have no tension. We know that she'll come out ahead and better for the experience and the world will be better because she persisted in her remorseless pluck.Underlying all this for, I suppose, the pervs in the audience, there is some sort of odd sexuality and rather uncomfortable suggestions going on. It's a sour note that doesn't offset the saccharine dominant note but rather only adds a nasty undertone to the production.So the same movie with different characters showing that effort aside from CGI doesn't exist or at least it's died entirely in Hollywood.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

This movie is a very good example of how kids' movies can actually be good.

Quite brilliant,"A really compelling animated film. It seemed from the start that it was just going to be a straightforward and well-written mystery, but it emerged as a fascinating allegory for racial tensions, tokenism and corruption in government. I felt this was explored quite brilliantly.What also helped the narrative work so well was the dynamic between the two main characters in Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, voiced superbly by Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman respectively. How their friendship develops was engaging and provided for some hilarious, and also sincere, moments.The animation was also fantastic, immersing you into the world completely.In the end, it's another great Disney animated film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"""Exciting, light-humoured action in a Spectacular Kingdom""","Zootopia film review ""Enticing, exciting, adventure and action in a spectacular virtual world"" (9/10)Setting the sceneFrom the word go the visually stimulating Kingdom and characters allowed me to quickly settle into the storyline. The costume and likeness to real relationships especially father- daughter were light-hearted and heart warming. Following the character introduction, action adventure was quickly eased into with help from the music. Defying convention was a quickly woven-in feature of the film with the main characters choices quickly going against the norm. This really acted as a great hook for future endeavours.Main bodyThe storyline was simple and clear. The plot was complex enough however to not unveil too much too early keeping me guessing throughout the film. In parts, the mood was a little predictable yet small flourishes of light-hearted humour, with great effects in the well created virtual world, kept me well entertained.The music continued well and the tempo of the film was fast enough for an enjoyable action, yet not confused by rushing for effect. The balance between happiness and turmoil was just right, avoiding an excessive bout of isolated trouble that some childish films typically suffer from. This made the film enjoyable for family yet not just accessible for all.The variety in the characters, their mode of speech and personality was great and helped transport me into their lives. They each had roles in fictional society and well created costumes to match these. A few well known actors were also involved in assisting their portrayal. Scene changes were dynamic and frequent to assist the films good tempo providing stimulation for the viewer.Relationships were dealt with nicely with only a hint of possible future romance. This was good since it helped the movie tone Remain in keeping with the action genre distracting the viewer or plot goal.MusicThe music was up-beat with a strong tempo and was great for the start of any happy adventure. Shakira Try everything seemed like a great choice ... As the story unfolded, the music was adjusted accordingly and appeared to fit in well with most of the scenes. The subtlety of the music in darker times made it less memorable yet left the effects no less effective.EndingThe ending was quite appropriate for an unpredictable action film. The resolution to the plot issues was not expected and therefore highly entertaining.SummaryOverall a clear story with entertaining plot quirks. It has great potential to produce a sequel. It was seriously difficult to find fault with since the created world and characters shouted as much diversity as the dynamic scene and setting locations with their stories. The film captured my imagination, transported me to another world, intellectually stimulated me with light humour and kept me thoroughly entertained with an interesting plot and storyline. Close resemblance in theme likeness to other action films appeared to show perhaps, a slight oversight in creativity. The lack of memorable music for sadder or darker scenes were my only other criticisms.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good Time For Everybunny,"""Zootopia"" is a very fun movie. The movie has something for everyone, whether they like the police action, the animal characters, the hardworking main character or the comedic paring of the two leads. I would have likely loved this film as a kid, I loved police stuff and this film has a lot of good police/detective material for those kids. This film has a lot of good stuff, it just loses steam as it comes to its final act.""Zootopia"" had three different directors, that may contribute to why the film feels very disjointed. Behind the scenes there are a lot of deleted scenes and scrapped ideas, including disagreements on who the main character was going to be. These disfunctions are well hidden for the most part, until the final 30 minutes. The movie suffers from tonal whiplash as they transition from one plot point to the other.Still a good time, the film just gets a heavy handed with their commentary towards the end. It isn't a bad message, just a message we have already heard, and this doesn't bring much new to the conversation.I don't mean to dog on this movie too much.

A Magical Feat that isn't Just an Illusion..,"The litmus test to confirm art and disconfirm zero-calorie entertainment is a comparison between the elements that can be found in both. There's a moment, early in Zootopia, in which our heroine is making a pop-song-backed montage-trip to her destination; the kind of scene that would otherwise typify hollowheaded Furious-7/Rom-Com style movies--yet how does Zootopia leave that sequence feeling closer to Potemkin than Pootie Tang? The montage cuts between establishing shots that are traveling closer to the center of Zootopia, but a crucial difference between this and the Cliché is, one visual element is shared by all subsequent shots; the Heroine's Vessel. The train defines the narrative purpose of each shot as taking the hero closer to their destination, instead of just showing how the second unit had virtual cameras running everywhere along the way to the city. The train will also turn out to be part of a Chekhov's armory for a resolution later in the movie.The plot of the movie, once you untangle the Noirish vines it wraps itself in, is a plucky young bunny heroine becomes a cop and flies to the Big City with a buoying air of idealism under her wings; she's here to Change the World. Make it a better place than she thinks it is. It's worse. She'll meet a shifty fox who'll challenge and disillusion her as much she'll amuse and enamor him. They'll earn from each other a reciprocal respect and more, and together, they'll make an indomitable, unlikely duo. It's the plot of a thousand movies, The Silence of the Lambs is the best of the kilo, and Zootopia runs a few paces behind it.The animation in the film is great enough to meet the greatest expectations, with an added layer most of the time missing; the characters are allowed to have nonverbal (and we guess off-screen) dramatic reactions to the proceedings, and every revisiting of the feature deepens them farther; they have an existence of their own, and aren't just saying their dialogue because wisecracks would be funny in a family movie. They own their platitudes. A rare feat. One aspect I loved even further is the Rainforest District, a rain-beaten Neo-noir Verde-vista which the characters unwisely visit and are met with a feline misadventure. It's a bold step for an animated/otherwise-Disney film to have a section in its World that isn't colored like fruit drops...and has fierce Carnivora that leap at us to equalize our interspecific excitements.Most of the humor in the movie is generic; it's all the usual high-speed-chase falling-from-a-bridge humor that drew its last laughs in the 90s. By now it should be plagiarism. Yet, because it's character-centered here, and the movie lets us warm to its characters, it's like a friend telling you an old joke, you laugh not because it's funny again, but you're glad you're having the time together.There is a substantial flaw however. The narrative bears an over-reliance on off-screen events and obscurant camera placement; the only way the screenplay knows how to resolve an urgency is pulling a resolvent carrot out of a hat; you didn't see us hide this! It wears itself into contrivance. There's also an overstatement of visual information using reiterative flashbacks. Kids should use their memories even at the movies.One of the few scenes that have wrought the teaspoonful of half-negative reviews the film has gotten is the Sloth sequence at a DMV office. If the movie is against stereotyping, then oh, why are all the sloths with jobs and speaking roles in it lethargic, as if constrained by their biological limitations even in a family film? Those who complain about this scene didn't stay for the epilogue to see the setup subverted. It's what marks the difference between good satire and generic parody; satire sets up the tropes again within its own story's context to demolish them with focus, yet parody just gobbles up the setups made in other works and belches lazy punchlines. The sloth sequence was necessary to prove a counterpoint, instead of simply stating one.""We may be evolved, but deep down, we're still Animales.."" so observes a Mr. Big in the film. He's paraphrasing a compagno of his, from an earlier version of himself, who said about black folks, ""They're Animals anyway. So let them lose their souls."" Of course, his compagno, in spite of being a Sabre-toothed ligature-toting predator, excluded himself from the Animales subcategory; he didn't even presume to be the gamekeeper. I know, I'm annoying you, comparing a 'kiddie movie' to a god-daddie movie, but one thing the confronto illustrates, even the dimmest film characters are evolving, at least on the top shelf of the art form.In this era where movies are blighted by on-the-nose dialogue (even very good ones like Interstellar) and fortune-cookie messages, sometimes with very sour fortune cookies, we seldom open the valves of our hearts to them.A lifetime's worth of product-line-assembled mediocrities has given us constrictive pericarditis.Zootopia is like a pericardiectomy that peels away that hardened pericardium, and lets our hearts expand with joy again...if only for 108 minutes and 32 seconds. Until we walk out of the screening and are assaulted by the Batman v Superman posters outstaying their welcome on the cinema walls, that fill our ventricles with venom again; not a result of the counterfeit product they're marketing being powerful enough, or powerful at all, to make us feel anything by itself; all it does and can do is steer backwards (and blindly) from every paragraph in this review. No half-good movie would ever do that.I love movies more than most things (anything?), but, I prefer to hate them; it's much more fun to frame-by-frame them, and deconstruct their technique than to futilely mine them for oft-nonexistent Deeper Meaning. Zootopia earns a high grade on both levels; it's the rare big movie you actually root for at the movies.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Good deliverance, bad idea","One thing has to be said about this Disney piece: it is propaganda. Yes, you read right. This is the right name for when a false idea is presented as 100% truth.

Great animation (*), decent story(*), nice dialogue(*) and probably a crazy budget. Everything you need. Hence my 3 stars. If only I wasn't so annoyed after watching it with my kid!Now, obviously this was made with children in mind, and so the tendency to present the world in pink light is not a bad idea. ""Zootopia"", however, takes it to the extreme and beyond. It sells a lie. It is, in fact, a metaphor of a liberal, multi-culture mix of society, where everybody should turn the other cheek, be politically correct and accept/tolerate just about everything. Just because tolerance is such a nice word. And because the predators can be tamed. And learn to eat carrots.Well, reality check. They can't.

Animated movie with powerful social message,"Zootopia is a great example of an animated movie that has something to offer for all ages. The crisp animation combined with witty social commentary makes it an enjoyable watch.The plot is simple; a rabbit named Judy Hopps is the first of her kind to become a police officer and faces many social challenges on her path to success. I will spare the details, but her journey involves a detailed crime investigation in tandem with a sly fox. The story is not entirely predictable and moves at a decent pace to keep the viewer engaged. I like that the movie encompasses various movie genres, which is characteristic of an excellent animated movie. Music is average, but can safely be overlooked.The most impressive parts are the commentary on various social issues as well as the small details that are paid close attention to. The characteristics of each animal was clearly studied well, and there were no logical discontinuities with the facts. It makes the viewer think a little and confirm that each animal's features are indeed sensible. The film stays grounded in realism and this sets the perfect tone for delivering social messages pertaining to classism. This could have easily been cliché if the movie deviated from logic too much, but the right balance was achieved by Zootopia.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The best Disney movie since The Lion King.,"As expected from an animated picture of Disney's caliber, I like it a lot. The animation and the different settings they showed throughout the movie were amazing; the chemistry between Judy and Nick was interesting enough. The anthropomorphic characters are entertaining because they're relatable and the film balances the human elements with the whole ""animal world"" very well. I think that's where the film shines the most and hence the high reviews it's getting. Usually for Disney films (and even Pixar) they only focus on one aspect; human condition or a fantasy premise. So you can say Zootopia is sort of breaking new ground by trying to do both. The only comparison I can think of that tries to match what Zootopia is doing is Pixar's Monsters Inc.Of course, like most good Disney pictures where it can be appreciated by both kids and adults alike; but through other reasons, Zootopia's brilliance lies in the important message that the film offers. It's straight-forward since aspects of it such as the ""under-dog"" story is something you see in a lot of animated movies. However, I liked how the plot manages to develop beyond that into a/the bigger picture.My only criticisms about the movie is the humor might not cut through enough to people as it's mostly witty banter and subversive. Besides that, I think a film like Zootopia, it would work MUCH BETTER as a Pixar film rather than a Disney film.Pixar films like Inside Out and Wall-E manages to deal with important themes more intelligently than Disney films like Zootopia while at the same time making the film entertaining to watch as an animation. I'm not saying those 2 films are necessarily better than Zootopia; but I'm saying they (Pixar) handle the aspect of trying to get a real-life applicable point across better. Personally for me, I prefer it when the film doesn't info-dump you with stale exposition especially if it's within one scene and keep the subtext conveying subtle across the whole picture. It might sound contradictory to what my main point is compared to the end of my opening paragraph since relating to that, I know the film-makers were trying to mesh out both a dazzling and subversive animated flick but the 2nd half of the film greatly focuses on the latter aspect. So my first impression when I was watching the ending was it tried to ""hammer in"" too much on the human subtext and should've mix it up with the fun animated stuff like in the middle parts of the film. To sum up what I'm saying, the tone of the climax (of the film) could've been handled a bit better so that way Zootopia's themes can be addressed as a wider scope for an enhancing experience.Overall, this film is on my top 10 list of my favourite animated movies and I enjoyed the technical merits more than my own personal enjoyment of the film since the humour didn't strike me that well at times. And to be honest, the funniest scene in Zootopia was already shown in the preview trailers (which I saw prior). I still found it hilarious the second time when watching the actual movie. So maybe that's actually a compliment to the execution of the film's humour despite what I said otherwise earlier?Zootopia is quite possibly the best Disney movie of the last decade since The Lion King.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An animated animal film about today's social and racial issues that hits the right spots,"Imagine a world like the one we people live in, only we are all animals. And not just some animals, all animals together. Zootopia is one of Disney's films from this year and it has really become an international success. In this world of animals, a lot of them grow up into already decided places and positions. If you are a bunny, you should become a carrot farmer. Judy Hopps is exactly that kind of bunny, born and raised outside of the city of Zootopia. She decides at an early age to become something more. After graduating from the police academy as the first bunny ever to do so, she moves to the big city. She soon discovers that it is a long way to the top and not everyone in the animal world is getting along as well as she thought. She is quickly drawn into kidnappings that go higher up than anyone in Zootopia could have imagined. Great voice actors lent their voices for the film, such as Jason Bateman, Idris Elba and Ginnifer Goodwin.Firstly I got to say that I was positively surprised. Partly due to the fact that the film was awesome, but also because it really wasn't at all what I expected. Sure it is a family film but forget the standard family film formula. We are talking Swedish Beck and Wallander combined with American police films. Sometimes the film is actually scary and exciting, but most of all it is well thought out. We follow mostly Hopps and and Nick Wilde the fox, as they struggle to discover who or what's behind the mysterious kidnappings. We are even offered some plot twists and just when you thought we were getting close to the end, the film takes another turn and becomes something else. Very strong and bravely done by Disney.Zootopia's strongest points lies in the relationship between the animals. It is a ""the small person against the big"" film. Hopps is a small herbivore among predators that for a long time ago used to eat animals like her. Anti-racial messages and tolerance is clearly visible in the film. It does not try and hide the fact that we may all look different and have various preferences, but we are all equal and deserving of a chance in life. When you sometimes think that the film will end, the filmmakers does not hesitate to twist it one more time and deliver another punch to our heads about moral and value. Zootopia could be Disney's most political and strongest equality praising film to date. It will certainly remain for a long time in my memory because it dares to ask us these difficult questions and also to venture outside of the frames of the family film genre and sometimes become almost a thriller. Very high level of surprise and entertaining for a family film. Disney Animation Studio's best animated film in yearsDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Disney proves that anything they touch, turns to perfection.","Zootopia is an animated buddy-cop comedy mystery film directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore. The screenplay is written by Jared Bush, Phil Jonston and on the main voice-role stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Tommy Chong, J. K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira. Zootopia is a place where all animals, prey and predator live in peace and harmony. A rabbit named Judy Hops dreams of becoming the first rabbit cop ever and on her journey to her dream she runs into a fox, named Nick Wilde. Together they will try to solve a mystery about some missing predator civilians on the city of Zootopia. I personally loved this film and its message with all my heart. I was in tears by the end of the film just because of how beautiful/creative and well done the message about living in peace and together even though we may be different in race and/or other things (e.g. religion, gender etc). The animation is incredible to look at, this movie is an undeniable visual treat every second of it. It is also very funny and references a lot of other famous movies and TV Shows (Breaking Bad). Kids will have a good time marveling at the beautiful animation and the really likable characters, but I feel like adults will be the ones to enjoy this movie the most. The message that comes across is timeless and very much necessary at this point and time. All the voice work is amazing, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fantastic job on the lead role and Jason Bateman delivered that slick fun tone throughout his likable character. The music is composed by the talented Michael Giacchino, who has been very busy recently composing pretty much every amazing soundtrack on a lot of successful movies. He also does a very good job here, with his composition that delivers what is required on certain scenes. This is one fast paced, interesting, funny and feel good animated film that Disney seems to have become masters at making recently. I did not find anything wrong with it all throughout the film, and it is definitely one of my favorite films of 2016 so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Disney really out did themselves,"I was pretty skeptical about this movie before going into the theater, I'd assumed that it was going to be like a slightly better chicken little, so I had my expectations lowered quite a bit before watching this. But dang, this film surprised me, it was amazing! The dialogue, animation, music, humor, everything! Not only that but I can guarantee that adults will enjoy this film instead of just sitting in the theater stuffing popcorn into their mouths. This movie comes with a great message about racism, prejudice, and gender stereotypes. Jason Bateman was spectacular as Nick Wilde along with Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, and with Idris Elba as Chief Bogo. If you think your kid will enjoy this movie, then you'll know you will too.TL;DR A hilarious, nicely animated film with a much more intelligent and well thought out plot that strives miles ahead of what most recent films can ever do.

Zootopia is another enjoyable Disney computer-animated movie,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this tale of a female rabbit wanting to became a cop and then growing up and becoming one in the title city. She's the first of her species to became one as other kinds of animals have been one before her but not a fox, though initially one isn't one yet here either. The fox she encounters in Zootopia is in fact someone different than what she's been familiar with before but I'm ahead of myself. I'll just now say that this was quite a funny and inspirational Disney computer-animated movie with a nice message of anyone can be what they want to be if they work hard enough to reach that goal. So on that note, I highly recommend Zootopia.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"a smart, funny, deeper than you'd expect animated film for adults as much as for kids","Usually Disney means that it lacks a certain edge or quality that makes it 'safe' or palatable for all audiences. While Zootopia is certainly another big blockbuster for the studio, and especially for the filmmakers and animators who have been behind many of the smash successes of the past 10 years (starting with Meet the Robinsons up through now, when John Lasseter took over), it's not a movie with talking animals something that is dumbed down or has a message that gets obfuscated by too much (dumb) goofball comedy (I'm looking at you, Ice Age and Madagascar sequels). This is actually about something in the same way, not quite up to this level but in the same ballpark, as Watership Down or The Fox and the Hound - though the former is certainly darker than this and the latter a little sweeter and more grounded (much as it can be) in the real world, Zootopia is an excellent example of using animals to convey a message about where we are at today.The film might eschew the current horrors of police brutality (hey, it is ultimately a movie that kids can enjoy, and that might be a lot to take in as far as an animated movie with animals), but it is really impactful about telling a good message about a complicated subject: how does the ""melting pot"" work? What happens when groups of people - or animals - converge in one city and have to interact with one another? What happens if the thing that separates the animals, acting without the human qualities (or like savage/aggressive beasts) is amplified to create tensions?And what happens when someone who doesn't fit in has the veracity and intelligence and just will-power to rise to the top of something tries to be accepted in a society where he (or in this case also primarily she) doesn't fit in? What I liked in the movie, aside from it having a very clever police procedural plot (which gets in jokes at the expense of The Godfather, which is nothing new but is done with a very funny Don Corleone parody in a tiny rat, and hippie-""nude"" yoga-ists), is that it is generally about addressing what it means to be the ""other"" in a society. It never comes outright and says ""it's about racism"" point-blank, but it shows it even in something like scale.Some animated films may not pay or draw too much attention to how animals' size differences mark then, but here it's clear from almost the beginning that how small Judy the Bunny is sets her apart from everyone when she's in the city (and likewise how she is bigger than those in the Rodent district, which is a part of Zootopia built for little mice). So it's not hard to see why she is set apart, and yet the movie is more about if you really DO try to make a difference yourself and set yourself apart, you can change things. Maybe. Or you might be looked at as a sly fox your whole life, or a slow sloth. How are you perceived in the world?Though it has a couple of story problems (a story turn two thirds of the way through, which is kind of crammed in to create conflict where it could be handled much better as far as something that separates the two main characters), it's probably my favorite of the recent run of Disney Animated Films productions. And as heavy as I'm making this movie sound it really isn't - it's bright and colorful and the filmmakers have a terrific sense of a whole world that has been built; they could've rested on just one part (the main metropolitan/granite part of the city), but there's so many parts to it that it works for so many possibilities (polar bears, panthers, wolves have their parts of the city) that are seized.It's fresh, clever but also funny, with some excellent performances (Goodwin and Bateman sure, but Elba, Slade and Simmons are very welcome additions with their own personalities), plus it's a cop procedural, and a very good one at that (with a few predictable parts, but it's this kind of movie so I can let it pass).",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
8.5/10,"Tangled, Wreck it Ralph and now Zootopia. It looks like Disney Animation is quickly becoming a pool of great movies. I came out of this one with a smile that covered my whole face and I still find hard to shake it off, this movie blew me away in excitement, fun but most of all heart.One cannot start to talk about Zootopia without mentioning some of the best world building of recent years. other than being animated to perfection, this film is alive, it is engaging even in its background and other than being intelligently thought out, it tells a story only with its world. Be it comedy or social commentary, I just wished multiple times I could put it pause the film or instantly rewatch a scene to absorb everything that was going on. This is a further example of the truly excellent, intelligent visual storytelling animated films are excelling at, especially recently and I remember clearly having a moment in the film in which I was effortlessly happy for cinema and its future, because this was the living proof of correctly using new mediums and technologies to tell a story.And I haven't even started yet talking about the characters of Zootopia. As I was watching the film I thought to myself that these were going to become staples of the genre, that's how good they are. The chemistry between the two main characters is unbelievable and their arch is riveting to watch at every moment, with a fantastic pay off. This film is so well written: be it the running gags, the pop culture references which never end and never miss, the character development, the storytelling, the themes incorporated seamlessly, the emotional connection, the perfect handling of secondary characters, the hilarious, laugh out loud comedic moments, I hope I am not missing anything, all of these were part of screenplay that I am sure I will revisit and study joyfully. I can't believe how much I fell in love with this world and its characters and only now I realized how entertained I was with them, not to mention how absorbing the story proved to be.The film does have its false steps, but none of them really mattered to me. The introduction is somewhat off beat and uneven with the rest, there are a little too many coincidences and whilst the characters are thankfully in danger many times, they are as many times handed a solution to problems which makes things a little too easy for them at times, yet fortunately the film does integrate these very organically to the point were you roll along, without even thinking about it.I wished this film would not end, that's how much fun I was having with it, this is a very recommended watch in the theater, where possibly adults are going to have more fun than kids. Can't wait to check this out again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Review for Zootopia,"This is an animated feature that I'm not fully sure that I'd ever have seen if not for having a child. My wife, Jaime, put this on to see if Mackenzie would watch it. She enjoys these types of films and since we have Disney+, that makes it easier. She also loves animals so there's that as well. She started this on a friend and finished it Sunday when we had time to sit down to watch.We start this off with getting a lay of the world. It is made up of animals. There are your predators and prey. They've learned to live together with Zootopia being a modern marvel where all different climates make up the city. Our main character is Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin). Ever since she was a child, she wanted to be a police officer. It is uncommon for a prey to be in a role like this. It also makes her parents, Bonnie (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) and Stu (voiced by Don Lake), nervous.She is bound and determined to become the first rabbit officer and she does. It isn't what she necessarily thinks though, as she is assigned to being a meter maid. She doesn't let that stop her though. Through happenstance, she lands herself in the middle of an investigation and puts her career on the line to solve it. She gets aid from a conman, Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), who is a fox. The plot that they're uncovering takes them all over Zootopia and the corruption beneath.What I'll say is that this is a fun way to introduce police procedural, crime and even neo-noir to children. It isn't as dark, obviously, but I can see the elements of films like this throughout. Something this does well in playing with animal stereotypes to incorporate into their characters. It also has a good message of not 'judging a book' by its cover by showing that despite these, there are still individuals.What also helps is just having a great cast of voice actors here as well. Bateman is perfect in his role as this sly fox. It fits so well. Goodwin works as his counterpart. They play well off each other. We also get the likes of Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Hunt, Lake, Tommy Chong, J. K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Shakira, John DiMaggio and Tommy Lister Jr., to just name a few. Everyone here is on point for their characters.Then to finish out with filmmaking, since this is Disney, it looks great. I still prefer the old school style of animation, but the colors here pop. They make the different worlds within this city feel real. I love the time and care put into it. Watching this on the 4K TV helps for sure. The animation does look smooth and the different things they do their work. Not one I expected to enjoy as much as I did. I had a lot of fun and would recommend it if you want something that is light-hearted. It does work for the sub-genres that it is paying homage to as well.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Relevant to a fault and gives an important lesson to its young and adult viewers alike bundled in an entertaining package,"There has never been a dearth in good animated movies especially the ones catered to young audience and Zootopia makes no exception. Beneath its charming lead characters, kids friendly action and comedy, an interesting plot and top notch animation lies the premise which is designed to be too metaphorically equivalent to current society which I think could be the only downside to this entertaining romp. Any standard stereotype tag you name it, you got it here - underdog, buddy cop, judgmental society, prejudice, beyond all odds, **spoiler alert** projected-good-character-is-the-villain etc.It is a world where animals of all species have evolved to shed their natural instinct and live harmoniously in the same society. Judy Hopps (voice by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a feisty young bunny from a small town who is determined to become the first bunny cop in Zootopia. Despite the prejudice and the physical limitation, she successfully enrolls and completes the Police training with top honors through sheer hard work and wit. When a sensational case of 13 missing mammals breaks the headlines, the Police Chief Bogo (voice by Idris Elba) overlooks Hopps and assigns her the traffic duty. Her judgmental view on fox species lets her catch a petty thief Nick Wilde (voice by Jason Bateman) a stumble upon a lead on the missing mammals. Clearing obstacle after obstacle she uncovers the abduction of all the missing mammals that points the Mayor Lionheart (voice by J.K. Simmons) as the chief accused. But is it the end of investigation?There are many aspects that contributes to a good movie or story, either some more aspects or bettering the existing ones make them great. But the level of audience connect with the story makes them a classic. Zootopia falls short of the classic level but has everything to make it great. First and foremost, is the story interesting and entertaining? Full marks for that. Are you able to relate to setup and get involved in its plot? Sure. A lead character that you would want to root for, a wily fox that breaks your stereotype, a supremely entertaining Godfather- esque episode, a ROFL worthy extended sequence involving a sloth, a nude sequence that jumps on you, a thrilling chase through the rodent town and many more. It also has a moral on not crossing a limit to get even - which is very important for young viewers.Despite its familiar premise, generous use of stereotypes and pop culture references and a Scooby-Doo style plot - there is a maturity and skilled handling of some sequences which results in winning moments and that's exactly what makes a movie successful. On top of its beautiful animation it is complemented by excellent voice performances and minimal and apt use of background score.Relevant to a fault and gives an important lesson to its young and adult viewers alike bundled in an entertaining package.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.,"This beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.Okay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.All kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.So the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.These days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.The Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A Great Reflection of Today's Society,"With Pixar being owned by Disney, there seems to have been a nice amount of bleed over between the two, Pixar is more consistent with the quality of their films, but every once and awhile a movie of Pixar's quality comes from Disney. We should remember that Disney was once, and in many ways still is the premiere animation company, but not that long ago they had been struggling to put out great films. Zootopia is smart, funny, and is mature in its storytelling and in its message. It's very nice to see a movie directed at kids that has respect and treats kids as people who can understand complex themes, not mindless creatures that need simple clichéd messages.In that respect Zootopia is more like a Pixar film, where Pixar has shown an understanding that complex messages can be the most emotionally powerful and while being complex can be presented in a simple, and straightforward way. Much like Inside Out taught us so much about using our emotions, especially sadness, Zootopia has a great message about fear and the treatment of entire groups of people because of that fear. It's ironic, because the movie indirectly latches onto an issue that is relevant today, with an air of innocence and purity. On top of that at a deeper level, the film is witty, in that everything ties together and that the audience is forced to think as the movie progresses.The humor is witty as well, in particular the scene about the DMV which is so funny because it's spot on. The witty humor and complex messages make this film enjoyable for everybody, not just kids. Every character in the film is given a great amount of thought and development, making it so that they all have moments to grow, and are extremely relatable. Unfortunately the film's villain has good motivations, however at the end when they reveal who the villain is they come across as campy and over the top.The movie does a great job creating an inventive world where animals from all different habitats can coexist in one city. The film then proceeds to partially waste it's inventive world on various scenes that are plucked straight out of other films, namely the Godfather. However, those scenes are only a small takeaway from the movie as a whole, because they don't last very long and are admittedly clever. That along with the overall maturity the screenwriters used still makes the film a great accomplishment.Zootopia never really looked like a film that would be this good, but after seeing the amazing amount of craft and effort, it seems this may be one of the better animated films of the year. The film does what every animated film should do, it tells a solid story with a lot of emotional depth, and a message that can hopefully teach kids important lessons. The film is also funny, smart, beautifully animated, filled with great characters, and features great voice work. If you have kids, and they haven't seen this film yet, it's safe to say they'd enjoy it, but they may possibly take an important life lesson away from seeing it to.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The opposite of unpleasant... Pleasant.,"In 1992, cartoonist Art Spiegelman won the Pulitzer Prize for Maus, which appropriated cuddly, anthropomorphic animals (not at all unlike Disney creatures) for a parable about racism, discrimination, and survival, circa WWII. Flash-forward 24 years, and we finally have Disney's rebuttal. And those years have been good to the House of Mouse, now enough of a franchise super-giant to fire off quirky B-tier flicks like Zootopia, confident enough to surpass Disney's usual standard of impeccable visuals and emotional storytelling to also really be About Something. Zootopia is razor-sharp, outrageously clever, bustling with urgent thematic subtext, and heartfelt enough to reach the realm of Disney classics sure to be heralded as essential canonical viewing for generations of children and adults henceforth.Following (the vastly inferior) The Good Dinosaur as the second consecutive Disney release championing a thriving societal infrastructure where humans don't exist (hmm...), Zootopia is a dazzlingly dense and textured realm almost too detailed to take in at first glance, forcing cinema viewers to acclimatize to the consistent unrequited urge to pause and contemplate. When our protagonist, earnest Officer Hopps (magnificently emotive, infectiously giddy Ginnifer Goodwin), arrives at Zootopia, the film is content to momentarily become a travelogue, drinking in, in a sweeping pan shot, the regions, and size/species/climate sub-communities of the city. Don't worry, though - we'll get to revisit them all later). Before you can think of a better pun than ""face the yaks"", Zootopia has transformed into a buddy (or should I say BUNNY - I thought of one!) cop mystery adventure. As Hopps pairs with irrepressible con-fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman at his most laconic, smugly hilarious), they dive into a romp full of hilarity, exhilarating sequences (including a slew of chases/tussles highlighting the unique physicality of each animal present), and thematic mediation on xenophobia, ideology, and societal power hierarchies. Y'know - kid stuff.Zootopia isn't subtle about being just as issue-driven as story-driven, but nor should it be. Here, the parable of civilized mammals 'going savage' (an interesting contribution to the nature/nurture debate in itself) serves as the perfect catalyst to ignite age-old discriminatory tensions between tenuously co-habitating predator and prey (including some genuinely upsetting sequences), in a fashion perfectly suited to contextualize privilege, racism, and wage and influence-gaps to children - heck, even for adults. But in case that gets too heavy (and Zootopia, while jaunty and fast-paced, has its fair share of vintage Disney darkness), it's tempered with some on-point one- liners to snarkily soften the blow (""a bunny can call another bunny cute, but you can't""/""you can't just touch a sheep's wool!!""), with only the occasional clunky line reeking of kid-friendly rewrites to distract from the revelry. For the kids, there are more Frozen and other Disney nods than you can count (including a genius Alan Tudyk cameo I'll weasel out of spoiling here). For the adults: inspired nudist colony gags, and riffs on the Godfather and Breaking Bad. And yes: that sloth DMV scene is just as funny in theatres as in the umpteen trailers you've seen it in. Trust me.Still, amidst all the ideas, heart, and cutting dialogue, the voice cast are what really hit home. Apart from the superb Goodwin and Bateman, who share delightfully sparky, and sometimes surprisingly emotional banter, the distinctive boom of Idris Elba and bark of J.K. Simmons lend welcome support, while Jenny Slate mumbles so many (yup, I'm going there) sheepish witticisms in the background she's almost worth a second viewing singlehandedly.Zootopia doesn't quite hit the soaring, transcendent emotional heights associated with classic Lion King/Beauty and the Beast era Disney (though many of its smaller moments are just as poignant and well-orchestrated in their own way), as it's really its own (guffaw) animal. But, as a snappier, more expansive, socially conscious cousin, it's still an essential addition to the Disney family, and one that almost insists upon revisiting, if only to properly do justice to. Rich, vibrant, and clever enough to make audiences young and old (night)howl with laughter, Zootopia is the confident work of a peerless studio operating at the top of their game, and necessary viewing as cinema, far surpassing mere animated entertainment.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be off trying to beat that stupidly catchy Shakira chorus out of my head. I moose be rid of it; I can bearly stand it!(...I really otter stop now. But rhino want to.

Also it has positive and motivational messages to all of us.Some people might say that this movie is not genius. Maybe they are right and maybe they are wrong.

The Inside Out of 2016,"Wow, this one surprised me. I saw the early trailers for this movie and had extremely low expectations for this movie, expecting to just be another awful March movie. However, when I saw that it then had a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to go see it. Well, I was wrong to judge it so early just based on the trailer. This movie was absolutely brilliant. It had more to say on relevant issues than a vast majority of adult live-action movies do, and it still found a way to do so in a clever and not overbearing way. The plot, while formulaic, was still interesting and the message and humor more than made up for the relative unoriginality of the plot. The characters in this movie were also rather cliché, but the movie used that nicely to make many points about stereotyping so that can't be used as a negative. This is a must-see for both kids and adults, the best true ""family"" movie in years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Eh.,"To be honest, it's watchable. It's certainly not good, by any means, the movie is way to fast, and the humor barely pushes out a sigh. It's not the worst however, considering the music and songs are phenomenal. I just wish it wasn't so eye-roll inducing. 6/10 could be better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"If nothing else, there is nothing ""Meh"" about it.","Best since the Lion King? Well, I don't know, I'd need to do a side-by-side comparison once it comes out on home media, but it certainly has the potential to be so.See, the problem is that, while this film is indeed good, the few times at which it blunders, it doesn't just blunder a little. It blunders big time.Think of it as being- 95% OMG THIS IS AWESOME, and 5% Oh sweet cheese and crackers, why did they do that?!!Some of the dialogue gets very painfully ham-fisted with the discrimination message, and the characters subsequently come across as tragically unaware because of it.A few of the characters, chief among them (pun not intended) being Chief Bogo, fell into this category so often that I actually thought they were being built up to be the villains (spoiler alert: they're not).Equally frustrating about the discrimination angle is that, when you step back and think about it, there actually is a lot of potential rationale behind a lot of the dialogue getting thrown around, but the movie never really explores that and instead tries to use it as a metaphor for our own prejudices (which, again, when you really think about it, they very clearly are not).The sloths at the DMV? That gets old in about five seconds, but the producers clearly thought it was comedic gold and drove it into the ground, turning what could have been an otherwise cute but forgettable gag into an absolute teeth-pulling aggravation.But that's about it for the bad stuff. These bits are liable to irk you, not because they are so bad, but because the rest of the film is excellent by comparison. Judy Hopps is an excellent protagonist, easily the best female lead character Disney has ever produced and in my top five overall. Nick Wilde also excels as a supporting character, even coming across as amusing and likable early when the movie clearly does not want us to feel that way about him yet.The best part about these two characters, and the way they interact with each other, is that, despite being depicted as total contrasts, they are both smart, constantly one-upping and shooting one-liners at each other, so much so that you are guaranteed not to pick up all of them in your first viewing.One scene, for example, has Judy quip after tallying up a figure that ""we (rabbits) are good at multiplying."" I didn't realize that this was a double-meaning until much later, not because I didn't get it (there's another joke about rabbits and the way they breed that is much more ham-fisted in its delivery), but because I was too busy laughing at everything else going on during this scene to even notice it.Some of the absolute best scenes (and thank Jaguar Jesus, there are many of them) are when Nick and Judy are alone and just talking. They have some of the best dialogue -- the best character interaction -- in any animated film that I can remember, so much so that I would honestly be interested in a spin off TV series or set of animated shorts that was just the two of them sharing an apartment or chatting while on patrol. They are that good together.The plot, though a clear and obvious (and often clumsy) metaphor for discrimination, is by no means predictable, and while you will likely figure right from the start that the character being set up as the villain is not the villain, it will make you wonder if there even IS a villain.Spoiler alert: There is a villain. And the big reveal of who it is isn't that surprising since some of the earlier-revealed accomplices are the same species. But while it is obvious who is going to be revealed as the main villain at the climax, it did still surprise me (albeit not in hindsight) to know in advance that was who it was going to be.And frankly, the big tragedy of them not getting more into the dynamics behind their stereotypes is that it would have been an opportunity to better explore the setting. Zootopia is the most compelling setting -- the greatest foundation for an entire franchise -- that Disney has ever produced.A sequel? Pfft. Zootopia warrants sequels, prequels, spin off movies, spin off TV series, an entire theme park of its own and a multi-server MMORPG. It is THAT GOOD.This movie's faults are glaring, absolutely, and it's a tragedy that they were not addressed, because everything else is pure epic awesomeness. Just go into it knowing what its drawbacks are and you will leave being ticked off at me for not giving this a 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Adorable,"The film displays many discourses on real world subjects and for that I give this a thumbs up. Though it may not explicitly refer to the real world, there are definitely similarities in Zootopia in which children growing up can extend to their world. The stereotyping based on appearance and 'biology' was a big theme in the film, and ultimately hints at race (that is how I interpreted it anyhow). I feel that the film did a great job at discussing the stigma attached to certain appearances, as well as finding a resolution to this way of thought. Appearances do not govern who we are, and biology does not dictate who we become.Additionally, the script is superb and keeps audiences engaged. The voice actors did a great job - as did the animators, to create the life of these characters. I also really loved (and was also somewhat annoyed by) the addition of the sloths. They added a comedic and recurrent comedic effect, and their slow motion is both hilarious and frustrating to watch.Though I do think the characters and voice actors complemented each other well, I noticed that certain characters would have accents. For example, the 'mafia' like character, Mr. Big (Maurice LaMarche) has a typical Latino type accent and the yoga instructor Nangi (Gita Reddy) has an Indian accent. I was quite taken aback by this and though it is great to have diversity in the cast, the film should not encourage the stereotyping of race and character. Also, large characters seemed to have loud booming voices that correlated to their size, and smaller characters tended to have softer, squeaky voices. Size does not determine pitch of voice, and this reinforces the idea that people who do not conform to this ideal is abnormal.Overall, this is a fun and engaging film with good discourses but disappointing voice stereotypes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Great characters, poor plot conclusion","Zootopia has some really great characters (specifically the protagonist, the fox, the arctic shrew, the mayor, assistant mayor, the police officers are ALL great) and a great message (against bigotry). However, the way the plot concluded was pretty lame. I prefer movies that allow you to see the conclusion was present all along, whereas Zootopia pretty much pulled a deus ex machina (especially the way the ""villain"" was surrounded all of a sudden).",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Simply put: Absolutely Stunning!,"Zootopia is one of the most simple-clever films to ever make it to the multiplex. By simple-clever, I mean the making of prejudice be conveyed in a blurry way that is visually shown here to not be so easy to battle but can be overcome with persistence, amidst a backdrop of Disney's most colourful and diverse fictitious cities ever put to film.Zootopia has the creative nutrients kids lack in their cultural diet these days: an easy to think idea being used as the template of a story that relates to the struggles one kid might face at school, and the thought of easing hostility in everyday life. Disney has gotten away with making one of if not the first fully animated satirical neo-noir film meant for kids.Needless to say, Zootopia is gorgeous, multi-layered, and smarter than you'd think by simply looking at the posters. Disney have mastered their computer imagery for the world of Zootopia and it has payed off wonderfully.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Zootopia - Continuation of Disney Greatness,"Well, Disney has done it again. Zootopia has volume in its complexity, message, and characters, along with some risk taking values that's brings the classic Disney back on screen. This is a film that explains what made Disney great in the past for the reasons of taking chances with a compelling, funny story and premise. They take the simple idea of animals living in the city and bring us the next great animated film. This may be a comedy like most animated films, but deep down this is something more. If you look deeper into the film for its meaning it actually handles today's problems with socialism, and racism in a very comical, and non-offensive manner. Prey vs. predator, they each treat each other differently because of their differences. This film teaches us to deal with differences, and help anyone at any time. Nowadays animated films are a force to be reckoned with, and this is a perfect example. Now to grade.

The storyline was well-written, everything was well explained and I really enjoyed it. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and some of them were really likeable. Of course, the graphics and effects of the movie were amazing and they were very well edited. I have to admit that it was a kinda funny movie and there were some really funny scenes. Also, it was a very intense movie and I really liked the whole mystery vibe of the film. The opening scene of the movie was really good and very promising. The ending scene was definitely expected, but I really liked it. Moreover, that movie had some unexpected plot twists and they were all very clever.

Zootopia is surprisingly great!,"Disney has another classic on there hands with Zootopia! Its a very fun and action-packed buddy cop comedy starting a fox and a bunny, and it works perfectly. Goodwin and Batemen are perfect in their roles and have great chemistry together as the films leads. The world of Zootopia is awe inspiring as well. You're gonna want to visit this city after you watch the movie. The movie also has deep messages about racism and discrimination, which I never expected from a Disney movie about animals, but it is done in such a great way that, like most things in this movie, it works great. My only real complaint is the character of Gazelle. She has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the movie, and is only there to sing the new Disney pop song.

Fun for all the family,"Zootropolis centres around a bunny, whose life-long dream is to become a cop, and a fox, initially a criminal but this is a Disney movie so it was never going to end that way, who end up working together to find a missing otter.

Unlike most people I didn't looove Frozen, I actually fell asleep watching it, so I was worried. But Zootopia exceeded my expectations with a compelling story, it's good. The story is interesting and smart. It deals with societal issues in a very witty way because it caters to kids as much as adults, which is probably why there is a certain predictability about the characters but it's not at the cost of the story or the message behind it.It's a Disney animation movie so of course there're positive teachable messages in the movie, perseverance, tolerance, open-mindedness, all wrapped in a funny and touching movie with characters that you'll root for and love.Zootopia is a good time at the movies, you'll laugh and be entertain as much as the kids.

Alright Disney Animated Film,This is a great animated film for all viewers to watch and enjoy. The crew did a splendid job in creating this animated film. There were multiple great references throughout this film. The storyline was strong and terrific. The cast selection was brilliant. They really committed to the storyline. This animated film by Disney reveals to viewers that everyone in the world has full control of themselves nor their lives. I definitely do not have any kind of control of my own life. My whole life has always been taken hostage. I cannot do anything freely. The people who are in my life are the ones who are controlling my life and everything that I do.

"Funny, heartfelt, creative, and teaching a strong lesson in prejudice, Zootopia roars as one of Disney's strongest films.","When one thinks of animation, walking and talking animals come to mind. Even at the start of animation, characters like Mickey Mouse and Felix the Cat were human-like animals that were the stars of the genre as they could speak to everyone and still be as entertaining as any human. Warner Brothers has the Looney Tunes, which is full of anthropomorphic animal-characters that perform vaudeville routines like a regular human comedian. MGM has Tom and Jerry, the ultimate battle to the death as a cat and mouse should, yet still make their slapstick comedy relatable enough for people to connect with. Now Disney has an interesting note with walking, talking animals.Despite having a mascot that's anthropomorphic, Disney haven't made much content with human- like animals. 101 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp and The Jungle Book has such creatures, but live in a world full of people that are the dominant species. In the case of an entire world of animals, I can only think of Robin Hood (which I really like) and Chicken Little (which I consider one of Disney's worst) that have pulled that off. Zootopia takes that same idea, but really takes advantage of the environment it creates to create something really unique.Judy Hopps (played by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a bunny who has always wanted to be a cop. She's constantly told by everyone, even her parents, that bunnies cannot be police officers due to their size and cute look. She proves them wrong and passes the police academy first in her class and a position in the metropolis of Zootopia. Though promised that she would receive the same treatment like her fellow officers, her police captain Chief Bogo (played by Idris Elba) assigns her parking duty. Rather then complain, she takes her new assignment with excitement, hoping her work effort will lead to something better.After arresting a thieving weasel, she given a chance to find a missing otter within forty-eight hours or risk having to resign. The only clue she has is a photo from where Emmet Otterton was last seen. She finds a clue that leads her to a sly, con artist fox Nick Wilde (played by Jason Bateman). Though she has a prejudice against foxes (due to her past), they team up to find the otter. Their various clues take them to a nudist club run by a Yak (played by Tommy Chong), a DMV run by sloths, and even a crime boss shrew named Mr. Big in order to discover the bigger mystery within the city.When I heard about Zootopia, I wasn't sure if more could be offered to the anthropomorphic animal setting. I was not only proved wrong, but this blew me away. The folks at Disney should be city designers as Zootopia feels like a legitimate city with it's various sections. From the desert to the tundra and even a section for rodents, the city could rank up with Los Angeles in Blade Runner or Gotham in Batman. I'll be surprised if something from this movie is not incorporated into the Disney Parks.The voice acting is simply perfect with Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as a good set of buddies in this cop story. Speaking of mysteries, the case to be solved was very intriguing and manages to pull off a moral that's perfect with the recent news stories of racism and gender discrimination. I assume that Disney had wanted to tell a story on racism and prejudice for a while and Zootopia should get the adults to think while keeping the children entertained with some great slapstick that remains fast and essential to the plot.I'll give this ten Nick Wildes out of ten. While Frozen may have been the major Disney movie that people wouldn't stop talking about, Zootopia has a chance to divert that attention as it already has for me. I highly recommend this for everyone, especially for adults, even if they claim they don't like animation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wildly entertaining and fun for the whole family,"When Disney Animation Studios releases a new picture, it is almost guaranteed to gain an outstanding receipt at the box office. Disney has managed to come with many great surprises over the last six decades, and although there have been a few disappointments every now and then, they have proved to have effective standards on gaining the attention of audiences everywhere. In this new Disney animated picture, Ginnifer Goodwin does the voice of Judi Hopps, a bunny with the dreams of becoming the first bunny to be a cop instead of settling with a typical bunny job of farming carrots, much to the doubt of every other animals in the world. Standing against all odds, she makes it through the police academy and wins position as a cop in the police department headed by a rhino Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Alba) of Zootopia, a city where all animal types, predator and prey, get along well. When a case of fourteen missing otters comes up, Judi steps up and volunteers for the case and is given 48 hours to crack the case with the help of a con artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman). Featuring a supporting cast of Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, J.K Simmons, Don Lake, Octavia Spencer, Shakira, and many others; this animated picture brings solid laughter to please kids and adults alike while conveying its deep crucial message that resonates with the issues that go on in our society today.I was utterly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It took me by a surprise on many levels. While it succeeds on bringing decent family-friendly laughter and eye-popping state-of-the-art animation that shows how far we have come along with technology with recent years, one of the most surprising aspects comes from its political message about society and the issues that America struggles with today. One of which is racism. As the story follows a bunny who pursues her dreams of becoming a police officer while battling the doubt of many who believe bunnies are too small and weak to survive as cops, it underlines an example of how racism and prejudice still affects our society. And as the film progresses, it digs deeper and deeper into this theme and the message grew more powerful, giving the story a more intellectual feel while still entertaining the audiences with its light-hearted humor. And the movie balances this so well that to where it can appeal to both adults, children, and even teens alike. While kids may not pick up on its message and just shrug off depending on their age, they will nonetheless find joy and laughter at the uplifting story and outgoing humor. Yes, there are a few jokes that only adults will pick up on, but plenty of kids jokes are thrown out here as well. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are both fantastic as the two main characters, the same goes for Idris Alba as the rhino who at first has doubts for Judi serving for the police department for the small little bunny she is. The film also has a message about not giving up and following your dreams regardless of what people tell you, and I think that is an important message kids will to come learn.Zootopia is by far one of the best animated features I have seen in a long time, and one every family should go see. It is very funny, very original, and astoundingly entertaining on many levels. And it is pretty safe to say this movie could make a contender for the Best Animated Picture at the Oscars.

There was nothing necessary or soul quenching about it,"This was a quintessential Disney experience. It was cute and clever and it pandered to every stereotypical Disney emotion.

Also, ""don't judge someone based on their heritage alone, you have to give them a chance to show their true self before making any assumptions."" All nice, all well and good, but redundant.We are in a metropolis in a world where all animals live in peace, except humans who are somehow non-existent. Predators no longer prey on weaker species. Lions and gazelles live together in harmony. Rats, moles, rabbits, foxes, wolves, bears, they're all living and working together in this world, having evolved past their respective savage natures. How? Its unclear. Is this at all possible in some fictionalized historical timeline? Perhaps, perhaps no, but if one is asking about possibilities in a Disney movie one is looking at it all wrong. It isn't about what's possible. Anything is possible. Its about does this make any sense, and to me, this concept was clever but it made no sense. It seemed to have been thrown together for the sake of a few jokes. And really the jokes did work, but to have an entire premise built solely for the purpose of leading to some animal jokes is lazy and flimsy.I did enjoy the movie, on a very superficial level. But it gave my soul nothing it needed. The message fell flat for me because I have found one cannot be anything one wants. I do not mean that cynically, I mean it as a practicality. If everybody were to be exactly what they wanted to be, the world would descend into chaos. A few of the jokes were funny, especially the ones involving the sloths, and the concept as I said was cute and clever.

It's ""harmonious"" because predators and prey live and work together without stereotypes and labels.Well -- that's what everyone wants to believe, but reality is a bit more messy. This is what a young female bunny named Judy learns when she pursues her dream to become a police officer. She also stumbles onto a mysterious case ... and things get interesting.It may sound a bit corny and adolescent, but the story and themes aren't. It's well-written with clever dialog, an engaging plot mystery and likable characters.Plus, ""Zootopia"" is like this big world with different zones or habitats for different types of animal species. It's a pretty cool concept in itself.The only thing I didn't like is that much of film's environments are too dark (visually) with gloomy skies and a general lack of vibrant colors. Better background color contrast would have been nice too. I'm going to guess this was a stylistic call to highlight something about the story -- but I don't think it was worth it.Anyhow, that notwithstanding, I'd say this is a great movie for kids - lots of action, fun characters and nice variety of visual locations and props.For the adults: if you enjoy movies like Shrek and the Lego Movie, you might enjoy this movie. It has less wit than those movies, but still has a lot of fun dialog and a good timely story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Versatile Disney Takes On PC Culture,"Ever since the turn of the 2010s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has been skyrocketing than ever before with great momentum. From an aspiring restaurateur who became a frog, a princess with long magical hair, a bad guy wanting to be good, a tale of two sisters, and even a troubled boy with his inflatable robot companion. For their latest flick called Zootopia, it's an intriguing caper comedy that not only spoofs the buddy-cop detective formula or noir like in 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but also tackles the themes that exist in PC (politically correct) culture. In this day and age, political correctness has been ongoing with the media exploiting the misunderstandings and atrocities happening in current events such as injustice and discrimination. Thinking back on the old 1946 Disney film Song of the South featuring characters Br'er Fox and Br'er Rabbit, that's where PC is finally drawn into this movie's characters and ""species-ism"" is tested.Jason Bateman (Horrible Bosses, Paul) voices con artist, street smart fox Nick Wilde as he makes a living in the animal-inhabited metropolis hustling various individuals. At the same time rural rabbit Judy Hopps (voiced by Once Upon A Time's Ginnifer Goodwin) has just arrived in the big city to begin her first day as the first rabbit officer. Although swift, skilled, and able to hold out on her own, fellow officers don't exactly see her capable of reaching their ranks. It's up to both natural enemies to work together when a crime is committed in the seemingly blissful Zootopia, while at the same time learning that they're not so different from each other.I have to say that in the studio's current Revival Era, the animators have really stepped it up a notch by exploring a PC-coated world completely devoid of all humans and where anthropomorphic animals dominate compared to childhood Disney classics I remembered in the 90s. I'm aware that this ""human-less"" concept has been done before for many decades during Walt Disney's lifetime and even after his passing, but it looks like nearly everything actually stands out from spoofed product placements to the current trends of music, technology, fashion, and lifestyle. Disney's 1973 movie Robin Hood helped open that door when adding animals in place of the usual human characters, but this time more attention to detail from the largest to the tiniest in the architectural designs looking like a cross between Times Square and Dubai (heck, even a hint of San Fransokyo). And then there's its inhabitants; they are what makes this entire movie look appealing, inviting, relatable, and immersive. Gazelle's (Shakira) song ""Try Everything"" was also pretty entrancing to my ears. Disney easter eggs are also pleasing to keep a look out for (try finding some!)To conclude, although the movie does slightly ride off its rails in some scenes involving the lack of exploring further into the other regions that connect to the big city and a concept of an individual who is ostracized based on who they are or what they look like is vaguely similar to 2012's Wreck-It Ralph; it recovers with a thoughtful moral about the big city with real-life social issues and stereotypes being overwhelming and even troubling at times. Basically, a kid version of the 2004 Oscar-winning film Crash. But it's really about finding your true potential and not letting naysayers get the better of you. This isn't just some kids' movie, there's thematic material adults may relate to as well. I can already predict Oscar nods awaiting, too. Go see it and find out for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Surprisingly Good!,"Zootopia is the latest Disney animated film from their own animation studio. From seeing the advertising for the film I had no ambition to see this movie in the slightest. However, after seeing the positive reviews and the praise the film has been getting from people I decided to give it a look finally. I have to say this is probably the most mature animated film from Disney since the Incredibles, which is saying a great deal.Now, I thought I was in trouble with this film at the very beginning. Honestly, the first fifteen to twenty minutes is my biggest grip with the movie. You have Hopps dreaming of being a police officer and everyone else putting her down saying it's impossible, even her own parents, and she has to prove her worth. It's a theme that's been done to death in movies, especially kids movies. It's not even especially bad in its execution, but it's just very heavy-handed and formulaic.Fortunately, once we get past those first twenty minutes and we get into the mystery angle of the movie it gets much better. The mystery angle is easily the pest part of this film. The whole ""don't judge a book by its cover"" theme is still present but I think it's handled in a much better way. It even goes to a place that I did not expect a film like this to go. Though, they do kind of go back on it by the end I was still amazed they went there at all.The second best thing is the characters. I really do like the two leads, Hopps and Wild. Wild is my favorite character definitely. The side characters are also a lot of fun.The animation is on-point, as well as the voice acting. Every voice fit their respective character perfectly. The action is also quite well-done and engaging. I also loved the artwork, especially of the city itself. The humor is also quite good. There were some jokes that were typical but most hit. There was this one scene where they straight-up parodied The Godfather and it was hilarious. It was the funniest thing in the entire flick.I also loved the design of Zootopia and its various sectors it has. The colors are so vibrant and the animation is great. From that to the people and their interactions with each other really brings this city alive and makes it feel like a real city.Overall, Zootopia is the best animated film from Disney since Frozen. It has a great cast of characters, a great mystery, great action, great art and animation, and a good portrayal of its many themes, adult themes, even if it felt fisted at times. I think this definitely a great film for the entire family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A Disneyfied, thrilling neo-noir","Walt Disney studios has been anthropomorphizing animals since before any of us were born, and it goes to show that they picked up a couple of tricks along the way. What an amazing world they have created for this movie, with tons of great details both in the forefront and in the background. Some jokes were obvious, while some I'm sure go over the head of the mostly young audience that will see this movie. The different parts of the city, how the animals live together despite physical differences, all of it is a delight to watch. And it's rendered beautifully.There are some parts of this movie that I'm not that big a fan of. The visual style of this movie is nice, but it's also very similar to what we have seen before. In Frozen, Tangled and this, we see Disney turning the style used in their traditional animation movies being converted into these computer generated styles. Maybe it is because other studios has also taken inspiration from Disney's old movies, but the animals in this movie mostly look very similar to what we have seen before in Dreamworks movies, for instance. While it was all still beautiful, the characters all felt like (really nice) ""stock CGI-models"".The ending was a bit of a let down too. It's as ""noir"" as the rest of the movie, but underwhelming. Most likely because they did not want to go ""darker"", as this is a Disney-movie. Obviously we can't expect it to go as far as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", but a bit more would have helped.All in all, it's a really fun movie that everyone can enjoy. I saw this in a ""surpise screening"" at the local art cinema (with a room full of cinephiles), and everyone seemed to enjoy it a lot. Despite there not being a single child in attendance. People were laughing and crying, jumping in their seats and going ""aww"". Disney knows their stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Disney Does it Again With Zootopia!,"The Disney film Zootopia is set in a world where animals have evolved and now live much like humans do. The film Zootopia centers on the rabbit with a big dream, the up beat, lovable, Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin (Walk the Line, Once Upon a Time). Judy Hopps was a small town rabbit with dreams of being a respected and loved police officer, who moves to the city Zootopia. While Judy is indeed successful in becoming a cop, notably the first ever rabbit to do so, she is still overlooked by everyone, including Police Chief Bogo, voiced by Idris Elba (Pacific Rim, The Jungle Book) and assigned to parking duty.However, Judy takes it upon herself to begin an investigating. A series of local disappearances, Judy needs the help of Nick Wilde, voiced by Jason Bateman (Starsky and Hutch, Horrible Bosses), a con artist fox she had previously encountered. With her job on the line, the two begin to discover the disappearances in Zootopia are tied into a conspiracy and a cover-up involving some locals.""The Big D"", better known as Disney has 80 years or more of experience making animated films, so saying that Disney has made another family film is not anything particularly noteworthy. It is what we have come to expect. While best known for their musicals, princesses, and prince charming, Disney animation has been on a roll of late with animated movies with a message. Like the Academy Award winning Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph. However, Zootopia is not simply another fun Disney animated movie. It is one of the greatest Disney animated movies I have seen in the last ten years.From a technical standpoint, Zootopia is top notch. The animation is gorgeous. All of the animals look spectacular. Each creature looks alive, real, and emotional on screen. Action scenes are fun, exciting, and a joy to watch. I have not seen Disney to great-animated action sequences like this since Toy Story 2. The action scenes will have you gasping, on the edge of your seat, and invested in the moment. The world is so colorful, bold, and a world you actually want to invest in. Accordingly, the voice cast works well. In addition to Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman we get the talents of J.K. Simmons (Spider-Man, Whiplash), Idris Elba, and musical artist Shakira, among others. Every actor and character is perfectly matched!To Heavy of a Message for a Kids Film?The story is so much more than just a buddy cop film, between a fox and a rabbit. The film is clever, has great inside reference jokes, there are a lot of jokes for adults that will go way over kids' head (references to The Godfather, the DMV, and Breaking Bad, for instance), but there's plenty for younger audiences to laugh at, too, and it all comes wrapped in great messages about courage, empathy, tolerance, teamwork, and the dangers of reducing others to stereotypes. I know this is a kid's movie, and this may not be politically correct. But, this movie has cojones (I'm talking' 'bout balls)! For a kid's film to tackle on the subject of race, stereotypes, relations, profiling, discrimination and bullying is really brave.Everyone can connect to this movie, and that what makes it beautiful. You can view it multiple times, and still learn something new. Something new about yourself, something new about society, some new jokes, overall something amazing every time for kids and adults. My only complaint about this film is, for a kid's movie, it is a little lengthy. Also, I am not sure if kids will understand the entire message, and laugh as much as they would like to.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Zootopia. It is Clever and heartwarming, it has vibrant visuals, an amazing story line, and a message for the world. A message that we as a society cannot fully grasp, but an animated movie helps us along the way. This is why I like movies. They teach, inspire, and make us connected. Also, Shakira plays a singing pop star Gazelle in the movie. I thought I would never say this, but that was a sexy gazelle! I believe the Disney film Zootopia earns a9/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Smart, uplifting and entertaining","Zootopia is the film that really confirms that Disney's second Renaissance is more than just a quick blip. With a heartfelt and often moving central theme, stunning animation, fantastic voice performances and an uplifting and fun-loving vibe, Zootopia had me smiling ear to ear from beginning to end.The main thing that strikes you about this film is how much it delves into its main theme, about the celebration of diversity and combating propaganda that creates a climate of fear. It's a very timely topic too, considering developments in the world over the last decade or so, but the thing that's so brilliant about Zootopia is that it brings across its message in a positive and uplifting way.Yes, it may feel a little overly preachy at times, but in the end, that doesn't matter as much, because the way that this film looks at its main theme is so upbeat. That's all emphasises by the wonderful main character, a budding young rabbit named Judy Hopps who manages to become the first bunny cop in the history of Zootropolis, proving all the stereotypes wrong to achieve her dreams.That's one side of the story, but as the film goes on, it talks about the way that fear-based political campaigns work in a slightly more dramatic, but still entertaining, simple and engaging way, which was absolutely brilliant to see, especially considering this is a kids' movie.That level of depth in Zootopia is really staggering, but we mustn't forget that the main point of this film is to give you a good time, which it does brilliantly. Although starting off in slightly generic fashion, this film develops into a really interesting mystery which actually feels a lot like a film-noir.The mystery that develops, in conjunction with the main theme about discrimination, made Zootopia play in a way that seemed oddly similar to In The Heat Of The Night to me (except with talking animals). That story is a lot of fun to follow along to, and with quite a few good jokes thrown in here and there, you won't be short of laughs either.Another really impressive thing about this film is the voice performances. In the lead role, Ginnifer Goodwin is absolutely excellent as Judy Hopps, bursting with happy energy that makes her character effortlessly likable, whilst Jason Bateman, who plays Nick Wilde, the sly fox con artist, is a lot of fun too, using his comedic experience to great effect to provide a fantastically charismatic and fun character to follow.Finally, the animation here is excellent. Disney Animation have reached levels right up there with Pixar now, and, if it weren't for the cartoonish design of the animals, this could be an almost photo- realistic animation, which you can see in the vibrant and visually stunning backdrops throughout.In the end, I loved Zootopia. Its most striking and original feature is of course its main theme, but thanks to using that in a positive way, and creating a generally uplifting film around that, it's impossible to not have a good time here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Mind-blowing cast of crazy characters,"I really loved this movie. Just when I thought I'd be tired of animation features this technical masterpiece appears and I'm lost in fantasy. The way the animals move in such quirky anthropomorphic ways is not just funny but impressive as artistic achievement goes too. The bunny heroine is cool but almost outshone by so many funny rogues. There's just this great mix of contemporary cultural references, very mild adult humour, plain amusing creatures like the ranks of hamster office workers, and a positive moral message. I almost forgot the music which is fresh and uplifting - with Shakira appearing as I think a llama with a blond quiff anyway with all this in the ingredients the plot seems a little eclipsed by the sheer zaniness of the animation and design. Every frame is packed with action. A kaleidoscopic triumph!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Absolutely beautiful.,"When you see the famous animation of Disney mascot Mickey Mouse before a movie begins, you know it's going to be good, and like many of Pixar's latest, Zootropolis does not fail to impress.In short, Zootropolis is about the inventively named bunny cop Judy Hopps, whose unfailing determination to become a fully-fledged officer sees her finding a position in the city from which the film gains its title.It is here that the main plot, which deals with some rather impressive themes such as prejudice, discrimination, and the social divide between predator and prey (likely a facsimile for the apartheid between black and white skinned people in 1960s America, or, a more modern example, the tension dividing Muslims and non-Muslims in modern society), begins.That is not to say that the entire movie is heavy, or that it is unfit for children. Like many of the recent Pixar masterpieces, it has the genius of hiding lessons like these; important messages that hold true meaning in the real world; in plain sight.This means that adults will see these deeply-embedded references and relate, thinking back with thoughts of ""I remember when the world was like that"" - an olden voice reminiscing from within, while kids enjoy the movie for the cute, lovable characters and witty, humorous dialogue.Speaking of humor, this film most certainly has a lot to boot. Nearly every scene will have you roaring with laughter, or at the very least, sporting a merry grin, especially in the scenes containing co-star Jason Bateman's Nick Wilde - devious fox con-artist, between whom and Hopps, some of the most entertaining one-liners in the movie will pass.This movie also has one of the best plots seen in recent movie years. The plots' many twists and turns will have you clinging for dear life to the edge of your popcorn-spattered seat as Hopps and Wilde chase leads across all four districts of Zootropolis, from frozen tundra to mist-enveloped mountaintops, and from sprawling metropolis to desolate jungle, each new location will definitely have you enticed.While I cannot force you to take out your wallet and cough up a handful of cash to watch this movie, I would thoroughly recommend that you do. Between the witty dialogue, the riveting plot, and the beautiful animation that makes you almost feel like you really are there, in the midst of the action, I can dutifully inform you that you will not regret your decision.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A VERY Good Movie,"Disney's ""Good Dinosaur"" was a setback to the company's overall good rating but this movie was a really well-made movie. Made me laugh a lot of times.

One of pixar's best ever! (No spoilers),"Zootopia tells the story of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde who are a bunny and a fox respectively who are trying to solve a case together.I am saying this is one of pixar's best is because it is bold enough to go where other pixar movies didn't go. From the movie start I was surprised by Judy which is such a loveable character and at the same time such an optimistic person that tries to be better and better even though she fails a lot of times just like Shakira's song says in both the beginning and end of this movie. The animation is the best ever from pixar and I've seen Coco which is newer than this but in Zootopia there were some scenes in which everything seemed real, really. The voice acting is fantastic and the standouts are these two leading characters, Idris Elba and JK Simmons' characters respectively. The story is so mature and so rich with countless moral lessons for both kids and adults but the thing I loved about it is that it gave so much depth to this two characters that at a point in the movie I thought I was watching a real movie about a police case. There are so many twist and exciting moments in this film where I was either laughing very hard or shocked or amazed by the courage this movie had with the story it told. I honestly don't have a single gripe or flaw with movie and that's why for me it's one of pixar's best along with 2017's Coco. Both will probably end up oscar winners and that along with the movie themselves just proves that sometimes animated movies can be better than real movies. Oh... did I mention the score? Fantastic again from Giacchino who is becoming a master at scoring these types of movies.Amazing animaton, great voice acting, engaging story and great music make this movie one of pixar's best and one of 2016's best movies. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Animal Blues,"Pixar is booming again. John Lasseter, the producer behind Toy Story, the Incredibles, Wreck it Ralph and a long list of successful animated movies, has brought to life another cohesive story that continues the pattern of thoroughly wrapped up films.Everything from the colours, the different styles and the voice direction works in harmony so well that you will quickly be caught up in the subtleties of Zootopia. Characters are fully realized, with compelling back stories that evoke empathy from the viewer, political motives provide a layer of intrigue and inspirational events will have you dreaming one minute, and shrinking in despair the next. It is this ability to tell a story with every element of the on-screen experience that continues to set this team apart.If there is a criticism to be had, it would have to come from the unwitting power of that ability to tell a story. Considering the age of a typical animated film, Directors will often debate the value of added layers of effect; one for adults, and one for kids. For the most part, the balance is there, with some raunchy humour slipped in here and there, and some jokes that kids won't get but will have the adults doubling over when every worker at the DMV is, quite literally, a sloth. It is in the larger elements of the story that reveal its roots in classic cop films, setting itself with an uncharacteristic irresponsibility and some shock scenes that are designed to produce fear in children. These scenes would not be so effective if not for its powerful ability to convey a story.An example would be the depiction of authority figures in the film. There are no positive leaders, and no restoration in the film of those leaders. Political leaders are corrupt, parents are backwater dream-killers and bosses are narrow-minded, unapproachable, and manipulative. This is part of a significant staging of a major conflict of the character's dream, pitted against ""the machine"". However, the conflict is never fully resolved as ""the machine"" is destabilized and then restored, but never truly changed.An item of awareness for parents may come in the presentation of several classes living in Utopian harmony, represented by animals, but loaded with political and ethical undertones. To someone who shares these values, it may go unnoticed, but for people representing minority cultures or of a different ethical compass, the story lays it on pretty thick and could stimulate an interesting discussion around points of separation in the culture. For example, what makes it possible for predator and prey to live in harmony? Why are animals segregated according to size and their environment? Is it really a ""Zootopian"" society when everyone lives separately? This could be one of the most culturally influential movies in this decade due to its reach and appeal, and its ability to tell a story with a purpose.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A bit different!,"As always Disney gives us a movie with lots of humor, lots of cute and funny characters and a great story for everyone. But this one in particular I thought was a bit different. From my point of view it's not only targeting kids in the first place, but adults too. The thing is that apart from the fact that the story is played out in a world where animals live together and carry the story (typical Disney environment), the story itself is actually quite similar to what the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies used to be about and more of an adult kind of plot. A police mystery with lots of action. Without the level of violence from Lethal Weapon of course, though it is kind of violent sometimes and maybe not the best movie to watch with your absolute youngest kids.There are also many references to adult movies like ""The Godfather"" that you will only find funny if you have actually seen the movie, which I doubt a 7 year old kid has. But not only that, it also takes on issues on a political level that is more than accurate around the world today: racism, sexism, xenophobia, even terrorism is executed to some extent. In my point of view that is what makes this movie darker and a bit different from other recent Disney movies. They have done a great job in taking on these themes in such a simple way that everyone can understand them. Children as well as adults.The characters are very well done! I loved the way they portray every animal, translate their abilities or peculiarities and put them to use in a modern human society. This is one thing that Disney almost never fails at. It made me crack several times and I had such a good time throughout the movie! Also I find it quite appealing that they are moving away from ""Princess- land"" since a lot of Disney movies has been about a prince or a princess in some way. We've seen all that too many times and it's what made me dislike ""Frozen"" so much. This one to me is more like ""Wall-e"" and shows us something fresh in terms of animated Disney movies. Thank God it's not a musical either. This is an action thriller for kids and I liked it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Try Everything:),"'Zootopia' is the latest Disney animated feature that tells the story of a daring bunny named Judy Hopps (Gennifer Goodwin), who becomes a police officer in a city of civilized animals.1. Walt Disney pictures has outdone itself once again with this film. The animation and level of creativity put into a movie like this is simply incredible. The design of the city of 'Zootopia' itself is amazing beyond belief with sections of snow, desert and rain forest for specific animal residents. The last CGI animated film that featured animals in a civilization that was this good came in 2011's 'Rango'.2. The story-line (besides Judy becoming an officer) in centered on a string of missing animals that have gone savage. Against the wishes of her commanding officer Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), Judy is tasked with finding a missing Otter, but is unwillingly joined on her quest by a suspect and street-wise Fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). It's really fun to watch this unlikely duo help each other solve this mystery.3. Bateman steals the show just by how sarcastically funny he is in the way his character Nick interacts with Judy and his take on society as a whole. You wouldn't expect much action from a film like this, but there's a lot. In my experience, there weren't many laugh-out-loud jokes, but you get chuckles and delightful moments throughout. There is just an unbelievable majority of cool things here and there that it's hard to mention them all.Besides the Pixar films, this surely stands as a soon-to-be classic for Disney animation that topples the likes of 'Tangled' and everyone's beloved 'Frozen'. Shakira also appears in the film as an animal pop-star called 'Gazelle', who dishes out a terrific song entitled ; 'Try Everything', that leaves a mark even more so than 'Let it Go'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Menagerie of Imaginative Delights,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A delightfully zany animated jaunt through the detective genre with our four-legged animal friends.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: In this world, all animals coexist in perfect harmony and take on stereotypical human traits. This animated buddy cop film introduces an idealistic rookie bunny teaming up with a cynical fox to investigate a series of attacks.JIM'S REVIEW: The evils of prejudice and the need for diversity are the underlying themes in Disney's Zootopia. We view a pastel-colored utopia sans humans where animals are ""10% predator, 90% prey"". That is until some violence upsets the natural order of things. Which brings Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) together to solve this whodunit.The film spoofs film noir, detective stories, The Godfather, Breaking Bad, cop films, and other pop references as the duo go about following leads while not-too-subtly handling the message of tolerance and equality. The puns are plentiful in Jared Bush and Phil Johnson's funny screenplay which contrasts this crazy metropolis with our real world. The script uses animal profiling to the nth degree in a most seductive and insightful way which brings about much of the comedy elements.A committee of directors are credited with this film (Bryon Howard, Rich Moore, and, once again, Mr. Bush), so their individual contributions are not readily known, but their end result is seamlessly blended to create a wonderful children's film that seems more skewed for the adults in the audience.The animation is highly detailed and beautifully rendered, creating a satirical universe. The visuals work in unison with a strong narrative, so rare in today's animation which usually panders to sophomoric humor and bad story-telling. Although the filmmakers lay their overly positive message on too thickly and their politics is biased to the obvious liberal left (of which, I firmly concur), this does not interfere with one's full enjoyment of the film's overall wholesomeness and ""kumbaya"" positive vibe.Ms. Goodwin and Mr. Bateman bring such joy and credibility to their characters. Providing expert voice-overs as well are Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Tommy Chong (superb as a holistic yak named Yax), Nate Torrance, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Shakira, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Raymond S. Persi as Flash, the slowest sloth clerk at the Department of Motor Vehicles, whose short (and long) bit is the film's laugh-out-loud highlight.Zootopia is the type of film whose main purpose to to entertain and amuse. Yet, it doesn't shy away from some serious issues. This animated film is not afraid to talk about the elephant in the room, even when there is an actual pachyderm in close proximity, which makes it all the more charming and memorable family fare.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Perfect mix of entertainment,"Let me start out by saying that I made an account just to write this review for this movie. I'm very picky about liking a movie enough to write a review, I don't haphazardly write reviews just because I can. I didn't have any expectations going in because I had never seen any trailers or reviews (heck I hadn't even heard of it) a friend just invited me to go. I like Disney (I say like with a very hesitant intonation) movies so I went. However Disney movies, in the past, have become very predictable and cliché. They are good quality and wholesome but they have always lacked something. They never had the right mix.So over the years my mind devised a grading gradient that each movie I watch had to go through. It determines if the movie is either hapless and unimpressive and be left in the ash heap of history or downright astounding to be articulated into a review. In order for a movie to impress me it has to have a good mix of elements. Here is just a simple list. 1.humor: Disney movies generally have to please children and or parentals. The demographic is typically families. So in order for movies to be ""fitting"" it has to provide a universal formula of humor. It's typically flat and unimpressive. It's not realistic. And it depends on one-liners. Give me something that has substance and comes naturally. Humor is at its best when it relates to actual real life scenarios. And is not forced or practical. 2. Character development. Sometimes Disney just gives the viewers the gist of what the portrayal of the character has to be and then slashes our hopes of what we thought it could have been. Never mind the $9.99 admission fee or the screaming kids we had to haul over to watch the movie. I GET It there is a time frame for the movie but give us more! We want our minds to be mesmerized and captivated. 3. Dialog: whispering, rough accents, things that are just hard to hear or understand (closed captions shouldn't even be an option) totally ruins it for me. And mysterious dialog that some character said in the beginning and now has nothing to do with the movie. Instead clear precise and actual real life conversations. And I don't want to rely on someone else to tell me what a character said.4.movie titles: if your going to name a movie name it with the intention that it's going to be said in the movie. Pretentious titles are offsetting and unprofessional. 5 unnecessary dark shadows: I want to see the character and don't mix it with action that has important implications later on. I shouldn't have to rely on someone else to tell me what happened. 6.excessive singing/soundtrack :I get it.its meant for kids but when the movie solely depends on the song for depth and entertainment then it does the movie a disservice. The soundtrack has to match the story-line or at least the geographic location. And singing sometimes just isn't meant to be in it. 7.love story: it's very attractive and it makes the movie more enjoyable. But Disney has a reputation of making every movie an unrealistic love story. Keep it realistic and fluid. A movie is more memorable when realistic connections are made. 8. Annoying comic reliefs. Those characters that are just there to make annoying repetitive remarks and songs. Or actions and appearances. They make the movie tacky and intolerable. Instead give us characters that add to the movie and humor that isn't completely void of substance. 9. unnecessary detours: Disney has to add some detour to make it to appear ""fun"" or to introduce new songs or characters. At the end its just adds clutter and confusion. Instead use that time to truly focus on character development. 10.forced emotional situations:we don't need to relive the lion King over and over again. And death isn't always a good Segway. Plus those deaths adds more tacky- ness and it breaks away from the cohesiveness of the story-line. Instead emotion is intricate and not always blantonly obvious. Its a subtle touch to the overall tone of the movie. This can also be said for the humor. 11.unexlained events or origins of a characters ability. A character isn't spontaneously made a certain way and then left to uncertainty of its origin or ability. This just adds to the overall quality of the movie. It makes it appear like an afterthought when it should have been the center of the movie (which it ends up being). 12. Overall message: Disney has always excelled at this. However it never ends realistically.which can be unsettling to the viewer. Give us a realistic message that can be applied to anyone. 13. twists:Disney generally is good but it lacks fluidity . Give us twists that connects to the overall movie and not just because it needs to happen. Don't make it seem like an after thought.Well I could go on and on but I just want to say that Zootopia far exceeded my expectations. It hit the mark on every single category. I've never laughed so Wholeheartedly and loud. I never lost interest and it had mystery and great fluidity. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Sweet, engaging and wonderfully original with a great message","Judy Hopps is a young rabbit with dreams of one day becoming a police officer. No rabbit has ever been a police officer, but Judy perseveres and succeeds. Now she is off to Zootopia, a multi-animal society where all animals, predator and prey, live in harmony. Her euphoria and idealism is short-lived, however, as she discovers that prejudice between species still exists, and she even starts to doubt her anti-stereotyping stance. What's more, she's assigned to parking meter duty...Wonderfully original. The idea of animals harmoniously coexisting in one world, and essentially representing characters that humans would usually take, on has been done (Jungle Book, Robin Hood) but not to this extent. Some great little in-jokes and use of the different characteristics of the different animals.Nice story too, with some very engaging plots and characters. Some clever pop-cultural references too (eg The Godfather, Breaking Bad).Behind it all is a great anti-prejudice, anti-racism message which is conveyed very effectively. Maybe a little too effectively in that it is laid on a bit thick and comes across as preachy. A bit more subtlety was in order, though, for kids, the target demographic of the movie, the level was probably about right.Voice casting is spot on, with a host of stars contributing: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Tommy Chong (as a stoner, of course!), JK Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Shakira, Bonnie Hunt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not for kids: adult plot with cartoons,"That's not what you want to see when you sit with your 4-year-old daughter. For a kid, this is plain boring and useless after five minutes.

No one really put this into perspective? Next step? A horror movie with cartoons? If you want to have a go with it, don't do it with a kid: you will be forced to walk out from it after less than half an hour.

Great movie!,"This movie is one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen. (I am a huge Disney fan! I've seen every Disney movie ever released.) What I like best about this movie (and most Disney films for that matter) was the true- to-life themes. Zootopia tackled self-doubt, discrimination, tolerance, compassion, fear, and much more. Not to mention, it played out like a real comedy/crime drama with twists and turns throughout. Officer Hopps embodies what many people lack that would make this world a better place--honestly, integrity, empathy, and determination. Nick Wilde shows us that we should not judge a book by its cover. We all have a back-story. This move can be enjoyed and understood by adults and children alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another one of a kind film from Walt Disney Animation Studios.,"Zootopia tells the story of a bunny named, Judy Hopps(Ginnifer Goodwin). Ever since she was a kid, it has always been Judy's dream to help her fellow animals, by becoming a police officer. In the world of Zootopia, humans never happened. Thousands of years ago, animals used to be savages, with predators hunting for their prey & the prey relying on their natural instinct to survive. Then, the civilized society was born. Predators & prey, learned to peacefully co-exist. Zootopia is a city where all the anthropomorphic animals live together. There are various small towns near Zootopia, that are inhabited by one particular species. Judy Hopps goes to Zootopia to pursue her dream, of becoming a cop. After all the required exams & field exercises, Judy finally becomes the first rabbit ever, to become a cop. While on the job, Officer Hopps soon realizes that being a cop is not exactly as dignified & rewarding, as she thought it would be. She finally gets an opportunity to prove her mettle as a police officer. Along with the help of a wily fox named Nick Wilde(Jason Bateman), Judy goes about solving this mystery. While on the job, Judy & Nick unearth a diabolical conspiracy, that will affect the entire society.Zootopia is a great movie! The animation is otherworldly. The city of Zootopia looks really authentic, & feels like a city that any anthropomorphic animal would flock to, for greener pastures. All the small towns around Zootopia, are gorgeous. I especially loved the rain forests. The 3D immerses the viewer, right in the middle of this beautiful world. Although this movie is wonderful, it doesn't reach the pinnacle of perfection like other recent Disney animated movies like, Wreck-It Ralph(2012) & Big Hero 6(2014). The various set pieces throughout the movie, are highly engaging & will keep you on the edge of your seat. Kids & adults will love this movie. There is a ton of heart in the film. However, one recipe missing from this movie, that make all Disney animated movies flawless, is humor. There are hardly any comedic set pieces in the movie. Even when there are, these jokes are mainly meant only for children. The sloth gag is funny at first but, it gets tedious really fast. This is a very minor flaw though. This movie is as unique as all the other Walt Disney Animation Studios & Pixar movies, to date. The highlight of the film is the suspense. This is the first animated film, that has a major mystery element throughout. The voice acting is spot on. Ginnifer Goodwin is spectacular as Judy Hopps. Jason Bateman is outstanding as Nick Wilde. Idris Elba is perfect as Chief Bogo. Jenny Slate is amazing as Bellwether. Nate Torrence is awesome as Clawhauser. Bonnie Hunt & Don Lake are good as, Bonnie Hopps & Stu Hopps, respectively. Tommy Chong is hilarious as Yax. J.K. Simmons is superb as Mayor Lionheart. Octavia Spencer is great as Mrs. Otterton. Alan Tudyk, Shakira, Raymond S. Persi & Della Saba are impressive as, Duke Weaselton, Gazelle, Flash & Young Hopps, respectively. Maurice LaMarche is effective as Mr. Big. Zootopia is a must watch, with your whole family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Zootropolis,This film is named 'Zootopia' in the US but the title was changed when it was shown in the UK. I thought it is a very good children's film. Very well animated. Colourful. Really cute animals.It is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.The jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof). The voice acting is very good and each actor perfectly adds to their character.,8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Zootropolis,"This Disney animation, retitled 'Zootropolis' in Europe, is set in a world without people; instead it appears that all other mammals have evolved to live like people... and not eat each other. Our protagonist is Judy Hopp, a rabbit who has always dreamt of becoming a police officer despite the fact that a rabbit has never been in the police. She exceeds expectations and becomes the first rabbit to serve in the Zootropolis Police Department. She is disappointed to be given traffic duties rather than 'proper' police-work but then an otter comes to the station saying her husband is missing. Her boss isn't interested but she insists on taking the case... he says she can do it but if she doesn't solve it in forty eight hours she will have to quit. With no access to police resources she has only one lead. This takes her to Nick Wilde; a fox who is quick to work a scam... after a little blackmail he ends up her unlikely partner and the two learn that there is a darker truth behind the disappearance; a truth that could end the peaceful coexistence of predator and prey species in Zootropolis.This film was a lot of fun... far more so than I expected. It starts well with a play featuring a young Judy which explains how predators and prey used to interact in this world but now live in peace. We then see that not all live up to the ideal. After this prologue the story proper gets started; this nicely spoofs cop-shows before the mystery gets started. This proves to be a surprisingly good mystery which is likely to keep viewers, young and old alike, guessing. There are moments that could scare younger viewers but these rarely last too long and ultimately things are resolved in a way that shouldn't leave youngsters worried. Most of the funny moments are aimed at all ages but there are some references to things children probably won't have seen such as 'The Godfather' and Breaking Bad'. As one might expect from Disney the animation is of a very high standard and the voice cast does a really good job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd say this was a really fun film that can be enjoyed by all ages with the possible exception of very young children... if the opening scene doesn't bother them they should be okay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Rating: A,"Zootopia surprised me a lot, it's one of the best animated movies of 2016! This is definitely a movie not only for kids but for adults as well. Actually, I think that adults will appreciate this film way more than their children.First of all, the story. How intriguing, captivating and surprising can an animated film be? Well, the levels are really high in Zootopia! It's constantly entertaining, fast-paced (except on a hilarious slow scene with a sloth), the mystery surrounding the case it's really interesting and the comparisons done with our real world are so well placed. Everything is addressed: from stereotypes to racism going through corruption and even drugs.Judy and Nick are amazing! They work so well together and it's beautiful to watch how they decided to follow completely different paths, even when their pasts are very similar. Both of them transmit such an important message of being whatever we dream of, not giving up and not showing your weak side. I had a blast watching this two fighting against crime and all of the stereotypes surrounding our world nowadays.It's really well animated with delightful details and with great supporting characters. Plus, some twists in the third act and a lot of funny scenes keep us entertained for the whole runtime. My only minor issue with this film are the constant exposition scenes throughout the movie, something I can understand since this is a movie mostly advertised for children, but it still bugged me a little bit, especially the opening scene.This movie is still awesome, it has great characters, a super interesting plot, some beautiful messages both for us and the kids, a really cool soundtrack by Michael Giacchino and two protagonists that are just amazing!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"didn't sleep the night,it was sooo good","My favorite animated movie BY FAR. Loved everything from the story which even if the ""animals"" were already used by Disney this time they created something totally new. The music was awesome and really mashed well with the animal city setting and Shakira's ""try everything"" was really good and the train and concert scenes gave me goosebumps. The characters were probably my favorite thing of the movie. Every single character was fantastic , and the two leads were godlike and fit each other perfectly, Judy hoops was so cute and pure hearth but at the same time really strong willed and ready to learn and improve and Nick Wilde what can I say... Probably my favorite character EVER. It felt so real , the personality fitted so well the animal of the fox and Jason Bateman was probably the best to dub Nick Wilde , it felt like the lead character was based on Jason more than the opposite. Overall this was a fantastic experience and it left a big joy in my hearth. Will be soooooooo hard for Disney or any other company to beat that but I hope they will do it and I can't wait for it, meanwhile this movie set an incredible achievement for Walt Disney studios and really made me smile in a sad and difficult period.

There are soo many great animated films out there both that are dark and some that are really lighthearted and funny and this is no different than those. This movie works in all cylinders. This will be the most fun of any animated film I have ever watched. This jokes are smart and interesting. The dialogue is pretty compelling. And the world building her is perfect. It really does feel like our world, but it just at one point was being inhabited by animals.This movie really has a strong theme of racism going on throughout it as well and it does it in such a cool way without feeling like it is beating you over the head with its message. This movie is fun, cool and very inventive. It also leaves the door open to sequels that could deal with other things in our world.A great opening it leaves is the possibility of interracial coupling especially with our two main characters or with some side characters within this film.

Wonderful Movie,"One of the best animated movies of 2016 that I have seen so far.

Follow Officer Judy Hops, the Zootopia PD (ZPD) and all her wonderful companions on an adventure you will never forget.You can tell the producers took time to research the real-life quality of the animals portrayed in the movie and this makes the visual aspects even higher on the rating list. Throughout the movie, watch for small ""easter eggs"" or connections to other Disney movies as you will see many of these.

Fun comedy thriller,"Zootopia is both a comedy and a thriller - and a children's animated film. For a children's film, it deals with surprisingly serious topics, as it doubles as a social parody (and NO, it ISN'T left-wing - THANKFULLY). Judy Hopps is a cute bunny (who'll get annoyed if you call her that) who manages to secure her dream job of becoming a police officer in the city of Zootopia - although she faces the challenge of a boss who holds old prejudices and simply isn't interested in a bunny as a cop. However, Judy soon finds herself on a missing mammal case with a very reluctant (and just a shade on the wrong side of the law) fox which has huge implications.The animation in this film is terrific - among the best I've ever seen (alongside Finding Dory). The voice acting is good. Ginnifer Goodwin is literally PERFECT as the voice of Judy. No-one else could have done it half as good. Jason Bateman is similarly perfect as the fox, Nick Wilde. I was unsure initially about the voices of a couple less important (but still important) characters, but now I can't imagine them with another voice. The movie is both exciting and funny and mysterious. In short, great!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
refreshingly modern,"Disney does it again. Another follow-your-dreams story featuring a protagonist resisting the voice of society, discovering who she is, and otherwise inspiring young audiences to do the same: to follow their dreams, to go after their ideals and desires, no matter the obstacle. For if you don't give up, and trust in your friends, you will surely succeed.Judy Hopps is a rabbit who aspires to be a policewoman, despite her parents' fear of the bigger, more predator-filled world out there in Zootopia and the absence of rabbit policemen. Unlike other Disney films, however, rather than end with the dream/identity being fulfilled, Zootopia goes beyond that and thrusts Judy into reality. Of course, being Disney, you know the good guys will triumph and everyone will be happy in the end and the bad guy turns out to be someone you've already met, you know, the usual stuff, BUT STILL, I like how Judy's dream of becoming a policewoman doesn't end there, and the plot entails a touching friendship and a message of social equality rather than the mere dream archetype. The utopia of Zootopia turns out to be darker in hue than Judy ever imagined.Zootopia is a land of mammals, predator and prey, who coexist and live as civilized beings. They're basically human but in animal form, and Disney brilliantly illustrates such a setting according to each animal's natural characteristics -- like how the streets run with multiple sizes of cars for, say, lemmings and tigers, or how the city is made up of districts for each habitat, etc. Another significant difference between Zootopia and previous Disney films is the incorporation of modern technology, such as smartphones. Watching Zootopia, you really feel like you're watching humans, just humans who look like animals on the outside. But they're human. Long ago, when the docile denizens of Zootopia were like the animals of our world -- that is, members of a natural food chain -- they decided to unite, and become civilized. In the same way, we humans have advanced in civilization and our ideals of toleration. As time passes, more and more do we see unyielding support for civil rights, first blacks, then women, now LGBT. As fellow human beings and fellow social animals, it is in our innate capacity to love and tolerate.And being Disney, the soundtrack and songs are amazing and catchy; the puns and references to popular culture are prevalent and hilarious; and the characters are well-developed and memorable. In addition, Zootopia astounded me with the quality of its animation. The studio has certainly improved since the days of Snow White.Like the featured song, ""Try Everything,"" when you fall, you can get up and try again. Our world may not be a utopia. In fact, it is far from one. But there is beauty and wonder still, and hope, and friendship, and love. Why not give it your all?",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Too Many Political/Social Undertones,"Usually I can enjoy a movie while just ignoring all the political and social commentary, but I guess I've been reading too many news articles lately. I just ""got"" too much of this movie's preaching and it ruined it for me.I hated Wall-E for the same reason. Movies are how I get away from real life. Last thing I need is a dumb cartoon bringing up all the pains and issues of modern society.Anyway, if you like movies that incorporate social commentary, this one does it as well as you could expect. Also, if you've had the wisdom to ignore the current ""discussions,"" you'll probably find the the hidden meanings subtle enough not to be annoying.Unfortunately, if you're like me, and keeping up with all the news and related issues are just making you feel ill, you'll probably find this movie leaves somewhat of a bad taste.In any case, watching this has suddenly made me realized that I need a break from editorials and news articles.I'm going to make it a point to stop for a while. :\",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the best animated films of recent years.,"This is one of Disney's most recent big hits, and it's good to see the most traditional animated film studio experiencing again some days of strength and energy, after more or less twenty years of difficulties. The film was, in all fairness, a resounding commercial and critical success, in addition to having a pertinent story about prejudices and stereotypes.The story centers on Judy Hopps, a rabbit that goes to the big city with the dream of joining the Police. But things are not easy: she is small in a universe of strong and large animals, and her companions don't take her seriously, even when she gets her first arrest. Thus, she volunteers to investigate the missing of Emmit Otterton, one among several Zootopia inhabitants who has vanished. For that, she will count on the forced collaboration of a swindler, crafty fox named Nick Wilde. And she will have to be quick, because her commander has imposed a deadline for her to present results or to resign from the force.In addition to being magnificently elaborated and animated, this film has a really good story with a pedagogical and humanistic background, insofar as it teaches us to disbelieve prejudices and preconceived ideas, as only strong men serve for the Police or Army, or all foxes are swindlers. There are so many ideas like that in our society (all blondes are unintelligent, all Frenchmen hate bathing, all Russians drink too much...) and all are unfair or unfounded prejudices. In addition to this moralizing message, the film is entertaining with good doses of comedy (the scenes with the sloths are anthological) and an engaging and interesting mystery surrounding the animals that disappeared.In addition to the characters being truly adorable, the film has a very competent voice cast, and the synchronization between animations and voices is perfect. Personally, I really liked the contributions of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Raymond S. Persi and Maurice LaMarche, the latter with an excellent imitation of Marlon Brando's hoarse voice. Musical moments are also present due to the unmistakable voice of Shakira, who was also entitled to give life to a character: the slender superstar Gazelle. It suits her!Technically, the film makes an impact due to the superb quality of animations and visual effects. Colorful, it was so clearly designed and beautifully edited an mixed that animations and characters took on an almost palpable realism. The conception of that city, with all its distinct but interconnected biomes allowing a better perception of how animals connect to their natural environment, also deserves an applause. Finally, I have to praise to Michael Giacchino's excellent soundtrack and the original song ""Try Everything"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Surprisingly good!,"I'm not usually into Disney. Everything is too soft for me. I like a few, mostly because I saw them when I was a kid and they make me nostalgic. I rented this mostly because there was a sale and if you rented five movies you could have them for a week for seven euros, and it was a bargain, and I remembered my sister wanted to see this at least at one point. I did want to see this for a few reasons. One of them was that people mostly said it was great. Another was that Jason Bateman was in this movie. Now I'm not his biggest fan or anything, but I've watched enough Arrested Development to like him. So, what the hell, I watched it.I was so pleasantly surprised. What's the highest rating I've given a children's animated movie? The Lego Movie, which was awesome, and I gave it 9 / 10. Zootropolis doesn't come close to The Lego Movie, but Zootropolis is great. It is funny, and it is actually super thrilling. I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen, and what had happened, and all that. It also has just the perfect amount of scary. I'm glad I watched this.Of course there are few things that bother me like why isn't Disney using voice actors instead of some random Hollywood live action actors and actresses. Like sure, they get more viewers, but there are amazing voice actors and actresses out there, who could be magical in a movie like this. Now it's mostly like ""hey, that dude sounds familiar"" and maybe recognising one actor (Tommy Chong). It's not like the cast is bad but... why can't you use people who will definitely, absolutely do a great job?Also this movie could be a great metaphor for racism and all kind of prejudice, but it's a bit... weird. It's mixed. First it seems that everyone is pushing the prey down, but in the end everyone is awful towards PREDATORS, like hey, maybe don't be prejudice against that huge ass beast who could murder you and eat you. If you are a tiny bunny, you kind of have the right to be scared of a jaguar or whatever. Maybe you're not supposed to think about these animals as humans, but still you are kind of telling kids hey, that person who bullies you and hurts you? They have their own issues going on. Sure, they might have some issues of their own, but that doesn't make it okay... I don't know where I'm going with this, but this situation kind of bothers me.But other than those things, this movie is surprisingly good. Like I said, super thrilling yet fun.

Great lessons for kids,This was a great film. My son loved it and I'd watch it again. Obviously it's no where as good as the classic Disney films but I loved how they talked about prejudice and had so many lessons that kids can learn. I would probably watch a sequel if it were to come out but sadly I don't think it's going to be a huge movie that can withstand time. The parents of the main character were annoying but I think that was to show how some parents are viewed by their kids(haha). Overall I think that the intent behind the movie was great especially for young girls. It showed that you can be anything if you try hard enough. It shows that even the people that seem great on the outside aren't always good and that they might not have your interests at heart. Great lessons for young kids and a wonderful little world that Disney built for this movie.,8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Easily an Animated Classic; Best Disney Film Since The Lion King (1994),"Zootopia is directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore, and Jared Bush, and stars Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, a bunny rabbit that lives in a world in which animals are civilized, and live in cities together. She dreams of being a police officer in a big city called Zootopia, even though all of her peers, including her parents, try to keep her under the ""status quo,"" in which she is just a simple carrot farmer. She disagrees with this, and becomes a police officer, yet realizes that she was handed a case bigger than she could imagine; a case she must solve with the help of a sly fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).To begin, Zootopia is hands down the best Disney film since The Lion King (1994). Everything about this movie was utterly amazing, and surprised me in so many ways. The underlying tone and themes, the characters, the plot, the voice acting, and the animation. First, the primary themes in the film are actually very dark and deep. There's symbolism of racism, sexism, drugs, and even what American is supposed to stand for, yet fails at doing. All of these themes play across perfectly, and are very surprising in a children's movie.The characters and plot in this film are both equally perfect. The plot shows that anybody can be anything, and the characters describe this so very well. All of the characters are very interesting, and three-dimensional in ways that are subtle, yet obvious once the film all come together. Each character has a great arc throughout the movie, and learns a lesson through experiences and other characters they meet.The voice acting is this film is rare. I mean this by saying the the voice acting is absolutely perfect. There isn't a single flaw with the acting, and each actor portrays their character amazingly. Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde was a perfect casting choice, although it didn't seem that way prior to viewing the film. Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps was also amazing, and brought the character to life in such a way that is near impossible for an animated movie. Idris Elba as Police Chief Bobo is also fantastic. He depicts a hardened police officer is a way I never would have thought of. Even Shakira does really good in this movie, which is something I never thought I would say.The animation in Zootopia is also top notch. Every tiny, seemingly insignificant movement, by any and every character, flows flawlessly with the background, and looks absolutely perfect. All of the animation is ultimately impeccable.Overall, Zootopia is an amazing film that children will love seeing, along with their parents or older siblings. It will easily be known as a Disney classic in 20 years or so, due to the animation, characters, acting, and intense plot. Zootopia deserves an A+, or a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Continuing Disney's New Golden Age,"Walt Disney Animation Studios, in the decade from 1989 to 1999, produced some of the Western world's most cherished and culturally significant films: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, the Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Tarzan. Not only were these films artistic masterpieces, but they in many ways captured the zeitgeist of their era - the ""Disney Renaissance"".Following a tumultuous transition to computer animation, since the release of Tangled in 2010, we are currently amidst Disney's triumphant return to form as an animation studio peerless in its technical animation and narrative prowess. Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and now Zootopia, all demonstrate the studio's remarkable ability to combine spectacular visual pieces of art with storytelling that both inform and are informed by the cultural dialogue of the time.Frozen proved to be a cultural phenomenon for this reason, and deservedly so. Yet with Zootopia, Disney has surpassed anything it has previously produced during this new post-Tangled ""Golden Era"" - its computer animation has never been so breathtaking, its writing has never been so on point, and its messaging has never been so timely.In terms of its artistic wizardry, Zootopia surpasses the high bars set by Disney's previous work Big Hero 6 and Dreamworks's How to Train Your Dragon 2. The environments are rendered with such sumptuous detail and inspired creativity that, counter-intuitively, one almost forgets you're watching a computer animated film. The movie does not strive towards photo-realism - the aesthetic is definitely stylized - and yet many scenes exude so much detail that they almost become photo realistic. The introductory tour through the city of Zootopia, as the camera speeds through its various biomes, is a marvel of animation and world-building. Combined with the smart and often surprisingly mature dialogue, Zootopia very may well be a brilliant live-action cop mystery/drama.The dynamic detective duo of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde serves as the narrative anchor and emotional core of the film. Voiced perfectly by Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman respectively, the chemistry between the two supplies their friendly relationship with much of its emotional weight and attractiveness. Dialogue throughout the film is clever and often uproariously funny, easily sustaining interest in the movie's story.On these grounds alone, Zootopia would be an excellent entry into Disney's repertoire. The film's underlying message, however, propels it to even greater heights. Animated movies are no strangers to anthropomorphic animals, but Zootopia leverages this device to its full potential and asks the viewer to consider important questions about race relations, prejudice, and stereotyping without his or her real world preconceptions and associated baggage. Released in the first quarter of 2016, this discussion could not be more important given given the politics and current affairs of both the United States and Europe.The easy course for this discussion would have been to follow the struggles of a minority group within Zootopia's inhabitants, which then would map onto a real world disadvantaged group and the challenges they face. In a real show of ingenuity in creative writing, Zootopia avoids this simplistic path completely. There is no clear-cut oppressor and oppressed, no abuser and victim, no privileged and disadvantaged. Instead, the movie wants us to think about the core challenges presented by prejudice and discrimination on their own terms within a world where, much like ours, such distinctions between groups often can be highly fluid and contextual.The predators of Zootopia struggle to escape their prehistorical roots as the oppressing class of species in a universe where the animal kingdom has biologically evolved far beyond this - appeals to ""biology"" in favour of the dominance of predators are just as flawed as their real-world racial parallels. Yet simultaneously, predators are also a minority within Zootopia, and are shown to be equally capable of being the victims of prejudice, stereotyping, media sensationalism, and dog-whistle politics. Zootopia shows just how complex, messy, and intractable these conflicts are. Things simply cannot be distilled down to, ""Here's the dominant group, here's the group that they're discriminating against. Look how awful it is..."" With this sharp commentary, Zootopia is the product of Disney firing on all cylinders. If there was still doubt as to whether we indeed are in the midst of a resurgent Golden Era for the studio, this film firmly quashes it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Two thumbs up!,"An atypical Disney studio animation comes out in March, ZOOTOPIA is a spunkily crowd-pleasing roller-coaster of gags, fun and wisdom, expediently taps into the anthropomorphic mammal fauna as a mirror of our own society, where the minority of predators is persecuted for their brutal nature which is designed by their DNAs, is it right to sacrifice the rights of a minority party just to ensure that a majority preys will feel safer? This is the lesson every kid (sometimes, the adults too) who is watching this picture should learn, so it is enormously pleasing to see Disney is judicious enough to be the torchbearer, to instill the notion of a harmonious society with co-existing diversity to children is an immeasurable deed can benefit future generations and promise a brighter future.Our protagonist is the rabbit Judy Hopps (Goodwin), who is determined to be the first bunny cop in the police force, against all odds, she makes it and starts to work in Zootopia. In spite of being belittled by her boss Chef Bogo (Elba), Judy befriends with a con artist, the fox Nick Wilde (Bateman), together they must solve a mysterious case of missing predators. Then, an ostensible triumph prompts Judy's politically uncorrected speech, which inadvertently incites the mass hostility towards the predators, so eventually, it is down to Judy and Nick to debunk a conspiracy theory carried out by the meekest species.The plot thickens halfway through, which indicates the story has more affinity to a Pixar-esque criterion than a common lower-age-aiming pap, and up to the segment where Judy apologises to Nick for her blunder, the film pulls off a fairly emotional catharsis, then rounds off with a bromide to reveal the (till that point) unsurprising culprit.The technical work is certainly above-par, Oscar-worthy to say the least. A ream of unorthodox characters, running the gamut from the limelight-stealing DMV officer sloth Flash to a rip-roaring Mr. Big pays homage to THE GODFATHER franchise, contradictions galore, but never overstay their welcome. So it is fairly safe to predict ZOOTOPIA will be a strong contender for next year's golden statute and Disney does elevate the bar for other studios to emulate, two thumbs up!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Bring your kids to see this movie!!,"An excellent film overall. Disney! you have done it again. The interplay between Judy (Hops) the rabbit and Nick the fox was simply a joy to watch, on how they outwitted each other.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"ZootopiaNo one has a problem with all-animal metropolises as long as citizens always remember to pick their pet human's poop up.Mind you, there aren't many squatting Caucasians in this animated-adventure.Believing you can be anything you want to be, no matter your genetic disposition, Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) forgoes carrot farming for police work in the big city.But instead of protecting the populace, Judy's issuing parking tickets because her buffalo boss (Idris Elba) doesn't think rabbits can be cops.To prove she's more than her genus, she pairs with her species sworn enemy, a street-wise fox (Jason Bateman), to solve a rash of unsolved missing mammal cases.Ingenuously devised, strikingly rendered and wholly hilarious, this anthropomorphic whodunit has all the earmarks of classic Disney but with a modern message on diversity and tolerance.Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, the worst drivers on Zootopian roadways are not always female pandas.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Too long,"I don't get how people thought that this was so good, like I heard people saying ""This was better than Wreck it Ralph"" or ""Wow, this is the best movie since Emperor's New Clothes or even 1990!"". After coming back from the theater, I didn't feel the same way as other people did. I thought that it had a nice story to it but the characters needed work.This was not better than Wreck it Ralph, though I gave both similar ratings but I thought the characters of Wreck it Ralph had more effort put into them. After seeing it the second time, I liked it more and it became my all-time favorite, although I was only 14 at the time, I thought that it was a nice break from seeing something overly intense or complex.Judy Hopps is a young bunny who was bullied as a child. Though, she still was determined and strong, she carried on with her wish on being a cop. Then, she meets a fox who had the same experience she had.Another small problem was the run time, kids may get bored off of a 108 minute run time.

"A surprisingly and refreshingly, mature movie, considering there are no humans.","When someone describes a movie about a world and a city with only anthropomorphic animals to populate them, you probably think about a G-rated fun-fest for three-year-olds, like something on Sprout. What you don't expect are satirical, cleverly veiled references to racism, sexism, addiction to technology, and drugs. Then, this movie comes out of left field with mature concepts that aren't even veiled at all, like con artistry, government conspiracies, and organized crime. There's even one reference to Breaking Bad that made me laugh rather loudly, with one character's cronies being named Walter and Jessie. The chemistry (pun not intended) between the two main characters was perfect and reminds me a lot of the witty banter Han Solo and Leia Organa had in Star Wars (minus the romance, thankfully). There are some very depressing moments with very good payoffs, while there are a couple cutesy moments that are clearly there for the younger audience. Overall, this movie is one of the best since Disney's Renaissance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Zootopia is GREAT,"Zootopia hits all the right marks when it comes to balancing all the elements needed to craft an amazing film. Let's start off with the plot of this film. It stars a bunny named Judy Hopps (played by the talented Ginnifer Goodwin) as she must track down a missing animal with the help of the sly, charismatic fox, Nick Wilde (played by the brilliant Jason Bateman). Other characters were played by Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, J.K Simmons, and Shakira (yes she's in this movie; great song by her). All of them did a terrific job playing their characters. The whole world of Zootopia was really fleshed out and you felt for almost every character in it. If you go in thinking that this movie is only for kids, you're wrong. There are great lessons to be learned from this movie, from themes centering around prejudice, to stereotypes. Overall, this movie is powerful, emotion, and very funny (Flash).

My Review for Zootopia,"Well, when we went to go see this film, I had no idea what we were seeing, but after it was over, what did I think of it?Disney did it again!The characters are great, story superb, and the music is great. It also teaches a life lesson, which really shows how life is, and how to follow your dreams.For the story, it follows a bunny who wants to become the first bunny to ever be on the police force. She will find out, that following her dream is hard, and she will get mixed up into a whole other mess in Zootopia.The Animation was gorgeous.And also laughable moments. XDMy final thoughts:Well, Disney has made a new movie that everyone should watch, it give us all a life lesson, it's funny, the story is great, and it shows that Disney can make a good 3d movie without Pixar. So this film is Superb!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

She finally passes the tests & becomes a cop but is only allowed to be a metermaid because of her small size & inexperience. She begs to be a detective.

Average Movie,"This was an average movie. The plot of the movie was clever and took several turns that kept the movie from becoming too predictable. However, there were a slew of underlying messages throughout this movie. The biggest subliminal message that I noticed in the movie was through the character of the fox. He was depicted as someone who could not help the situation that he was in because of something that happened to him when he was younger. I question this message and I wonder, besides American culture pushing this idea, if there is any reason to why this has become a prevalent idea of our culture. I also wonder what effect this message has on the young viewers who watch this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A family film with an important message,"If there are lessons in life people should be crystal clear about when growing up, it's that no one should determine who you are except yourself and you can't paint with broad strokes. Everyone's opinion will have different angles to it because of their own life experiences. With that said, it's important to try and listen to the other side from where they're coming from. While this film came out in 2016, it is still just as relevant then as it is now, with so much mislabeling going on in society. People are more disconnected than ever believe it or not and a dialog needs to be had, whether an agreement is made or not. What's great is that anyone of any reasonable age can watch this movie and take that message away from it.Written by Jared Bush and Phil Johnston and directed by Rich Moore and Byron Howard, who some of which worked on the popular Wreck-It Ralph (2012), the story is about a small town bunny named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) making her way to become a police officer in the place called Zootopia. A city where all animals live among each other; predator and prey. However, things are not all fluffy clouds when not everyone is so friendly. Meanwhile, some citizens are going missing and there might be more to it than just it being a strange issue. As Hopps learns this, she teams up with a street fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) to see what she can dig up. The plot itself behind the story is nothing that breaks new ground, but it's the overall message and themes behind the film which are so poignant.Judy Hopps is a bunny, an animal considered by many as prey in the animal kingdom. This however does not stop her from becoming what she desires most. Even though her parents were very much satisfied being the status quo. Too each their own per scenario, but the idea of taking a risk and stepping out of the comfort zone to embrace logical positive change should not be something that is feared. Fear is unfortunately one of the strongest emotions and it can wreak havoc among not just a single individual, but a society as well. What's great about the characters is that focused writing. Even Nick has a backstory that allows audiences to get a better understanding of his perspective as well. This again, all goes back to the getting to know people and not assuming things based on similarities to others.As for characters and the actors that play them, it is quite interesting to see who plays what. Ginnifer Goodwin who's known for doing Snow White in the Once Upon a Time series has made a lasting impression as Hopps. Jason Bateman known for being in all kinds of comedies plays a great foil to that of the straight performance from Goodwin. Idris Elba plays Chief Bogo, Hopps' boss. Jenny Slate plays Assistant Bellwether, as her character would call a glorified secretary position to actual Mayor Lionheart played by J. K. Simmons. There's also Nate Torrence playing Clawhauser, a donut eating cheetah. There's Octavia Spencer playing the wife of a missing animal, Alan Tudyk as a weasel, Raymond S. Persi as Flash the slow moving sloth and even Maurice LaMarche in a special role that won't be disclosed.The animation is another great component to this movie. Supported by animation supervisors who have worked on Treasure Planet (2002), Big Hero 6 (2014), Paperman (2012) and Frozen (2013), it's no surprise the visuals are creative, colorful and well detailed. Credit also should be given to Nathan Warner listed as cinematographer for designing the unique layout location that is Zootopia. How that architecture would ever become a reality today is big question. Lastly the musical score composed by Michael Giacchino is an added bonus. Unfortunately, he did not create a main theme for the movie which he easily could've done with Shakira's ""Try Everything"" pop song. But that doesn't mean his music isn't effective. Having worked on The Incredibles (2004) and Star Trek (2009), how could it not be worth a listen?Plot wise, it's not something people haven't seen before. However, it's the way that it's worked into the execution and relies heavily on the themes and morals it wants to get across is what makes it special. Everything from the characters, music and animation make this an entertaining family film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Finally a movie with a strong female character!,"...even if she is, you know, a bunny.Judy starts her police training being smaller and weaker than the other recruits, but she overcomes all these difficulties not by some magical talent (live-action Mulan, I'm looking at you) but by sheer perseverance and cleverness.She is bullied, mobbed and put down by her male colleagues, who are not intrinsecally bad or evil but simply old fashioned, and in the end Judy manages to show them the error of their ways.I liked that the screenwriters didn't make Judy seem smarter by making every male around her look weak or dumb (True Detective Night Country, looking at you now): she actually comes up with some excellent ideas as to how to pursue the investigation.Sure, she is scared and has her moments of weakness (who doesn't!) but this simply means that she is not a cardboard character. She's also a bit racist (understandably) but in the end she overcomes this bad trait and becomes a better person.I wish more Hollywood storytellers would learn from this excellent movie when they try to tell stories about strong women!

"My Inner Child & Mature Self, Were Equally Satisfied","Zootopia is another resounding original from Disney, as it joins the likes of Your Name & Kubo atop the pinnacle of the 2016's best animated offerings.

Its render of its animal characters was astoundingly detailed, with designs specific to each. The creativity furthers with Zootopia's own construct, where animal habitats form its regions, each with its own quirk the characters & screenplay take advantage of. Happily, Disney ensures this fictional world is recognizable still, with its true to life depiction of features & peculiarities.Apart from its touch of eye candy, Zootopia's writing deserves a thousand mentions, as it is quite possibly its most stellar asset. Judy Hopps & Nick Wilde for instance, are well envisioned, lovable characters that are given rich backstories & grounded personalities & even flaws, that makes them a breeze to root for. On the other hand, its mature messages that touches on stereotypes, prejudice & how politics weave through these, was a pleasant, welcome surprise. Amazingly, Zootopia veers away from being preachy despite its themes, as its brand of comedy & light hearted fun remain its main draw.

In the eyes of children, this movie can bring them different visual effects, such as cute animals, prosperous big cities, green forests, white glaciers, and inspirational little white rabbits. In the eyes of adults, the film reflects more moral. Having dreams, customer service difficulties, building friendship, eliminating racial discrimination and respecting others are the basic principles of life, and also the road to success. It's a very inspirational movie, worth watching!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An amazing story,"Zootopia has such an amazing story and it really is a good movie. The story really has its political aspects to it and for a Disney film I wasn't expecting it at all. The star studded cast is brilliant and it seems like every character is voiced by a Hollywood actor. For a film that went slightly under the radar I've got to say this is one of the best modern Disney animations I've seen. It is hilarious aswell, it has so many meta jokes and a lot of pop culture references which I didn't expect at all, it's just a really fun and enjoyable film. Really enjoyed it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I hate this movie! Sorry,"Most people do like this movie, that's good for them. I obviously didn't! I honestly don't get it why people say this is for both kids and adults.This is most obviously a kids movie! The story is tedious and predictable, the humor is nearly non-existent, the characers are either dull or even unlikable, and also I can't stand Shakira's song when it plays. I even had to mute the movie while watching it.The only good things I can give credit for is that the animation is well done with some creativity displayed, some of the jokes were funny, and it does handle its message about accepting each other decently.Even so, I don't recommend watching this movie!!!",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The voices are also very well done, with accents and built in humour. The story has a few very funny and surprising twists, which keeps you hanging until the end of the movie.

great movie for children and adults,"Zootopia is a Disney animated movie featuring the voices of Jason Bateman, and Ginnifer Goodwin. The film revolves around a police officer bunny rabbit who teams up with a con artist fox to takedown a conspiracy. I've always admired Disney and their unlimited imaginations that go beyond time and space. But I have to say that Zootopia is my favorite Disney film that they have created. What's genius about this movie is that they take an exact replica of our society and transform it into an anthropomorphic city called Zootopia where everybody lives in perfect harmony. And like our society where we deal with issues like racism, sexism, and other topics, they take those issues and pack it into Zootopia, while at the same time keeping it entertaining for adults and children. I also want to give the screenwriters credit for working as a team while the first half of them creating a controversial topics, while keeping it clean, while the other half on taking classic works like Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and putting it into Zootopia. I was so impressed with this film that I wanted to watch it again because i wanted to soak up Zootopia and see how every animal fits their job that they work at. So in the end, I will say that Zootopia is my favorite Disney film that everyone needs to check out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Physically painful,"First 40 minutes were fun, light and entertaining, i would describe that kind of experience as ""excellent"", but after next 16 minutes film it was set to zero. After finishing i've felt very much like (mentally) squeezed lemon. Everything that happened after 40 minutes is complete narration's inconsequential disaster for 6 year old kids( and HOW it happened and directed)! I mean, it amazes me every time how in nearly every series or movie it starts with something cool and then end on the bottom, when suddenly everything stops being sane, when writing, dialogues, plot becomes over the top idiotic and unsatisfying in any way! Definitely skip this one. Movie for the kids(or how they often called ""for family view"") not means ""bad movie"". So, what you want is good animated movie? Go check Finding Nemo, Incredibles,Schreck 2, Cars or if you not care so much about top tier animation something like Dobrynya and the Dragon.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Favorite Disney Movie Ever,"The ideals represented in Zootopia are more relevant to the real world than any other Disney movie I've seen. There are the more obvious principles of social justice on full display here, such as the themes of diversity and tolerance for others-obviously embodied by the primary duo of the film being ""natural"" enemies: a fox and a rabbit. What sets Zootopia apart though is how well it treats the issues and how the themes apply not only to issues of racial bias, but to all forms of intolerance of any number of personal traits. The themes of inclusion extend to all groups or persons who might feel othered for any reason.Zootopia also features strong themes of believing in yourself and in others. Of breaking out of the mould of what the world tells you are your limits or how high you should aim. Or even the value of having any notion of reaching after your aspirations at all, instead of settling for the familiar well-worn path of your parents and those around you. The idea of daring to tread the unpaved road.From a cinematic perspective, the characters are great and the world is both beautiful and intriguing. Ample amount of humor too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It's fine - tries way too hard,"On paper, this movie is exactly what I would enjoy. But the execution is very...shallow.You can see the amount of thought and effort put into the overall world when looking at the concept art and notes. I like how they thought out how a world of animals walking on two legs would work.Yet this movie falls flat for me. First off, it's a simple buddy cop movie. I don't really like either protagonist, and none of the other characters. Judy is shallowly peppy and just a tad annoying. I see how I could like her, but I don't. Nick is trying to be a sly fox character type, but it feels like they're trying to hard to make him lovable.In fact, the entire movie feels like it's trying to hard to be as marketable as possible. Every sequence is based off a joke, and it it doesn't land, you have to sit through an entirely long unfunny sequence.Every scene, moment and object is desperately trying to be something they can market with. Something that the masses are guaranteed to find enticing. Which results in a shallow movie that tries way too hard to get it's audience's shallow adoration.The racism metaphor is shallow and doesn't really make sense. What'd make more sense is animals judging each other because of fur color or size, etc. I think predator vs. Prey can be done right as an allegory (BeastStars) but Zootopia is not subtle enough for that.I honestly think they should've done their original idea. Following a fox growing up in a society where predators have to wear shock collars, to placate the prey, is fascinating. It creates this greater divide and a stronger force to fight against. It'd allow for more quiet thoughtful moments, and showcasing first hand what it feels like to live in a world that hates you. The finale would've been this big show in the arena. That just sounds much more provocative.But like Disney always does, they have a perfect idea right before they stomp it out and make it generic for the masses.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
fun for the whole fam-ba-lee,"Judy is a rabbit, who dreams up growing up to be a police officer. Her parents try to talk her out of it. But judy persists.

Disney's one of the best creation,"""Zootopia"", a dream set in a city where predators and prey live respectively in peacefully, is an entertaining, flawlessly planned children's film. This movie gives us a message. Zootopia is an extraordinarily fun and engaging film from Walt Disney Animation. Furthermore, the illustrators work superbly at making exciting character plans for many various types of creatures.
Zootopia is one of the best-animated movies up to date because of it's stunning animation. It's pleasant, clever, and truly smart. I appreciated the primary characters, and I even thought about them!
Bunny Hops, a small town bunny who's informed that she can't be a cop in Zootopia on the grounds that there will never be been a bunny police officer. The work will, in general, be finished by predators and huge herbivores, like an Ox that is become a police chief, voiced by Idris Elba. enduring police training in any case and gets allocated to meter maid duty, to the help of her parents. Her parents repellent the fox. They had a valid justification to give her fox repellent. the fox is one of the rabbit's enemy and when Judy was youngster, a fox cornered her at a province reasonable, offended her for being a rabbit, and sliced her face with his paw.
The story follows Judy forces Nick into helping her by secretly recording his fee to tax avoidance, having found out from photograph proof that Nick was the last to see Emmitt. Judy collaborates with Nick to find the missing Emmitt, and together they wind up see-through a hazy plotting. Judy praised Nick for illuminating the case, has become companions with Nick and requests that he join the ZPD as her partner. And at the end, Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner. Featuring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, and J.K. Simmons, the voice cast is particularly acceptable and gives some extraordinary exhibitions; making truly beautiful characters.
Judy learns some hard fact as she digs more into the secret, and also watchers will, as well. Being civilized doesn't mean pressure and immorality is disappeared. Additionally, achieving positive change isn't as simple as it appears. However, she is reminded by a good-natured yet microaggressive cheetah that ""only a rabbit can call another rabbit cute"". And also Judy regrets after her sincere intention is gone wrong, she said, ""I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it.""
However, the composing is weighty in its messages about resistance, the legislative issues of fear, and not generalizing others. There's additionally a touch of disarray in how this universe of humanized creatures functions.
It's still Disney, however, and it closes joyfully and absents a lot of transparency. There's plentiful space given for prey like Judy to apologize to unreasonably charged predators, like fox amigo and for everybody to develop.
Lastly, it teaches us, ""anyone can be anything"". And it is one of the best movies of Disney and what I have seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Zootopia"" Review","Disney's new animated feature, ""Zootopia,"" centers on a metropolis that is home to many anthropomorphic animals, big or small. New police department recruit Judy Hopps is the first rabbit officer to join the force, but she soon faces the challenges that occur, such as being considered too small and her capabilities being doubted by police chief Bogo. However, a conspiracy involving the disappearance of different predatory civilians forces Hopps to team up with a sly fox named Nick Wilde. As they begin to uncover the mystery, they also begin to learn more about each other and overcome their differences to work together and save the day.The timing couldn't be more perfect for ""Zootopia,"" since its themes about overcoming prejudice and stereotypes, realizing life isn't as perfect as one may think, and making great achievements in spite of one's differences or deficiencies, are displayed with a real degree of honesty and genuine emotion. These undertones are particularly evident in the backstories of the leads, Hopps and Nick. This might be the best Disney film to explore the issues that often plague modern society, and once the plot unravels, the audience starts to get the sense that things are not always what they may appear to be. In an effective visual metaphor, the animals are anthropomorphic when walking on two legs and wearing clothes, but revert back to being animalistic once they are forced to walk on all fours. The story is structured very neatly as well and never misses a beat, even at the revelation of certain twists. Some of the funniest scenes in the film include a naturist animal club led by a spiritual yak named Yax, a DMV operated by sloths that include the ironically-named Flash, and an homage to ""The Godfather,"" as if it featured an Arctic shrew in the lead.The animation of ""Zootopia"" looks absolutely stunning, as does the visual design. There is so much emotion and energy prevalent in the characters, especially Hopps, Nick, and the DMV sloths, that it supports the movie in terms of its artistic and socially-conscious appeal. The different districts in Zootopia are named and designed to reflect the different species of animals that live there, including Little Rodentia for the rodent residents, Tundratown for lower temperature mammals, and Sahara Square for camels and other desert animals. The film also features a large cast, including Ginnifer Goodwin as Hopps, who brings a great deal of sincerity and optimism to the role, a perfect counterpart to Jason Bateman's cynical and anti-authoritarian turn as Nick Wilde. Tommy Chong, as Yax, brings back memories of the Cheech & Chong days, while Idris Elba gives off a stern demeanor playing police chief Bogo, J. K. Simmons shows off gruff enthusiasm as Mayor Lionheart, and superstar Shakira cameos as a singing gazelle sensation. Additional cast members include Octavia Spencer, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, and Alan Tudyk.With its relevant themes, well-developed characters, and invigorating moments of suspense, ""Zootopia"" could be considered a modern classic in the Disney canon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My fave,"I won't go I to much detail because I don't want to get spoilers here BUT imagine everything you like in a movie EVERYTHING from the lols of fun to the great plot twist to the amazing animation. Got it? Good now put all that amazingness into one single movie add to that cute anthro animals and BOOM you got yourself a Zootopia. This movie is the greatest Disney movie of all time. Also this movie was the one single movie that managed to get a genuine shock out of me with the plot twist, also it has a lot of great humour and the best I repeat the BEST animation E V E R! So shut up all yo haterz about ""the twist villain being obvious"" and ""the bad sound track"" the villain was really good and the song was a banger and I could not get it out of my head for a long time and I was ok with it. So all in all if I could put a 20/10 review then I would do that because Zootopia THE BEST MOVIE EVER THAT CANNOT BE BEATEN (except maybe Zootopia 2) IT IS PITCH PERFECT IN EVERY SINGLE WAY SHAPE OR FORM AND IS ALSO THE GREATEST CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE EVER MADE, PERIOD!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Clever analogy to modern world,"'Zootopia' uses all the advantages given to fable. The director's clever metaphor acknowledges sensitive race issues with so much wit and humor. Not just the race. People sometimes put self-limitation because of their sex, diploma, hometown, and other's preconception of who they are. Judy Hopps symbolizes everyone who fights against this stereotype constantly every day.The storyline of Judy and Nick solving the crimes of 'missing mammals' and 'predators turning into savages' + personal developments of two characters are complementary supporting each other. While two work together, they face their wounds caused by others' prejudice. Sometimes personal realization gives the leads to the crime.Diversity is the key word of this movie. Just count how many animals the director brings in to the film with each unique characters. From mouse to lion, all animals' personalities are so flavorful and humorous. Also, I find pleasure noticing each district with different colors, weathers, and characteristics. Animation team's efforts are well represented in this movie. It is such a high-quality animation to the level of being revolutionary.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Kid's movie for adults,"So this is what a kids movie should be at least imo first of all it looks gorgeous the colours are vibrant the animation is fluid and the characters details are very fine in particular I noticed in a scene where a mice was talking and it legit looked like an old man due and the best part of this movie is the voice acting (in Hindi) just how perfectly the accents are given to each animal. No voice feels out of place and this just elevates the movie. You will laugh in this movie from start to end the characters are honestly hilarious this could have worked just fine with the comedy and animation but the story is also not neglected the main conflict feels real and tries to give a solid message which is rare to find in Disney
Also the world of this movie is something special I mean I was looking at the world more than the characters itself I would really like to visit the world again since zootopia 2 has been announced 😃FAVOURITE CHARACTER : cannot pinpoint one I guess the fox is in lead

One of the best animation from Disney,"Zootopia is a 3D animation from Disney. The CG animation and the of this movie are very amazing. it is very flowing. This is the perfect animation for children and families. The color and tone of this movie are Eye-friendly color. This movie has a great story that shows the different animals that already evolved. They live in the same city as Zootopia. Like the different people that have different characters but live in the same city. The characters and the design of the characters in this movie are very nice and Attraction. This movie showing the friendship between Judy Hopps (rabbit) and Nick Wilde (Fox). Besides, this movie has many points that interesting to follow. Like it says in the movie ""anyone can be anything"", so Judy wants to be the police in Zootopia. Even though most of the police in Zootopia is a carnivore and she is herbivores. Finally, she made it. But the animals around her still laugh at her. In the end, Judy can make the masterpiece and become the top police. Moreover, Disney pays attention to the area where this movie was screening. Like the journalist in this movie change into the animals which relate to the land that they were screened. For example, in china is a panda. Also, the jokes in the movie are cute and new like the slot one. Which is the joke that I like the most. This is one of the best animations in 2016.

This is ranking among Disney's finest!,"Zootopia flew right into my top 5 of the Disney animated movies. And if nostalgia had nothing to say on that list, it would be on top!This is one of the few Disney movies which manages to master the fine balance between the most hilarious comedy and the darkest issues of reality. Nothing is thrown in just because it had to.It's a tale of a countryside bonnie who wants more out of life, she wants to persue that by going to the big city of Zootopia! She wants to be a cop, but everyone tells her that she hasn't got what's needed to become one simply because she is a rabbit. Beside that personal issue which has been seen a lot in recent Disney movies, there is a refreshing social comment on how society is full of prejudice, here exemplified by predator and prey. That is a brilliant metaphore!And there is no stone left unturned in the world of Zootopia! So much attention has been payed to details in every part of the city! Go watch it for yourself, otherwise I would spoil it!But such small things as how Judy Hopps shows her emotional state by how her ears are is one of the great details of the animation. She's a rabbit, get it?It will keep you at the edge of your seat, it will make laugh a lot, it will make you think about your own prejudice especially if you pay attention to our present times.Go watch it, you won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
