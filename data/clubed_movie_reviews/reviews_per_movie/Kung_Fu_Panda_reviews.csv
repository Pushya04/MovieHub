Entertainment in its purest form,"Like many others, I saw the ""trailers"" featuring Jack Black. The featurette made me think ""Okay, at least I got to check this out"". Not much more. It didn't make me think ""This is gonna be awesome"" or anything like that.Boy, was I ever under-expecting.At first I thought it was quite okay, decent entertainment and at least not totally crap. But then the really funny scenes and details kicked in, after Po gets into the temple. From then on, it was laugh after laugh, excellent voice acting, amazing CG animation (but this is Dreamworks so I expected that).The whole deal simply hit home run for me. Spot on. I love martial arts movies, I love Dreamworks CG movies and I must admit I find Jack Black amazingly funny (saw Be Kind Rewind the other day and loved it). There was so much charm and amusement in this movie. It's without doubt the best animation from Dreamworks since the first Shrek.Now, I am not saying this will be for everyone. There IS a lot of fighting going on, and while it is (for most of the movie) comical (yet amazing to behold) violence, it might not be suitable for the smallest of children. But for any healthy kid aged 6-7 or above (especially boys), this will be kick-a**! I cannot really put my finger on anything bad. Sure, the movie is filled with clichés, but sometimes you can go a long way with those. And this one serves them perfectly. I even rated this higher than Ratatouille, due to the fact that it took me totally by surprise. With Ratatouille, I EXPECTED it to be great. Kung Fu Panda I only expected to be decent, but it was awesome. That deserves the last point.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wasn't Expecting much - Got a very good movie,I was almost dreading seeing this movie - we won tickets to the screener and from the first scene I found myself laughing out loud. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn't. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can't imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don't remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I'd like to see again.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Kick ass movie, almost note perfect","I saw this movie in the Cinema last night. I can not recommend this movie highly enough to kids of all ages. it is a long, long time since i have heard a Cinema audience laughing so much during a movie ( i think the last time was during Gigli!).Finally Dreamworks have managed to surpass the achievements of Pixar. All the elements are beyond anything i have seen in an Animated movie since The Lion King. the animation is hugely detailed and achingly beautiful, the script is the best i have come across in years. the only bum note in this symphony of fun is the fact that some of the immensely talented voice cast are badly underused. i can only remember hearing Jackie Chan's voice 3 times at most. having said that, the movie rests on the shoulders of jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. while playing their parts in a very different manner to each other, both are note perfect. they invest their characters with an energy (Black) and dignity (hoffman) that i could not find any fault with, even if i wanted to, not that i want to.Lastly, i believe that Oogway is the best animated character ever rendered, his facial expressions are hilarious and-surpass any previous attempts to give a character convincing facial expressions (i consider Gollum to be a CG character, not an animated character, for the record).in short, this is an utterly fantastic movie that everyone should watch 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best films from DreamWorks.,"Take it from me, this movie is brilliant. Don't go by it's silly child-pandering name, this film is for everybody. From little kids just looking for some simple fun for a little while to adults looking for a more compelling experience that makes you feel for the characters, this one's for everyone. Funny action adventure with some wise words scattered throughout.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Exceptionaly visual, funny, action packed and  intelligent movie for all ages.","One of the best comedy movies I've seen, this animation feature is both packed with action and intelligent at the same time. It's yet another variation on ""You can do anything if you believe in yourself"" and carries strong morale and educational message. But the way it's done, the incredible visual side of the story, as well as the dialogs, is just exceptional. You can't but love the fat Panda boy who's dreaming about being the greatest warrior of all China only to wake up to the reality of hawing to serve noodle soup in his father's shop. Unlike his father, who also dreamed but never found the courage to act on it, Panda follows his calling and by ""luck"" get chosen to be the legendary Dragon warrior by the Kung-Fu grand master, the old turtle, to defeat the evil tiger. That's when his training and troubles start. It's really for anyone between 3 and 100 and I laughed and loved it from the titles in the beginning to the very end. Much recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A True Warrior Never Quits,"In China, the big, fat and clumsy Panda Po is a great fan of martial arts and worships The Furious Five - Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey – and their Master Shifu. He works in the restaurant of his father specialized in noodles, but he dreams on being a kung fu hero. When Master Oogway summons the population to announce who would be The Dragon Warrior, he surprisingly points out to the slacker Po, frustrating the expectations of Master Shifu and Tigress. Po joins the academy of Master Shifu that does not believe that Po might be The Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile the evil Tai Lung breaks out the high-security prison where he has been arrested for twenty years and heads to the temple of Oogway, expecting to get the Dragon Scroll and becomes more powerful. The Furious Five tries to intercept Tai Lung, but they are defeated. Now the only chance to stop Tai Lung is the glutton Po.""Kung Fu Panda"" is a very funny and entertaining animation, with the delightful story of a clumsy Panda that dreams on being a hero. The computer-animated heroes and villain are hilarious, supported by the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angeline Jolie and other magnificent actors and actresses. Po is tailored for Jack Black and I can not imagine this character without his voice. Dustin Hoffman also makes the difference with the voice of the wise Master Shifu. I just regret that I did not pay much attention to this animation before and only now I have watched it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Kung Fu Panda""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Finally, Dreamworks Animation has a classic.","After various 3D animated movies ranging from lacklustre ""star"" movies (""Madagascar""), boring tripe (""Shark Tale"", ""Bee Movie""), and over-rated, over-hyped overkill (""Shrek""), Dreamworks can finally be proud of a truly great film. (Sidebar: I actually enjoyed ""Flushed Away"" and ""Over The Hedge"".) First, the bad. If I could complain about ANYTHING it may be a few of the voices. Besides Po, Shifu and Oogway, the rest of the cast seemed pretty 'phoned-in'. Thankfully, those characters are pretty inconsequential so they're not really missed.Now the good... or rather great. While classic kung fu movies are poked fun at, Kung Fu Panda does an excellent job of treating the genre with great respect in a movie geared towards kids. And while it IS kid friendly, it is not dumbed down to the point where it's childish. All the classic elements of those great kung fu flicks are there, while still keeping it pleasantly G-rated.Let me get this out of the way: this movie has some of the greatest 3D animated fight scenes. Ever. What elevates them from good to great is that while I expected the unbelievable, gravity-defying stunts that are REQUIRED of a good kung fu movie, there is an amazing amount of 'realism' to the physics in this movie. Just watch the jailbreak and you'll understand.Speaking of animation, the cinematography, character design and backgrounds are all done very, very well. Whether it's flying through the air alongside a leaping character, the painting-like backgrounds, or the wonderful opening sequence (reminiscent of Samurai Jack), they're all beautiful. Snap zooms, slow-motion, and flying cameras are also used with great skill to further the experience.Even the music and sound is outstanding. Asian drums rumble in the background of intense fights... stones shatter and crumble away... fight sequences rise and fall with each of the music cues, or is that the other way around? Beautiful.What helps make this a new classic in my eyes is what it doesn't have. There are no Matrix, Spiderman, or other dated references. There are no inside jokes related to the voice actors. There isn't even any double entendre or unnecessary crude humour. Much like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Monsters Inc"", there's just plenty of pop-culture-free goodness that is terribly entertaining.The last great part of this movie is often the most overlooked part of a good family film... heart. This movie has oodles of it. Other movies have tried to have a lesson in the end like 'be yourself' (""Shrek""), or 'the value of friends' (""Madagascar""), or... 'be yourself' (""Shark Tale""), but ""Kung Fu Panda"" has genuine cinematic moments with dialogue that carries real weight. Best line: Oogway regarding yesterday, tomorrow and today.So, finally, as a complete sucker for Pixar animation, I'm glad that another animation company can actually put proper thought and execution into a FAMILY movie. What else can I say? Congratulations Dreamworks. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good,"I am not a big fan of Dreamworks' non-Aardman movies after Shrek. They used too many jokes, pop-culture references etc. instead of serving real story with real characters. The only exception is, I think, Over the Hedge, which, while not really Pixar-standard, is one where they didn't overuse pop-culture references but gave us lovable characters and a good story. I think Kung Fu Panda is closer to Over the Hedge than other Dreamworks-movies. Actually I didn't find real pop-culture references (while there may be a lot of references to martial arts movies - I lack knowledge of them - there is nothing that does not fit to the story and the characters) at all. Slapstick is very childish in the movie; I can understand that, they wanted to sell it to the little ones too. But other than that, and most of the time, it is a beautifully-animated kung-fu movie with great scenery that is more for adults and kung-fu movie lovers than for children. They even give time for character building, although it is only for the Panda and the two masters; others are really one-dimensional (they even don't really have too much screen time for more). The story is nothing new, but maybe that's not something you would expect from a Kung-fu movie. All in all, the movie is much more fun and sensitive but with less jokes than its ads suggest. i did like it even if I didn't love it - maybe you should be a kung-fu fan for the latter.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dreamworks hits a HOME RUN with this one!,"From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.I took my wife and nephew and niece to see it on a Friday night and they enjoyed it, too! We were totally laughing, smiling, and guffawing at Po, the main protagonist (voiced by Jack Black) and his misadventures at becoming a Kung Fu expert. This was certainly a flawed character, one that a lot of people can relate to because he dreams, he's funny, and he can laugh at himself. Also, the story was pretty clear and easy to follow because the storytelling was well crafted, and the animation was paired well with characters brought vividly to life by some of the most famous names in Hollywood.Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are downright excellent as the main characters, and Ian McShane as the bad dude gave it the right fearful presence. Other big name stars don't shine as much, but that's because their roles are rather limited in the film. But that's still okay because the animators should be given equal credit (if not more) for delivering the funny, action and heart elements of this movie in an effective, amazing and (I've got to use this) AWESOME manner. Visually, this movie is stunning (notice all those scenic shots of the Chinese mountains, bodies of water, and the bridge scene; not to mention the action animation version of ""The Matrix"" with slow-mo)... simply a delight to watch.It's clear that Dreamworks has gotten back in the animation game with Kung Fu Panda, after slight ho-hums in Shrek 3 and Bee Movie (call me crazy, but I liked Over The Hedge more than those two). Hopefully, it should earn well over $500M worldwide because it is so good.This movie rightfully belongs in the top animation movies of all time (okay, let's not include the classic fairy tales of old; let's begin with the 90's onwards), alongside my faves ""The Incredibles"" ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Beauty & The Beast."" Has the makings of being a classic.My wife and I enjoyed it so much that we saw it again the night after. And maybe another time... haha!Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Weak, but well made for kids","When one goes to see a movie of this nature, it is expected that they will compare it to its peers; Finding Nemo etc. However, I cannot even come close to putting this movie in the same category as Finding Nemo when it comes to ratings. Let me explain.Kung Fu Panda is an easy 92 minutes, that will not only leave children in hysterics at the good clean humour, but will not leave you fuming at Dreamworks for taking another hour and a half of your life. Jack Black brings a full blown feast of his personality to the table, and Dustin Hoffman does a stellar job as the diminutive kung fu master. Jolie, Liu and Chan hardly feature in this star studded cast. The animation is as good as you expect these days, and the pace of the movie doesn't let anything to be desired.However, I do have a few bones to pick with this film. One can go see Toy Story and be captured by the notion of figurines coming to life while the human beings are away, or see Finding Nemo and be content with the assumption that all the beings of the ocean can talk to each other - while they still live in sea anemones etc. These movies thrive on these settings to aid and progress the plot of the movie. One has to wonder watching Kung Fu Panda, was there any other point to personifying these animals other than to play on our feelings as to what is 'cute', and sell movie tickets to parents with children? There were little, if any, jokes for older generations, whilst the plot line was nothing but your typical underdog story. In the end, one is reminded to believe in one's self etc... blah blah blah. This is apart from the many many many MANY continuity errors that might or might not irritate you.So, for the performances by Jack Black and Hoffman, as well the great animation and value for young children in the silly humour, I can give it a 6/10. As far as movies go, this does not measure up as much as other movies in its class, and certainly not as much as other movies in general, and I believe that more care was needed to take this good movie and make it a great one.Strongly recommended for children and bored adults who think it's cute and funny to see a fat panda try to do Kung Fu - no doubt there will be many of you.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cute animated comedy that inspires lessons in life,"(Synopsis) Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, (voice Jack Black), a sweet, but clumsy Panda who has dreams of fighting with the legendary Furious Five and protecting the city against all threats. The only problem is that Po has no real life experience of kung fu, and his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodles shop. News of selecting the Dragon Warrior is sent out from the Jade Temple, and the whole city along with Po, go to the celebration. The competition is between the Furious Five: Tigress (voice Angelina Jolie), Viper (voice Lucy Liu), Crane (voice David Cross), Monkey (voice Jackie Chan), and Mantis (voice Seth Rogen). Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu (voice Dustin Hoffman) must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master, especially, after they learn that the snow leopard, Tai Lung (voice Ian McShane), is headed their way.(My Comment) This is a cute animated comedy that also inspires lessons in life. The audience can relate to people who have dreams of doing the impossible, just as Po. Po ultimately learns that if he believes in himself, he can do anything. Jack Black (Po) and Dustin Hoffman (Shifu) voices were just right for their parts, and the chopstick fight between them is fantastic. Ian McShane (Tai Lung) was also wonderful as the villain, and his battle sequence on the rope bridge is spectacular. This film is for the whole family, because adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. (DreamWorks, Run Time 1:28, Rated PG)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Can you handle the crazy feet?Kung Fu Panda,"Pixar is where it is at for me animation-wise in Hollywood. Maybe that makes me a snob, but something about their films resonant on a level that the others can't even begin to touch. Sure Shrek and Madagascar are funny, but besides the off-belly laugh, they are kind of shallow and hollow. With that said, I went to check out Dreamworks new foray into computer graphic cinema, Kung Fu Panda. Admittedly, I knew very little about this thing other than the fact that Jack Black and Angelina Jolie voiced characters. It could possibly be due to the fact that I don't watch much TV, but I've seen sparse promotion at best until walking into the theatre and seeing a giant 3D panda in the lobby. On the whole, the film plays out much like you'd want a family/kid friendly picture to. We are given examples of friendship, belief in oneself, and humilityall life lessons we hope to inspire our youth with. With a good backbone such as that, along with some humorous bits and stunning action choreography, this panda definitely packs a punch doing his job: entertaining the audience right until the final frame.Credit the producers for compiling a top-notch roster of vocal talent to enhance the somewhat ho-hum script. These types of movies are never very original, so it takes a bit of extra panache to really draw me in. Black is actually quite good in the role and Po the panda plays right into his schtick. When arriving at the hall of warriors, he goes to every artifact and does his thing, screaming his excitement at all the cool stuff like it's his JB character from Tenacious D eying Jimi Hendrix's first guitar. The Kung Fu arm mannerisms even recall his air guitar/rock n' roll motions. Black is somewhat restrained and his manic energy is reigned in to be effective on the comedic and dramatic levels. This guy is, after all, our entrance into the story and the character we are supposed to relate to. An outcast and an original, we all can see a bit of ourselves, always dreaming but never taking the leap to achieve those goals. We watch his evolution and start to believe that it could happen to us too.It is a fine line for the supporting roles. A Panda with historical knowledge of the ancient art yet without any actual experience has been proclaimed the savior of the valley against a monster of a foe. He is truly the ugly duckling and all those around him must straddle the division of chiding him and the absurdity of the situation, but not be too meanthere are kids watching. In order to keep a good grasp on this tenuous situation, the filmmakers cast a group of affable people with the ability to work in serious moments, but never relinquish the humorous edge to their voice. Guys like David Cross, Seth Rogen, and Jackie Chan are perfect for the roles of the true warriors attempting to reconcile their preconceptions of this screw-up swooping in and taking their thunder. Moments like the acupuncture scene really show this to be true. Jolie is good as Tigress, another fighter and prize student, but the role ends up being pretty forgettable and by the books. She never really gets the range to go crazy. Neither does Dustin Hoffman as the master and teacher to them all, yet he is a still a success. My favorite supporter was the great Ian McShane as Tai Lung, the villain of the tale. No one has a better voice for nefarious deeds than this guy and he delivers continuously.As far as the story goes, it is a nice tale to teach the kids about faith and comradery. For us older folk, however, we are treated with some spectacular action/battle sequences to satisfy our want for more than just preaching. The chopstick fight between Hoffman and Black is fantastic, having comedy and tenacity with some nice artwork and fast paced movement. The battle on a rope bridge towards the end, as well as the final confrontation, is also highly enjoyable. Credit the entertainment to the acting and a gimmick that at first made me cringe. Throughout the film we are treated with slow-motion insertions during the action. A nod to old Kung Fu films and the satirical spoofs created as a result, I was thinking I'd grow tired of the maneuver very fast. Fortunately, as the movie continues on, the moments become sprinkled in with perfect timing. The escape from Rhino prison wouldn't have been half as fun without the speed changes in the action and the slow-mo facial expressions of those getting thrown around. Even towards the end, the filmmakers began to use it as an original comedic device. Capturing Po's reaction to a charging Tai Lung is absolutely priceless.Kung Fu Panda is by no means a masterpiece, but for a cartoon that really flew under my radar, I had a lot of fun taking part in the experience. Right from the beginning, with a stylized 2D rendered sequence as an introduction, I saw that this wouldn't be quite the run-of-the-mill work I was anticipating. Always staying fresh and funny I can fully endorse anyone wanting to check it out as a nice appetizer to what could be a fantastic main course in Pixar's Wall-E come this summer.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Animated slapstick, with a plot older than Shakespeare","Might be fine for younger kids who haven't seen this same plot 100 different times. But I had to give up 30 minutes in.Po is a clumsy fool (picture Inspector Clouseau) with a good heart, somehow destined to become a hero and protect the world from an imprisoned villain who's apparently so dangerous that all the guards and kung fu experts in the rest of China can't handle him.When the wise old master selects Po to be the new ""dragon warrior"", the headmaster of the famous kung fu school is outraged, planning to force Po out of training by any means necessary.That's the first 30 minutes. Now really, how many adults reading this don't already know how the story plays out? Cute slapstick, though.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome Colourful Kung Fu Creatures,"'Kung Fu Panda' is another delightfully entertaining flick to come out this summer. Osbourne and Stevenson do a fine job in directing. What I really liked about the film is the sincere effort behind it and its lack of pretension and use of clichés. The directors stay focused on the main story which is Po's struggle. I could really relate to Po's dream and love for Kung Fu and his disappointment and lack of faith in failing to be successful in doing what he loves. The stellar voice cast that includes names like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Randall Duk Kim is impressive but it is Jack Black's show all the way, followed by Dustin Hoffman. Black's comic timing is wonderful as he provides some of the very memorable laugh-out-loud moments and he brilliantly succeeds in making Po both endearing and funny. I would never have guessed that Hoffman was behind the voicing of Shifu. The actor does an excellent job. I wish Jackie Chan had more lines. The music and CGI are good enough. There's a lot of energy. It's colourful and very appealing to the eyes and it's funny as hell. What's not to love? In my opinion, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a winner with both adults and kids.",,Anonymous,Animation
Recommendation from a Chinese,"First I need to make it clear that since I was born and grew up in China, this review might be biased because there is so much more I appreciate from the movie, given my cultural background.There is a specific category in the Chinese literature history called Kung Fu fictions and it had spread among generations currently between 12 - 60 years old. Have to admit, this movie touched deeply on that, far more than any Jackie Chan or Jet Lee movies. Because it is animated, it leaves more rooms for imaginations.I am very satisfied with the movie, though I watched it with my American-born kids. It is still a typical Hollywood production, but somehow, it touched my Chinese heart.It is a simple story, yet deep. See it if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Jack Black is the Greatest Panda in the World!,"Caught a screening of ""The Panda"" and all I can say is wow! I took my 6 year old daughter, who has the attention span of a 6 year old, and she wants to see it again. So do I!Jack Black is not only half of the greatest band in the world, he is also a fine voice actor. His flawed character, Po the Panda is very refreshing. So is this film. After having to sit through the boring ""Over the Hedge"" and the last two ""Shrek"" messes, I really appreciated an animated feature form Dreamworks that didn't have too many celeb voices all competing for screen time. This is Jack Black's movie. He has 75% of the lines in the script and that is not a bad thing.Don't just drop the kids off to see Kung Fu Panda. Go with them. I think it's one of those rare movies like The Incredibles and Finding Nemo that adults can enjoy as much as the kids.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A bad ending spoils this otherwise enjoyable film.,"Po is a panda (voiced by Jack Black) who dreams of being a kung fu master; however, being a little on the large side and just a waiter in a noodle shop, the chances of him realising this fantasy seem relatively small. But when Po leaves work to witness the selection of the Dragon Warrior (the mighty martial artist who is destined to save the valley from dreadful danger), he somehow finds himself chosen for the position.Now, with only days before the arrival of the villainous Tai Lung, a powerful snow leopard with destruction on his mind, can Po learn the secrets of kung fu in time and become the hero he so desperately wishes to be?Although Kung Fu Panda has a lot going for itcool animation, great characters and some wonderful gags (which work particularly well if you're a fan of martial arts movies) I'm going to go against what seems to be the general consensus, and declare that I thought the ending sucked, and spoilt what might have been an otherwise excellent adventure.Following loads of wonderful action, plenty of laughs, and some mystical mumbo-jumbo about a magical scroll that contains the secret of unimaginable power, Kung Fu Panda turns into a weak morality tale, preaching that real strength comes from belief in oneself. Whilst I think that being confident and comfortable with who you are is a wonderful sentiment, I do think that a positive mental attitude only gets you so far, and that the mighty rhino-bashing Tai Lung would've torn Po a new one! End of.Some fans argue that Po used his weaknesses (ie., his fat) to his advantage, deflecting his enemy's more powerful moves; others say that after Tai Lung realised that he could not improve his powers through the use of the Dragon Scroll, he lost his confidence. I say 'hogwash!'.Tai Lung was a highly trained juggernaut of rage who easily fought his way past guards twice as bulky as Po and defeated five of the best warriors in the country (does that sound like someone lacking confidence to you? I don't think so). Po should have been turned into panda paste.Of course, there is the theory that once Po worked out that he all he needed to do was be himself, he finally realised his destiny and became the fabled Dragon Warrior. If this is the case, then it's a lame, wishy-washy idea that isn't explained very well .Either way, the ending spoils the film. And that's a real shame.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
beautiful but slightly disappointing,"I saw KFP last night and i when i left the theatre, there was a weird feeling in my stomach. That feeling was disappointment due to the lack of laughter. I watched the entire movie with a smile on my face, so it was enjoyable but not hysterical, i never broke out in laughter like i did with other animated movies.This movie has something special and that is the magnificent animation and the spectacular fight scenes, that will remind you of ""crouching tiger,hidden dragon"" and ""house of flying daggers"".I went to see it with a friend of mine and we both love movies. Afterwards we love to discuss what we saw and re-enjoy the best moments, but you could have heard a pin drop. We couldn't find anything to mention that was memorable to say besides our admiration for the beauty and eastern style the movie was crafted in.So in conclusion: If you want to see an animated Kungfu-film, KFP is great. If you expect to see a funny picture about a panda doing Kungfu , KFP is very mediocre. 6/10 (the great fighting and lack of comedy)",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Animated Feature in the Past 2 Years !!!,"I LOVED this movie!!!! I even daresay that this is the best animated motion picture I have seen since ""Cars"" two years ago. Although the whole story of an underdog turned champion is admittedly an oft-told retread, the treatment is original and amazing and very engaging, and not corny (unlike a lot of the recent animated films). I cannot stop singing praises to this one. The artwork of the whole movie is fantastically rendered, no exquisite detail was spared in the scenery, the architecture and of course, the lead animal characters.The action and fight scenes are very well done and memorable. I enjoyed watching the fight scene between Po and Shifu for the last dumpling, the fight of the Five vs. Tai Lung at the Bridge, and the climactic fight scene of Tai Lung with Shifu, and then with Po. Very exciting. My daughter even spontaneously applauded after that last fight sequence.There were also a number of beautifully-crafted emotional moments throughout. I loved the inspirational talk of Master Oogwei and Po (loved those words of wisdom), the talk of Master Oogwei and Shifu with the peach blossom petals, and of course the touching moment of Po and Shifu after the battle, and even in that small extra scene after the credits.The voice acting was also very good. Jack Black as Po, so natural the comedian, wow. Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, really great. I did not expect it to be him. If was fun to discover after the movie that is was Angelina Jolie who voiced the Tigress, Lucy Liu, the Viper, and Jackie Chan, the Monkey, among others. And even more minor characters like the menacing head of prison security rhino Commander Vachir voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan, all very good.Overall, a fantastic movie experience that I would not mind watching over and over. There is something for everyone -- action, drama, and comedy. It is an animated classic in my book. Very highly recommended indeed!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun film for the family.,"One perfect way to make Jack Black not too annoying: make him a cute computer-generated panda! Another fun, if not all too predictable film, has Po the Panda, a cook for his father's noodle shop, selected as being the legendary Dragon Warrior, much to the chagrin of five kung-fu artists and their master, who have spent their lives and then some trying to attain that goal.The movie is entirely predictable. Don't expect something different or unique done to the status quo of computer-generated animation and storytelling. But of that, Kung Fu Panda is much more entertaining than some of the other recent, past efforts, and the quality is above par as well! I found myself not minding Kung Fu Panda. Jack Black's voice is softer than his other films so Po's character isn't your usual Jack Black-like character. Thumbs up for a job well done.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome....Awesome!!!!!,"What a fabulous movie...great output from Dreamworks...This is the film, can be watched by all section of audience...very entertaining...The artists selection was too good....Jack Black the real show stealer...I don't think there was any expectations about this movie before release, but if you go with high expectations, definitely it reaches beyond.The story as follows, Po(Jack Black),a panda who helps his father make and serve noodle soup. One day,an ancient tortoise named Oogway believes that Po is the Dragon Warrior. Po can't believe it, and neither does Master Shifu(Dustin Hoffman). When Master Shifu learns that a certain evil villain named Tai Lung escapes from prison, trains Po to defeat Tai Lung.Don't miss this movie at any cost.

Awesome movie! I've seen this in cinema for twice!,"I can't exactly describe my feelings when I first saw this movie yesterday. It's awesome. The dreamworks has done really a good job in expressing Chinese cultural elements! It made me and my friends and all the audience laughed from the beginning to the end. When the movie came to its end, 90% of the audience didn't leave the room as usual. They stayed until the HP picture came out! Every scene is so precious and lovely that everyone didn't want to miss it! As a Chinese citizen, my feelings are complicated when I saw that the culture are so nicely expressed on screen by some foreign movie makers, but it's good, isn't it? Chinese movie makers should learn a lot from Hollywood.I think Kung Fu Panda perfectly gets together several important Chinese cultural elements: traditional Chinese Kung Fu Tactics, traditional Chinese fighting story, traditional Chinese jokes, traditional Chinese scenes, traditional Chinese music, even traditional Chinese legends! I also like the song after the movie.Thank you, Dreamworks!! I'm seriously considering to go to see it for the third time!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Turtles and Wisdom,"Dreamworks has finally made a cartoon I can stand. It has finally outgrown the limits of its founders, three men an the attitude of good enough. They've for the first time put more money into one of these than in the promotion of it. They've finally weaned themselves from the contracts with Microsoft.Three things impressed me. One was the attention to the characters, at least the top three. This really was world class. You can see it both in the writing and in the subtle way their faces are rendered. No expression is direct or static. Every expression fleets through a number of emotions. Its what good actors do, but animators aren't limited by the human instrument, so can make the expression of expressions more theatrical and therefore more effective. They did well here, wisely focusing on mouths and not eyes. (They still do poorly with teeth.)The third thing was the use of vertical space. They are catching up, and its only notable because it isn't Pixar/Disney. But it means that now even the dullest of animation shops has adopted the rule that when you can, use that third dimension in a way that physical cameras cannot. What they do here is not remarkable compared to what others are doing. But it is remarkable when the fat kid in the class gets interested in aerobics, the laggard thinks being smart is finally coolThis has one well engineered fold. It starts with a highly abstract cartoon. We know it is a cartoon, because it advertises itself this way. Then we are told it was only a dream, essentially the movie within the movie. This is at the same time the real cartoon starts, but we register it as reality. Its a good trick.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not a disaster, just a bit disappointing.","It is not a disaster, but I thought that ""Kung Fu Panda"" was a bit disappointing.""Kung Fu Panda"" is big, bright and colourful (and, by the way, looks wonderful in an IMAX DMR print). It does have wonderful animation, some nice comedy sequences and good characters, but ""Kung Fu Panda"" is not nearly as funny as it could have been, and is severely lacking in character.I think the worst crime of ""Kung Fu Panda"" is the waste of a potentially top class voice cast. Half the fun of modern animated movies, especially for adults, is in the spotting of various celebrity voices having fun. ""Kung Fu Panda"" manages to leech all of the character and idiosyncraticness out of the voices of fine character actors like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and others, that you may as well have used a cast of unknowns.A real shame, then, but not a total waste. My Nephew (12 years old) liked it. My Niece (11 years old) thought that it was OK.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finally a Film About China the Chinese Love,"There have been many films about China that the Chinese themselves didn't like. They didn't like Disney's ""Mulan"", they didn't like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This list goes on. Westerners have westernized the stories or included elements culturally offensive or unintelligible, and humour that, in the Orient, just isn't funny. Well, all that has changed. Last night I went to see Kung Fu Panda in Shanghai (in English with Chinese subtitles). Shangahai is the biggest city in China. The cinema was packed. And from start to finish there was non-stop laughter, excitement, and joy. The humour was universally funny, the culture was dead-on, and the story hit home with the Chinese. They could relate to the characters and their situations. They laughed. They laughed until they cried. Visually, the movie was just beautiful to look at. As an adult, I usually don't enjoy watching cartoons. But this one was more fun I've had at the movies in a long time. The timing of the film's release with the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing coming up is perfect. A job well done to all involved with the making of this little gem!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Striking,"Kung Fu Panda is Po (Jack Black), a bear who does not have the right girth for the martial arts. He works in his father's noodle restaurant but dreams of joining the Furious Five, China's famous kung fu fighters which also represent a style of martial arts. Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Viper and Crane.A prophecy reveals that Po is to be the new Dragon Master to the surprise of Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). However Po does not take to the tough training regime well which is designed to make him fail, the Furious Five mock him and Shifu realises that food motivates Po.When a vengeful Tai Lung (Ian McShane) escapes prison and goes after Shifu, it is left to the Kung Fu Panda to save the day.The film is enjoyable family fun, the overweight panda provides comedy as he struggles to learn kung fu, there are plenty of wise Chinese proverbs, colourful animation, frenetic action scenes and a reworked version of Everybody is Kung Fu fighting.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not only Good but also Makes me think.,"Kungfu Panda is marketed mainly as a children's movie with very childish style of cartoon-making and Jack Black. But it turned out to be eccentric and wonderful, a good story to bring your family to. If the box office becomes a flop(which is already impossible), it should be attributed to the marketing only.As the tag line says, ""Prepare for awesomeness."" Even after so many positive comments, I still have no idea what the movie will come out like. One reason I couldn't figure out what the movie will be about is the super-simple title. Will it be just another Forbidden Kingdom? Or another Mulan? Or will it even turns out to be another Bulletproof Monk, which is among the disgraces to the Chinese culture? Sorry about this but I've seen too many movies portraying Chinese culture too superficial, which assumes Chinese philosophy established on either Buddhism(usually fake Buddhism) or some ridiculous superstition. So first of all, I am glad to say Kung fu Panda is the first Hollywood-made Chinese movie ever to make me feel proud for my ancestors' culture. If I haven't guessed it wrong, the writers really took some time digesting Chinese philosophies like the relationship between ""Beings"" and ""none-beings"", and other basic Chinese ideas about life and faith. No matter how old you are, the movie will make think for some time. It discussed some deep topics about human desire, confidence and destiny. After seeing it, I sincerely think that human desire can be used for good, for our bodies are like super-advanced machines and if you manage it in the right way, it won't be harder than controlling machines. Ancient Chinese assimilated so many nutrition from nature that they have a vision to achieve a balance between everything, that is also a reminding to me as a Chinese, which makes me proud.The visual style of the movie completely beat my expectations. Everything is animated in a Chinese paper art style and the color red is so widely used as the main theme color. It touched me deeply because it reminded me of the glorious days of Chinese cartoons. It's like a combination of Matrix and traditional kung fu movies.For many obvious reasons, it has the potential to win the Oscar. I am looking forward to some better cartoons this year. But at the same time I want Kongfu Panda to be the best animated feature of the year.9/10 Almost excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good fun,"A clumsy, overweight panda, Po, spends his time working as his father's noodle restaurant in the Valley of Peace. The Dragon Warrior, the champion fighter of the kingdom, is being chosen and Po, a kung fu fan, attends. To his surprise, he is chosen as the Dragon Warrior. This upsets the Furious Five, the protectors of the valley, who deem Po well beneath their standards as well as Shifu, the Furious Five's trainer. Po is at a low ebb when Tai Lung, the valley's biggest threat, escapes from prison. Now Po will have to fight Tai Lung to save the valley.Good fun. Plot is okay, though hardly novel or unpredictable. Will mostly appeal to kids though some of the humour is great and will get a laugh out of adults.Animation is excellent: even 13 years on in a world with 4K it is superb.Voice casting is okay. No miscastings though similarly nobody really stands out either.Not brilliant but entertaining enough. Kids will love it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wow.... Dreamworks' finest.,"When I watched the trailers to kung fu panda, I scoffed and sneered at the stupidity of a rude panda barging in and demanding to learn kung fu. If someone had asked me to go to that movie, I would have laughed in their faces, but gone anyway for the popcorn. As I watched the preview, I thought ""Well there's a waste of time and money, There's something I would never like.""...Boy was I wrong. Kung fu panda has splashes of children and adult humor, done by the perfect Jack black, who fit so well with Po, the roly poly, cuddly panda. The scenery was breathtaking, and most of the time I forgot that the majestic shimmering water and lovely smooth trees were fake! The Thins that most surprised me was all the heart put into it. On the previews they are targeting mostly youths and younger audiences with their humor, but really the thing that I found sweetest of all was all the heart. The moral was so touching and sweet, that I could have never expected Dreamworks to pull it off, after their recent garbage like ""Over the Hedge"" ""Shark Tale"" and others.The scenery was beautiful, and the animation was outstanding! The characters fit so well with their voices, especially my all time favorite character Master Shifu voiced by Dustin Hoffman. True, Jackie Chan and the furious five didn't have too many lines, but this does not stop the upbeat trhill and flow of the movie. I am Definitely buying this movie the second it comes out on DVD, and have seen it 7 times in the theater. The battle scenes are superb, and my entire family is getting sick of me talking about them. The storyline is very original, and bright, but within all the humor there is a heart, and other emotions,such as sadness. One of my favorite scenes is the one in which the Brave Master Shifu battles with his former pupil, the vicious (and I mean vicious) Tai Lung.All the characters add their own little sparkle to the story, like sweetness being added to a cake. I really can't express my utter love for kung fu panda-It would be like trying to type out love, or music- it just can't be done.Sincerely, Piggypony",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best after the Nemo.,"Saw this movie today. It was both entertaining and imbibing good values. For kids a definite watch. For adults too.The story is a well known moral story of don't judge by the appearance. It is about a Chinese town in the valley where a kung-fu rule is about to be seized by a evil spirited tiger who wants to become The Dragon Warrior, the great. And a Panda comes in his way to achieve it.The script is very good. Dream works artwork team has proved one more time. It was very funny from the beginning to the end. And some philosophical moments too. The music and colors used in the movie reminds Chinese in every aspect and mainly kung-fu. It no way is lesser than ordinary kung-fu film. Kung-fu fight scenes drawn with such a clarity. Colors used are mostly red and yellow. Some flash back and magical related scenes have been drawn to bluish grey. The effects came out were extremely good. My credit goes to directors who could imagine the whole thing in their minds to make this film.Animation films have been reaching new dimensions. Though this one did not create any new dimension but will be still one among the classics. Liked a few 'Zen'nish philosophical lines of the Master Turtle character such as 'there are no accidents'.. ""i am the big Panda'..'past is history... future is mystery... and present is the only gift you have that is why they call it as 'present'...they have most profound meanings which the film could casually spill it on its way.Ver good movie. A must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

And because it has the perfect ""package"". So, Kung Fu Panda"".",,Anonymous,Animation
"Good Animation, Well Directed","The story is cliche as it gets. A student of a kung fu master isn't given a secret technique and becomes a powerful villain. Then a ""chosen one"" has to defeat said villain.It's the plot of probably lots of martial arts movies. Add to this the fact that the dialogue is mostly cliche after cliche (...""now is a gift and that's why it's called the present"" and such similar drivel), and you have quite the uninspired plot.Let us not forget the dangerous (yet so post-millenial) message that the movie sends out with its main character. That is, the Panda is basically a fat lazy slacker dreamer who becomes the chosen one for no reason and ends up beating a bunch of martial artists who train hard. In other words, slacker prevails and everything turns out right despite no effort.Where the movie shines is in the humour and animation. It looks and moves great. The fight scenes are bouncy, faces are expressive, and movements are fluid. It's pretty funny.Honourable Mentions: Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf (1992). Basically the same plot. Some teacher has two students and doesn't want to teach the secret technique to the evil one, so the evil one leaves and murders the good one. Then his sons try to avenge the good one's death. Probably a martial arts movie plot that's been rehashed to death.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the five best CGI animated films ever!,"After the disappointing SHREK 3 and the only ""cute"" OVER THE HEDGE, DreamWorks Animation finally delivers another highlight to the CGI animated universe.I got used to the rather simple story of MADAGASCAR after watching it again, I really liked SHREK and even more SHREK 2 (am I the only one?). I never liked the cultural references they built in, because I think they only work in their time (but in their time they worked great!). So for me KUNG FU PANDA is the first great ""classic"" DWA film. Go see it, it also works for adults. If you have seen some of the classic martial arts film (Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee etc) you will even more enjoy it. The voice talent of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane is perfectly used. The other voices are OK.It will be a big hit for DWA, north of 200 millions domestic, eventually even 300 mil.That said, my favorite CGI's are 1. THE INCREDIBLES, 2. RATATOUILLE and 3. FINDING NEMO and closely followed by KUNG FU PANDA. Looking forward to seeing KFP an second time and then maybe it will become my new Nr. 3.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Prepare for awesomeness,"This one of my favorite DreamWorks animated movies, you might think a movie called Kung Fu Panda would be bad or standard, but it is a great animated movie with actor Jack Black in the main role with other well-known actors voicing the other main characters or side characters; the animation studio DreamWorks is great when it comes to its movies, and doing concepts that can only work in animation. DreamWorks's animated movie Kung Fu Panda (2008) is a fun and funny time with great voice acting from the actors, fun action, well-done animation, and a good villain; also, I will add that the characters are likable, especially the main character, and you can get behind them when they do certain things that tie-in to their backstory.Jack Black does a wonderful job as the main character Po, being a likable character who wants to be a master at kung fu, while also being a fan of the kung fu team called the Furious Five that he makes friends with; Po might be overweight, but he still has a passion for learning kung fu. The members of the Furious Five being Tigress, Monkey, Viper, Crane, and Mantis voiced great by actors Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross, and Seth Rogen; though some of them do not have many lines of dialogue, they do look cool in action scenes and give backstory to one of them, leading to Po and them building a friendship and them having respect for Po. Lastly, Master Shifu, also voiced great by actor Dustin Hoffman, he begins with doubts that Po is the chosen Dragon Warrior, but trains him and sees his potential to defeat the villain that connects to Shifu's past; also, there is Master Oogway who helps Shifu on teaching Po and help him be the Dragon Warrior, but also help Shifu on being a master to his students that he is teaching kung fu to.The villain Tai Lung voiced nicely by Ian McShane was an intimidating enough villain who could be funny at times, but also, he has a connection to Shifu by being his student back in the day before turning him down on giving the Dragon Warrior role to him; because the action sequences are fun to watch, it is cool seeing him attack/fight people. The 3D animation is well-done with fast paced well-choreographed action sequences that are cool to see these characters do, along with all the characters being funny and having their own personality; the movie is just fun and funny to watch with professionally written scenes and dialogue, good direction, and there are moments in the movie that can be sentimental or just pretty to look at because of how the animation is done, especially in the opening of the movie with the use of cool looking 2D animation.DreamWorks's movie Kung Fu Panda (2008) is a fun and funny movie with well-done 3D animation, great voice acting, fun action sequences, and lots of funny moments; Jack Black is great as Po making him iconic for this role, so fans of Jack Black will like this movie, as well as people who are fans of animation or of the animation studio DreamWorks who have made other great movies before. I like this movie, it is fun watching, it is fun rewatching leading to it having two sequels with a fourth movie coming soon; I do highly recommend giving this movie a watch whenever given the chance, you will have an enjoyable time with this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun Flick!,"If awesome fight sequences, crazy- mazing animation, and Funny humor are your thing GO SEE THIS MOVIE!Who saw this coming? No one, everyone went into this movie thinking that it would be a stupid kid's movie (and personally I thought some of it was a bit too mature for the little kiddies in OUR audience) From one of the most incredible animated fight sequences, to a chaotic jail escape, to a dramatic bridge fight, to a hilarious final showdown.Even though the movie does get serious at some points, it never takes itself seriously... did that make any sense? Jack Black is PERFECT in the role of Po the Panda, as are all of the other actors in their respective roles.What's the only bad thing about this movie? THE TITLE! Who's gonna go up to their friends and be like ""Oh yea Kung Fu Panda was AWESOME!"" (oh yea, that's right, ME!)

What a perfect gem of a movie...,"This is just the sweet spot you want - animation perfection coupled with a fine story that delivers an extremely enjoyable, very funny lovely gum drop of a film.I think Dreamworks has easily surpassed Shrek (the first) with Kung Fu Panda. ""Shrek"" was great, but had so many puns because of the content (Fairy Tales) that it was almost too easy.With the law-of-diminishing returns Shreks and the passably funny Madagascar under their belt, I had low expectations for ""Kung Fu Panda."" Pleasant surprise is an understatement: the animators, screenwriters, storytellers, voice actors, and producers all brought their ""A game"" to this one. This should be considered at the very least a CGI animation and at worst a top 30 animation classic up there with the best from Disney and Pixar. I'd rate it very close to my Pixar favorites, ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" I won't bother regurgitating the highlights of the plot - others have taken care of that. It's the quality of this movie that's stuck with me; e.g., more laugh-out-loud hilarious moments than I can possibly remember, the tightly woven plot, and the simple, yet powerful message that isn't weighted down with too much sentimentality. I was also drawn unexpectedly to the animation itself - it has such a strong, unique use of color I found that the palette was another element that lifted the film out of the ordinary dreck of CGI.This is just a great, fun, and very funny movie that is completely worth bringing the whole family to. Don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesomeness of the cute Panda,"My opinion:-- KungFuPanda is the best animated movie so far. I have seen almost all of them (toystory,incredibles,ratatullie,shrek,iceAge you name it). But KungFuPanda beats all of them. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It made us laugh like anything. Very good comedy scenes, well crafted anime art, Good action sequences, good Chinese landscapes, and very well told story. The screenplay is great. Special mention to the voices. Jack Black Rocks !! He blends into PO as if he was born to voice for PO. Dustin Hoffman suits perfect for Master Shifu. Dreamworks has surprisingly given an awesome anime picture.My 10 out of 10. I'm gonna watch this movie again.Highly Recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"With dazzlingly animated fight scenes and the likable panda Po, I found this very entertaining.","I saw this with a friend at a preview screening last Sat and I was worried it might be like the other forgettable mass-produced animated films, but I was pleasantly surprised.The voice acting was pretty flawless. This is a very good case of finding the actors(even if they are all well recognised stars) that fit that characters well. I couldn't imagine anyone else voicing Po apart from Jack Black - he just seems to completely embody Po's personality and humour. Jolie also has the severity of her character Tigress while the standout being Hoffman conveys Shifu's exasperation and everything else as the panda's master.Pacing and Plot: OK, so the plot is probably borrowed form numerous sources but it does have a classic storytelling feel to it, and there are certain parts that don't happen(especially during the climax) exactly the way you expect. Slightly clichéd, but charming and entertaining enough to overcome it, I think.Animation: The opening 2D sequence is nothing short of amazing, in my opinion. The fight scenes and Tai Lung's escape is just stunning to behold - both witty and a feast for the eyes. This coupled with the subtle character animation that brings them to life might be overlooked since the masses are probably used to it due to the load of animated films that come out, but it's really well done.Music: This is where I take my hat off - there are no of those stupid, generic pop songs playing during the film! Thank God! The music is very good, from the orchestral parts I heard and does give one a sense of being in China.Overall, there are some things not explained(like why Po's dad is a duck and Po's past) but apart from niggles with lack of originality story-wise and some clichés, this is really an experience to enjoy fully in a cinema I think, due to the sheer scope of the fight sequences and the cinematography of old China. It has it's quite funny scenes and even if it's not funny all the way through exactly, it has a heart, which is always important to me - it raises it from just flash to having some substance. A very good animated film from Dreamworks and even if the forthcoming sequel isn't as good, this'll be one for me, to enjoy again and again when it arrives on DVD.",,Anonymous,Animation
Panda Made for a Happy Day,"My boyfriend and I had to choose between this movie and the Zohan. Needless to say we were both glad we chose Kung Fu Panda. I would rather have sat through this movie with a bunch of rambunctious kids than an action thriller with a bunch of obnoxious teens. The animation was up several levels by entertaining the adults with fast paced action segments speckled with the genius humor of Jack Black. There was so much of this movie that no one but Jack Black could pull off. The special and sound effects were better, in my opinion, than Ratatouille. The dishes clanking, the light shining off metal objects..fabulous. Town characters were enjoyable, cute and entertaining for the little ones...and it was a refreshing time to see so many adults relax and laugh as heartily as the little ones. The scenery was at times so realistic and breathtaking. Yes...the ""skadoosh"" segment was hilarious. As were many other points in the movie. The voice cast was wonderful. Clark Duncan was intimidating, funny, and I think the little ones were endeared to him even though he was a big burly character. Hoffman..wow...several times I had to remind myself it was his voice.

"Old story, great script, funny movie","Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, a fat clumsy Panda, son of a noodle shop owner goose, who loves Kung Fu and dreams of being a Kung Fu hero and finds himself being chosen as The Chosen One to fight the evil forces and a renegade who threatens his village.The animation, an action comedy, is good and very lovable, but nothing remarkable. The story is predictable, the message ""believe in yourself no matter what"" well known, and the characters stereotypical. However, the script is great, very engaging and funny, the main characters and the performances of most voice actors are so good that you soon forget the flaws of the film and fully immerse yourself in it.The film is highly indebted to Jack Black's performance and self-deprecating humor, which really suits the personality of Po. At the end of the movie one wonders, what came first, the Panda or Jack? Also brilliant in their dubbing are Dustin Hoffman as the cranky teacher Shifu, Randall Duk Kim as the wise spiritual old tortoise Oogway, James Hong as Po's goose father Mr. Ping, and Dan Fogler as Zeng.The other characters, despite being important, are mostly action figures and don't have many dialogs, but the voice actors d0 a good job too: Ian McShane as the renegade snow leopard Tai Lung, Jackie Chan as Monkey, Seth Rogen as the Mantis, Lucy Liu as the Viper, David Cross as Crane. Angelina Jolie's voicing of Sexy Tigress is very bad; she sounds as if she was reading something without acting; she should have made the effort, as her character has only a few lines, or the directors demand more from her.This is one of those unpretentious movies that, even if you don't fancy to watch, will certainly entertain and amuse you.

"Not really fresh, rather boring","I found Kung Fu Panda to be rather boring and very typical. The plot has been done many times and the other times it were done better. I also found the jokes and gags in this film to be way too childish and immature. I know its meant for children and younger teens but this film just didn't seem that great, and it also sends a rather bad message. Kung Fu Panda brings us absolutely nothing new. Perhaps it's me getting older, but the humor nowadays feels very shallow in these animated movies. And the almost non-stop violence, because there really is. I don't mind action movies, or even martial arts movies but this is clearly a movie with intended major demographics in ages 8-12, and hopefully a sizeable number of high school kids so the music and animation must be perfected.

A Nutshell Review: Kung Fu Panda,"It seems like this is a movie made for all the fanboys out there,  regardless of what their obsessions are about. You know, being one who  idolizes certain somebodies or some things, and given a day that Fate  decides to throw you a curveball and give you that one opportunity to  come up close and personal to meet and greet your idol in the flesh, or  be thrown into the exact situation that you've always been dreaming  about. What would you do, and would you go weak in the knees or be  overcome with disbelief that you're actually, finally, realizing your  dream?  Panda Po (voiced by comedian Jack Black) epitomizes exactly that in  Kung Fu Panda, and that struck a chord in me and with many in the  audience as well. And for that, no matter how cliché the story would  become, it had already done its deal and made the connection. It is no  wonder it is rated G here, and I expect that the holiday season would  allow cash registers to ring, for animation fans with the different  styles utilized to tell the story (you must be on time and not miss the  opening sequence), for kung fu fans to get a kick out of classic kung  fu moves personified in their animal forms - Tigress (Angelina Jolie),  Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey  (Jackie Chan) - collectively known as the Fearsome/Fab Five, and for  the kids, given the obvious reason that hey, the protagonist is a  cuddly bear. The marketing department, if not already done, should  stock up on the plush toys, not only of the hero, but the supporting  casts as well. And make their younger forms available too, for they  will sell.  Story-wise, I can't help but to note its tip of its hat towards the  Jackie Chan martial arts movie of the past like Snake in Eagle's  Shadow, Eagle Shadow Fist, etc. The formula which follows a misfit with  weak or zero martial arts background having to undergo harsh training  under a kung fu master, finally realizing his true calling in time to  defeat the villain everybody fears. With the Jackie Chan movies, the  demise of loved one always trigger off a chain reaction, but since this  is G-rated, you won't have the pleasure of having blood spilled, but  with so many splatter-type movies in recent times, I have to admit this  was refreshing, and even having animated animals that talked, didn't  irk me as they are just so lovable here, in their own right.  It's an excellent and very even mix of comedy and drama, even though  they are quite cliché at times if you grew up with the formula, but I  thought that was the point. While the trailers might have given away  some stuff, there are still lots more available which are hidden up the  sleeves, and some minor word replacement such as ""suck"" to ""stink"",  though you would likely be able to stay a step ahead throughout and  even guess whatever secrets the movie have, actually are. For its  stylistic training sequences, they became a throwback and a link to the  fore-mentioned Jackie Chan movies. The fight choreography isn't done  shoddily too with its designing of fights true to the characters'  forms, and integrating them all in a manner rarely seen before. Since  it's an animated flick, it was able to, and probably ramped up  whatever's possible in the kung fu fantasy realm, to give us everything  from rooftop flights to an incredible prison break. It didn't waste any  effort in tapping from the wealth of kung fu material, what with the  various names of deadly moves, secret manuals,  teacher-student feuds, and the best part of it all? Humour being quite  unexpectedly well placed, with more hits than misses to break out into  a hearty laugh by the panda antics.  For all its A-list voice actors in the movie, with the likes of Michael  Clarke Duncan, Dan Fogler, Ian McShane and those who provide voices to  the 5 key animals, Kung Fu Panda is clearly a Jack Black and Dustin  Hoffman vehicle. The bantering between the two is priceless as the  latter plays Sifu (duh) the master teacher, a highly-strung and serious  character who has a past they are shameful about (don't they all). And  as his own teacher Oogway (read: Wu Gui, aka tortoise, voiced by  Randall Duk Kim) advises, herein lies an opportunity for Sifu to  rediscover himself when training possibly the next-big-thing (pardon  the pun) Po, whom he foretold as the mythical Dragon Warrior. So begins  the forging of friendship, long lasting bonds and trust between the  two, even though they got off the wrong footing. And you can probably  feel for Po, because for a fanboy type, having your idols scoff at you  at first opportunity, is actually quite painful.  As a kids movie, there's almost always a message to take away. Here,  it's a reminder to believe in oneself, which I guess is a universal  theme to instill some confidence in the young ones. You might not look  the best, nor are the best amongst your peers, but so long as you have  that attitude to want to learn, that should put you in good steed. As a  summer blockbuster movie, it's fun, thoroughly entertaining, and  doesn't try to be too smart. It's likely to be a crowd pleaser across  all age demographics, and an ultimate popcorn fare, so long as you  manage to keep the popcorn away from the thieving hands of the panda.  And with this release beating local film Kung Fu Gecko to the screens,  I wonder what's the status currently on the Nickson Fong project.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An all-star cast wasted on a mediocre script,"Considering the amazing amount of talented actors involved in this movie I expected a lot more than what this film provided.There were comedic moments but not many laugh out loud ones. The 5 great warriors were very poorly utilized and not given nearly enough screen time, It was pretty lame that they hired great voice talent and followed up by giving them all only a couple of lines.There were 3 great actions scenes but the ending was so anti-climactic that none of them really saved the worth of the movie. The main villain Tai Lung and the story that surrounded him was interesting but once again poorly utilized, especially since the final fight of the movie was completely worthless.",,Anonymous,Animation
DreamWorks done good,"Like the rest of the western world, I love Pixar - from Toy Story to The Incredibles to Ratatouille, they've delivered some of the finest, most timeless and age-proof entertainment of the last fifteen years. Even their lesser efforts like A Bug's Life and Cars make the other kids' movies that surround them at the multiplex look leaden and trite. But this casts the harsh, judgmental light of comparison on Dreamworks, and although Shrek was a fun little flick (that has rapidly aged), I haven't been impressed by most of the work they've put out since then, pop culture-infused cookie-cutter kiddie flicks awkwardly constructed around their voice stars (the fish with Will Smith's face will forever haunt my dreams).But everyone can change and everyone can evolve, and while Kung Fu Panda isn't a pockmark on a timeless piece of art like Pixar's Ratatouille, it's a lovingly constructed, humorous, and more-than-competently made tribute to old kung fu movies and a solid piece of entertainment. I genuinely liked it.First off, unlike the ilk of Shrek, this movie contains NO pop culture references other than innate stylistic similarities to the kung fu flicks it lightly satirizes and pays tribute to. It stands on its own feet. Secondly, while the titular panda is very much an avatar for Jack Black's standard goofy personality, the movie doesn't make the easy mistake of just taking that and letting it sit there like a limp fish (voiced by Will Smith) - while it mines that particular style for humor all the way through, the character is forced to take responsibility and evolve, and the evolution is pretty much the same standard you would ask for if this movie were the same story starring Jack Black done in live action. Citizen Kane it's not, but there is a character arc. Third, the animation leaves Madagascar and Ice Age choking to death in its dust. No, it's not Wall·E, but the characters are fluid and vibrant and the art and settings have a vaguely dusty, ancient, ethereal, Chinese feel to them that doesn't feel phoned in.Also, the infinite potential of animation is actually taken advantage of to produce some pretty nifty kung fu / fight scenes. It's obviously all synthetic, being animated and whatnot, but the choreography and ideas actually build on that to do neat things that couldn't be done in live action (at least not easily and without millions of wires). There are old-fashioned kung fu fights with kicks and blocks and punches and jumps, that have a sense of momentum and energy. None of the action blew my mind to pieces but it was all entertaining to watch. As was the comedy, which was pretty much all either slapsticky type mishaps or building on the ""Jack Black"" personality, but relatively little of it felt juvenile, and I had some laughs.Of course, it's not perfect by any stretch. The story - fittingly for a kung fu movie - is very simple, straightforward, and doesn't innovate in any way. None of the characters besides Po the panda, his primary mentor Shifu (skillfully voice acted by Dustin Hoffman), and the villain receive any development whatsoever; they are pretty much all paper-flat, and it seems a shame that they have Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, Angelina Jolie, and Jackie Chan voice acting but barely use them for more than a half-dozen lines each. But I don't think the kids this movie was basically made for will care, and not having ten million pop culture references, this movie actually won't painfully age year by year like certain movies starring green ogres played by Mike Myers. So I'd give Kung Fu Panda a thumbs up, not an ecstatic one, but a comfortable one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

kungfu panda,"""Kung Fu Panda"" is not one of the great recent animated films. The story is way too predictable, and truth to tell, Po himself didn't overwhelm me with his charisma.

And then there's two Pandas!! 'Po' and 'Shifu'.,"When a layperson is introduced to the opus of Chinese Martial Arts, the animals,birds and insects commonly present in fighting techniques are Tiger,Snake,Monkey,Leopard,Crane,Mantis,Eagle,Horse,Tortoise,10000 bees,Centipede,Scorpion,Gecko,Toad and several other relatively unknown styles.There's also the mythical Dragon style.But Panda ? No buddy, there's no Panda.And that's specifically the reason I loved this movie.The giant, lazy, slow animal ( Giant Panda ) with it's affinity for food ,having probably the least chance to make it up to Kung-Fu ranks, becomes a hero in this incredible movie.And his master 'Shifu' is a small Red Panda !!But don't get me wrong.Not by magic.The Giant Panda is a large animal with considerable strength and it can be fast when needed.Po the Giant Panda was unexpectedly chosen by Tortoise guru Oogway to defend their valley from the wrath of the snow leopard 'Tai Lung' who was raised by Kung-Fu master Shifu, who is a Red Panda himself.Shifu has five of the best as his students: Tiger, Viper, Crane,Monkey and Mantis.But not one of them, or even, all of them together can defeat the Snow Leopard who used to be the best and most powerful of all of Shifu's students.Sadly 'Tai Lung''s lust for power turned him into a merciless outlaw.Only with the help of Tortoise Guru ( Shifu's master )'Oogway' could Tai Lung be sent into Prison.However Tai Lung breaks prison in an outstanding animation sequence that can compare with Hollywood's best action scenes, and is slated to come back to the valley and wreak havoc in his quest for a 'Secret' power.And now according to Oogway, only the gentle Panda 'Po'( with enough theoretical, bookish knowledge but no Real Kung-Fu experience ) can stop him,and Shifu has to train him in unconventional ways.Watch this movie with your entire family and you will love every second of it.The climax could have been more gripping.Even then, for innovation, a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Excellent movie!,"I found this movie to have a perfect combination of humor, hilarious situations and great graphics.

It's difficult to envision what kind of person would not enjoy this film. Most of the good jokes require some mental abilities, so I assume somebody with a low IQ will not find this movie too interesting (hence the < 8 ratings?).

Lovable Panda,"Po (Jack Black) is a panda who is a big fan of Kung Fu. Master Oogway is about to pick the Dragon Warrior when Po stumble into the ceremony. To the dismay of the Furious Five and Master Shifu, Po is picked the Dragon Warrior. Po is chubby, and inexperienced. When the powerful Tai Lung escapes from prison, everybody must battle to save the valley.The animation looks great. Importantly, the characters are fun. Jack Black sets the tone, and he's perfect as Po. He's played the bumbling good nature fool before in other movies. As a cartoon character, he even more lovable.The story is fairly predictable. It's really straight forward. The script doesn't have the modern references so prevalent today. It's not the most impressive part of the movie.However the action is energetic. Po is hilarious.

it's all in the faces,"The latest years have been busy and interesting in the field of animation. The full transition to digital creation (at least in a main stream context) is a reality, and in the middle of it, the competition between Dreamworks and Pixar/Disney is bringing benefits to us, viewers, all. So far, i've been enjoying Pixar's projects better. They are working in their specific corner of film exploration, which has to do with the use of space. The kind of freedom a virtual camera gives to animation is something they've been working properly, at a world class level in Ratatouille. That's the top of it, so far, to my taste. But here, these guys embrace a research on something that had been somehow neglected until now: the faces.The camera is virtual, the sets are virtual, but so are the actors (except of course for the voices). So they can be worked in a sort of exaggerated more than real way. That's done here. So far it's the best digital faces characterization i've seen. Every expression is intended, has a purpose, and is fully enjoyable. Certain subtleties are really intelligent, because in the middle of a great technological capacity, they used quite simple devices (it comes to my mind that eye movement in the monkeys face when the panda is making fun of the master without knowing he is behind him).The motion in space and throughout the space was not specially interesting, specially if you look at what Pixar has been doing. And this story had potential in that field. Kung Fu, in cinematic terms, is about a dance between the eye and the performer, and the way he fills the space he's occupying. Here we have a temple in the top of a mountain, with a village at its feet. The only thing they use is the stairs, so the panda can get tired. Could be more. But the faces make up for all thisMy opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Animation
"Great, Innocent Fun, with a bit of depth","I don't know what to say, exactly, about this movie, except that it was about as close to pure distilled comedic awesome as I have come into contact with in recent years. That said, this is not humor for every person, as it is not always perfectly clear where the punchline is. The fact of the matter is that the entire movie should be treated as one giant jab at old, super-cheesy Kung-Fu movies. However, rather than flatly lampooning it, what we wind up with is a deconstructionist approach to the genre. Rather than making fun of specific elements, Kung Fu Panda seems to set out to, instead, write every Kung Fu movie ever made, and does so to hilarious effect. It is a simple plot, but well-executed, and the animation is superb. Every frame is a work of art.The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie a perfect score is that it is so simple, and the depth of the movie suffers somewhat from it. However, the movie does have a point, let no one convince you otherwise. It is nothing earth-shattering, and is somewhat in the vein of ""feel-good"" types of thematic statements, but it is, all in all, an excellent movie, and one I would recommend all should see. Unless you have a personal vendetta against Dreamworks, CGI movies, animation, Eastern culture, martial arts, or Jack Black, I could just about guarantee you would enjoy this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Entertaining and fun to watch, if not exceptional","Overall, I did enjoy Kung Fu Panda, but I don't put it up there with Dreamworks' best. Apart from Po and Shifu(and possibly the film's villain, splendidly voiced by Ian McShane) the film is lacking in its character development, while the story while well constructed, original and fresh has its predictable parts and the message is a little over-familiar. However, when it comes to the visuals, there is nothing to fault, the whole film with its gorgeous colours and backgrounds looks wonderful. The score is excellent as well, and I can see that there was care to make it sound authentic. The script is witty, funny and smart, the pace is bright and breezy and the voice acting is solid across the board- Dustin Hoffmann is perfectly cast while Jack Black does a great job voicing one of his more likable characters. In conclusion, very entertaining film, but it didn't wow me completely. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing!,"I was surprised at how good this movie really was. The level of detail that DreamWorks has put into the animation is beyond me, and it has gotten even better with each movie.Being a kung fu movie, the action is nothing to scoff at either. Every fight scene is special in its own way, and I love that the characters all have their own unique fighting style.The music to the movie is absolutely amazing! Hans Zimmer and John Powell truly did an incredible job bringing this movie to life with its score.

Definitely worth the wait,"This animation i have to say is one of the best i've seen and i'm not a fan of pixar type 3D animation (ie Find Nemo, Shrek etc...) since they're too much for kids. But this animation is worth the hype and the wait. Not only is it entertaining/funny but also has a moral to the story which we all should learn from (both adults and children).The graphics is excellent, story is simple/typical (aren't majority of them nowadays) but the moral included makes this animation not only for kids but for everyone.Generally i don't want any sequels to be made since they are just for money grabbing reasons but for this one i hope they make a trilogy since i really LOVE PO.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
a balance between the predictability of the plot and the loving homage/spoof of the subject matter,"Kung Fu Panda was the first Dreamworks animated movie I even considered going to see, nevermind liking, in quite a while. Perhaps it's because I didn't see it on a professional critic basis, and none of the past Dreamworks animation didn't have any appeal aside from a basic, kiddie movie basis (the last one was Sharktale, which left a bad taste in my mouth for a while). But after hearing some high praise, and recognizing some voice talent that seemed a little unusual (i.e. Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen), I took a chance. Thankfully, it paid off more than I would've imagined. It's an entertaining ride, and somehow uproariously funny in some pockets. And just when I thought I'd had enough of those ""Don't Talk"" ads before the movies at AMC with Po the Panda!It is, in fact, still predictable in that quasi-Shrek kind of way: a big, lovable lug somehow gets chosen for a task of great importance, and along the way becomes everything that he never though he could be, gains respect, and retains individuality all the way through, particularly at the end. What's interesting this time around is how the filmmakers marry this repeated theme for animated kids fare with the basic plots of cool, old-school kung-fu movies, like the fare from the Shaw Brothers from the 60s and 70s. Or, for a more contemporary example, it comes closest to the Kill Bill movies (i.e. the Pai Mei chapter) in attempting homage for a 21th century crowd. What's been done over and over in those films somehow comes fresh with what's expected for a kid's movie, and it all works thanks to the sharp script.Voice actors, as well, contribute pretty well to the proceedings. Jack Black, who can be hit or miss depending on the viewer (or just the mood of the moment), is fit like a glove for this character, who's a dreamer and weak-willed but wants to not stay a noodle-boy his whole life after being chosen for the Dragon Scroll. Hoffman is terrific as the 'Master' of the members of the group of the ""Five"", who are a Mantis, a Tiger, a Monkey, a Crane (you know, the ""moves""), and all the voice actors in these parts are also pitch perfect- Jolie, Seth Rogen, David Cross (a big surprise), Lucy Liu- because, for many moments, they disappear into their parts (an essential if hidden asset to good voice acting). Points should also go to Ian McShane who plays the bad-ass-turned-villain of the film.Featuring training montages that veer on spoof (plus a dumpling scene that might be the funniest in the movie), fast and lively and energetic animation, and some intense fight scenes, it's a real treat for its target audience of children, but adults and martial-arts genre fans should not fear. They might have as good a time as the first Shrek, if that's indeed possible after so many years of Pixar's golden standard.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cute but trite,"Kung Fu Panda is a cool-looking movie, and fun, and unlike many summer movies, it did not annoy or offend me. So yeah, I'm sort of glad that I saw it.That said, though, I would've appreciated a more original script. As it stands, Kung Fu Panda feels like it was cobbled together from the leftovers of 100 other movies involving chosen warriors, sagely mentors, crises of confidence and spooky supervillains. I recognized scenes lifted from Star Wars, from various karate movies, and even from the long-forgotten (or so I thought) Judge Dredd! This is not exactly a trailblazing film, in other words.Also, I actually disapproved of Kung Fu Panda's underlying message about always ""following your dream,"" even if it's (a) utterly implausible and (b) involves telling your family to buzz off. You see, at the start of the film, the panda is working in his dad's noodle shop, but he dreams of being a karate master - even though he's lazy and fat. So, in order to become the hero, the panda has to reject his father's life's work and, through no particular effort of his own, become a super-powerful warrior.Call me Mr. Cranky-Pants, but I think that message might actually be bad for little kids. The film, in short, tells kids to be dissatisfied with ordinary jobs - like working in a restaurant - and encourages them to pursue ridiculous unlikely jobs, like unstoppable warrior hero. It annoys me, really, that hundreds of Hollywood movies are all about vaulting over ordinary people (like the panda's dad) in order to make it big. Foreign films, you'll notice, don't always have this ""become a rock star"" message, and are actually about realistic things and realistic people. But not American movies, noooo...American movies tell you that you can become a karate master without exercise and leave your boring dad and his boring everyday job in the dust.Right, enough ranting. I suppose I've been spoiled by watching too many foreign movies lately, and I can no longer get behind cute formula fiction like Kung Fu Panda. That doesn't mean I hated this movie. The animation was nice, the action was cool, the celebrity voices impressed. I just wish that a single original idea - or even a shred of realism - had been displayed as well.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda is a good movie,"I must admit I was a little skeptical going in to watch this movie, the main reason being, Dreamworks, in my opinion, has not produced a good movie since Shrek. By good movie I mean, a movie with a good story, heart, and humor. The Shrek sequels and other movies from the studio have all been corny and shallow, utilizing big name voices but with little in the manner of storyline and heart. Pixar, did exactly the opposite. Avoiding big names as much as they could except for where they felt it was necessary to help the storyline. Pixar put movie first, then voice actors. Dreamworks the reverse. And look at which company does better. Pixar of course!A good friend told me that Kung Fu Panda was 'friggin Awesome', so I decided to take a chance. The trailers looked interesting. A little different from Dreamworks' typical approach of touting voices and funny scenes. Kung Fu Panda does have its fair share of voices, with Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, and Dustin Hoffman. But the trailers did not focus on the voices at all, which led me to believe that this might be something new.So it started. I was mesmerized by the stylized opening sequence. I'm sure many an animator would take note of the work. It left me intrigued and interested. It also got me to smile and set me up for what was to come. The opening sequence is important. Make sure you don't get late and miss it.The movie then switches into the normal style of 3D animation that we have become so familiar with in recent years. Kung Fu Panda has a lot of talking animals in it, and no humans at all. Jack Black plays Po, the Panda, who works in a noodle shop assisting his father (a goose?). He dreams of learning Kung Fu, and is a big fan of the fearsome five, a group of five animals who are experts within their animal talents. He is a true fan boy, and owns action figures of each of them. The story unfolds in a way that is not too unexpected. Po, our unlikely lovable hero, has to eventually defeat Tai Lung, and save everyone.Interestingly, I found that the style of story had some similarities to Chinese folklore. The storyline intentionally encompasses Chinese culture and tradition to a degree. A rare thing to behold. I loved the effort.Kung Fu Panda will appeal to all ages. For the young, the motivational message that comes towards the end. And for the older, an enchanting work of great entertainment. I was entertained.Kung Fu Panda is a good movie, and is reminiscent of the days when Dreamworks came up with Shrek. Now go see it and enjoy yourself!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well crafted and fun film with strong story and characters driving the humour,"Po may well dream of kung fu glory but the reality is that he is heavy, lazy, food-focused and likely to spend his life in the noodle business like his father. When the test for the Dragon Warrior is announced, Po hopes at very least to be an observer of the contest. So imagine his surprise when he finds himself to be the one chosen. Trainer Shifu and his students are sceptical at least and furious at worst, but are confident that Po will soon quit, but they do not count on the sheer, good natured pleasure that Po takes from just being involved. Thing is, what Po doesn't know is that the Dragon Warrior is prophesied as the only one who can stop the powerful and evil Tai Lung, who has just broken free of a prison of one prisoner and a thousand guards.I wasn't totally sold on going to see this film but it got the group vote so away I went. It wasn't that any one thing put me off it, it was just that the bar has been set high for this sort of thing by Pixar etc and I have been disappointed by some films that were ""only"" OK. Kung Fu Panda opens with a really cool sequence that suits the genre of animated martial arts films and then quickly moves into reality and the seemingly straightforward tale of an individual who aspires to more than his appearance would suggest him capable of. It sounds generic and indeed I suppose that, in its basest form, it is but it is the delivery that sees it be much more than just this.It worried me at first that the film was not loaded with pop culture references and ""for the adults only"" one-liners that Shrek etc often are but I quickly got over this. Instead of lots of quick fire humour, Kung Fu Panda actually focuses on the characters and the story and builds the humour onto that rather than the two just happening to be alongside one another. As The Times noted, the film is also free of lavatorial humour which is not only a pleasing omission but one that must have been deliberate given how easy it would have been to draw f*rt gags from the main character of Po! But instead it is a smarter type of humour, with the only downside being that younger children might be a bit restless at the infrequency of really obvious comedy. I didn't roll with laughter that much either but for me it was more rewarding as a film rather than an animated series of references and sly gags.The focus on character does help because I was drawn into the story quick effectively to the point where I wasn't bored if I didn't have a laugh for five minutes. Those that set up the quick-fire stuff as the agenda risk this feeling but the story was my interest here. It also helps the voice actors to be more than just voices. Black and Hoffman both benefit greatly from this and the expressions of their animated characters. McShane has a simpler character but his voice really suits Tai Lung. The supporting cast looks great on paper with Jolie, Cross, Rogen, Liu and Chan but sadly they are not that well used and have too few lines considering. One star with no dialogue is the animation itself. It is amazingly detailed and stunning and yet another example of how the technology seems to be constantly moving in leaps and bounds.Kung Fu Panda is not the funniest animated film you will see and it doesn't really deliver the rapid laughs of Shrek (for example). This comes with the approach though because the film doesn't load itself with pop culture references and lots of gags for kids while slipping adult humour into the one-liners, instead it is much more satisfying in its construction and deliver. The clichéd framework of the plot is fleshed out really well and ultimately I really enjoyed it for this. Well worth seeing for what it is and how unpretentious it all is.",,Anonymous,Animation
Spectacular Movie!,"Kung Fu Panda is one of the best animation movie I have ever seen. It has excellent animation; everything seems so realistic. The voice for the characters were a perfect match for in the movie. Throughout the movie, there are many scenes where you laugh until you can't anymore.The story line was pretty good. It is just like any other animation movie. The only thing that sets this movie different from others is the laughter, adventure, and kung fu style.This is a great family movie, but I suggest about letting little kids watching it because of the kung fu, action fighting thing. Other than that, its a great movie for kids and adults too. You'll love it until the end and will want to watch it again. It will definitely be worth your while.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Wisdom of KUNG FU PANDA,"Looking for an animated film that the whole family can watch and enjoy? Then the summer has a good selection in Kung Fu Panda, a magical tale of talking animals, martial arts, eastern philosophy, and good versus evil. It is also voiced by several well known stars not the least of which is the force of nature that is Jack Black.Panda bear Po (Jack Black) works for his father's noodle business in ancient China but yearns for something more. His interest in martial arts leads him to being an accidental selection as the 'chosen one' to defend the local town from a vengeful leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a former student of the wise, martial arts teacher, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). As the 'chosen one', Po is given the sacred Dragon Scrolls and is trained by Shifu in the ways and technique of Kung Fu much to the consternation of the Furious Five, the current crop of warriors. Po presents the ultimate challenge both physically and mentally to Shifu until the master hits on an unorthodox idea. As Tai Lung approaches and the Furious Five attempt to defend the town, Po must learn the ways of the true warrior. As he begins to mature and learn about himself, he becomes the last line of defense.This story nicely blends serious themes with moments of comedic fun. What is refreshing in the humor is that it is organic and timeless without resorting to pop references (as in Shrek)-no small feat. It also depicts the ancient Chinese warriors with not only martial arts prowess, but abilities to defy gravity as in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Children will find a wondrous, far away land populated by real people in the guise of animal characters. It is a believable world with real feelings of yearning, tradition, envy, and bravery.A somewhat more subdued Jack Black does a fine job emoting and realizing the young Po. Dustin Hoffman is quite good as the wise sage, a sort of Asian Yoda (or the other way around). It's rather hard to believe the star power behind the other voices including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and Seth Rogen. The movie could have worked just as well without them.The movie actually gets better in the middle and toward the end, not that long a wait. Its basic themes of destiny and loyalty are universal. As Master Shifu says, ""there are no accidents."" The animation and creative use of camera angles and zooms are breath taking at times. You kind of wish the script had just a bit more substance and this would have become a treasured classic. As it is, Kung Fu Panda is a delightful, inoffensive adventure with something for all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesomely Skadooshilicious,"Kung Fu Panda is both a send-up of and a tribute to the kung-fu genre, and it works. Innocent eyes will goggle at the beautifully rendered characters, break-neck action, and gentle humor; more experienced viewers will laugh at loud at all of the kung fu movie clichés... a hopeless loser that goes from zero to hero in about one day of intense training... a promising but evil student who turns against his master... the wise, ancient master... the prophesy... the various forms of animal-style kung-fu practiced by actual creatures of the correct type... it's all there, without any wires, and without the awful dialogue you would expect from a chop-sockey film. Jack Black entertains, and shares some excellent dialogue with Master Sifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. The Furious Five, a group of powerful Kung Fu warriors, is voiced by various big-name actors, but somehow, they rarely seemed to get enough voice-time to justify those big salaries - particularly Jackie Chan (Monkey), who had about three lines of dialogue. Presumably they based Monkey's movements on some of Jackie's more inspired moves from the past. This is where the film lost a point. An honorable mention should be given to James Hong, who voices Po's (Jack Black, the Panda) father's voice - apparently, PO is the son of a goose who owns a noodle shop. Ian McShane also deserves mention as Tai Lung, the immensely powerful evil Snow Leopard kung-fu master who must escape from prison and return to the valley in order to fulfill PO's destiny. See this movie. It brought awesomeness back to a genre that has seen a lot of crap in the past 5 years (anything with Star Wars in the title, anything starring Jackie Chan, anything directed by the Wachowski Brothers...), and it's even clean enough to bring your kids to. And to any naysayers, I say to you... SKA-DOOSH.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Jack Black's back, only this time its digital.","Were sure it's not easy being an animated flick in a world where everybody can't wait for WALL-E but even with this looming Kung Fu Panda was not scared away. A valiant attempt to outdo Pixar is slightly smouldered by its misuse of its supporting cast (Angelina Jolie, Luci Lu and Jackie Chan) However with the failure that was Shrek the Third this is a film that puts DreamWorks credibility back on the line, will it ever be as good as Pixar? Probably not but Kung Fu Panda proves it can (at very least) look better than Pixar.Visually, Kung Fu Panda is pretty unstoppable. High flying kicks and punches that can't be replicated in real life making this a must see for martial arts fans but the low brow humour and the fact that while the film manages to pull off some stunning visual treats but never really going anyway with the plotting makes this a fun but ultimately forgettable movie event. Brilliantly beautiful if a little flat. Black seems less irritating in GCI but the films wastes the rest of its unused cast.A clumsy panda bear becomes an unlikely kung fu hero when a treacherous enemy spreads chaos throughout the countryside in this animated martial arts adventure featuring the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and Jackie Chan.On the surface, Po (voice of Black) may look like just another portly panda bear, but beneath his fur he bears the mark of the chosen one. By day, Po works faithfully in his family's noodle shop, but by night he dreams of becoming a true master of the martial arts. Now an ancient prophecy has come to pass, and Po realizes that he is the only one who can save his people from certain destruction. with time running short and malevolent snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane ) closing in, Furious Five legends Tigress (Jolie), Crane (David Cross ), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Chan), and their wise sensei, Master Shifu (Hoffman), all draw on their vast knowledge of fighting skills in order to transform a lumbering panda bear into a lethal fighting machine. Now, if the noble Po can master the martial arts and somehow transform his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths, he will fulfill his destiny as the hero who saved his people during their darkest hour.With its negatives looming, Kung Fu Panda still manages to do better than thoses DreamWorks disasters (Madagascar, Shark Tale) and while it didn't quite live up to the hype, and it won't do anything with the release of WALL-E. Kung Fu Panda is a great kids movie with several laughs that will even have the tightest ass hole laughing.It's in the superb visuals and the fact that Kung Fu Panda really did try. It excels, but not enough to be noticed. It works however as a decent enough bridge to WALL-E, while its a crying shame that a film devoted to hard work simply cant stride far enough to be something truly spectacular. My final verdict? Give it ago, but don't go in expecting Shrek 2 or erm ... any other good DreamWorks animations? No? Oh well.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A cute, average, family entertaining movie.","Well, to start with an overview, this movie was definitely not a waste of time, and deserves the money.The plot is kind of interesting, but a little too childish, and I'm sure it's meant to be. But the thing is that-- MANYYYYYYYY things are too exaggerated, too over the lines of any other exciting and exaggerated cartoon movie.The plot also keeps you coming with a few..FEW.. gaps of comedy scenes. The story flows the way any other exaggerated action, and not comedy, movie flows. The scenes that make you laugh, really, i say really, make you laugh.But when i was seated in the movie room with all the other people, i saw that all the families were laughing together, so the movie was absolutely worthwhile and well done.I gave this movie 1 star for all the hard jobs that were done for completing the movie. 2 stars for the laughs. Another 2 stars for the suspense and the creative plot. And 1 star for the well-thought characters that seemed very hard to create. 6/10. -4 for the too much exaggeration. But go ahead and watch the movie with your family, it's worth it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Kung Fu-n,"Jack Black is on form with his latest outing 'Kung-Fu Panda' a funny and excellently animated tale of dreams, ambition, self belief and of course Kung-Fu. Po is a panda stuck in his job at his dads noodle shop but as he cooks and serves he secretly dreams of being a Kung-Fu master and part of crack fighting force 'The furious five'. Trained by Shifu the five are being groomed so one will become the Dragon master and protect the village from the wrath of the evil Tai Lung and in a hilarious set up that task falls to the reluctant Po. Cue comedy training scenes and 'Karate Kid' style balances on one leg as the clumsy and unfit Po tries to become the ultimate fighting force. With an all star cast of voice talent here, Black, Hoffman, Jolie and Chan to name but a few, the characters are instantly likable, but what sets this film apart is really the animation which is simply stunning and often uses matrix style slow motion to great effect as the camera whirls you round a fight scene that just stays the right side of not making you dizzy. The story despite being heavy on the morale of believing in yourself and you can do anything rhetoric is a strong one and the script is full of great jokes. Add to this some fun slapstick and it should have the adults laughing along with the kids. To quote Po 'there is no charge for awesomeness' well the price of a cinema ticket anyway, but I assure you its well worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
There's no secret ingredient..,"So much nostalgia comes from this film. One of the first animated movies I genuinely remembered as a kid. And was unexpectedly good even after 10 years.Solid story with originaility and hilarious writing. It was funny and had some of my favorite animated movie moments. The characters are pretty good for an animated movie. There's Po who's only motive seems to be food but somhow they make it interesting by him training kung fu with the use of food. The side characters are decent. You got the Furious Five, Pooh's dad and Master Oogway who's part of the four horses of wisdom. And the antagonist Tai Ling who's backstory was sort of sad but was a good villian. The visuals were good as expected especially the fight scenes. The music was awesome with the mix of Chinese instruments and the voice acting cast was perfect.Overall an enjoyable film.Memorable: So so (Nostalgia) Rewatchable: Maybe",,Anonymous,Animation
entertaining (6.5/10),"well,i liked the movie.the story was interesting,and the action scenes were good.the voice acting fit well with the characters.i gotta say though,that,i never laughed once.maybe it's just me,or maybe you have to be in a certain mood.still,i thought it was a good movie.it moves along at a good pace,and it's certainly never boring.it reminded me of the movie Beverly Hills Ninja,starring Chris Farley from 1997.the main character is pretty much the same type of character,except in that one,our hero is a human being,and in this one,of course,he's a panda.the other difference is i actually found Beverly Hills Ninja pretty funny.but that's neither here nor there.as for Kung Fu Panda,i was entertained throughout.i just didn't laugh.for me Kung Fu Panda is a 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda destined to become a classic,"Went to see Kung Fu Panda on Saturday with very high expectations and I wasn't disappointed in fact, it was better than I thought. I was funny and it has a lot of action and adventure. It is also a movie that leaves you some valuable learning like ""never give up"" and ""always believe in yourself"". A very good story about an Enthusiastic, big and a little clumsy, Po is the biggest fan of kung fu around which doesn't exactly come in handy while working every day in his family's noodle shop. Unexpectedly chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy, Po's dreams become reality when he joins the world of kung fu and studies alongside his idols, the legendary Furious Five--Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey--under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu. But before they know it, the vengeful and treacherous snow leopard Tai Lung is headed their way, and it's up to Po to defend everyone from the oncoming threat. It is like a tribute to all those Chinese kung fu movies. The cast of voices is excellent, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen and Michael Clark Duncan all with awesome performances. In conclusion, this is one of the best movie of the season and the best animated DreamWorks movie since Shrek 2.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It was funny, but rather bland","The animated story of a fat panda dreaming to become a great ninja should have been about awkwardness, involuntary humour and overcoming one's limitations. This film was exactly that. The voice acting was top notch, the 3D animation good, the funny animal faces perfect. But it was so incredibly predictable, that it brought only a type of indifferent fun for me. Maybe it was because I have seen old Jackie Chan movies and I knew how things will go, PG rated and everything, but every single little scene was in my head before it happened.Bottom line: it is one of those funny American animations that you can easily laugh to, but that slip your mind the next day. You've got fat jokes, kung-fu jokes, funny faces, an angry misguided villain and the calm wise master; you've got animals acting like humans because it is funnier, not because it means anything to the story; you've got an easy effortless win from a natural talent.

Dreamworks bring the value of Kung Fu to life,"A unique concept turned into a great movie. The plot follows Po as he tries to find his purpose in life through his passion, Kung Fu. The story is entertaining and engaging for most audiences; it is not a movie adults will get bored watching. The movie's flow is solid at first, but in the second half, it picks up the pace. I would have liked more training sequences; it almost feels rushed. The story's theme revolves around believing in yourself to find your purpose, a message that is always valuable. The characters are unique, and their voice actors match perfectly. I would have liked to see different types of villagers; they felt very cut and paste. The dialogue was childish at times but not unrealistic. The writers were able to manage the balance between humor and heartfelt discussion. The art and details in the movie were amazing, and the animators did a phenomenal job putting the movie together. The soundtrack was soft in the background for large parts of the movie, adding to its charm. Overall, this movie inspires various audiences and reminds us of the value of our dreams and individuality.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A lot better than it looks!,"When I first heard the title, I was expecting this to be a movie with stupid, unoriginal humor. Boy, was I wrong!. Don't look at the title and dislike the movie because you have to see it! There was definitely original humor. Adults will adore this movie. Many scenes contained humor that actually made you laugh. I guess you could actually compare this movie to Shrek which was hailed everywhere. Jack Black was the perfect actor for the lead role. I think he should be in more kid movies. He wasn't his normal immature acting. He was serious, yet funny. The whole idea of Kung Fu Panda may seem a bit ""questionable"", but don't believe that.

derivative storyline bolstered by decent execution,"As voiced by funnyman Jack Black, Po is just your average Chinese panda with dreams of one day becoming a world-class kung fu fighter (isn't that what all pandas living in China want to be?). When he's chosen by The Master to become the new Dragon Warrior, a position that brings virtually unlimited power to the individual who holds it, Po is thrown into round-the-clock training sessions to help groom him for the role - kind of like Eliza Doolittle on steroids.The plot of ""Kung Fu Panda"" - with its echoes of ""The Karate Kid"" and even of ""Star Wars"" in its portrayal of teacher/pupil relationships - is fairly derivative in nature and lacks the kind of strong secondary characters we've come to expect from computer-animated films (no slam intended on the voice-over work by Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan).Still, there is sufficient energy, wit and visual inventiveness in the movie to captivate the little ones while keeping the rest of us from actively storming the box office and demanding our money back. This is most definitely not one of the ""great ones,"" as animated features go, but it is short and pleasant enough to at least earn it a spot in the recommended column.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Run of the Kung-Fu Mill,"Well here we go with another CG animated movie full of cutesy animals. Will it be any good or will it be simply average like so many of its competitors (only Pixar produce consistent gems). Well I went in to this movie with high hopes having read a positive review in 'Empire' and the fact that I was viewing the movie in IMAX would surely help. Well unfortunately not. This is just an average movie where everything is well done but no connection was made with the characters on my behalf. Admittedly most of the children in the audience seemed to enjoy the film (but I felt even they would of enjoyed it more). The animation is strong though I found the fight scenes a bit like watching a computer game. But I just was not taken with any of the characters and the main character of the Panda just did not do it for me, there was just too much Jack Black here and not enough character.

It may not be Citizen Kane or The Godfather, but even mature audiences can and should learn from this movie. Not everything needs to be perfect and majestic, and not every great thing comes from seriousness and years of hard work. Sometimes it's all about believing to be able to achieve greatness and to help others become the best version of themselves. Even now, 15 years after its release, it's still as epic and fresh as the first time I saw it, even more so when comparing it with newer, animated productions, including sequels of this same series that didn't deliver as well as this one simple fable movie.

"Nothing Uproarious But Warm, Colorful & Likable","This was a nice movie with likable characters but, frankly, I didn't find it anything memorable. Yes, it was beautiful artwork but I read where it was the most beautiful animation ever put on screen, and I didn't find it lived up to that. I guess my expectations were sky high, which made it almost impossible to meet. The story could have used more laughs, too. I think that was the main thing that slightly disappointed me: the humor was mild, not laugh-out-loud funny.Having said all that, it was enjoyable and it will put numerous smiles on your face as you watch it. I guess ""pleasant,"" ""agreeable,"" ""warm,"" etc., would be better words to describe the film. It is pretty, too, especially on Blu-Ray.

"Benefited by having friendly characters and with with excellent visual, the productions brings action and humor to the audience","While Pixar follows a line of more complex and intelligent animations, full of meaning and visually bold, the other producers continue to bet on the basics: Action and a lot of humor. Now and then, however, productions from this second echelon come out as good as those of the studio linked to Disney. PDI / DreamWorks Animation had already hit the nail on the head with Shrek and now creates a new character with so much potential to become a new millionaire franchise: the panda Po.Surprising even in its first moments, when it begins the narrative with a beautiful sequence of animation in 2D, Kung Fu Panda is, technically, a production that lives up to the growing experience of PDI / DreamWorks - and the visuals of the characters maintain a great balance between the real and the cartoonish, staying between the likelihood of Selvagem and the caricature of Madagascar. On the other hand, the animators do not shy away from using exaggeration in the expressions of the creatures in search of humor and, thus, Po and his companions twist their jaws in an absurd way, exhibit an intense tremor in their eyes when frightened and move without caring. The laws of physics. Still, the animation team finds room for sophistication by turning Oogway into a senile individual and likely victimized by Parkinson's disease, as his constant (but not exaggerated) tremors are brilliantly conceived by IDP artists. Likewise, it is interesting to see how the spots on the hair of the villain Tai Lung are used to create the impression of a muscular abdomen, which highlights his frightening air.A more critical look identifies easily: Kung Fu Panda is a film of a single joke - that of the fat panda wanting to fight and causing the greatest disasters with its clumsy attitudes. However, the short duration - it is a mere 90 minutes - and the agility of editing and photography, which present some of the most elaborate and well-structured shots of modern animation, guarantee the spectator's interest throughout the course of the action. And this is present from the beginning to the end. The strokes are very funny and well developed - the panda training, always behind a new plate of food, is just hilarious - and everything is present within a completely understandable logic. The design is light and precise, beautiful to see and full of details that make the most demanding people happy.Kung Fu Panda goes beyond the breaking of stereotypes, in a possible didactic regarding the prejudice against fat people, or an imposition of the Western social theme in an Eastern mythology. In fact, the great principle of the panda, inferior to its physical size, rationally speaking, is shown in the unnamed resistance of the animal panda as an image of Chinese art. If the Furious Five that Po idolized were qualitative figures in martial art, the whole process of the film is to prove that the panda (like tiger, snake, heron, grasshopper and monkey), is also a symbol animal, an attribute to learn Kung Fu. For this reason, the exercise of the film in ""surprising"" the stereotypically fat animal to fight is because one hardly ever looks at the biological or psychological particularities of this stereotype, especially for an agile Kung Fu fight. It is not by chance that the voice actor who plays the protagonist Po is from actor Jack Black, who always used, in general, his physical form for comedy, but without depending on her to make varied films. Then, prejudice is revealed, by the judgment of the serious training in being impossible for a panda. Thus, through comedy, there is a plausible field of possibilities in the film, even slow motion to better capture the fast, elaborate and impactful Kung Fu action scenes.With very few narrative pretensions other than 90 minutes of humorous adventure, the film stands out especially for its art direction. The technique of computer graphics is beautiful, attentive to the smallest plastic details and extremely colorful, stylized but with something oriental - obviously taking advantage of the setting in China. Raymond Zibach's good production design (Sinbad: The Legend of the Seven Seas) results in interesting settings, like the village and the monastery, but - again - nothing that is particularly inspired or breathtaking (with the exception of prison) guarding Tai Lung, who is impressive for his vertical geography. The action sequences are correct most of the time, although they only show brilliance in two moments: during the battle on the suspension bridge and in a great dispute between Po and Shifu. In fact, once again, the animators keep referring to other features similar to a few and subtle elements, such as running through the roofs of the village at night (The Tiger and the Dragon) and, of course, the fantasy tone and themes recurrents of the genus wuxia pian.On the other hand, if the 2D sequence that opens the film is ambitious in its stylization, the rest of the narrative, performed in 3D, exhibits a visual logic without imagination or personality, limiting itself to framing the characters in a bureaucratic and not very expressive way - and the maximum that directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson can conceive of ""differently"" boils down to a few freeze frames that try to extract humor from Tai Lung's blows while he attacks his jailers. On the other hand, cinematographer Yong Duk Jhun at least tries to make the experience more interesting (albeit unoriginal) by bathing the flashbacks in a nostalgic gold that contrasts with the gray and cold tones that mark the scenes starring the villain.The digital animation of Kung Fu Panda was filmed in CinemaScope, a film format used from 1953 to 1967, that is, also in classic martial arts films. In addition, the animals that make up the Furious Five represent styles of fighting that really exist in kung fu, which has styles inspired by animal movements. Such precision in portraying this universe includes research that began five years ago, involving all Chinese aesthetics. The producers also took kung fu classes and film marathons of the genre to understand the movements that should be imprinted on the characters in the animation. The result is an animation produced with excellence. In addition to having charismatic characters - especially the protagonist -, Kung Fu Panda sounds like a tribute to the height of kung fu features. The movements of the characters, the direction and the way the cameras move between the grandiose scenarios created for the feature film always refer to the genre's productions.But if the script is unpretentious, apart from one harmless scene of ""Buddhism for Westerners to see"", that does not mean that it has moments of pure brilliance. The scene with Po outside the temple where the tournament is being held to define the Dragon Warrior is excellent for not showing anything that is happening inside. The suggestion, through sound, a narrator and any pyrotechnics that escape the building, is hopeless. Just like Panda, who cannot see his idols inside, we are distressed. Another great detail is the bear's hilarious relationship with his father (a goose!), Which the film leaves without any explanation, in a delightful nonsense moment. If the two are so happy that way, why would you want to know their origins? The captivating irrelevance of this moment is another asset of the text, which also includes other fun details, such as the fact that all citizens are ""Chinese food"" (pigs, ducks, rabbits ...).Benefited by having friendly characters (it is impossible not to admire the excitement of Po, who is happy even when he is beaten by his idols), Kung Fu Panda still offers a strong dramatic element through the internal conflicts of the master Shifu - and it is touching to see him try to face Tia Lung only to be weakened by the very memories he has of the villain while he was still a sweet cub. Less interesting, on the other hand, is the development of old and beaten themes from DreamWorks animations (and I also include 2D productions), such as the need to ""fight for dreams"", the maxim of ""be yourself"""" And so on. In general, it is a good example to have fun with the children and to have some sincere good laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm not sure it quite lives up to that high of billing.What I did really like about it was the animation and artwork. The colors were absolutely gorgeous and brilliant. Everything seemed to almost jump off the screen at you. I also really liked Jack Black's portrayal as the underdog who becomes the hero. He has the self-deprecating personality to begin with that fit well here.Some disappointments were that some big name A list stars seem to barely have bit parts here - like Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan. I would have liked to hear more from their characters. Jolie's rendition seemed to be especially flat and emotionless - but perhaps she was trying to portray a steely tigress. But it sounded like she was just reading lines.

"KUNG FU PANDA (Mark Osbourne and John Stevenson, 2008) ***","After an innovative and likable start, the SHREK series quickly deteriorated and, being a similar product, I didn’t quite know how I was going to react to this one – which is basically TMNT via SHREK and STAR WARS (with Oogway standing in for Yoda, Shifu as a cross between Obi-Wan-Kenobi and Master Splinter, Tai Lung replacing Darth Vader and Po, obviously, as an amalgam of both Luke Skywalker and Shrek!).Surprisingly, I ended up enjoying it quite a bit because, not only was the animation technique on display thoroughly “awesome” (though the very best sequence may well be the classically animated opening dream sequence!), but the characterizations themselves (particularly Jack Black’s titular bout) were vividly realized. Apart from Black, Angelina Jolie and Dustin Hoffman, I didn’t recognize the other voice artists and, realizing that the characters of Tai Lung, Monkey and Viper had actually been voiced by Ian McShane, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu respectively only brought to mind another pet peeve of mine which has become increasingly common in contemporary movies: the credits are bundled together at the very end while the opening is reserved to an endless succession of production company logos (although, in this case, the transformed animated Asian-inflected Dreamworks logo was an inspired and amusing touch)!The moral of the story – that one should not refrain from chasing his life’s dreams in spite of the everyday adversities and that within everyone is the will to achieve this goal – sets the scene for an epic framework of good-vs.-evil in ancient Asia. Thankfully, in spite of the expected spectacle of various action sequences, we were spared anachronistic, in-jokey references to popular movies like THE MATRIX (1999), CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000) and the KILL BILL saga (2003-4). The only disappointment is the rather thin, by-the-numbers plot line – for all his strength and ferocity, one would have expected Tai Lung to summon an army to make his bid for the Dragon Warrior title and end with a veritable battle (rather than turn up alone and, after defeating the previously unassailable Furious Five with relative ease, confront his former mentor/surrogate father and engage in single combat with Po – which he then, obviously, loses)!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not as engaging as I thought it would be,"I was definitely excited to see Kung Fu Panda. I ""prepared for awesomeness"" as its fun trailer suggested, but it wasn't as engaging as I thought it would be. It opens with a stylized fight sequence that belongs more in highbrow children's books that thankfully ended after my first yawn.Po (voice by Jack Black) is an impressionable, fat panda who regularly daydreams about kung fu fighting as he helps his pop run their noodle shop. He finally gets to realize his dream when he is chosen to be trained by the great kung fu master Shifu (voice by Dustin Hoffman) to fight against the evil Tai Lung (voice by Ian McShane), much to the chagrin of Shifu's highly trained posse of Tigress (voice by Angelina Jolie), Monkey (voice by Jackie Chan), Mantis (voice by Seth Rogen), Viper (voice by Lucy Liu) and Crane (voice by David Cross).It had truly awesome fight scenes (especially noteworthy Tai Lung's escape from prison) and its share of kung fu wisdom, but overall, the writing and illustration just wasn't as clever or as funny as it promised. The animals were plain and androgynous so their personalities were very reliant on their characters' voices, especially the Tigress (thanks to Jolie's unmistakably sultry voice). Only the panda had a wider variety of facial expressions, and only very few of his lines were able to elicit some chuckles from the adults in the audience.

The Hero's Journey,"In one respect, the concept of a ""kung fu panda"" is an appropriate one. Kung fu is Chinese; pandas come from China. In other respects, however, it seems hilariously inappropriate. Pandas are widely regarded as placid, inoffensive animals, the least carnivorous of the Carnivora. Indeed, for many years zoologists denied them their rightful place in the bear family, categorising them instead as a sort of overgrown raccoon, as if unwilling to allow the noble name of the family Ursidae to be sullied by the inclusion therein of a creature which subsists on a staple diet of bamboo shoots. Even the name by which the giant panda has become known in English was borrowed from a much smaller animal, the red panda.""Kung Fu Panda"" is based upon a similar concept to the Disney cartoon of ""Robin Hood"" in that anthropomorphic animals are used to represent humans. The story is one which could have been the subject of a Chinese live-action martial arts film; an evil warrior (represented by a snow leopard) escapes from prison and spreads terror throughout the land, but is finally thwarted by an unlikely hero when the greatest kung fu masters have failed to do so.The story is treated as a comedy, so Po the panda becomes a comic figure. He is cowardly, clumsy, overweight and greedy, although being an anthropomorphic panda his favourite dish is not bamboo but noodles. Nevertheless, the wise old sage Master Oogway predicts that Po is destined to overcome the evil snow leopard Tai Lung and tells his disciple Master Shifu to begin training the panda in the martial arts. (Oogway is a turtle- a creature associated with wisdom in Chinese culture in the same way as the owl in the West. The name ""Oogway"" is derived from the Chinese for ""turtle"". Shifu, whose name is Chinese for ""master"" or ""teacher"", is supposed to be a red panda, although he does not bear much resemblance to one). At first Po seems to be completely unsuited to the disciplines of kung fu, and is resented by Shifu's other, more talented students, a tigress, a snake, a monkey, a crane and a mantis. Shifu eventually realises, however, that the way to motivate Po is by playing on his love of food.The story has been described as a comic take on the ""hero's journey"" narrative which underlies many Hollywood movies as well as traditional myths and legends. (The ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" films are also based upon this narrative). The ""journey"" in such stories can be spiritual rather than physical, and Po's journey is one from self-doubt to self-belief. A key moment comes when Po's father (not, as one might think, another panda but a goose) reveals to him that his famous ""secret ingredient soup"" does not in fact contain a secret ingredient; what matters is that people believe it to be something special. Similarly, Po starts to become special the moment he starts to believe in himself.In a departure from my normal practice, I am not giving this film a mark out of ten; cartoons like this are primarily aimed at children, who tend to judge them by very different standards from adults. Nevertheless, I will say that this is a film which I enjoyed. My wife, who is herself Chinese, enjoyed it even more that I did, as it reminded herself of the ""wuxia"" films with which she was familiar in her own childhood. (The wise old master, the self-doubting disciple who learns to believe in himself and the kung fu master who follows the way of evil like Tai Lung are all stock figures from these dramas). The Chinese-inspired style of the computer-generated animation helps give this film a distinctive local flavour and the amusing antics of Po make him a great comic character.",,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty pictures and thats about it,This movie was entertaining first off. Which I think all movies should be. Now let it be known Dreamworks is no Pixar in terms of story development. Yet visually it was on par with Wall-E. The characters designs were very nice and stylized.Yet here's the clincher the story was nothing short of typical. There was nothing that possibly set it apart from other movies like itself. There has even been books and televisison shows and movies and even videogames that preceed this that are based on some the principles of this movie.The main character Po was just that po' in character development. It was just another Jack Black character except this time with fur. The casting was nothing spectacular. Could Dreamworks have maybe did a little bit more with it's actual casting. Yes. Instead they choose top celebs or celebs that basically everyone is accustomed to and gave them roles. The other characters besides Po had little to no personality to me except for maybe Master Sif.The humor was typical Dreamworks so I won't touch that but otherwise I can tell you now that if you're looking for a nice way to kill some time this way movie is the way to do it.My overall score is a 6,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A dreamworks masterpeice,"This movie isn't just for kids. I've watched it as a child and i thought its one of the best movies I've seen. I just rewatched it now that im 18 and its still as good. Po is such a great character. Many people can relate to him because he comes from nothing and achives the highest level of mastery. All the characters are catching, to the point you never will forget their names 5 years from now. The villan of the movie is just as well writen and the story and pacing of the movie is perfect. I cant say more about this movie because I don't want to ruin it for others. This movie never ages and the story is thrilling. Must watched if you haven't!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Just like every other movie, should've done something special with KUNG FU PANDA","good animated movie for the kids but if you're not a fan of animated movies, of course this movie is not for you. this movie alone is not worth the money. voices are great, although i'm a bit tired of hearing Jack Black's voice. it gets quite irritating.Basically we've got a plot for an animated movie, that is overly didactic. The main character, a panda, learns his true dreams and pursues this dream, eventually reaching the zenith of his career. He achieves the seemingly impossible, with the indirect aid of his goose father and a kung fu master. Does this plot seem familiar? Mm hmm.This movie isn't special. It's purely entertainment. But it is more animated than most other movies, and a lot more vivid/character-involved. Sooo you'll guess correctly that it's kind of boring for the older audience. Kung fu Panda is fun but the humor is seriously directed to the younger audience (<14.) If you think it can serve as a source of inspiration for the young kids, in that anything is possible, then go for it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, But right now our present is 'Kung Fu Panda'.","To be honest, despite reading flattering reviews, I didn't really expect much from this film.It's not amazing, but it is entertaining and very humorous in parts, with the kung fu scenes sufficiently fulfilling need for epic- ness (for want of, not a better, but a more conventional, word).However, it is the witty script that impressed me the most, and I suddenly harked back to the witty dialogue in the original 'Shrek'. Though conversely, to praise 'Panda' further, it is valid to say that this Dreamworks production adopts a more original storyline, backed up with equally as provoking dialogue.Not to insult 'Shrek' that is, because I prefer it- just clarifying the many post-modern references that support 'Shrek' in its comedy.Yes, 'Kung Fu Panda' goes back to basics (well aside from the blatant Asian-kung-fu-animation-parody), and provides laughs in a more round-a-bout way. ...Again this is not necessarily a good thing.I did enjoy it, and was mused by Jack Black. Felt like writing this comment purely because of some of the lines delivered throughout the film (some of which I have stolen for repeat purposes).The End.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Such a wonderful family gem!,"A little close to being late to catching up on the new Kung Fu Panda, figured I'd go through the films today I got incredible sleep which is rare for me.

Visually beautiful for a (2008) film, great voices, wonderful silliness, and charm.

"Painfully average, with few good moments.","It is a common thing these days that animated movies are not made just for kids, but also for adult audience as well. I have no reason to think that kids won't love this movie. Po is interesting character, somewhat funny, but unless you are 12 years old, this film just won't do the thing. Before I watched ""Kung Fu Panda"" I have read a lot of reviews full of superlatives, excitement and good words for this movie and to be honest, I have expected much, much more. The story is, just as I expected to be, nothing more than million times seen thing like ""there is a hero in each one of us, even the most average guys"". And to make things worse, writers didn't even try to add anything new. After 15 minutes of this movie, you can pretty much guess the rest of plot, without any errors. But the story is not the only flaw of this movie. It's not even funny. And it is supposed to be, it's animated movie after all. I have read some reviews saying the beginning is little boring, but later on, you will roll on the floor laughing and crying. Honestly, not only I haven't roll on the floor like promised, I have a feeling that I have spent an hour and thirty minutes waiting to see something spectacularly funny, but it never happened. There were few funny moments, but that's it! There was no magic, like in ""Wall-E"" or ""Shrek"", no laugh, no nothing, it looked painfully average to me, especially after big expectations I had. I think this movie is pretty much overrated.By my opinion, 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
My 150th Review: Kung Fu Panda: Good family film,"I like that in this film that they don't make all their jokes to simple to all the kids like in a lot of kid movies and they actually respect that kids do have an IQ over 15 and do know some things so you don's have to over simplify everything for their so called tiny brains.In the film, Po (Jack Black) is a noodle chef who dreams of being a Kung Fu Master gets declared the saviour of China and meets the master (Dustin Hoffman) and the skilled 5 (Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, David Cross, Seth Rogan and Jackie Chan) who are all trying to get rid of him. But when an evil force escapes from prison, he must fight and save china.The film is good and well acted and written. The film is a welcome relief to some of the other family crap coming out this year and last, I know I am not the only one but I am a definite fan of this film.Overall, the film is good and worth a watch to all family members out there. There are jokes for the young and old and the film definitely gets a high rating from me. I rate this film 74%.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A paper thin and clichéd plot/script saved by superior animation,"I watched this movie on the recommendation of a good friend. He absolutely loved this movie and as he hasn't steered me wrong before, I took his word for it and watched it. Boy did he let me down on this one. I will state the films' positives first.The animation is gorgeous. It is a visual gold mine and on every level the movie looks FANTASTIC. Here endeth the positives.And now for the negatives-EVERYTHING ELSE about the film. Where do I start? How about Jack Black's character stumbling or falling down every two minutes of the film. This gimmick is so tired in children's films. The goofy, ugly duckling character bumping into a table and then starting a chain reaction of things falling apart around him and then he falls on his ass and something lands on his head has been used ad nauseum in most films like this. The plot, the script, and the characters are so thin that there is zero emotional impact when the villain and Kung Fu Panda meet in the finale. There is no sense of danger whatsoever in regard to the villain. WARNING HERE BE SPOILERS All of the characters are freaking out all through the movie that the villain (a completely wasted effort from the fantastic Ian McShane) is going to kill everybody. He kills no one and Kung Fu Panda dispatches him easily in the end. Which, considering that KFP has zero Karate skill until a montage gives it to him is laughable. Every Disney cliché you can think of is on display here-from the Ugly Duckling to the goofy supporting characters to the ""Just believe in yourself"" pep talks from the wiser older characters. Basically the film feels like all the money went into the animation and not the script and plot. This is a shame because there is no solid foundation for the films' breath-taking visuals to rest on. There is just no meat to this movie. Take away the visual side and you have a completely un-imaginative film that teaches the viewer nothing and elicits zero emotional response.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Kung Fu Panda,"The hard-headed folks at Dreamworks just won't back down when it comes to their consistent choice to produce only the animated genre of slapstick comedy despite constant unnecessary comparisons to Pixar by most audiences. Here however, I feel they've finally succeeded in forming a well-crafted comedy that references itself and its genre without any manipulative occurrences of incessant cute (despite featuring one of the universal symbols) or thin framework. One of the first cgi Dreamworks romps to lack pop culture (shockingly less than Pixar's Cars) the pacing in the film shines, as well as the slick camera work and surprisingly effective fight sequences. Particularly, there was a true sense of environment to the animation, but also a sense of peril and physical boundaries in the well choreographed combat scenes. The story is expectedly predictable as well as the clean message, but the film comes together as referential fun comedy with likable and moderately inspiring situations despite the nature of the film. There are no mean-spirited jokes, and just the right amount of heart are out into them (not too much or little) so that it begins to approach what made the first Shrek enjoyable. It makes great use of its animation, tying in it's comical pacing with a lot of great physicality. I thoroughly enjoyed the characterizations, barely noticing or caring that they typically come to us from cherry-picked A-list celebs in an attempt to drag in theatregoers. Despite that, they bring their A-game with voice work, and the audience besides the actors have fun for once. In my opinion, it's one of Dreamworks' best after they canned their 2d films. I did not see that coming, with the eye-roll inducing premise.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A great introduction to one of Dreamwork's best,"The Good Stuff (from best to least best)1.) The two main characters are really well done. Po and Shifu's dynamic is fun throughout the whole film. You get to see Po start to believe in himself and Shifu warm up to him in some touching and comedic ways.2.) The villain, Tai Lung, is really good. Its very hard to get a great hero and a great villain, but this movie did it. Tai Lung has a believable back story, a fun cocky attitude, and an excellent entrance.3.) For a movie all about Kung Fu, it does not disappoint. The training and the fights are all well choreographed and fun to watch.4.) I am quite the critic when it comes to comedy, usually being hard to win me over, but this movie definitely has its moments. Some of the jokes didn't land at all, but there were quite a few that got me.The Bad Stuff (from worst to least worst)1.) I really wish the Furious Five had more time to develop and feel like real characters. As it stands, besides Tigress, it's hard to even vaguely describe any of them.2.) The story, while definitely not bad, feels a bit uninspired. They make the plot fun, but it still lacks when you realize the potential they had with the characters.Overall this movie was a great opener for the cast of characters. While it left some to be desired from the supporting characters, the main ones worked great together. Exciting fights, punchy comedic moments, and a lovable panda all work together to make a really fun movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Kung Fu Panda sporadically uses the Wuxi Finger Hold to produce an uneven yet delightful animation.,"A family-oriented parody animation, paying homage to the classic martial arts features that clearly inspired it. 'The Karate Kid', 'Enter The Dragon' and even 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' as a more obscure credit. Whilst not at the stylistic level of 'Hero' or 'House of Flying Daggers', there are glimpses of cinematic allurement, yet the basic story and one-dimensional supporting cast of anthropomorphic animals prevented this flick from reading its own omnipotent dragon scroll. In ancient China, a kung fu enthusiastic panda named Po is nominated as the ""Dragon Warrior"" and must fulfil his destiny in vanquishing the antagonistic Tai Lung.Bravery. Self-belief. ""Skadoosh"". The timeless legend of a bumbling panda beckoned to save the realms of China from an evil snow leopard, where the vital aspect of life itself is the power of belief. A basic moral for children to abide to, and a pleasing adventure for adults to be entertained by. Stunningly animated, particularly the introductory sequence resembling Chinese shadow puppetry, with many shots bursting vibrant colours at every opportunity. Even the lighting was superbly animated, bouncing off furry character models exquisitely. Zimmer's score harnessed Chinese instruments and utilised them to their full potential, exhuming a rural aesthetic that complemented the environmental design.Then of course, you have Po. The titular beast that would do anything, and I mean anything, for a cookie or dumpling. Voiced excitedly by Black who executed his consistent comedic timing with ease, but failed to take hold of the more heartfelt moments. And that's where my biggest criticism lies.The visual comedy overwhelmed the poignant moments for the characters which rarely allowed any connectivity between them. Oogway's departure, seen through the eyes of the fragile Shifu, was probably the only heartfelt moment. Po couldn't quite capture any pure emotion, whether that be due to the frenetic screenplay or Black's overabundance of comedy is up for debate. The remaining cast members, aside from Hoffman, were forgettable and could've been replaced by anyone. The Furious Five rarely made an impact to the overall story, and essentially only provided one fight scene against Tai Lung, whom of which was terribly miscast as McShane as he lacks that sharp bite from his voice. Atleast they addressed the fact that Mr. Ping (goose) was the adoptive father of Po (panda), because that could've been an awkward conversation for parents to have with their children.With Kung Fu Panda being a DreamWorks Animation product, it's unequivocally one of their more memorable films. Beautifully encapsulating ancient China in an accessible story for everyone. Its simplicity and heartfelt absence does however prevent it from realising its true potential as an all-round animated classic. Wait, let me say it one more time...""Skadoosh"".",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Good Fight Scnes can't save inept script, miscast voices, and wrong messages.","There's just so much money involved in the creation of the current breed of animated/cg movies that they rarely strike out. Indeed, I found even mediocrely-reviewed fare such as ""monsters vs aliens"" to actually be quite good and appreciable on an adult level with lots of intelligent jokes and the occasional innuendo.But not ""Kung Fu Panda."" Kung Fu Panda is awful.Here's the plot: fat, lazy, wisecracking panda boy is surprisingly chosen to be ""the one"" to defend against big bad guy, much to the chagrin of five sidekick kung-fu master animals who have spent their lifetimes in training and work. initially, they reject him since he's a fat lazy panda. will he find the solution, a combination of 'believing in himself' and taking advantage of his 'alternate but just as good talents' (he's fat, so he can be motivated by food) to defeat the bad guy and save the day? alas, yes. the plot is just that stupid, sending all the wrong messages. in kung fu panda's America, you don't have to do the math or practice for more than a few token montage scenes. you just 'believe in yourself.' this line of nonsense used to what they used to console kids on the slow bus with, but is now what passes for 'inclusive education' or some-such. and mind you, I'm an extreme political liberal (though a well educated one) writing this.but, even such inanity could be salvageable if the jokes and acting along the way were any good. they're not. the A-list quality supporting voice talent in addition to B-list quality lead Jack Black are utterly miscast. Angelina Jolie is wasted and unnecessary, though I'm sure she was glad for the check for her afternoon of work. did anybody here go see the movie because Angelina Jolie or Dustin Hoffman were cast? then why did they bother? one suspects a massive kickback scheme is in place - how else to explain why major stars land well paying voice animated rolls that probably do nothing to drawing audiences? the only good to be gotten out of this absolutely miserable movie are the fight scenes. i'm not usually one for fight scenes (and this movie didn't change this), but at times they were clever enough. there was no groundbreaking animation in this movie; I just mean to say that if you happen to like kung fu fight scenes, then you'll probably enjoy the ones here. i personally found those in 'crouching tiger hidden dragon' far more satisfying, but I can't say that those here were in any way bad for what they were. the 'dumpling scene' was particularly well done.the only thing that this movie had that in any way broke the usual stereotypes was the depiction of the prison that held the 'long caged' bad guy in the beginning. his jailers, for once, were not total dupes.i, however, felt like a total dupe after watching this very poor movie - doubly so since it was recommended to me as being particularly well written.conclusion: worst animated/cgi film i've seen in at least the last decade.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Really cute and fun!,"Kung Fu Panda, when I saw this trailer, I have to admit, it looked pretty lame, it just seemed like a typical CGI kids film that wouldn't be much fun for the grown up's and like it would be forced humor. But I decided to go ahead and see the movie today, I'm so glad that I gave it chance because this was such an enjoyable film not just for me, but the kids as well. As I looked around the theater, everyone was just having so much fun watching Kung Fu Panda, the jokes, the animation, the voices, the story, I felt like I was watching real kung fu movie. The action sequences were so exciting and you couldn't help but just cheer for the warriors. I loved how the animals represented all the kung fu movie: the viper, the tiger, the praying mantas, the monkey, the crane, and the panda. This movie is just so much for the entire family to watch.Po is a panda who is just dreaming of one day to learn kung fu like his idols, the fantastic five, but his father wishes for him to take over their noodle restaurant. Bu when Oogway has a vision and tells Shifu that he is having a vision of Tai Lung, a student gone evil, is about to come back, he picks the ""dragon warrior"", which is Po. But Shifu sees Po as well as the fantastic five, they're all disappointed and don't believe in him. But after Tai Lung escapes, Shifu has to learn to believe in Po and help him with the strengths and the ""secret ingredient"" that he has.Kung Fu Panda is one of the year's most fun and entertaining movies that anyone could enjoy. I know that most of Dreamwork's cartoon films are not always as memorable as the Disney and Pixar combination, but they do pull out some great films. I just loved the scene where Shifu is training Po how to fight and they realize that it is food that is Po's strength, the fight for a dumpling was just so much fun and incredibly entertaining. I really enjoyed Kung Fu Panda with a passion, it's a big recommendation, it has great comedy, and some really terrific characters that will all get you in the mood for some kung fu fighting. Not to mention: Jack Black, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, and Lucy Lui, plus many more, how could you not love a cast like that?

A hit even with mainland Chinese viewers,"I saw this last night at a theater in mainland China with four of my 20-something year old Chinese friends. There were about 25 people in the audience: no kids, only other 20-somethings (cinemas here are usually only attended by young couples looking for a place to go), but the movie was a hit nonetheless.The film had been dubbed in Chinese, so I didn't get to hear the original voices (that's why I can only rate it a 9; I'll have to watch it again later in English) but the story itself and the lines as they'd been translated went over really well with this audience. (One of my friends commented afterward that it was so good he wondered if the English version could match it!!)The theater was full of laughter all throughout. The audience (including me, an American 40-something) loved the story, the characters, and especially the brilliant slow motion ""takes"" with their great sound effects.To be honest, like several others who've commented here, I really wasn't expecting much. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. If you're in any doubt whether or not to go, GO!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
Boring but has cute and cuddly characters,"Kung-Fu Panda is an above average film which tries to stay away from predictability and takes its time to show Po learning martial arts. The result at the end turns out not too bad, it uses Hollywood clichés in a pretty clever way, and even though some of the fight scenes don't work, it still is pretty good, though kind of boring. DreamWorks tries to regain the magic for the film that it had for Shrek but doesn't reach up to standards despite that their 7 years apart.The voice acting for Po sounds like nails-on-a-chalkboard sometimes especially in the beginning but then gets better. The animation is not the best but it still features cute and cuddly characters. It's funny.It's fast-paced but I still would try the sequels even though they may not seem necessary to me.Rating: 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny and well animated,"Kung-fu Panda is packed with explosive animation sequences that go well with the story. Most of the characters are well developed, likable and really well animated. If you watch their faces closely, you will not consider them 1-dimensional. Less is more, some of the body language was beautifully accomplished with the slightest of moves.As for the story, it bears heavy resemblance to the movie Kung-fu Hustle. If you watched both movies, you will be able to tell without hesitation who is who, and many scenes and concepts from the Hustle are directly transposed to the Panda. Still, the movie has lots of original content. Event characters and jokes carried over from the Hustle are tweaked in such way that they are still very funny and enjoyable.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Out of them all, the 'escape' was probably my favorite sequence.Though I wouldn't call it a classic, as it lacked the emotional touch of 'Nemo' & Lion King etc, it is entertaining for adults and kids alike, though it kinda seemed a little violent for kids (but then who really cares these days!).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Feel the Thunder!,"From the time I was a little one to now, I have always loved movies and anything else with an Asian flair. From Mulan to Samurai Champloo, Asia's rich and interesting culture have always been in my must-have book, and I have loved them since childhood. Kung-Fu Panda takes an interesting look at this genre, as well as a modern one.Po, a chubby, yet lovable Panda (Jack Black) works in a noodle shop with his Goose father (David Hong), but dreams of Kung-Fu and fighting with the Fearsome Five, a team made up of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen). When the old turtle sage Oogway announces a tournament for the selection of the Dragon Warrior, Po tries to attend, but, because of late arrival, is shut out. When he falls into the stadium after another failed attempt to get in, he is unwittingly selected as the warrior. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) is now faced with the task of training a panda with great knowledge but little skill in Kung-Fu. Meanwhile, the evil Tai Long (Ian MacShane) has escaped from prison, and is now threatening the village. Can Po live up to his new title and the dreams that keep him going? When the film was advertised, I became very interested. Seeing promo after promo peaked it. When I read the article on this film from USA today, I was surprised to see that a number of adults had gone to see it in the opening weekend! I figured, that's good enough for me, so I got my mom to take me to the theater to see it...and absolutely loved it. It is probably the best film from Dreamworks yet. The characters are what really draw you into the movie and the action/fighting sequences are expertly timed. The voice cast is perfectly cast. Jack Black plays our furry, chubby, kung-fu loving hero Po. Angelina Jolie is the bad-ass tigress who, although brash and thinks Po is a joke at first, is brave and learns to trust in her new comrade. Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Michael Clarke Duncan and Lucy Liu also round out the cast. The effects and animation also make the movie a must see!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Jack Black's influence all over,"Like all other animations this movie sure took its time in developing the critical characters. Although maybe for this movie one might feel that it takes too much time in developing those characters that it feels that the character development still happens just until the main conflict, which is quite sudden for animation movie story flow. The jokes are absolutely funny, not necessarily because of the jokes itself, but because of Jack Black's comedic aura. I've watched two versions of this movie, one with original Enlish dialog with Jack Black's voice and one with dialog dubbed into Indonesian. The Indonesian version didn't have the jokes to be cracking laughs due to the dubber lacking Black's comedic prowess. The voice acting overall is nicely almost entirely Jack Black's influence. And that's quite fair in my view since his mark is all over the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Just a Great Animated Movie- A Great Movie . . . Period!,"I was very entertained by ""Kung-Fu Panda"". This movie ranks among Dreamworks Animation's best along with ""Shrek"", ""Shrek II"", and ""Antz"". The animation as a whole was excellent, including the fantasy sequences that took the form of supposed 2D animation. Even when the animation was 3D, the animation had everything down to a T from the blades of grass to roof shingles to animal's fur.Of course, since 3D has now become the norm for animated movies, I know that 3D animation alone cannot save a movie. For instance, ""Doogal"", ""Shrek The Third"", and ""Shark Tale"" (which also featured the voices of Jack Black and Angelina Jolie) were big disappointments for me. Fortunately, there was enough good comedy, great action sequences, and intriguing characters to keep me entertained and to rate this movie as the best to come out of this summer so far.For starters, Jack Black was perfect as Po the Panda. In my opinion, Black was underused in ""Shark Tale"", which was probably why I didn't like that movie so much. Here, he brings his great comic timing and a touch of his Tenacious D personality into this panda character. He especially works very well in the training sequences with Head Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). I thought it odd that his character was the only panda in a story set in China, but I won't get too picky.The actors who played the Furious Five were also well cast. Angelina Jolie was a natural to play Tigress, who is probably the first truly strong female character in animation history who also isn't involved in a love story subplot of a film. I actually found myself relieved that they left such a subplot out and just concentrated on a great story.If I have one complaint against the movie, it's that the other four fighters weren't as focused on as they should have been. Yes, there's only so much you can fit into a 90 minute movie, but the snake (Lucy Liu), crane (David Cross), praying mantis (Seth Rogen), and monkey (Jackie Chan) all individually made such intriguing characters. Indeed, this is one of the few animated movies I've seen that merits a sequel, and I hope that all four of them are focused on in that other movie should it come along.Otherwise, that's my only complaint against the movie. It just worked so well otherwise. Other than the mostly American voice-overs, the movie stayed true to a traditional Kung Fu movie by the likes of Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba, and also had elements of spaghetti westerns and other movies such as ""Star Wars"". None of that would have been complete with a great Darth Vader-esquire villain like leopard Tai Ling (played by lesser known actor Ian McShane), and an even better Yoda-esquire mentor like tortoise Ancient Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). This is an altogether incredible movie that I personally can't wait to purchase on DVD. I may even see it again in theaters, and there are few movies that make me want to do that.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Positively entertaining,"This film is about a panda accidentally getting selected to become the dragon warrior to fight off the ferocious beast.The story is straight forward but interesting enough to keep viewers interested. Playing against stereotype is the main theme here, with a big fat panda becoming an unlikely hero. The fighting scenes are well done, and it preserves a lot of Chinese elements, such as the scene where Shifu's stick touches the water (a move called dragonfly touching the water) when he gets the scroll from the ceiling. There are quite a few funny scenes, but I think the fat jokes and crashing into walls are overdone.Have faith and believe in yourself is also one key element in ""Kung Fu Panda"". I think such positivity is one of the key to the success of this film. It connects with every viewer, offering a dream where everyone can excel.",,Anonymous,Animation

"I suppose it's wrong to compare it to Pixar's work, but it is a decent little flick","Decent animated entertainment from Dreamworks, the poor man's Pixar. Except for Shrek, which I despised, Dreamworks' animated films have been rather enjoyable, if unremarkable, and Kung Fu Panda continues this trend. Jack Black voices Po, a fat, clumsy panda who dreams of kung fu while working in a noodle shop. One day, he is chosen by a kung fu master to be the next dragon warrior, the one who will defeat über-villain Tai Lung (Ian McShane). Will he embarrass himself, or will at some point realize that, if he believes in himself, he can accomplish anything? Only the stupidest children can't figure that one out. Other voices are provided by Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, and Michael Clark Duncan. Jesus. Just think about how much money Dreamworks wasted on all these people. Jackie Chan, for instance, has possibly one line in the entire movie, and probably made a million dollars for it. The movie itself is enjoyable, especially during the action sequences, which go by a little too fast but are well choreographed. The storyboarders had their work cut out for them. The artwork is probably the best looking Dreamworks has yet conceived, but compare it to the visionary WALL-E and it's clear that this studio is just for kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
In the making of Dragon Warrior,"Not a big Animated watcher but still this Franchise has caught me up to follow but here I am only talking about the first installment of the movie which roams around the making of Dragon Warriors who is unorthodox and even did not met up with the criteria for being one but fate had its own planning the film is good for all the right reasons however the message is familiar but blended nicely with Humor, strong dialogues and some Kung Fu actions, this animated movie is both likable and watchable at the same time for all ages and genders",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Lot Better Than Expected!,"I hate talking animal movies and CGI movies so when you put those two together, it's usually a pretty bad combination for me. There have been a few exceptions like most of Disney/Pixar's films and now, Kung Fu Panda. I'm a big fan of kung fu movies and I think most fans will enjoy this movie because it seems to have been made specifically for those people.The story and actually quite good and has a lot of heart. There are some really great action sequences, as well and they really captured the kung fu feel with this movie. I also thought the visuals were great which is rare, at least to me, in a CGI film. There are a lot of very good things about this film that almost everyone should enjoy.Kung fu fans probably won't be disappointed with this one as I had a blast with it. I was expecting total garbage and actually am happy that I saw it. I'll be picking up the DVD when it comes out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

THE Big Funny Panda,"Fortune cookie wisdom is imparted throughout the colorful KUNG FU PANDA. Some of it makes no sense out of context but it all amounts to some very simple, very basic advice about believing in the warrior within. ""There are no accidents,"" claims the coolest of Zen master turtles after a panda drops from the sky at just the right moment to be deemed the next Dragon Warrior. There are especially no accidents when no risk is taken. That panda is of course the panda from the title and from the moment this lazy emotional eater is ""discovered"" as the warrior that will go on to save the kingdom, you know exactly how the entire thing will play out. Po (voiced by an increasingly subtle Jack Black) will drown in doubt while he trains for something he doesn't believe himself capable of; the other animals will badger him into giving up; but eventually, he will find his inner kung fu master and save the day. Subsequently and expectedly, reviewers will call it out for its lack of originality. That's how it goes.So it isn't so original. No big deal. What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in style and humour. Relatively new directors, Mark Osborne and John Stevenson have created a multihued ancient China that moves with stealth precision between enchantment and explosive energy. Its inhabitants are geese and rabbits that live their lives in the shadow of lore. As long as all is peaceful, then they can blissfully enjoy their noodle soups in the town square and if anything should happen to collapse that peace, then they have the kung fu specialized Furious Five  a tiger, a monkey, a crane, a snake and oddly enough, a mantis  to protect them from whatever evil lurks. No one member of the community has more faith in these five than Po. His idolatry of these heroes extends to numerous posters on his walls and action figures by his bed. Black plays Po as the hardcore geek that hides his enthusiasm and secret desire to be a part of it all in fear of being ridiculed for wanting the impossible. Po is that unfortunate fat kid from school that wants to hang with all the cool kids, hates that he's stuck working at the local fast food joint after school and knows that there's nothing he can do about it. Wait; was I that kid? Is that why I love him?KUNG FU PANDA is overloaded with voice talent. Any scene with Po is usually hilarious as I guess Black knows what it's like to be the unlikely guy hanging with the in crowd. However, when he isn't in the picture, the delivery from the majority of the A-list cast is often bland and purely functional. Po, and his kung fu trainer, Shifu (a frustrated and disgruntled, yet still minutely optimistic Dustin Hoffman) trade quips with fervor and weight and make for much giddiness. The Furious Five, not so much. Considering they're voiced by actors as varied as Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen, you would think they would provide for plenty of conflicting antics but they end up reduced to nothing more than another obstacle for Po to overcome. I'm no kung fu expert but I'm pretty sure gossiping and bad mouthing members of the team when they aren't there (and sometimes even when they're right in front of them) is not part of the package. Our heroes aren't always what we hope they will be when we finally find ourselves face to face with them but these five could have certainly been truer to their furious form if some element of development had been given to them.Still, despite its unevenness and seemingly simple approach, KUNG FU PANDA is great wisdom wrapped in even greater fun and often breathtaking animation. Sometimes the simplest of lessons are the ones that are hardest to learn. (Now I'm a fortune cookie.) Perhaps the subtlest lesson the film passes on is to relinquish your control over the destiny of your own life. Po never thought he would find himself surrounded by his heroes, getting the chance to realize his life long dream of becoming a kung fu master but here he is suddenly. Master Shifu never thought he would be training such a useless lump but here his is as well. It is only when each character let go of their egos and expectations that they saw how to make their situation work. Shedding your own expectation for KUNG FU PANDA to be something more than what it really is will allow for the good times intended to be had and an unexpected tranquility to seep into your mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I can't wait to see it again!,"Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po (an overweight, underachieving panda) who spends his days serving noodles at his father's restaurant and his nights dreaming of kung fu greatness. When the wise Master Oogwei (a tortoise) foretells the return of a deadly warrior who is bent on exacting revenge on their village, he and Master Shifu (a red panda) must find the fabled Dragon Warrior who is destined to save them all. Much to everyone's surprise, and seemingly by accident, Master Oogwei chooses Po. With entire village's fate in his hands, Po must face the countless doubters all around him as well as the doubt in his own heart.Though I was excited to go see this movie, I had some reservations. Jack Black's bumbling-yet-lovable shtick can be too much at times, and as a starring actor he can be rather polarizing. I'm happy to say that he blew me away in his role as Po. The part was clearly written for Jack Black and is very much in keeping with his personality, but rather than bringing out that annoying side of his, here he was nothing short of absolutely endearing. I suppose it doesn't hurt that Po is a roly poly panda bear, but Jack Black injected the character with so much heart and soul that you couldn't help rooting for him from the very start, no matter how hopeless it seemed. Indeed, he had the audience laughing out loud by the end of the very first line.Dustin Hoffman shines equally in his role as Master Shifu, the kung fu master charged with training Po in the art. While Po is clearly flawed, Shifu is just as insecure and uncertain due to past tragedy, and he too must learn to trust that destiny will right things in the end. A number of other well-known talents voiced the roles of the Furious Five, a team of warriors trained under Shifu. The Furious Five are all Dragon Warrior hopefuls (as well as Po's idols), until Po is picked over them. It was fun to recognize their voices (Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Lucy Liu as Viper, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Jackie Chan as Monkey, and David Cross as Crane), but their roles were largely unexplored. That's okay, I was so entertained by the developing relationship between Po and Shifu that I wasn't much interested in the rest of them. Other memorable supporting parts were the roles of Po's noodle chef father (who is, inexplicably, a goose), the prison warden (an imposing rhinoceros voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan), and Master Oogwei who was reminiscent of a softer, gentler Master Yoda and is brought to life so beautifully by Randall Duk Kim.The story itself is simple and predictable (and, as some critics have been quick to point out, clichéd), but it is told so well that I can't think of anything I would have changed. Obviously there is an element of the fantastic, but the plot is woven together so seamlessly that it is easy for small children to keep track of and yet interesting enough to keep adults on the edge of their seats. Speaking for myself, there were several scenes that had me biting my nails with anxiety, and others that brought tears to my eyes.Many of the laughs involved classic references to the martial arts movie genre. Having grown up in a household where martial arts movies were a big part of family movie nights, I can tell you that the writers definitely did their homework. Once again, critics will complain that they just recycled old clichés, but that's the point. Anyone who is a fan of old kung fu movies will appreciate how well researched this is. Honestly, anyone who complains of this as being ""unoriginal"" is probably the same kind of movie critic who will complain about there being too much singing and dancing in a musical. It's part of the genre, so love it or leave it.Lastly, the animation was absolutely incredible. Dreamworks really outdid themselves here. The characters' movements were graceful and fluid... well, maybe not Po's so much, but you get what I'm saying. This was absolutely vital in a movie that features so much movement, and the animators did a wonderful job. There was also such incredible attention to detail. I'd like to watch the movie several times over just to take it all in. And the way they captured the treacherous beauty of the Chinese mountain ranges was breathtaking. Several scenes looked just like Chinese watercolor paintings.In closing, I'd definitely recommend this movie to viewers of all ages looking for a movie that is hilarious yet moving, and visually stunning. The whole audience laughed and cried together, and the experience reminded me of why some movies have to be seen in theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
equaled if not surpassed Ratatouille,"I had the pleasure to see this film last night in theaters. I was expecting little. Maybe it was because Dreamworks hadn't really made films to my liking recently, or maybe it was because I didn't think Jack Black's comedic talent (what I thought to be a mix of his voice ALONG WITH facial expressions) would do well in an animated film. Well, Dreamworks delivered what I thought to be the best comedy I've seen this year (that's right, include the non-cartoons in this category).The animation, firstly, was a major reason for the film's successful comedy. I was correct in saying Jack Black's facial expressions give merit to his overall performance, which is why the graphics and the perfection of just that in the visual characters had to be spot on- and it was. The script was surprisingly blunt and heartwarming at the same time. The voices were perfectly and hysterically matched (anytime Po the Panda's father spoke I couldn't stop laughing). The fight scenes were actually very impressive while maintaining the spoof-feel of the film, making them well-choreographed (if that's the term you use for a cartoon) and one of the funniest aspects of the movie.In all, I couldn't stop laughing throughout the whole movie. Now I don't really know if it's a ""great"" movie in all aspects for it to be an Oscar-winner, but I think the laughter speaks for itself on the matter of whether to buy a ticket and see this movie as soon as you possibly can.",,Anonymous,Animation

'Panda' is Peerless,"In recent years Dreamworks animation has been a sort of hit and miss production company. Some of their films have been nearly as good as the Pixar films (Shreks, Over the Hedge), but others have been close to complete crap (Shark Tale, Madagascar, Bee Movie). With 'Kung Fu Panda' Dreamworks hits the jackpot.The film is great because of how simple it is. Simple story, simple morals, simple (but very effective) comedy, and simple style. The movie is just good to watch. You could go and see it with your family, or your best friends---its a neutral sort of movie.Jack Black was the by far the best choice for the main character, Po, and you REALLY get a sense of the real Jack Black. He is such a passionate soul in most of his movies---this is especially highlighted in 'Panda.' Apart from having a simple and intriguing story, the movie has some legit fight scenes. Scenes that could only be made with animals shown in the film.Honestly, this is a great movie. If you want to feel good about going to see a movie by yourself, with friends, family, a girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever---truly, this is a great choice. DO NOT think this movie is just for kids, because it really is not.All in all, the movie is a clever, refreshing, and entertaining flick.

The first scene in the ""gym"" where Po gets hit in the groin and says ""mis panditas, always gets a big laugh in Spanish language theaters where in the English version, his answer is mumbled as if it wasn't correct to make that kind of joke in a children's movie. I think the animation is fantastic and everything else, but the voices are the weakest part of the movie for me, sad after how much effort was put into the animation. If you don't speak Spanish, just listen to the tonality.

Otherwise, this movie was certainly worth passing, unless you have children that are entertained by just about anything animated. Jack Black is typically very funny to me, and this character even suited his voice, yet still the silly and mundane story line just wasn't enough to keep my attention.

Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon + Once Upon a Time in China + Jackie Chan's Drunken Master + Bruce Lee + Shaw Brothers Movies + 3D Animation = Kung Fu Panda,"Firstly I can say that I am blown up by this movie. I am a fan of cartoon movies and I also a fan of Kung Fu movies. I can say that this movie is an amalgam of the many past Hong Kong kung fu movies from Shaw Brothers Wire Fu to Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan to Jet Lee in the wrapping of 3D animation.When I watch Po, I remember Jackie Chan in The Drunken Master. When I watch Master Shifu, I remember many of the white haired kung fu teachers characters to Jet Li's Master Wong Fei Hung. When I watch Master Crane, I remember Fu Shen's depiction of Fang Shih Yu on high poles. When I watched Master Tigress and Master Viper, I remember those lady kung fu warriors from Cheng Pei-pei to Michelle Yeoh to Zhang Zi Yi. When I watch Master Mantis and Master Monkey, I remember kung fu stars like Liu Jia Liang, Gordon Liu, and many others.The training devices so much resembles many Shaw Brothers kung fu movies with pivoting parts and so on. I particularly remember the Shao Lin wooden man scenes from those movies.The fight scene between Tai Lung and Master Shifu resembles many scenes from Hong Kong kung fu movies about a skillful students goes bad. The fight scene between the Furious Five and Tai Lung resembles many Jet Li's/Modern kung Fu Movies (like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) fight scenes. The fight scene between Po and Tai Lung is literally taken from Jackie Chan's Drunken Master/old movies. When Master Shifu told Po to hit the doll, Po was imitating Bruce Lee's moves.The story is not unfamiliar in many from zero to hero Kung Fu movies with doubts from the teacher, the hard training and so on, also with the antics and humor in them.In short, this movie encased all the good times in kung fu cinema in the clothing of 3D cartoon animation, almost too much for me to digest. I had a really really really good time watching this movie and could not stop laughing from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Panda Awesomeness,"In the climactic kung fu battle wannabe ""Dragon Warrior"" Tai Lung gazes upon the sacred Dragon Scroll which reveals the secret of Martial Arts Mastery and Power, and is left chagrined and perplexed. Panda Po (Jack Black) hysterically admits to the evil and powerful Snow Leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), ""I didn't get it the first time either"" Jack Black is awesome as the kung fu Panda in Directors Mark Osbourne and John Stevenson's ""Kung Fu Panda""one of the best movies of the year so far. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is definitely one of the funniest and most entertaining movies in a long while. Screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glen Berger, and Storywriters Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Vows' ""Kung Fu Panda"" has an inspiring and familiar message. Even in its familiarity and crisp spot on humor, ""Kung Fu Panda"" is surprisingly touching. After all, this is an unlikely hero's transformation tale. At the story arc Po confesses to Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), ""If there is anyone who could... make me, not me""it is Shifu. ""Kung Fu Panda"" also gets it right for the story of martial arts mastery, and perhaps mastery as a whole. This is refreshing and is also a great message for kidsas trite as that sounds.Fat slacker Panda Po, who dreams one day of being a kung fu master, works for his Dad, Mr. Ping (James Hong) in the family noodle shop. Note that Po's father is a duck, who dreams one day that Po will take over the family business. In a bizarre circumstance ancient tortoise Master Oogway (Randal Duk Kim) chooses Po as the Dragon Warrior. As Dragon Warrior, Po inherits the secrets of the sacred Dragon Scroll. The Dragon Warrior must protect the Valley from the powerful Tai Lung, who seeks the Dragon Scroll for himself. Oogway's student Master Shifu (Hoffman) had raised the young and gifted snow leopard Tai Lung (McShane) as his own to become the Dragon Warrior. However, Oogway sensed the darkness in Tai Lung, and dismissed him as Dragon Warrior. Oogway was forced to defeat the enraged Tai Lung, and banish him. Now Tai Lung returns.Shifu tells Oogway he is horribly mistaken in choosing Po. Oogway reminds his old friend, ""There are no accidents."" He also tells Shifu that the Dragon Warrior will bring peace to the Valley and ""bring peace to you"". Shifu's students The Furious FiveTigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane, and Viper, quickly dismiss Po. Admittedly, Po says ""I sucked more in the history of sucking"" In particular Tigress (insightful and arrogant Angelina Jolie) tells Po, ""You don't belong here."" Here Directors Osbourne and Stevenson deliver their message home. The pitfall of the greatly skilled is arrogance, and this is embodied by the Tigress and the Furious Five, and in fact Shifu. Surprisingly Shifu does not get it, until the end. Shifu can't rely on what he knows to make Po this great Dragon Warrior. A master can only show The Path or The Way, and it is up to the student to reclaim the greatness within. It is all about discipline, courage, and humility. ""Kung Fu Panda"" does all this in a very hilarious and visually spectacular package. I was laughing hysterically during the training session with Po and Shifu as they dueled with chopsticks over a delicious dumpling. The Furious Five trading blows with Tai Lung on the hanging mountain bridges was visually stunning.Jack Black really makes ""Kung Fu Panda"" work. As voiced by Black, Po realizes the ridiculousness of his situation, but ultimately realizes this is his last chance to own up to his own greatness. Black is both hysterical and profoundly genuine. Dustin Hoffman is amazing as Shifu. Ironically and humorously he is a martial arts master, albeit a rodent of some sort, in love with his own accomplishments, clueless to The Way. Fortunately, Po comes into his life. Randal Duk Kim is great as the true Master Oogway. Angelina Jolie is brash and spirited as the skilled Tigress.""Kung Fu Panda"" is one the best movies of the year. Besides being hysterical fun, it has great heart and a wonderful story.

I'm not an expert on martial arts so I don't know if what's being portrayed is 100% accurrate, but what I will say is that it looks real and it's amazing how they've animated it.

With a powerful enemy, Tai Lung the Snow Leopard, threatening the gates, everyone is relying on a martial arts hero known as ""The Dragon Warrior"" to rise up and save the day. When Po unwittingly shows up in the midst of the martial arts competition, the masters are shocked to see that this unmotivated panda bears the mark of the Chosen One. Tigress and Monkey from the Furious Five are my favorite characters. Did you know that the individual fighting styles of the Furious Five members (Crane, Mantis, Tiger, Monkey, and Viper) are actual martial arts styles modelled after those particular animals?I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the whole film and its lesson on believing in yourself and being your own hero-age-old lessons that I don't mind at all.

While its relatively simple tale of an underdog who has been laughed at throughout his entire life learning to fulfil his unexplored potential is nothing new, it remains effortlessly entertaining and the kind of film you can catch halfway through and still enjoy what it has to offer. Although the title promises plenty of fat jokes, and there are certainly plenty, the film goes beyond simply appealing to kids with sight gags by working in Chinese mysticism, some wonderful voice acting, and stunning animation that would only get better and more ambitious as the series went on.Clumsy panda Po (Jack Black) lives in the Valley of Peace, a scenic ancient land in China overlooked by the Jade Palace, home to the legendary kung fu masters. While he dreams of joining the Furious Five - a gang of ass-kicking kung fu specialists consisting of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) - Po spends his days making (and eating) noodles with his father Mr. Ping (James Hong). When he spectacularly enters the Palace during the choosing of the 'Dragon Warrior', Po finds himself picked out by the wise old Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) as the one to stop to the evil Tai Lung (Ian McShane), an escaped snow leopard seeking revenge on Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his Furious Five.Taking inspiration from the Chinese kung-fu movies of the 1970's as well as American geek culture, Kung Fu Panda works as both as a physical comedy and an action spectacular. Although the characters frequently defy the laws of physics and seem incapable of getting hurt, the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting, with McShane voicing his role with whisker-twirling relish. There are also hints at backstories and questions raised about Po's past (why on Earth is his father a goose?), and the film is wise enough to leave the answers to future instalments and trusting in its simple introductory tale of a misfit finally finding a home. While the majority of the Five don't really find a moment to shine individually, Hoffman lends a certain gravitas to his tragic backstory and relationship with the deadly Tai Lung. The pratfalls will entertain the kids and the gentler moments will no doubt charm the adults, something that Dreamworks generally fails to do with its animated efforts, so it's no doubt that the series remains the jewel in it's crown.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
On par with Pixar's best,"One of the best animated films I've seen in a long while. Dreamworks is finally showing it can overcome the mediocrity of movies like Shrek, Bee Movie, and Madagascar, and put out a film that is not only fun, but shows excellence in animation as well. The CG animation easily stands up next to Pixar's work, and even the 2-D animated opening was beautifully done. I would've loved to see them even do the whole film in that style.Plenty of laughs to be had for audiences of any age. A truly enjoyable movie and likely the best animated film we'll see this year.

A little but for everyone,"Kung Fu panda is fun for almost any age to watch. Even after rewatching this movie I feel it holds up today, though not everything is as funny as it was when I was kid. Something this movie does well is having a sort of symbolism that kids and adults can understand and at different levels. This symbolism or moral is something that isn't just people over analyzing the movie but something that is present throughout the entire movie. The voice acting in the movie elevates the humor to the max and Jack Black was casted perfectly for the main character.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Save The Pandas - But Not This One,"My wife and I watched the Blu-Ray DVD of Kung Fu Panda for 30 minutes but could not take any more of it. This is, without doubt, one of the absolute worst animated features we have ever seen. It's a real snoozer -- not the least bit funny or entertaining.So much top-notch talent was wasted on the weak storyline and pathetically bad dialog! It's hard to believe that this second-rate production came from Dreamworks Animation, the studio that created the fabulous Shrek. The animation is mediocre and seems amateurish in comparison to any Shrek feature or Pixar film of the past decade (Nemo, Cars, Wall-E, Ratatouille, Monsters Inc., Toy Story, etc.).Save your time and money - not this unfunny Panda. Take a nap instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
That was Delightful!,"Kung Fu Panda - Po the Panda (Jack Black) must somehow become a Kung Fu Master in order to save the Valley of Peace from a villainous snow leopard, Tai Lung. Set in the legendary world of ancient China, it features the voice talents of Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and Jackie Chan (kind of).At first glance the movie looked like a pass, mostly because of a crap title and Jack Black's less than good batting average lately. The kung fu genre has also kind of been mocked and done to death. This is the day of CGI and the superheroes.But this movie, on the whole, is delightful. It is funny and cool, and not in a topical way. It also stays away from the usual fart and pee jokes that movie execs push in when they can't admit they don't know what kids like these days. No. This movie is actually honest to goodness funny. It's also got some very good action sequences, and doesn't do the same tired montages we've seen before. Po learning shaolin in a couple days seems to go down a lot smoother than Daniel-san winning a karate contest after a week of manual labor, because of the excellent decision to do this in cartoon format, and because of Po himself.There hasn't been quite this good a protagonist in an animated film in awhile. Po is a goodnatured but cowardly and overweight nerd, just like most martial arts nerds. He's the sort of guy who worships the martial arts, like me and my friends used to (hell, still do), but never had the time or discipline to learn (1 year of Aikido and 3 months of Tae Kwon Do for me. Nothing stuck). Speaking of martial arts, the movie doesn't shy away from the action either. There's about as much awesomeness as a PG cartoon can get away with. The animators did an excellent job. Of course this movie treads on familiar ground (""believing in yourself"" etc etc). It's a labor of love towards the martial arts and an attempt to keep their spirit alive.Jack Black plays it just right without going overboard like he's prone to do, and the result is one of my favorite characters in their extensive movie list. Dustin Hoffman plays sound support as the Red Panda Master. Seh Rogen is hilarious and Ian McShane always plays a good villain as the Evil Leopard Tai Lung. It was a pleasant surprise to hear Michael Clarke Duncan and David Cross as well.I'll probably purchase the DVD for this one. A truly pleasant surprise from a movie I expected little from about a panda nobody expected anything from, Kung Fu Panda gets an A-.(now don't get greedy an make a sequel now. I had to endure trailers for Madagascar 2 and Pink Panther 2 to get to this)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not that awesome,"DreamWorks brings out yet another animated production but does it fill the shoes of the other films that they have recently made? Although this film is good the answer is sadly no. For starters an issue with this film is Jack Black. Granted he isn't that bad in this and it is his voice that is doing the work and not his acting, but his voice is so distinct that I couldn't help but imagine that it was actually him on the screen, especially when the part he is playing is an overweight, cartoon panda. Far to life like for me. Other voice members of this team remain hidden, Hoffman is brilliant as Master Shifu and his voice becomes lost in the character, also Ian McShane as Tai Lung the deadly snow leopard is deep and menacing. The same can't be said for all the other voice cast which includes such stars as Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, Lucy Lui and David Cross. All seem to get about ten lines each. Perhaps this isn't a problem with the voices but the character as they are so hard to connect with. Five animals, a tigress, crane, monkey, mantis and viper, all kicking ass but saying nothing, yep I can see why we can't connect with them. My favourite character I have to say was the Grand Master Oogway, an old tortoise that seemed to get everything right by accident and then state that nothing is an accident.The film is about the Panda, Po. He dreams of being a kung fu warrior and not running his Dad's noodle bar, his Dad who is somehow a stork?? On the day that Oogway has a premonition that the feared Tai Lung will escape from jail, Shifu states that they must chose a Dragon Warrior to fend him off. The nominated Furious Five stake their claim but it is the panda that is selected when he accidentally flies into the arena, trying to catch a glimpse of what is going on.Reluctantly Shifu begins to train him and we see that this panda is completely incompetent and the only thing he can do is eat. This however, as noticed by Shifu, is his strength. Relate aspects of kung fu to food and the panda will become awesome.Tai Lung breaks out of jail, which is a very good sequence of CGI animation, and hurtles across the land to gather a Dragon Scroll out the hands of the Masters. The Dragon Scroll is what the Dragon Warrior possesses and it is an accomplishment that Tai Lung continually misses out on. Tai Lung's tale is told through a back story and his connection brings emotion to the film. Tai Lung eventually arrives at the palace and after defeating the Furious Five and Shifu it is down to the Panda to save the day.As you can tell from the synopsis there are no real twists or turns and the film holds true to a very simple formula. This becomes a slight issue for me as it means children can connect with it more than adults, which certainly wasn't the case with Toy Story, Shrek, Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo and this is where this film lacks compared to those. There is nothing for an adult audience to really grip and enjoy. There is very little emotion in the film and the main humour is childish or slapstick.The animation is still good. The Panda and Master Shifu having good genuine expressions but the Furious Five are undeveloped in character and animation. They could have all just been made into one character that has been worked on. Their story is just poor and very uninteresting.That all being said it is a very easy watch film and I would happily sit down, chilling on a Sunday afternoon and watch it again. However using the term Jack Black must have written into the script as it is all he ever says in other films and over uses in this one, this film is certainly not awesome.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome movie full of bodacity,"This movie works well for kids, teens, and adults. My family went to this for Father's Day and two 40ish-year-olds, 19 year old, 18 year old, and 15 year old all thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing out loud numerous times throughout the movie.It was a mix of old kung fu movie nostalgia, The Matrix fight scene choreography, awesome animation, and the humor of Jack Black. A winning combination and I hope they do a sequel because I could have watched this all day.The movie has a great story that keeps you you in anticipation, is paced very well, and while you know how this movie will end it is still surprising and pays off in a big way.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Cute Little Story,"I had heard some good things about this movie but I kind of relegated it to ""just a little kids film"" for years in my mind. When I finally sat down and watched it....yeah, that's pretty much what it is. I'm not saying it's painful if you have to sit through it if you're an adult--it's absolutely not. But it's not quite on par with the Toy Story trilogy.There are 2 elements about the movie that really stick out as excellent. Firstly, a lot of the scenes are extremely beautiful to look at. The shots like where Po is talking to the turtle teacher by the peach tree and you get an overhead view of the valley of peace are just gorgeous. The second element that is really great are the action shots: they're fast, they're fun, they're varied. The fight sequences are a joy to watch.Other then those 2 elements, I don't know if anything really stuck out. The voice actors are all well-chosen and do good jobs and the jokes are pretty good but the story is pretty predictable. Like I said, it's pretty good but I wouldn't go as far as to say it's spectacular.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Put Jack Black's voice in a warm big fluffy Panda, and you just have to love him.","Even though he is as much a motor-mouth as so many other actors who become annoying with time, there is something incessantly likable about Jack Black. Put his voice in a warm big fluffy Panda, and you just have to love him. Put this Panda in a Kung Fu setting complete with training-school dojo, grand masters and a nemesis to fear, and you have the first Dreamworks Animation movie that can stand up among Pixar's annual excellence as one of the best 3D animation movies made.A Giant Panda is a 250-pound black-and-white bear that lives in the mountains of China, and although carnivorous, the panda has a diet which is 99% bamboo. That's how pacifist it is. But when Po (Jack Black) gets accidentally selected as the mighty Dragon Warrior by the Grand Master, there is no option left but for Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to train the clumsy Panda into a Warrior of the highest order  much to the resentment of the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Viper, Crane, Mantis). But Po, as much as he loves Kung Fu lore, would rather eat. Yes, that's how pacifist he is. But Master Shifu has not much choice as his ex-student, the evil Tai Lung, has escaped from his maximum security prison to claim the position of Dragon Warrior for himself.Some sequences in this movie are breathtaking, I exulted at the thought of animation finally telling us such diverse stories. Two sequences (and this is not a spoiler): Tai Lung's escape from prison and the foot-bridge fight are extraordinary in exigency. Dreamworks has been churning out animated movies for a few years now, but apart from Shrek, none of their movies have really hit any mark. But this is easily the best animated movie out of their bucket yet. The voice cast, although stellar, does not overshadow the characters with their star-power. The likes of Jackie Chan and Angelina Jolie get limited voice-time, but just as much as the movie requires. Jack Black & Dustin Hoffman are wonderful as loud obnoxious student & controlled cool master. And unlike Madagascar, the movie has very soft colors, curves and a glowing focus. It works very well with the cuddly look of the Panda.A special mention for Tai Lung. Not since Lion King's Scar has a villain taken himself so seriously. Tai Lung is a warrior extraordinaire, and he is beyond humor or humility. Just like Jeremy Irons' Scar, Ian McShane's Tai Lung speaks with a sense of superiority. It makes him that much more of a nemesis  a villain worthy of a much more formidable opponent than a pacifist panda. See, that's how impressive his sense of superiority is!

Kung Fu Panda,"So the rather clumsy and inept ""Po"" has dreams of saving the world! His real job is working in a noodle bar where one day, maybe, he will learn the secret ingredient that gives their dishes that special flavour. Meantime, the ageing ""Oogway"", the most learned of creatures, has informed his stalwart lieutenant ""Shifu"" that he will soon have to defend their ""Valley of Peace"" from the vengeful ""Tai Lung"" who, though currently incarcerated in a seemingly impregnable prison, is set to come and wreak some havoc. ""Po"" is determined to attend the selection ceremony and, well yes - you've guessed. He ends up selected by the old wise turtle, much to the chagrin and general disbelief of just about everyone else. Hopeless, hapless and helpless - but can ""Po"" prove his mettle and save the day? It's really quite good fun this. The characterisations are well developed and it has humour and style to it too. The animations are lively, vivid and the directors avoid the temptation to allow the combat and action scenes to descend into the all-too-often realms of repetitiveness. There is a moral - the values of teamwork and trust, honesty, integrity yada yada, but the story delivers them in a gentle and demonstrable manner via the plot and the characters rather than pontificating. All in all, this is great family fun that shows the (not so) little guy doing his best... Can he save the day?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
How do you like them pandas?,"Kung Fu Panda is formulaic and harmless fun. It doesn't lean too heavily on the morals, thankfully eschews the usual pop culture references and disposable pop songs that hopelessly date the movie only years afterward, and definitely doesn't take itself too seriously.But despite the fact that it is hardly vital cinema it is an OK film that manages to survive some deplorable Hollywood laziness and provide a non-Saw alternative to the 10-14s in the household. I would pigeonhole it as 'reasonably family friendly light entertainment' and nothing more.Well this reasonably family friendly light entertainment made over 600 million dollars! To paraphrase one Will Hunting ""How do you like them Pandas?"" The tale of this well meaning yet clumsy and decidedly non kung-fu expert's rise to the top is the stuff of every second kung fu film in the 70s to be honest. Take someone with no apparent traits of a champion, give them a trainer who seems to not believe in him/her, throw in some training montages that find our hero believing in themselves and cut to them holding the trophy/prize/severed head of their nemesis.In this case the unwitting hero is pudgy Panda – voiced by pudgy Jack Black – in fact if you aren't a Jack Black fan or simply can't stomach his shtick move on, because his dialogue is infused with so many JB mannerisms and speech patterns that your feelings toward the man may dictate your enjoyment level.I like him. In small doses.Panda is ordained as the Dragon Warrior in front of the resentful Furious 5 who have trained their entire lives for the very honour Panda accidentally falls into. The Furious 5 are a group of highly trained martial arts experts of various breeds; a tiger, a monkey, a crane, a praying mantis and a snake (the names of various fighting styles).They are voiced by an all star cast of unnecessary celebrity cameo cash-ins that smacks of free publicity, and I say that knowing full well Jackie Chan is among them. That said I will not bother acknowledging their lack of input to the film any further.The 5 are trained by Master Shi Fu (Dustin Hoffman), who I think is a possum or something?? Nonetheless he is a master teacher, and upon finding he must train Panda to become the Dragon Warrior and defend the entire village of random rabbits, ducks and pigs he is immediately aghast and feels dishonoured, though he is gradually talked around by his own master, an elderly turtle named Master Ugwei. The 5 are also resentful of this unskilled interloper and generally make no secret of this fact, especially the tigress who felt that it was she who would be named Dragon Warrior.The training sequences are a little flat to be honest, but contain enough moments of humour and pratfalls to keep the kids interested. I liked Panda's Dad – who is a duck – and his constant references to the 'noodle dream' amused me for no known reason. Most of all I liked a sequence in the middle of the film where the main nemesis for Panda is introduced, a fearsome creature named Tai-Lung. His escape from a mountain fortress is both incredibly animated and well choreographed. This is also perhaps the main impediment to the littlies liking the film, as Tai-Lung is so well rendered and so effective a foe, that I think it might put the fear of god into any kids under say 8 or 9, which is a bit of a shame, as three quarters of the film is perfect for all ages.Ultimately Kung Fu Panda wasn't nearly as 'awesome' as it was promoted, but it definitely wasn't bad either.Final Rating – 6 / 10. A solid animated film for kids aged (maybe) 9 and up, with enough jokes for the adults and kids alike, and some non-threatening action to inspire the kids to go home and kick p*ss out of their younger siblings.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Prepare for absolute awesomeness,"Finally, an animated-CGI film I absolutely adore! I love Jack Black as it was, but him as a panda is the icing on the cake.Black voices Po, a lovable yet lazy panda who is chosen as the legendary Dragon Warrior. The Dragon Warrior is the master of Kung Fu who will protect China from the deadly Tai Laung. Problem is, Po's trainer Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) believes it's a mistake and that one of the Furious Five should be chosen. All the voices and animals are remarkably charming minus Tigress (Jolie). With loads of action, comedy, bright colors and an amazing time, Po rises to complete awesomeness.You will laugh, maybe cry at Po and his comrades in this wonderfully paced adventure comedy from Dreamworks. Hopefully, it's great success won't lead to a sequel which would ruin its spunk. I personally think I laughed more than the little kids in the theater, it appeals to adults and kids, mostly adults I think.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Nothing new, but still fresh","Family movies over the past couple of years have digressed into mindless entertainment, save a few examples. The humor has been shallow, nearly non-existent. To me a family movie is something where the entire family enjoy it. The humor appeals to both children (potty humor, slap stick) to the older crowd (CLEVERLY disguised innuendo and classic media references). I would argue that Family movies are the most difficult genre to work in, because one must successfully strike that delicate balance while being neither preachy or boring.Kung Fu Panda is a worthy entry in to the pantheon of the classics. While I am not arrogant enough to place this one on the level of Disney from the golden age to the Pixar achievements, it makes its own unique contribution to a tired story that has been played out time and time again. The kind hearted, but initially inept subject overcoming their shortcomings is a movie staple. However, its treatment in this story is fresh. The voice actors play their bits wonderfully. While I was aware of a star studded cast going in, they allowed their characters to speak for them rather than vice versa.So, the contrived plot points are really what hold this movie back. But, the humor with how they are treated allow this to be looked over. Instead, look for the interesting way that clichés are handled. I enjoyed this film.

Just OK,"On the plus side, I admired the realistic computer-generated fur effects. This animating technology really is coming of age. On the minus side, I'm still wondering about the merits of a movie in which the over-weight 'hero' is motivated by offering him food. First, I have a concern about, well, not only Hollywood's but society in general's tendency to make fun of fat people. I guess the filmmakers could argue that the panda is just over-weight to him an unlikely hero.. and then of course if he were to become slimmer to be accepted that's not cool either. But couldn't the panda just be fat and that's that? Couldn't he have been motivated by something other than more food? The bottom line is, the story is kinda OK but nothing special.

"""Kung Fu Panda"" gives a fresh kick to an overused formula. Skidoosh.","""Kung Fu Panda"" is not your typical cgi product from the precisely calibrated Dreamworks animated animal film machine. While first glance at a trailer or poster will have you believing that the cgi family film powerhouse has simply extended its range to include the animals native to the far east, Dreamworks has just used those techniques to sell you a film that actually deviates from the formula with which we have become so accustomed. I wouldn't go as far as to call ""Panda"" innovative, but more so that it stays fresh amidst the over- processed films of its kind.""Panda"" stars Jack Black as Po, the overweight Panda who is the son of a noodle-making goose. While Po's father hopes to pass down the noodle-making business, of course Po dreams otherwise. He loves the world of ancient kung fu and his idols are the Furious Five, five kung fu-trained animals that serve to protect the village. When the kung fu palace's old master has a vision of bad things to come, a dragon warrior must be chosen to fight this evil and Po, trying to see who will be named, appears to accidentally get chosen.The first thing this movie does right is focus on Po. Po is lovable because he tries hard and dreams big despite his obvious flaws and his humor--via Jack Black--is the one part of the film that doesn't take itself seriously. As a result, Po is probably the easiest character to identify with in the entire cannon of Dreamworks animated films. While the voices of the Furious Five include Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu and more, and their master is played by Dustin Hoffman, these actors are purely supporting, proving they were brought in merely to sell the film. While some people might be disappointed, it's the right thing for this film. Po's journey is enough to focus on. While I expected Hoffman, for example, to really make the part his own, he stays very true to the written character. Any no-names could have played the 5 and considering the movie is still enjoyable despite it, that's a very good thing.Perhaps the most commendable aspect of ""Panda"" is its family- friendly comedy. There aren't more than 5 or so jokes that make you laugh really hard like the ""Shrek"" franchise does, but those movies were funny because they slipped in jokes for a PG-13 or higher audience. This film appeals to kids, teens, adults and the like without doing that stuff, by relying on already-present humor and not looking toward outside sources/pop culture references. In 30 years, it is possible this movie will be looked at by young audiences as funnier than ""Shrek"" for this reason and it should. There are also some spectacular action sequences, namely when the villain Tai Lung escapes. The smartly conceived fighting choreography is probably the most underrated aspect of the film.""Panda"" may never be more than cute, clever and fun, but a G film should be without trying to sneak in inappropriate jokes. This is truly a film reminiscent of Disney's wholesome animated days when it was about just writing stories people had to like. The overdone values of believing in yourself and making something out of who you are don't feel overdone in this film--they feel right. Next to the unrivaling unique ""Ratatouille,"" ""Panda"" is right there when it comes to family-friendly wide-appeal films.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Everybody is kung fu fighting!""","Prior to its release date this delightfully pleasurable action comedy-adventure from DreamWorks Animation seemed as though it would join the likes of 'Surf's Up' (2007) and 'Chicken Little' (2005) as one of the most average pieces of animated rubbish ever to be shown on the silver screen. And it is for the first ten minutes in which we are first introduced to our hero  the Po (voiced by a hilarious, show-stealing Jack Black.) Po is an under-achieving fat, ravenous, panda born the son of a slightly mad noodle seller (voiced by James Hong) who dreams of being a famous kung fu master. His heroes have always been the amazing furious five  Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie,) Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan,) Mantis (voiced by Seth Rogen,) Viper (voiced by Lucy Liu) and Crane (voiced by David Cross) trained by the greatest kung fu teacher in all China, Master Shifu (voiced by the magical Dustin Hoffman.) When it is prophesied by the powerful all-knowing Master Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim) that the dark and menacing Tai Lun (voiced by Ian McShane)  a former pupil of Shifu's turned evil when he was denied ownership of the powerful dragon scroll will escape from heavy imprisonment and make the entire Valley of Piece fell his deadly wrath, the great turtle announces that the Dragon Warrior must be proclaimed as he is China's only hope. That noble position is of course seeming accidentally given to none other than Po, who must somehow be trained to fight and defeat the monstrous villain.There the film throws off its predictability and becomes a fun-filled action-packed thrill-ride, leaving us all in a daze at how unbelievably wrong we all were to think that it was just another washout. For DreamWorks, this is a fine achievement and an excellent recovery from 'Shrek the Third' (2007.) What's more, this film  unlike most comedies  doesn't rely on the jokes to give it life. The gags of Kung Fu Panda work as more of a little extra spice to top it all off. What really makes it enjoyable is the engaging story.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Quite good, up there with the first Shrek","Warning: I believe the movie is a bit scary for the very young, I think this movie should be rated PG or even PG 13. Shrek is a wonderful movie because it upends a lot of conventions, in fairy tales and in animated movies. The next few Shreks become weaker echoes of the first by doing the same movie over and over, and by existing to parody other movies without bothering to put in a meaty story to string the jokes. Kung Fu Panda is another movie that upends a lot of recent animated movie conventions that have become cliché. Firstly, it isn't anymore a joke a minute. Some care was used in telling the story. In a way, it breaks current convention by becoming a more old-fashioned movie, by taking its time with the story. And yet, there are many touches that are clear tributes to previous great Kung Fu movies, especially Jacky Chan movies. The movie is going to be rewarding even to adults, so they aren't going to mind bringing their kids to this movie. It helps that Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman strike such witty rapport with each other. If anything becomes pretty conventional or dull, I can depend on either actor to give it a nice reading. Not necessarily a funny reading, but at least a reading that's consistent with the character. Definitely worth getting on Blu-ray!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Watching this now, all I can think about is how much Po reminds me of Kamala Khan. His levels of fan-girling over the Furious Five match her's for Captain Marvel.I know it's an animation, but it's more cartoonish than I remember. It's also funny, as funny as I remember. Themes like Po's relationship with his father and his desire to forge his path are relatable, or at the least understandable, like his dad envisioning a different life for Po.The ""one thousand guards, one prisoner"" line is a massive flex for the prisoner. Tai Lung as a villain is a striking contrast to the movie's bubbly, lovely nature and Po himself. The characters in general are simply good. I can't believe Master Oogway just disappeared like that abruptly. I thought he definitely lasted longer than one movie. I don't know if it was meant to be funny, but I found the scene where master Shifu and Po fighting over a dumpling really hilarious. Also why did they leave mantis to support the bridge out of everyone? Made me laugh.It's a pretty fun movie, one of the more memorable ones from my childhood. Its animated charm and timeless appeal make it a film even the kids of those who watched it as kids can still enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best animated movie of the year so far,"Kung Fu Panda was a very fun movie to watch from start to finish. The whole cast makes it a very fun movie. Between Jack Black, Seth Rogan, Angelina Joline, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, and Luicy Liu playing the voices of the characters it was fun. They had many funny moments that they shared. I think that kids would especially love this movie. Even older kids and teenagers can enjoy this movie. I sure do know adults that take their kids to see it will have a fun time. Its fun to relive your history and go back to movies like these. Jack Black was perfect and was a riot in this. The facial expressions he makes pretty much will make you laugh out loud. When I had first seen the trailer to this movie it didn't seem to catch my eye but after the good reviews I went to see it and it was really good. Their was a ton of action for younger kids. It wasn't to long so you don't have to sit through a long movie. Overall this was a very fun family comedy. GO see it if you like animated action movies. This is a real gift to see. This is coming from someone who doesn't care for animated movies. So for me to like this one it means it has to be good. They also made the panda and other characters look very good. Overall a great animated CGI film. GO see it you wont be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why Kung Fo Panda is the greatest animated movie ever!,"Kung Fu Panda is a 2008 animated movie produced by DreamWorks Animation and directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson. The movie tells the story of Po, a clumsy and overweight panda who dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master.

Firstly, the movie's animation is visually stunning. The colors, textures, and design of the characters and settings are richly detailed and expertly crafted.

It also promotes the values of teamwork, loyalty, and courage, and teaches viewers the importance of perseverance and hard work. These themes are presented in a way that is both accessible and inspiring, making Kung Fu Panda a movie that is enjoyable for viewers of all ages.

The performances are perfectly balanced, with each character having their own unique personality and quirks that make them memorable and endearing.In addition to its animation, story, and voice acting, Kung Fu Panda is also notable for its music.

Pleasantly surprised and enjoyable.,"This was a delightful film. The deep rich color, the contrast, most of the caricature development and voices seem to come together to make a wonderful experience. The story follows the dream of a fat panda and his desire to be trained in the ways of Kung Fu. Laced with a serious overtone, the comedy is on a more mature level, but a level that even a young child can follow and enjoy. Paced well, the movie starts off as well as it ends. A bit predictable once you know all the components in the character constellation, even the anticipation lends its self to the experience.I have to admit, the most enjoyable and laughable scene to this movie revolves around Po (The panda, voiced by a Jack Black) and what is discovered to motivate him to learn the teachings of his master Shifu (Voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Shifu has been left with the task to train Po to become the ultimate warrior, much to the chagrin of his other disciples: A tigress, a snake, a praying mantis, a monkey and a crane, who have studied for years to become the level of Dragon master. Unfortunately, there is also another beast, a previous student of Shifu, that also believes that level belongs to him. In the end, dark forces against that of light must meet.One thing I always find disconcerting is that why, out of all the people in the world, do movies like this need to generate any interest from already famous actors? There is so much talent out there, I would think leaving live acting to live actors. Or how about a radio announcer? Or a person that does audio books? I have a hard time believing that this movie couldn't have used an unknown to be a primary voice and still kill at the box office. Just my opinion.The theater was sparsely populated. I think my wife and I were the only ones there that didn't have young children. The lack of an audience allows for a more pungent viewing, one that isn't caught up in a wave of laughter that usually infects a viewer at a well attended presentation. One very young child tried very hard to understand what was going on through most of the film in a rather loud voice, but this was acceptable. I don't think a child of 3 can truly enjoy this, even as a cartoon. So, as a summer surprise, seeing this was not on my list of movies to see, I was pleasantly surprised.

"haiya, Cool!","(Karthik Narayan) Po seems a funny name for a Panda living in China, let alone consider Kung Fu as a passion. Well, Po is a dreamy young Panda whose ambitions are to become a Kung Fu expert, maybe even a master! Being a big fat Panda and the son of a Duck running a Noodle Soup restaurant in China, Kung Fu is certainly out of question.Po goes to watch the selection of the Dragon Warrior by the Kung Fu greats and finds himself in the irony of things.What follows next is a series of comic events, great action from the studios of Dreamworks SKG and the final showdown between a legendary Kung Fu warrior and an ordinary Panda.The comic attack is pleasant and not in your face, though one feels the cute panda getting hurt too often gets a little too slapstick  but then this movie is about facing life as it is vs as you like it; so the hit will be brutal, no doubt.Two messages that are left in your mind as you finish watching this movie: Never give up. There is no secret ingredient to true happiness.Overall, you will find that there is no secret ingredient to this movie, just don't give up watching this one  a must watch.The perfect movie to watch when you really want to relax and get away from the traffic, noise and hectic work.On the personal front, this movie reminded me of those underdogs in the quizzing circuits, who aren't the best at what they do, and can only look awestruck, jaws open at the Greats of Quizzing.Then one fine day, one of these underdogs rise up to become a world beater. Lessons for all those eager beavers not to give up and to chase dreams.There aren't any Kung Fu movies around these days, this is your best bet to revive that Golden Age...Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

All the makings of an excellent story,"Kung Fu Panda is the kind of movie I've been waiting for all year. It is sad to see that a children's movie is what finally rekindled my interest in venturing to the theaters over the course of the past year. However, Kung Fu Panda is difficult to place in the ""children's"" category.We'll get right to the meat of the movie--the action. I haven't seen such brilliant action sequences in quite some time, whether from an animated or live-action film. These were exceptionally choreographed, and the best part is that they didn't quite take themselves seriously in executing these performances. It's always difficult for me to enjoy a fight scene in a movie where people are flying and doing absolutely outrageous things unless it is an obvious attempt at humor. Kung Fu Panda achieves this goal with stunning aptitude.Not to mention that the humor is top-notch, whether you are six or 26. I had trouble catching all the jokes, considering most of them were laugh-out-loud funny, forcing me to lose concentration on the next perfectly set up situation.One of the prime aspects of this movie, to me, is the casting. Many well-known actors and actresses came together to put together this finely crafted film, and they really pulled off a performance worthy a golden statue displaying their ultimate worthiness. I can always appreciate an actor/actress typically involved in raunchy comedies (ahem... Seth Rogen) who can flip a 180 and manage to keep it clean for a full two hours. Bravo, you sickos, you gained a few more points in my book of notorious filthy acting! And finally, my favorite part of the entire movie is that the director managed to find THE BEST film composer of our time and put him to work! Hans Zimmer is as brilliant as ever, pulling out all the stops with his amazing themes and intense action sequence crescendos. And he perfectly avoids overusing the cliché Oriental touch, only using it in key moments. I can't get enough of his music. There should seriously be a library full of his music. I'd own it and maintain it FOR FREE, and I'm not even joking. Seriously, I have a shrine dedicated to this man in my backyard which plays music from Gladiator 24/7.You definitely should see Kung Fu Panda. And don't hesitate to take the kiddos.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda is fun family entertainment!!!,This is Dreamworks best movie to date. Dreamworks still can't measure up to quality of Pixar. As always i always dread seeing 3D animated movies.

animated tale of a panda who dreams of Becoming a Kung Fu master,"I could only watch half of this movie, then I had to call it quits for me and my daughter. Imagine teaching children to prejudge and ridicule people based on looks. The panda looks like the panda is SUPPOSED to look, and he stands there and accepts the poking and prodding and ridicule that is heaped upon him and it made me sad to watch. If the Panda were female or if he were a caricature of a visible minority, jokes of the same ilk would be inexcusable, so how is this funny? I'm sick to death of this trite perpetuation of a stereotype that, at best, teaches children forget that there is a broad range of what is beautiful, or, indeed, what is healthy.'There is evidence that fat people who achieve cardiovascular fitness through exercise have better health outcomes than lean people who don't.' Many people are overweight. Many people think that being fit means being lean. We have to stand this idea on its head and film and TV would be a powerful way to get these ideas across to the burgeoning generation, instead, we perpetuate cruelty and a culture where eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, ranging between 5-15% for patients with anorexia and 1-2% for those with bulimia; where people with these eating disorders have the potential for imminent and serious self-harm (those with anorexia are 57 times more likely to commit suicide than the expected rate for women in the same age/racial groupings).

Unexpectedly Good!,"Lets give a small background of me as a commenter. I'm 19, movie lover, and haven't recently liked any 3D movies unless made by Pixar. I saw this with my mom, who badly wanted to see it (she's a 5 year at heart). I REALLY REALLY REALLY didn't want to see this at all. I was never planning on seeing it after all the recent failure 3D movies I had seen by Dreamworks or Disney (non-Pixar). I loved Shrek though and everything by dreamworks after that excluding Shrek 2 was a waste. It wasn't until reading all the wonderful comments by others who've seen this movie, I was turned around and decided to see it.It was good, very good, good enough that I rated it high.The story was so well done. It's full of heart and of course set for the family. I enjoyed the atmosphere that they made for the movie. It was so ancient china and enjoyable. Each and every character had their own personality and Po was no exception.Sorry parents and teenagers, there's no jokes directed to make us laugh. Their are cute moments that make you laugh but as stated for the kids. The thing that made me continue to watch was the AMAZING action sequences that just lets you sit back and stare in awe. Of course it's 3D but it was so real feeling.I recommend seeing this. It's cute, the story is entertaining, and you cheer for Po the whole time in his journey to become a Dragon Warrior.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"He's more than a talking cute panda, seriously","Outside the ""Shrek"" franchise, Dreamworks Animation didn't really have much in the way of memorable animated films (even ""Shrek the Third"" fell into the traps of mediocrity). And while its latest product ""Kung Fu Panda"" doesn't introduce a groundbreaking chapter in the history of animation, this animated film directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson provides a solid entertaining hour and a half.Set in a fictional ancient China populated by animals, there's Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black), a die-hard kung fu aficionado who works in his father's (whose being a goose is never really explained) noodle shop. He dreams of one day seeing the temple head monk Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) crown one of kung fu master Shifu's (Dustin Hoffman) apprentices - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Snake (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), and Mantis (Seth Rogen) - as the Dragon Warrior to stop prison escapee Tia Lung (Ian McShane) in his quest to lay waste their land in quest for greatness. A series of events lead to Po being chosen as the Dragon Warrior, much to the chagrin of the apprentices and the frustration of Shifu, who's now tasked to train Po to fight Tia Lung, which seems an impossible task considering the Panda can't even bend to see his toes.Where the story's headed is pretty much obvious with all the trappings of kung fu and sports movies. But its message doesn't come across as mawkishly sentimental and its humorous and light tone keep the proceedings fluid and at ease. The animation is competent and nicely rendered. Also, at 90 minutes, it also doesn't overstay its welcome.The voice cast is commendable, particularly with Black and Hoffman. Black perfectly provides a comedic geeky quality to kung fu-obsessed Po while Hoffman lends an authoritative facet to Shifu. Chan, Jolie, and Rogen don't have much speaking parts and are only there perhaps for the star value, since anyone else could have performed their parts.I would have to admit that I didn't expect much of ""Kung Fu Panda"" since haven't we all had enough of animated talking animals. And maybe that worked for it since the film delivers the laughs and the cuteness in a much needed respite from a grueling work week.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An effective animation with indirect hints to something of value,"You gotta love animation. It's a natural breeding ground for fun, boundless creativity and innovation, without taking itself too seriously. When done competently, it gives us glimpses of multiple structural narrative elements at the same time (layers of realities, references, allegories etc.). These elements are not meant to be completely developed. Instead, they are supposed to reveal something important about the genre and its target audience.This starts with a 2 dimensional ""incomplete"" framing story that puts ""everything"" into perspective. However, it's not until an hour into the main story that we are allowed to compare it to the repressed memory of the bear as we observe the process of assembling the puzzle/achieving ""inner piece"". Indirectly, this hints how deeply intimate shared narration and creation of complex mental constructs can be. This aside, as always, there are several nice visual and verbal references(e.g. games, movies, people) that help us bridge the gap between the outer reality and the inner ones. See this, it's good.I did not particularly like the poke at China but I do not see it going away anytime soon. The mentality has been there for decades. After a while, it gets amusing.4/5 - Worth a watch",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Same old movie, temptations, struggles, success.","As a teenager, I had a choice to choose which movie to watch with my girlfriend the next morning. So I diligently went online to see the IMDb rankings for the two movies. Firstly Don't Mess With The Zohan and secondly Kung Fu Panda. Based on the ratings and reviews I chose to see kung Fun Panda, it seemed the better choice.... It seemed the keyword.So when I eventually went to see it, you could say I was a little let down. Actually you could say an enormous amount. To make matters worse, I was surrounded by children, normally tolerant of them, today I was not. They laughed at inappropriate jokes, scenes which were clearly not even funny. I contemplated ""when will this end?"" ""It must be shortly"" This movie is clearly not as comical as Shrek or Ice Age, it did not have witty, enchanting characters. Since when does a goose or duck give birth to a panda? There should be more factual, intellectual movies for children to see in the holidays! The only good thing was the imagery and advancement in realistic cartoons.

Kung Fu Panda-Great Animated Movie,"I highly recommend the film Kung Fu Panda. I have to admit that I assumed that this movie was advertised to kids between the ages of five and ten because of the animation. I only watched this film because it was a class assignment but I actually enjoyed it. The film is short and made for all ages. In the film, Kung Fu Panda, Po, the main character, is an overweight panda that secretly dreams of one day being very good at kung fu. In actuality, he is the son of a goose, Mr. Ping (voiced by James Hong), a noodle restaurant owner. Po literally drops in on a ceremony where the elderly Master Oogway, a tortoise (voiced by Randall Duck Kim) is selecting the next Dragon Warrior who will defeat the escaped villain, Tai Ling, (voiced by Ian McShane). Po is ""accidentally"" selected to be this savior even though he was not an invited party to this ceremony. During these beginning scenes, if you do not pay close attention you will surely fail to notice Po as he lands smack dab in the middle of the ceremony. I really enjoyed this movie laughing at all of Po's antics as he makes his way to the Grand Warrior ceremony.The theme of this movie was to follow your dreams, believing in yourself no matter what others may feel about you. Po had to learn to be what he dreamed he was destined to be, even though his father Mr. Ping wanted him to be something else. He had to ignore being taunted about his weight by the Furious Five in order to realize that he was the ""chosen"" one. Kung Fu Panda's theme was very similar to Happy Feet. In Happy Feet, Mumble had to learn to be comfortable with his talent, tap dancing, not being overly concerned with what others thought of him and for being blamed for the fish shortage. In Kung Fu Panda, Po had to find his inner strength and look beyond being ridiculed and overweight in order to be the next Grand Warrior. Mumble was told that penguins do not tap dance and Po was told that overweight pandas are not going to be martial artists. Po and Mumble were both unique and treated as outcasts but in the end became heroes.Kung Fu Panda had ample sound effects that were present that made a movie watcher feel as if he/she were there. The graphics were suitable and so were the lighting, angles, and music. The scene where the messenger is going through the mountains during the winter with the wind and snow howling, displayed how those background sounds help to make this scene realistic for a film watcher. The camera is tilting as the messenger takes a journey down to verify that Tai Lung is still locked up. This technique allows the camera to focus on the messenger tilt upward to follow his path in one continuous shot. Even though the camera is in a fixed location, it is flexible enough to follow the movement of the messenger and the guard. The prison breaking scene is excellent for an animated movie. It demonstrated Tai Lung's escape through sound and lighting to emphasize him breaking free. The arrows were whirling pass his head, missing each time. His deep guttural groan as he broke free of the chains was a great way to use sound.Even though this movie was PG rated and geared towards kids, its universal theme or message in Kung Fu Panda, was to be confident in yourself, even if you are not the best looking, richest, or educated person. If you have this confidence then no matter what others might have to say about you, it only matters what you think about yourself. Po and Mumble both did this and forged lasting friendships through respect and admiration. I again highly recommend Kung Fu Panda to people of all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Who doesn't love Kung Fu?,"Please do not critique my review based on the score which I have awarded this movie. This is a very fun-loving, action-packed yet very funny and lovable movie.Po, as the overgrown lump for a panda, is very likable because of the voice casting of Jack Blak, who doesn't overdo it and make him sound ridiculous. But the character whom I liked the most was the old trainer of his who has the right voice as the kung fu master. The tortoise too is very witty and its funny to see such a slow creature being the greatest fighter.The dialogs are meant for children as well as the adults who would enjoy the touch of adult humor that has been added here and there. Some of the situations are very funny, for example the thought of having a bird as the Panda's father, Po's efforts to watch the fair etc.But the thin storyline affects the movie. Its a typical action flick that doesn't probably have much intentions of winning accolades and awards. Plus, it also lacks the charm that Disney movies offer.I'm going to go with a 6 for this movie.

DreamWorks gets it right. Finally,"I have been avoiding the Kung Fu Panda juggernaut for the past four years. The Shrek sequels actually killed my enthusiasm for any animation made by DreamWorks (How to Train Your Dragon being the exception which proves the rule). A sequel has meanwhile come and become a blockbuster, there are various episodes released periodically by DreamWorks and most of my friends have become tired of recommending this. I finally succumbed because I wanted to watch something light and short in length. Po is a Panda in China who dreams of learning Kung Fu. His father wants him to run their family's noodle business which is the farthest thing from his mind. There is a mountain atop which there is a monastery. Here, Master Oogway, a turtle who is a Kung Fu master lives along with his disciple Shifu and five other animals Tigress, Mantis, Viper, Crane and Monkey. Oogway foresees an old student of Shifu, Leng, escaping from prison and coming back to claim the dragon scroll which is supposed to hold the secrets of being the ultimate fighter. He decides to find the next Dragon Warrior to take on Leng. The animals at the monastery are training hard as they are vying among themselves to be the next Dragon Warrior. By a strange quirk of fate, Po ends up selected as the Dragon warrior. The movie follows the adventures of Po as he is trained in the various martial arts and becomes ready for the ultimate showdown with Leng. The character of Po is very cute and his antics are endearing. I could relate to him totally as I am a big foodie myself. He is voiced brilliantly by Jack Black. Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman, is a complex character burdened by his past and he stays with you after the movie has ended. There are great Zen sayings uttered by both Oogway and Shifu and I loved the way an animation movie was used to portray serious thought. My only grouse was that the climax fight between Leng and Po was a bit short. However, overall this was a very satisfying watch. 3.5 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Some positive sides,"As you've probably expected, Jack Black is in this as he is in most else you'll see him in... if you find him irritating elsewhere(as I do), this won't be an exception. And it won't surprise you to find that this has about as much slapstick as can be fit into a 90 minute running time. However, beyond the typically silly and childish humor, this does genuinely have things to offer, for those not sold on what I've just described. The drama is actually pretty good, and rings true. This also lets its villain be more than the usual two-dimensional, diabolical maniac that far too many stories settle for. The action is awesome, and there's a ton of it. Animation is excellent, and the design is great. Use of color and lighting is effective. The cast is marvelous, though it seems a tad wasted, with the kind of talent they got, it seems like they were given kind of few lines. Cross is a little hit and miss, and I think it's mainly the fault of the material. There is no strong language, and the violence is mild, though parts of this are intense. The DVD comes with an informational director's commentary, two featurettes, a Dreamworks Video Jukebox, trailers, a game you play by the remote, and a PSA kind of thing for the conservation of wild Pandas.

I also enjoyed a lot of the message in this movie although it seemed like something you would find in a fortune cookie. There was almost no dull moment, the action sequences were a lot better than a lot of CGI movies that should have been more about the action. The visual were great and the story is very engaging and moving although it's a very simple and straightforward story that isn't all that original. But it still carries the movie very well to the point it's more than passable. A lot of the characters also stands out and they all have their redeeming qualities. Without giving away the whole story, this movie was more than what I expected, way more. Watch it with the whole family, I am sure everyone will have a entertaining and enjoyable time with this movie.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good animation,"Good animation movie. It was even better than ""Shrek"" and ""Over the Hedge"" (Both very good films) The animation was quite well made: Not only the characters look more ""Alive"" than in many other CGI productions, but also the atmosphere looks stylish and more than adequate for the tone of the film. The characters were very likable and the action scenes were not only very funny to watch, but also were much better directed than other boring live action films like ""300"" or ""Pathfinder"". Jack Black was great in his role as the main character, and the cast did a great job as well. I highly recommend this film to anyone! It has fun, action and adorable.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu  Panda,"Aim High, Fly high The movie 'Kung Fu Panda' is a great movie. It was one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen. It is an animation about Kung Fu, but made by America. I am just curious about why Americans are interested in Kung Fu so much. Instead of Taekwondo which is Korea's. But this movie is the one of my favorite movies. I can't take my eyes off it from the beginning until the end because it is very unique, cute, interesting and creative movie.Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po. Po is a sweet, kind, but clumsy and fat Panda who has great dreams that save the world. Po has no experience of Kung Fu, but he wants be a warrior who fight with furious five warriors. He is a son of a cook. So his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodle shop. One day, he heard some good news about selecting the Dragon Warrior from the Jade Temple. So everyone wants to go to the celebration to see the competition is between Tigress, Viper, Crane, Monkey and Mantis. They are well-known warriors and they are popular.Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master. The special teaching for Po with delicious food is very impressive. At last Po is trained well because he want to eat some delicious food. So he can practice Kung Fu over and over. I think Shifu is a great teacher, because he teaches learner's centered education.This is a cute animated comedy that also inspires lessons in life. The audience can relate to people who have dreams of doing the impossible, just as Po. Po is not handsome, not smart, he is fat. Frankly speaking, he looks like a loser. But his dream is amazing and his passion is great. So his dream comes true. He becomes a hero. Po learns that if he believes in himself, he can do anything. This film is for the whole family, because adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. So let's aim high, fly high like Po. Even Po can make his great dreams comes true.I Love it! The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. Especially Tigress's voice is attractive. It's Angelina Jolie's voice.The movie made us happy and laugh a lot. It was perfect because it has comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation film.I let my students see it at school and they enjoyed it, too! We were totally laughing, smiling from beginning to finish. and I downloaded the script of it, and make some blanks for my students. They could fill the blanks with joy. It was a good activity.I want to recommend this movie strongly to everybody.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu means a lot more than fighting,"TBH one of the best works of DreamWorks... Not only the ways of kung fu and fighting, Kung Fu Panda shows the ways of life in a absolute glorious manner. The usage of comedy in most part of the film yet keeping the main motive of the movie open to its audience proves it brilliant cinematography and script writing. Without throwing out any spoiler I would just say that this movie is One of the Best animated movie not only in the past few months but my entire life.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great characters, great plot, great fun!","""Kung Fu Panda"" delivers what the title promises: Kung Fu action, and a Panda. Po is a big panda who longs to be part of the Furious Five and take part in Kung Fu. He eventually is given the chance to try and accomplish his dreams. The character development in this animation is greatly explored. Po's character development is great and enjoyable, the characters of the Furious Five are given the spotlight for some time. The plot is great and Po is challenged and put up to the test to see if he truly is a Kung Fu Panda warrior. A lot of fun, enjoyment out of the cool action and adventure. DreamWorks has found a premise for some great sequels and more action to come to the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fun for the whole family,"DreamWorks can finally be proud of a truly great film. While classic Kung Fu movies are poked fun at, Kung Fu Panda does an excellent job of treating the genre with great respect in a movie geared for kids. And while it is kid friendly, it is not dumbed down to the point where it's childish.This movie has some of the greatest 3D animated fight scenes. What elevates them from good to great is what expected the unbelievable, gravity-defying stunts that are required of a good Kung Fu movie, there is an amazing amount of realism to the physics in this movie.

We periodically review this cartoon with the whole family and every time we have a warm residue in our souls of kindness and love.

from Hollywood's product line,"This may not be the worst movie I've ever seen. I am surprised to see those ""good"" ratings and comments. What is good about this movie? actions? music? cliché words? special effects? the crane's meticulous feather? You can find them in any other animations. Probably this one could have been called good if it had been made thirty years ago. This is simply one of those products from Hollywood's product line. The director tried to make it special by putting a panda as the hero. Yet that makes no difference. The panda and his father and his teacher and his colleague and his neighbors, they are just as same as those character you can find in every other dreamwork's stuff. Sorry. The first one they made was glorious, the second one was a movie, the third one was just a piece of junk. This would be a sign of the end of road if their films went on like this.

The Wondrous Marriage Between East And West,"Kung Fu Panda tells the story of a martial art loving panda by the name of Po who lives in the Valley of Peace, protected by his idols, the Furious Five, and their master, the legendary Master Shifu. When Shifu's malevolent ex-student Tai Lung breaks out of prison and threatens to create more havoc in the valley than he did once before, Po is chosen, seemingly by accident, to become the Dragon Warrior; the prophesied hero who is the only one that can stop Tai Lung. Shifu is reluctant to train him, seeing his lack of attributes required of a kung fu master. However, he is eventually convinced to believe in the panda, and discovers a method to train him into a true warrior.A product of Dreamworks, which has always been regarded as the poor man's version of Pixar, KFP shows the filmmakers venturing into previously uncharted territory for CG films; kung fu. And they have brilliantly incorporated a wealth of elements into the film; from most notably Shaw Bros movies to even Taoist philosophies and Confucian values, combining them with Tex Avery style cartoon action and humor. Even the action scenes were surprisingly taken seriously, and the directors managed to emulate real kung fu moves for the characters in the fight scenes. From start till end, the dumpling sparring sequence between Po and Shifu is a prominent example of all that combined, and remains one of the best animated scenes I have ever seen. Being Chinese I can only feel proud to see the animators putting so much effort and attention to my culture, and exposing them to the world in a major motion picture.The voice work is outstanding, most notably Jack Black's, optimizing his comic talent as the title hero. Black could effortlessly transit his voice from blind optimism to insecurity, all part of the incredible spectrum of emotions he displays for Po. Dustin Hoffman is faultless as the authoritative Master Shifu, and it just puts a smile on your face to hear the voice of the master himself, Jackie Chan, as Monkey.Kung Fu Panda triumphs as an action spectacle and a family comedy, and is a sincere tribute to the culture of the other side of the world. It takes a lot of heart, devotion, meticulous attention to detail and a collective amount of talent to achieve this. It is quite hard to imagine the kind of effort it took to bring all these together, because they certainly did not come together by chance.Like the wise Oogway would say, ""There are no accidents.""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really solid animation!!!!,"You really expect this movie to be a really stupid movie because of the title. But it's so far from that. This is one of Dreamworks' best movies besides HTTYD and Shrek. The animation is great. It's very funny. The fight scenes are really good. The musical score is amazing. The cast were perfect especially Jack Black as Po. And the story is really good too; Po trying to be like the Furious Five. I know it's kinda cliche but it feels fresh. And the villain Tai Lung is really good too.

"Kung Fu Panda is a great animated film, but not just animated either","I have to say before watching this movie and hearing the title I thought to myself that it has to be the dumbest name for a film ever. The film looked like it was going to suck judging from the trailers.But as it turned out after watching this I found myself engaged and interested in what was going on. This movie is a perfect example of never judge a book by it's cover. The story of the film was very simple yet it was funny, cute, charming, likable and it can be pretty serious at times.The Animation was very impressive and colorful, the facial expressions on the animals looked great and there movements on them were great to. The soundtrack was very good and the action scenes were very entertaining. The acting was good and the characters were all fun to watch. If i had to point any flaws to the film would be two things, the furious five while pretty cool didn't have many lines and it would've been nice to have more development from them. The bad guy Tai lung wasn't a terrible bad guy since he was a cool fighter and he had a good voice that fits him well, but he was underdeveloped and could've been better.Overall Kung Fu panda is a great film that teaches people that they can do anything in life if they put there minds to it no matter what flaws they have.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not as funny as a movie titled ""Kung Fu Panda"" should have been.","First, let me say my niece enjoyed the movie quite a bit...this was her first movie so it was a new experience for her. If I was rating the movie on her thoughts on it I would have rated it higher. However, I paid money to see this one too, and I have to say I just thought it would be funnier. Jack Black is great as the voice of the Panda as was all the cast, though I thought the five warriors were rather ignored for the most part with the Tigress one sort of stepping up a bit. The movie was just to talky for me with way to many serious moments. I will draw a parallel if I may. The first hour of Shrek had me laughing a bit and was rather good. The last half hour I did not laugh much at all and I thought it dragged down the rest of the film. This whole movie seemed more like the last half hour of Shrek rather than the first hour. It had a few cute parts here and there, but for me it just did not deliver the goods, the preview for Madagascar 2 looked better than this one. The story has a Panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu hero ending up being the chosen dragon warrior to the dismay of a master of kung fu and his students. A villain escapes and is on his way to challenge the dragon warrior and nothing to surprising happens along the way. A few chuckles to be sure in the ending fight, and scattered throughout the movie, just not enough for my tastes. However, my niece loved it so it is a good movie for kids anyway.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
An excellent standard for DreamWorks movies,"To me, this film represents the high-level quality that DreamWorks animations can create, especially when it comes to creating trilogies. This and the How To Train Your Dragon series are some of the best family animation films out there, than can be enjoyed by everyone, and actually managing to have a captivating storyline while still appealing to a younger audience.The animation holds up now, and likely always will, because even with CGI constantly improving and upscaling, this movie is incredibly detailed in its models, and managed to create realistic fight scenes, which is extra impressive since all of the characters are cartoon animals, so you wouldn't expect the fight scenes to look smooth and accurate. However, each of the animals are based on an actual fighting style in real life, which the film makers went to great lengths to accurately replicate. The fight scenes are what hold this film together, this is definitely some of the best action I have seen in a film that can appeal to all ages.The voice acting is also really excellent, while the Furious Five don't really get a lot of in-depth character development outside of Tigress, their voice actors are still really good, and Jack Black absolutely kills it as Po. A lot of comedy actors end up doing voice work for a cartoon character, but with Jack Black it actually feels like he fits the character, with many of Jack Black's mannerisms coming to life in the way Po acts.This film is a great place to start for the DreamWorks catalogue, and the sequels are also really good, and overall I would consider this to be the only animated series that can rival How To Train Your Dragon, all of the animation and character writing are just extremely solid in this movie, everyone should check this out if they are looking for a fun family action film.8/10 The definition of a solid animated film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

All the Elements of a Children's Story,"I enjoy reading children's stories because no matter what the country of origin, they all universally speak for the weaknesses and tendencies of man. Kung Fu Panda, despite not being derived from a classic children's story, has all the elements that teach and prepare children for what to expect from the cynical, imperfect world of adults.Po is a panda serving as apprentice in his father's noodle shop. Despite being obese and awkward, his dream is to become a Kung Fu great one day. The day of reckoning comes when Master Oogway, a wise tortoise and Kung Fu master, recognizes Po as the ""chosen"" one to battle evil. Po is dispatched immediately to the ""Shaolin"" like training monastery.Po isn't well received by his trainer Shifu and by his highly skilled classmates: the tiger, the preying mantis, the monkey, the snake, and the crane. All are jealous, disappointed and insulted that an unproven novice would overshadow their renowned reputation. Many times our cynical needs to rise in importance will cause us to destroy those destined to save us. In the end, all five and Shifu get their crack at battling evil, the snow leopard Tai Lung. They all fail. Po, the dark horse, finally comes through to save the day. All are now happy in the Valley of Peace. All is forgiven.Kung Fu Panda is a cartoon metaphor to describe the traditional brick and mortar workplaces in America. ""New blood"" is often at odds with the senior workforces who see new approaches and ideas as a beachhead for an eventual overhaul of the status quo.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Interesting cartoon with oriental culture,"Against the background of many other (especially recent) foreign cartoons, Kung Fu Panda looks very successful. An interesting idea, of which, in principle, there are many, is very well implemented - but this is already a rarity in the mass flow of cartoons stamped by the American film industry. The protagonist - a clumsy, ridiculous Panda, dreams of becoming a kung fu master - and fate gives him such an opportunity. The result is obvious, but that's not the point. The very path of becoming a great master is a separate story, causing either laughter or sympathy. The authors did not overdo it with moralizing, successfully turning it into ancient Chinese wisdom. In the end, everything looks very tasty. And the drawn cartoon fights are a separate fat plus in the common piggy bank. In addition to beautifully drawn graphics, they give off an old-school quality that only a person who grew up on films with Jackie Chan can understand. The fleur of the story itself is present in this and makes the picture even more interesting and enjoyable to watch. And most importantly - in the cartoon there is humor. I don't know whose merit is in this - the authors or our localizers - but there are jokes, there are a lot of them, and they are generally very successful and funny. What does it mean? This means that it is high time to take it and watch a wonderful cartoon.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprised by how much I liked it.,"I really thought I was going to hate this movie, just by the premise. I thought it was just going to be a bunch of fat jokes, tied into a cliché and unfunny movie. Boy was I wrong, I mean it did have quite a few fat jokes, but they weren't as many as I thought. There are a few cliché parts, but it's seems to be playing around with those clichés. And the best part, it's actually funny. I mean it isn't the funniest animated movie ever made, or even the funniest one Dreamworks has made, but it got quite a few laughs out of me.My biggest problem with the movie isn't that there's too much of the Panda, but that there's too little with the furious five. The Furious Five were pretty awesome in my opinion, I mean the best part of the movie is when there fighting the villain on the bridge. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I here there's a lot more of them. I didn't really have any problems with the panda, but he seems to be a walking fat joke, which are just a step below fart jokes.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Feast for the Eyes & Laughter Muscles,"Kung Fu Panda is the best animated movie I've seen since Finding Nemo. It's the story about Po, a fat-bellied panda, who dreamed of becoming a master of kung fu although his father thinks that he'd one day take over their family business of selling noodle soups. The panda is good at making noodle soups but he knows better that he's destined for something bigger. One day the village is threatened by a villain named Tai Lung, a power-seeking snow leopard. Po is somehow designated as THE dragon warrior who would save the town. I wouldn't go too much in details so not to spoil anyone but this animated picture has a very important message. Sometimes you wish you had a magic wand to make your imperfections go away or transform yourself into someone else. The truth is there's no such thing as magic wands. You got to believe in yourself first before people can believe in you. And you got to work hard to get to your dreams. So that's pretty much the plot behind the legend of the legendary warrior. The CG-animated work in Kung Fu Panda is so much detailed that it's breathtaking. I particularly liked at the end of the movie when they showed a close-up of Master Shifu (Po's kung fu master) waiting for the return of Tai Lung. You can clearly see the wind brushing his fur. The fighting scenes (and believe me there's plenty of them) are spectacular and would make envious any live-action kung fu movies. Some characters were underdeveloped or had no real purpose like most of the Furious Five except maybe for Tigress. However, Jack Black cast as Po did a remarkable job. Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu was a real treat as well as Ian McShane who played the voice of the fearful Tai Lung. Finally, there's no single moment you won't find yourself cracking a smile or bursting out in laughter while watching Kung Fu Panda. It's a must-see!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING,"This film has everything I can ask for in an animated movie: great cast, exceptional visuals, good moral story, and on-point animation. Not only I was entertained but I was also hoping for a sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"While not solid, Kung Fu Panda is still one of Dreamworks Animation's best films","After DreamWorks Animation finished distributing most of their films with their formal company, DreamWorks, they made a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures when they made Over the Hedge. Later, in 2007, two films ""Shrek the Third"" and ""Bee Movie"" both became box office hits, but received mixed reviews from critics. Then, in 2008, DreamWorks Animation had found a way to get them back on track. They decided to make a Chinese martial arts adventure with anthropomorphic animals (similar to Disney's Robin Hood) named ""Kung Fu Panda"", now celebrating it's 5th Anniversary.The reason why I saw it is because I thought that after Bee Movie disappointed me (it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't a much stronger film either), I was hoping for something better to put them back on track. However, when I sat through the whole thing, I had a smile on my face and with that, this film exceeded my expectations back at 2008 during the summer of that year.I will admit that it may not be DreamWorks Animation's solid film but before I can get to the flaws, there's a lot to like about this flick.The story for Kung Fu Panda is very heartwarming and original on it's own right. It pays it's respects to the Chinese culture and gives a lot of moral lessons about believing in yourself and believe that you are a very special person. The martial arts fight sequences are well choreographed and epic it gives you a lot of chills just watching them; the comedy is decent. Not as laugh-out-loud as say ""Toy Story"", but it gave me some chuckles; the dialog is witty and smart as well.The music score from Hans Zimmer and John Powell is by no means excellent. It's Chinese-esque flutes in the orchestra is magnificent and the rock-guitars blends very well with the film's action sequences. Of course, let's not forget the characters and by golly they were wonderful. Po is very funny as a clumsy, but determined panda, Shifu is a strict, but kind Master Shifu; Mr. Ping is a very nice goose father to Po and Master Oogway is both wise and a bad*** turtle Kung Fu master, but the best character would have to go to Tai Lung as the sympathetic villain. His back-story is so sad it made me felt sorry for him and the fight scenes with him are great it makes him one of my favorite Non-Disney villains in the history of animation. The voice work for the characters including Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, James Hong, & Ian McShane is flawless and are a sight to behold.The best part, however, would have to go to the animation. The settings and the textures are so great they look like a Chinese tapestry (similar to that of Disney's Sleeping Beauty). The character animation is solid with realistic expressions on their faces and the emotions are done very well it would make you feel for these characters as well. A+ for you, DreamWorks.Now, before I would end this review, I will say that there are two problems that I do have with this flick. While the story is strong, the way they ended it felt pretty silly to me. I mean, you had an epic final battle between Po and Tai Lung, but aside from that, it ended just abruptly and leaves a lot to be desired. Second, is the Furious Five's development. Don't get me wrong. I do think they're great characters as well, but their development was lacking at best (aside from such big voice casts like Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross, and Seth Rogen) and I would've liked to see more of them (well, until the sequel, that is).Overall, while it isn't solid, Kung Fu Panda is still one of DreamWorks Animation's best films next to Shrek, The Prince of Egypt, and How To Train Your Dragon and is a fun-filled martial arts animated adventure that is heartwarming, beautiful, and hilarious at the same time. Recommended to others who haven't seen it and this deserves a thumbs up from me! :)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I get a funny, exciting experience in this movie","Personally, I am an animation movie lover. For me, animation is a kind of light movie, you don't think too much as the plot goes. What you must keep is let your imagination flow, feel the great adventure-suspense, and a wonderful fantasy, that makes you wonder and amazed. Animation movie is, I think, a cheat movie, you can always create a world or story without too much worry of its properties or safety. Of course, you can always said, it is not logical, it's odd. It's true, but that is not the way to enjoy the animation. Like I said before, don't use your left brain, use your right brain.Let's move to ""Kung Fu Panda"" itself, for me it is a kind of animation treatment. It is classic, funny one, I can enjoy this in every time. The action-animation scene is somewhat entertaining. The characterization is very strong. The friendship value is exposed, and very much moral value in this funny Kung Fu movie. The Kung Fu styles is based on the actual Kung Fu itself, an epic one.The cinematography is fresh. And I also feel the adventure-soul in this movie. The comedy is smart, compared with other movies like ""Madagascar Series"". It is also a simple one, great story in simple movie. I give 8 out of 10, the weakness that I recognized is just some dialog scenes. I think for those scene, the simple yet powerful quotes can be said. So It can be a real epic movie.

"Mildly entertaining, but nothing more and ultimately boring.","I never was taken much with Kung Fu Panda as with a lot of reviewers on here. Dreamworks have come up with some pretty impressive animations over the years though my favourites being Shrek 1 and 2. But the company just isn't in the same league as Pixar. Anyway Kung Fu Panda I found mildly enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying. Don't get me wrong I chuckled at a few parts throughout and Jack Black puts in an incredible effort of bringing a lot of charm to Po. The cast is great including Black with Dustin Hoffman (Shifu), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Jackie Chan (Monkey), Seth Rogen (Mantis) and Lucy Lui (Viper). They all lend good voice-overs to the characters and even the story was OK.But I couldn't connect with many of the characters, the fight sequences if you can call them that were choreographed surprisingly badly, the script wasn't sharp enough with the comedy as the jokes weren't all that funny and the animation wasn't as impressive as previous animations. Despite that though it's not the worst animation I've seen and it was at least trying to entertain you and the bottom line is kids will absolutely love it anyway.

The Big Panda - skadoosh!,"Let me tell you straight without much of any rants...this is the best animation flick in recent years, probably the greatest ever! Why? It has got probably the most awesome action sequences that interlude with slow-mo frames extremely intelligently, thus producing a scene which makes you go...Whoa! That fight scene on the bridge final fight scene are worth to die for! Comedy is unexpected and unprecedented. I hardly remember myself laughing with my eyes out in an animation flick, I nearly missed half of the film as I was too busy laughing my bellies out. Characters are great, voice-over is nearly perfect..The only thing I was let down that it ends a bit too abruptly, just when you think it has started, it decides to end. Too bad they changed script writers,vfx managers in sequel as a result it wasn't as good.

"""Prepare for awesomeness!""","In the Valley of Peace, Po the Panda finds himself chosen as the Dragon Warrior despite the fact that he is obese and a complete novice at martial arts.Animation comes in variety. The ones I only watch are Pixar movies but once and a while Dreamworks can come with something original. Hence Kung Fu Panda! Kung Fu Panda is a hilarious journey through the veins of kung fu. And funny enough, it stars a big fat panda. Although not a big fan of Jack Black's work, this movie shows his true potential. The voice acting is fun, the movie is fun, and everything in between is fun. Kung Fu Panda's animation works greatly in all directions and I loved the opening story that's directed as if a motion comic. Kung Fu Panda also shows heart, for the first time in Dreamwork animation history! If you can look past the not-too frequent toilet humor, you can see the story shows real emotion. It's not quite as magical as Pixar's magic, but Kung Fu Panda proves Dreamworks worth at real animation movie-making! I cannot wait until Kung Fu Panda 2 (which has been receiving lots of good reviews) and any future projects of Dreamworks like this one. Kudos! 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Be careful from overexposure to pure awesomeness!,"I don't know where to even begin with this as Kung Fu Panda is probably one of my top 20 animated films as this film nearly checks everything that should be in a masterpiece. Speaking of whichThe plot and story overall isn't something new but what really makes it stick out is how it was executed. The incredibly thought-provoking and motivational quotes, the Shifu-Tai Lung drama, and the messages are all something very powerful despite the film's rather goofy name.The main attraction of this film is just how beautifully the animators choreographed the action scenes. These people poured their soul into creating incredibly entertaining, interesting fight scenes that will never age no matter how many times you watch it. Even the dumping battle scene was choreographed with passion.Adding to it's gorgeous action and hart-hitting plot is also some minor additions such as humor, small details that make it that much more worthwhile. The humor isn't super hilarious but what makes me laugh all the time is that they have perfect timing that makes a lot of the humor land. This film also has contains creative transitions to the next scene. Like how one time Tai Lung's shadow casted over the valley of peaceThe villain of course, is fantastic and powerful both emotionally and physically. The character development is also strong which makes the entire film really inspirational for people like PoRating: 9.4/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung fu panda,"In China, the big, fat and clumsy Panda Po is a great fan of martial arts and worships The Furious Five - Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey - and their Master Shifu. He works in the restaurant of his father specialized in noodles, but he dreams on being a kung fu hero. When Master Oogway summons the population to announce who would be The Dragon Warrior, he surprisingly points out to the slacker Po, frustrating the expectations of Master Shifu and Tigress. Po joins the academy of Master Shifu that does not believe that Po might be The Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile the evil Tai Lung breaks out the high-security prison where he has been arrested for twenty years and heads to the temple of Oogway, expecting to get the Dragon Scroll and becomes more powerful. The Furious Five tries to intercept Tai Lung, but they are defeated. Now the only chance to stop Tai Lung is the glutton Po.""Kung Fu Panda"" is a very funny and entertaining animation, with the delightful story of a clumsy Panda that dreams on being a hero. The computer-animated heroes and villain are hilarious, supported by the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angeline Jolie and other magnificent actors and actresses. Po is tailored for Jack Black and I can not imagine this character without his voice. Dustin Hoffman also makes the difference with the voice of the wise Master Shifu.

We are in a movie where animals interact with each other in a civilized way and where they are so liberal as to consider it acceptable that a bird be considered the father of a panda bear. Added to that is an invitation to disbelief when you must give way to a story where the weakest character is the protagonist.

Kung Fu Panda definitely doesn't let-down!,"I was pretty skeptical about Kung Fu Panda at first. I thought a movie about a kung fu panda would be too dumb and westernized. However, I was gladly wrong. Every element of the movie resembles an old Asian kung fu movie. The fight scenes are very memorable and you can tell the animators worked hard on them. One of the things I did hate about the movie is the casting of the voice actors. The ""Furious Five"" are supposed to be great kung fu fighters and stuff, and are voiced by celebrities. However, they barely have any importance to the story. And it seemed like Angelina Jolie's Lion character was the only important one. Jackie Chan was the monkey, and he literally had only two lines! There was absolutely no point in having these high profile actors. Some parts of the movie are too cliché, but overall ""Kung Fu Panda"" is pretty good.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very good animated movie...,"The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. The story is about Po, an overweight panda who is the son of a noodle maker, who dreams of Po following in his footsteps. But Po longs to be a ninja fighter. Po is as you know is a panda bear and the film's unlikely hero: as the bigger than life and completely lovable bear voiced by the comic genius Jack Black. Po is a Sweet but clumsy, bear who hears the news the ancient and long awaited dragon warrior will be named, so he runs (as much as he can) to hear who will be named at the celebration.
Without giving too much away, when an ""accident"" seems to name Po as the dragon warrior (much to the horror of Master Shifu (voiced perfectly by Dustin Hoffman) and the disappointment of Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross) and Monkey (Jackie Chan). Shifu must find a way to train him. One hilarious moment after another continues until Shifu recognizes Po's true driving force.

Exciting Kung Fu Underdog Story,"This is one of the greatest films made by Dreamworks. In it, a panda named Po (voiced by Jack Black), who is raised in a noodle shop by Mr. Ping, who is his adoptive father, his life soon turns upside down when trying to get into the Jade Palace, he is declared the Dragon Warrior by Master Oogway, who has a vision that Tai Lung (voiced by Ian McShane), a former pupil of Master Shifu's who turned evil, would escape to seek revenge against the red panda sage. When this comes true, Shifu (voiced by Dennis Hoffman) must train Po to face this dangerous foe.Kung Fu Panda is another example of how big Dreamworks has become. The cast is excellent, as other than Jack, Ian, and Dennis, there is also Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Jackie Chan as Monkey, and Lucy Liu as Viper. The story is well done, as are the fighting scenes, and the movie actually teaches a real good moral.

The Body,"The MindIt has been a long time since I have watched this movie but WOW, it is so good !! From start to end the movie is packed with really good jokes, Jack Black absolutely embodies and nails this character to a T.The supporting cast is also really good !!!Beyond the laughs this movie is driven by belief, believing in yourself is the only secret ingredient that you need. Thai Lung was driven by pride, needing to be the best for his own personal gain rather than becoming the best to protect and nourish the people and kung fu. I must say he is an amazing villain. Master Oogway also has some incredible insights, my favourite being ""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift, that is why it's called the present"".Po puts fear in the backseat and fully embraces being the Dragon Warrior, and rightly so.I really enjoy the movie and honestly I can see myself watching it again many times.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"The big, fat panda kicks butt!","This film has got to be one of Dreamworks best ones! The animation is great, the music really fits in with the movie's mood and the humor is excellent!Po is a Panda whose dream is to fight along side the legendary Furious Five. Only he can't do that because he's stuck selling noodles in his dad's noodle shop and on top of that, he has absolutely no knowledge of martial arts, whatsoever. One day, a flyer is sent out stating that the Dragon Warrior will be chosen from the Furious Five. Po, along with everyone in the town, is excited and goes off to see who'll be crowned the Dragon Warrior. However, due to some circumstances, instead of one of the Furious Five being crowned the Dragon Warrior, Po finds himself being chosen! Now Master Shifu finds himself having to train a big, fat panda who knows nothing about kung fu. He has no choice, though, since Tai Lung, a known criminal, is heading their way.The plot itself seems like it's nothing special- an outcast being chosen to do a professional's job. But the way this movie was presented was just great. The humor really blends in with the movie and makes it just really fun to watch. The humor is what makes this movie stick out. It isn't just your usual animal slapstick comedy. It's really more than that. On top of that, the fight scenes were quite awesome, if I do say so myself.

A good animated one from Dreamworks!,"This is a Dreamworks animated feature, a story about a noodle-shop worker panda named Po, who is the biggest fan of Kung Fu. Chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy, Po joins an elite Kung-Fu group and trains alongside the legendary Furious Five -- Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey -- under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu. Their trainings come in handy when they must battle the vengeful snow leopard Tai Lung.The film has the action, tense and adventure of any martial arts-themed movie, and it is counterbalanced with the laugh-out-loud comedy and humor provided by the host of characters including Po, voiced by Jack Black, and Mr. Ping, voiced by James Hong. The Furious Five, voiced by Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu and David Cross each gave a humorous yet determined and courageous performance of their respective characters. Dustin Hoffman gave a commanding and dignified portrayal of Master Shifu and Randall Duk Kim gave a gentle, yet wise performance of the master turtle, Ooogway.The movie is made in beautiful animation and great visual effects, capturing the many characteristics of China like pagoda-style buildings, magnificent mountains, a spectacular fireworks show, noodle shops, Chinese Characters and chopsticks and glass bowls. Mark Osborne and John Stevenson did an awesome job in directing a movie with adventures in action in abundance, with unforgettable characters marvelously voiced by an all-star case. The writing team of Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Burger, Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris provided a daring story with a touching emphasis on courage, believing in yourself and teamwork. And, Composers John Powell and Hans Zimmer provided a brilliant music score, with beautiful Chinese-style music accompaniment.Overall, I believe this is one of the better non-Disney animated films I've seen and it is fun and terrific for the entire family.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Aaaammmaaaazzzziiiinnnngggg!!!,"For a long time, I was hesitant to watch this movie. I feared that with it being an animation movie, it would make fun of the kung fu tradition and the oriental culture in general for the sake of comedy and jokes, which, to me, would have been such cheap comedy.

The characters are drawn in such an amazing fashion and very well balanced, especially Po, he is childish and a little immature but in an adorable way that you still have to like him.Voices!! My my!

Hoffman did a wonderful job as well, his deep poised voice was the perfect match for his character.Visuals! This movie introduced a whole new level of awesomeness visual-wise.

Good for Children - Maybe not Even,"I remain baffled by this film's success, but perhaps mediocrity is its secret weapon. Give the audience nothing new, slap a fresh coat of paint on it, and they'll mistake the thin, safe veneer of novelty for something inspired.The plot? The same tired underdog story we've seen a thousand times - an unqualified, bumbling outsider (this time chubby panda Po) miraculously outshines the experts, not through skill or effort, but sheer narrative inevitability. Naturally, the so-called ""elite"" warriors, who have dedicated their lives to training, are somehow not good enough when it counts.Nothing flatters a lazy audience quite like the fantasy of unearned success. Why work hard when destiny can just hand you greatness on a platter? A perfect feel-good message for those who prefer wishful thinking over actual effort.I never thought I'd find a movie about a panda boring, yet here we are. Aimed mostly at children (and apparently undemanding adults), Kung Fu Panda serves up unfunny jokes, the usual bombastic action sequences, and the obligatory anthropomorphic-animal fight scenes - this time against yet another generic rebel villain. If you've seen one, you've seen them all.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Formulaic yet mystical, amusing and incredibly well animated. Props for the striking swift and creative fights.","As an upbeat movie that provides some sort of homage to kung fu movies and follows the chosen-one and embrace-your-destiny tropes it succeeds in all aspects. As a ground-breaking, oscar-worthy, emotionally deep animated movie it doesn't quite strike that impactful as some of the themes are approached comedically instead.Where a movie about a norms' breaking panda who at first was unfit for a destiny he was chosen for finds himself discovering who he trully is, could have communicated that known trope in a new groundbreaking way; it settles for an eye-grabbing old-China aesthetic setting, endearing anthropomorphic characters and an epic, funny and mystical story worthy of praise and originallity.However, it is inevitable to compare it with other animated movies that set the bar back then like Shrek and PIXAR movies of the 2000s. And unfortunately the movie borrows its tone from the studios' critically-acclaimed previous movie Shrek. A tone that works in that movie because it represents a satire of Fairy Tales tropes and stories. Kung Fu Panda on the other hand, provides emotional weight to each of its characters taking many of its themes maturely enough to be taken seriously. Not to say that the humor doesn't fit the story, quite the contrary, it is welcomed and I personally find some of those moments amusing. Nevertheless, some of the more emotional moments are ruined as Po's character is overly played for laughs. Outstanding lessons in such a spiritual approach at the art of Kung Fu through the character of Oogway or even Shifu loose their emotional impact because right after it Po deliveres slapstick comedy.Personally, should the movie had embraced its mysticism and provided a more mature take at the common trope of embracing-your-destiny in such a lacking backdrop that is Ancient China, it would have become a more impactful tale aside from the amusing and heartfelt movie that it is. Kung Fu and other martial arts are perfect to channel a spiritual journey a troubled or lost person can take to find his/her destiny or to cope with the past or search for the future. Movies like the Karate Kid and the Last Samurai and even anime like Dragon Ball Z are good examples of these approach. Although a more comedic, child-friendly approach is refreshing and welcomed it can potentially damage the more spiritual aspects if they are mutually exclusive or if the humor is excessiveIN CONCLUSION, the film is one of the better ones of DreamWorks Animation as its endearing and jaw-droppingly well animated characters, plot and setting provide a spectacle of well-chorographed fights, legendary foes, mystical masters and an inspiring uplifting tale of self-confidence and acceptance. And the best part is that the sequels expand not only in the new adventures of the protagonists but also on their backstory. Dreamworks knows how to do sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

There are no accidents.,"I love animated movies, but I remember watching 'Kung Fu Panda' many years ago and thinking it was definitely more suitable for a young demographic. With the release of 'Kung Fu Panda 4' I decided to watch the original again to see if I'd had a change of opinion, but - as it turns out - I don't. I still believe it is a cartoon for kids. (I also haven't seen any of the sequels).Po, an overweight Panda Bear, has dreams of being a kung fu warrior, and his heroes are kung fu masters The Famous Five. His Dad, a goose, runs a noodle restaurant and has hopes of Po taking over the restaurant. (Interestingly, the film never explains how the goose came to be a Panda's dad. I would have liked a back story on this.)At a ceremony for choosing the next Dragon Warrior, Po accidentally ends up being chosen. Now, he is being trained by Shifu, a red Panda. Meanwhile, the real Dragon Warrior, Tai Lung - a Snow Leapord - escapes from a maximum security prison. There's a back story telling us Shifu took in Tai Lung when he was little, and trained him, as well.Action and adventure - and kung fu fighting - ensues, but I once again couldn't really get into the movie. I found it a bit too cartoonish; like a big budget kids cartoon. My opinion aside, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a film families can enjoy together. Kids, especially, will have a good time with the movie and fall in love with the characters. It is a story of good versus evil, with a message of believing in yourself - no matter what.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Jack Black as a Panda ? And it was a good movie ?,"Hearing the title and the premise, I thought Kung Fu Panda was going to be a waste of my time but boy was I wrong. The film excels in almost all aspects from the likable characters to the amazing animation.The film's strongest quality is its characters. Po is likable in his tenacity and determination never to give up and fulfill his dream whereas Shifu is sympathetic in living with a mistake and taking it out on others. The Furious Five are all wonderfully unique in their different personalities but are also relatable in that they think they have been cheated. The villain is also a lot of fun, and the fact that he is a Kung Fu master allows for some exciting imagery. The world that the animators create with anthropomorphic animals is a very unique and pretty world and there is also a good blend between the ancient Chinese culture and modern day humor. The Kung Fu displayed in the film (especially by Tai Lung) is always fun to watch as it has the right blend between animation and comedy. The music by Hans Zimmer was excellent, one of Zimmer's best in my opinion (particularly the music sequence used for the five's battle with Tai Lung). However, the film does have a few flaws, personally I felt that the film's climax was a little weak, so much had been building up to that point and they tried to play out the climax between Po and Tai Lung as both serious and funny. Personally, they should have gone one way or another, but that is simply a nit pick. The fight between Po and Tai Lung is still entertaining and the film does end on a happy note.Overall, Kung Fu Panda is still a wonderful film, it has an inspiring message of hope and determination that will appeal to both adults and children and as much as it appealed to me.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderfully structured movie,"Kung Fu Panda is one of the best films that Dreamworks Animation has put out and still holds up well. Po, voiced by Jack Black, is a panda who is the biggest fan of the Furious Five. He works at his father's noodle restaurant, even though he loves kung fu. On the day the dragon warrior is to be announced, Po does everything in his power to get in to see who the dragon warrior is. However, a surprise happens as Po is selected.Now that Po is to be the dragon warrior, he is one who must defeat an evil snow leopard named Tai Lung. Master Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman, must train Po to do what may have been impossible and put him through rigorous training involving food in order to motivate Po.The Furious Five are all excellent supporting characters. The stand out of them is Tigress, voiced by Angelina Jolie. Jole is excellent at being the uptight, tough one who truly thinks Po does not belong. Ian McShane is also excellent as Tai Lung. McShane brings a real tough intensity to him that shows Tai Lung's true evil spirit.The best part of this film is how directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenon rely mostly on the story. They show that if you have a great story to follow, everything else will fall into place. This film has great dialogue and great transitions from scene to scene.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Skadoosh!,"Kung Fu Panda tells the story of Po (voiced by the one, the only, the incomparable Jack Black), a clumsy-but-friendly panda who lives in the Valley of Peace in ancient China. Po is obsessed with kung-fu, and aspires to fight alongside his idols, the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), and Monkey (Jackie Chan, Hollywood's master of kung-fu, who ironically, gets fewer lines than anyone else). But there's a problem: Po knows nothing about actually performing kung-fu, and is burdened by his daily job at his goose dad Mr. Ping's (James Hong) noodle restaurant. One day, however, there's news of a ceremony at the Jade Palace, where Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) will determine the Dragon Warrior. Po enters by accident, and is chosen. The five's leader, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), must figure out how to train him and make him a kung fu master, especially since Tai Lung (Ian McShane), an evil and entitled snow leopard who has always believed himself to be the true Dragon Warrior, has escaped from jail, and is on his way to the Jade Palace.That's the premise. Now here's my opinion: this movie is INSANE!! And not just the premise. Everything about it!The animation is astounding. All the character designs are very charming. Especially Po's! He looks very cute and cuddly! And all the character movements are fluid and expressive. Furthermore, all the set pieces are magnificent to look at. It's a feast for the eyes, and even holds up about 15 years later! Kudos to DreamWorks' incredible CGI animators.And all the characters are so likeable in every way. Po is very goofy and always great fun, and a very compelling protagonist. Master Shifu, despite his initial cold and unfriendly demeanor, is gradually shown to be very charming, and seeing him warm up to Po is very pleasant to watch. And the Five are all well-fleshed out, and though skeptical to Po at first, they gradually grow out of it, and begin to show faith in him. Tigress, especially, is initially disdainful to Po, but even she begins to see his potential. And Tai Lung is a very threatening, and very memorable villain!The voice-acting is fantastic, ESPECIALLY by Jack Black, who's having the time of his life voicing Po! He's clearly channeling his energy and goofiness from School of Rock, and it works wonders for Po's character. But everybody else also does magnificently with their roles. Dustin Hoffman brings Master Shifu to life with a certain bitterness that gently fades as he grows out of his harsh, controlling nature. Angelina Jolie is very no-nonsense and earnest as Tigress. And, of course, Ian McShane makes a spectacular villain as Tai Lung!And the movie is jam-packed with exciting action, that will never cease to thrill you. Along with that comes mounds of perfectly-timed comedy, especially the sequence of Po failing miserably on his first attempt at kung-fu training!And last but not least, there's the music. Hans Zimmer and John Powell co-composed a fabulous score for this movie! Along with matching the mood exactly right all the way through, it has a sublime and exotic ancient Chinese feel to it. And of course, there's the end credits song ""Kung Fu Fighting"", performed by Cee Lo Green and Jack Black (I mean, they wouldn't put Jack Black in a movie unless they also gave him something to sing, right?). It's awesome.Everything considered, Kung Fu Panda is an awesome movie, probably one of the best DreamWorks Animation has ever made.

I am a Panda,"Following the story of the panda who wants to learn martial arts - Po (Jack Black) this time is to replace Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to teach the five great teachings including Snake (Lucy Liu), Tiger (Angelia Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogan), Stork (David Cross). And yet, a buffalo (J.K Simmons) raises the grave only to take revenge on the Elder (Randall Duk Kim) because he used to kick his ass in the past. And this time we saw a little more about Po's origin when Po's father appeared.If the first part is about the impossible journey to become a hero, then the second part is to continue to train to become more powerful. The third part is the journey to become someone everyone respects - a master. But along with that is also the journey to learn yourself, your own source. Perhaps this is the most beautiful part of the three, not saying that the parts that were ""short of breath"" but the image quality were somewhat better. This is extremely interesting when the action scenes are detailed but beautiful, along with Hans Zimmer's contribution, we don't have to complain about the audiovisual segment.As for the ""acting"" part (voice acting), Jack Black still retains his performance like the previous parts, all the laughter of the movie is almost captured by him. The mind is the same as the soul of the whole film, but this content and implication is somewhat ""goat tiger"" part two. Because this time must also face an enemy, while learning a new lesson - the content of part one and two. In addition, when Shifu kept saying ""I am very young"" after all that Po had experienced. The only other story this time is probably learning ""new moves"".That said, obviously, the film also has many unique features this time. As if Po had to teach a bunch of pandas as his relatives to study elaborately, while Ngu Dai had his own work (although they lacked the same land as before) and also a series of actors new again. Kate Hudson's unexpected appearance as Mei Mei really took away some laughter from Jack Black, but the most striking was the participation of Bryan Cranston as the father of Po, Li Shang in the role Po's adoptive father and JK Simmons' undisputed talent as the main villain this time is Kai. This is probably the most interesting guy from Tai Lung (Ian McShane) part one. A strong guy but also has a history of exciting pushing. But the funny thing is that even though he's not known. However, with the talent of J.K Simmons, this character is even more interesting when having his own funny face.Unlike Kung Fu Panda 2, this time it's like the end of the series. The end of the hero ""Long Binh"", although quite unexpected, is very wonderful and very satisfying. Although it is only about the main theme of ""surpassing yourself"", this is not a bad thing to teach, especially with small children. In general, if you love the first two parts, this is a ""must see"" already. And if it really is the end for ""Long Binh"" it is also extremely spectacular.Perhaps coming here, I do not need a lot of words for you to ""carry"" out of the theater to be able to enjoy great hours with Kung Fu Panda 3. With a huge cast of talent and talent. Ignoring some old rules, everything is excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome,"What I love about the movie is the beautiful scenes, music, soundtrack and funny lines. All these make this movie awesome.I strongly recommend you go watch it with your family. It will bring you a lot of fun. The story is quite easy,but I think that's supposed to be that way. The Kung Fu action in the movie is awesome too. Ofcouse Jack Black and Dustin did a great job too. I watched some other movies which had Chinese cultures in there, I didn't like them well. But this time, seems they did so well to show the real side of the culture, not just build them in. I watched Kung Fu Panda with my husband. He loved it too. He is a very picky guy, he even said it is a great movie to watch. There were a lot children in the theater, I could feel they had a great time in there. I even saw a little girl watching it and taking pictures with a camera. I guess it might be her second time to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
FilmCreature Reviews 'Kung Fu Panda',"According to Wikipedia, ""China has one of the longest histories of continuously recorded martial arts tradition of any society in the world, and with hundreds of styles probably the most varied. Over the past two to four thousand years, many distinctive styles have been developed, each with its own set of techniques and ideas."" One of the coolest things about Kung Fu Panda is that it seems to celebrate some of these individual styles, representing them with its own animal. The animated martial arts in the film is lithe and mesmerizing; surprisingly sharp for a kids movie. Teens, parents, and kung fu fanatics will all get their money's worth with this high-spirited and high-energy flick.The plot is obvious. A fat, lazy panda (voiced by a precisely cast Jack Black) gets a chance to prove his worth as the ""Dragon Warrior"" who will save China from the wicked snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane). In order to do this, he must be trained by Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a deceptively small red panda who has trained the greatest kung fu warriors in all China, the Furious Five, voiced by (*deep breath*) Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and David Cross. Of course, they all expected to be chosen to be the Dragon Warrior, and here's Chub Fu to take away the coveted prize.The voice talents are mostly generic. The exceptions would be Jack Black, who brings a slacker panda reminiscent of Kevin Smith comedy to life almost flawlessly, and Dustin Hoffman, doing such a good job as Master Shifu that you won't even recognize his gravely enunciation unless you listen closely.I recommend 'Kung Fu Panda'. Everyone'll have a blast. Even if it's predictable to the very end, the characters are all likable, and the film has a cartoony animation style but still looks gorgeous.3/4",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Clever,"This is one of those films that really gets you thinking for weeks, think Donnie Darko, think Donnie Darko.It also seemed to build an inner confidence i never knew i had.After the final shot where the Panda wins the bet and walks off with the hottie i set out to buy myself a giant wood-lice costume from www.youwilllookatwat.co.uk and got into character as soon as i got home.I then spend the rest of my evening chewing the mdf backing on my wifes wardrobe which seemed to turn her on.The rest of the evening was a blur and she is no longer talking to me but what i am trying to say is that dressing as a strange animal can have some very beneficial effects.Love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift, which is why we call it the present","The wonderful bit of dialogue mentioned just above is not from an artsy fartsy movie or some sweeping epic that will stun the Academy for years to come. Instead, we receive this nice line (albeit used before) from the surprisingly good Kung Fu Panda. While it is not even close to being original, Kung Fu Panda is surprisingly funny, surprisingly rich, and has a surprising amount of decent fight choreography that might even impress the legend Jackie Chan. With Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman leading the way with their superb voice acting skills, we have the best animated Dreamworks picture since Madagascar. Yes, this includes the Shrek sequels.Kung Fu Panda follows Po (Jack Black), a friendly fat panda that has one dream in life, and that is to be the best at martial arts. Unfortunately, his size and his lack of coordination hamper his potential. His opportunity actually arrives after he is revealed to be the chosen one that will save the village from an extremely angry tiger. Much to the dismay of the better fighters in the area and their trainer (Dustin Hoffman), they must whether accept this revelation of attempt to take in the role of protectors themselves. As you can tell, the plot borrows heavily from other films past and present, but we're not totally about the narrativebesides, the short running time doesn't allow us to dwell into the storyline either.Visually, the movie is the best since Madagascar as well. While the Shrek sequels never attempt to enter the next level in animation to the likes of Cars and Ratatouille, or attempt to try something different, Kung Fu Panda offers a variety of animated styles that includes but isn't limited to: slowing the action down, freeze-framing some shots, rendering into 2-D, and then sometimes speeding up the action so quickly you have to be paying attention closely or you'll miss out. The physical humor here resembles that of Madagascar; fast-paced, witty, and with plenty of it to go about. The fights themselves are actually well-choreographed and quite creative; some of the best you'll see in quite some time. A good fight is tough to film, even tougher to create from scratch. The advantage of animation is that you can manipulate the camera and allow it to catch up to the action, and they use this ability well. Unfortunately, the good action sequences occur only in the second half of the movie.Besides Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman, the voice acting isn't that wonderful. There is no point in Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, and Angelina Jolie getting paid the millions they are probably receiving for their rolesthey barely have over 20 lines in the film. The main chemistry and relationship that works well in Kung Fu Panda is that of the main character and his mentor. Dustim Hoffman's performance as the mentor is easily one of the best animated performances of the decade, going up there with Ellen DeGeneres in Finding Nemo, Holly Hunter in The Incredibles, and Sacha Baron Cohen in Madagascar.Bottom Line: Kung Fu Panda starts off slow, but then builds plenty of momentum once the story shifts gears and the climax is approaching (literally and figuratively). The fights are good, the animation is good, the laughs are definitely in here, and its surprisingly rich dialogue offers some useful advice for kids and adults. The movie isn't going to be a hallmark in film history like Pixar's best work, but it's definitely better than most Dreamworks animated films. Kung Fu Panda is a good original story that will entertain audiences of all ages.P.S. Dreamworks was smart in releasing this before the heavily-buzzed Wall-E.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"He's funny, he's adorable; he's The Incredible Bulk","Po (voiced by the incredibly talented Jack Black) is a fat panda who likes kung fu but never dreamed that he would one day be chosen as the Dragon Warrior. He also never imagined having to fight the fearsome Tai Lung (Ian McShane), who is as mean and vicious as villains come. The reluctant fighter gets help in preparing for his showdown from Master Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), and the interaction between teacher and student provide many of the laughs. There's a lot more going on around this simple storyline, and the movie is filled with comedy and action from start to finish. The animation is brilliantly done, the characters' facial expressions are priceless while the kung fu action is flawless. Although much of the humor is action-based, there's also much wit and satire in the script along with a good dose of tenderness and heart. Among the many lovable characters, my favorites are Po, Master Shifu and Master Oogway, an even older and wiser teacher who decided that there's no reason why an ordinary panda cannot be a superhero if he just believed in himself.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A new take on an otherwise generic plot,"Call it generic, but 'Kung Fu Panda' is one of the most enjoyable films I have seen in years. Jack Black voices a lovable overweight panda named Po, living in China selling noodles in a family business. Po has developed an interest in the ancient art of Kung Fu, but accepts that this interest can only be a dream and nothing else. This changes however, when he crashes a Kung Fu ceremony and is named the Dragon Emperor. Although the other Kung Fu students protest, their master proclaims 'there are no accidents'. Simultaneously, a Kung Fu master named Tai Lung, who was previously denied the title of the Dragon Emperor and became evil, has just escaped from prison and seeks revenge. It is up to the unlikely hero, Po, to become a master and stop him.While the ending is predictable, what separates 'Kung Fu Panda' from other animated films is how damn funny it is. 'Kung Fu Panda' is a mere 92 minutes, which is perfect because it never feels dragged out and it never gets boring. The animation is visually stunning, which is especially apparent in IMAX. The martial arts fight scenes represent a breakthrough in computer animation. Each character perfectly matches the personalities of the actors who gave their voices to them. Jack Black is perfect as the lazy Po, and Angelina Jolie is equally convincing as the fearless and powerful tiger Tigress. 'Kung Fu Panda' is guaranteed to entertain people of all ages, and leave them laughing even after they leave the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a real Chinese panda!,"The reason why I saw this film in the very first place is because it relates to the Chinese culture and Chinese features, especially, Chinese Kungfu. Though a Chinese I am, I am not a big fan of Chinese Kungfu and quite indifferent about the animated film. But, after I finished the Kungfu Panda, I was indeed carried away to the ancient China by the film which unravels the 100 percent pure Chinese culture and features- Chinese Kungfu of course, Chinese Zen culture from the words of Master Wugui(turtle), Chinese settings( pine trees, high mountains, temples, music and garments as well), and, hilariously, a few Chinese words( Chi-eat, Wugui-turtle, Shifu-master, just to name a few).Besides all the Chinese features, the film alone also is highly impressive with the laugh-out-loud funny leading character Po the Panda, the heart-pounding Kungfu fighting, and the inevitable but must life philosophy not in the pedantic way. What I like best of the film is the ending, when Master Shifu finally found his inner peace, Po the panda disturbed him once again unintentionally with his innocence regardless of his awesome record of beating the Tailang. What a Panda!I wish that China could produce its own animated Chinese Kungfu Panda, dragon, or whatever, but when it couldn't, it's also very nice to see America did it and, especially, presented the real deal of Chinese culture.

Written on two levels,"I saw this film at the Imax in Siam Paragon, Bangkok.I took my son and a couple of friends, we all loved it.The film critics back in the UK have given this film only an average rating, sad or what ? I expected it to be the usual thing I have taken my children to see over the years. I was in for a humorous and pleasant surprise.I will not go over the detail described often enough in the user comments but I will add three of the things written for adults.""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift. We call it 'The Present'."" I like the play on words 'gift' and 'present'.I think that phrase just about says it all ? Then there is the 'Scroll with Ten Secrets' - it turned out to be blank yet showed the reflection of the reader. Believe in what you do.The Po the Panda's Dad(A bird !)

Kung Fu Panda is one of the best from Dreamworks Animation yet,"While I admit to falling asleep at some scenes (parts of Tai Lung's escape and some of Po's training), I was mostly highly amused and entertained by what Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) was teaching Po (Jack Black). In fact, this was one of the most entertaining of the Dreamworks Animation features. Po gets befriended by five other of Shifu's students: Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie). The villain, Tai Lung (Ian McShane), was another student of Shifu's whose attitude got him jailed for 20 years. Also of interest is Mr. Ping, Po's restaurateur father (James Hong), who turns out to be quite an inspiration to his son though it doesn't seem that way at first. Black's line readings and the animation movements of his panda character are some of the funniest I've seen and heard on the screen yet and the relationship between Po and Shifu are some of the best mixture of funny and touching especially the end scenes that end up quite differently than you'd expect (perhaps the fact Kung Fu Panda is mainly meant for kids have something to do with it). So on that note, this movie comes highly recommended for the whole family though it's okay if you just watch this alone or with a friend as I did. P.S. I loved the 2-D animation that began this movie (which included the unique way the Dreamworks logo was done here).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not for kids under 3!,"First, I take complete responsibility for not looking deeper into the rating before I went to the movie. My mistake was assuming that all cartoon movies are made for children. There were LOTS of parents in the theater with children under 5 and we all left saying the same thing.. the movie is way too violent and in some places even ""scary"" for children under 5.That said, I found the movie incredibly funny and enjoyed it very much. There were several points in the film where all the adults in the audience laughed, though I think even the kids over 5 never really ""got it."" The biggest laugh I heard from the kids during the entire movie was from the preview of Madagascar 2.On an additional note, the voices are a perfect match for the personalities of each character.I just have to remember that not all cartoon movies are made for kids.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Pan-dastic,"This beautifully animated movie has the hallmarks of an enduring classic. Cleverly scripted, it follows the Joseph Campbell ""Hero"" formula with several twists of individualistic humour, primarily allowing Jack Black's deliberately stilted story telling style to be relayed in the opening sequence (as witnessed in ""School of Rock"" and ""Be Kind, Rewind"").The movie pays homage to many Chinese greats including ""Enter the Dragon"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" plus several early Jackie Chan movies.The animation style is predominantly Dreamworks' own with just a touch of Manga.My children (7 and 3) and I were laughing very early on, usually at different scenes, proving once again that Dreamworks has the formula to appeal across the age demographic.In true Chinese food style, we felt sated when the credits started rolling. Ten minutes after leaving the cinema, we wanted to see it again...My 7 year old son gave it 21/10. I'll settle for a more modest 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just a fun film to watch,"Kung Fu Panda - ****Director: Mark Osborne & John Stevenson. Starring: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Ian McShane. Certificate: PG. Duration: 92 minutes. Best Bit: The Escape and Po's training. Worst Bit: had a few corny bits.If you liked Over the Hedge or The Incredibles you might love thisYet again an animation with animals appears on our screens, which is OK as this one features a panda. Pandas are awesome.Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, voiced by Jack Black, who is a fat panda who works in a noodle shop restaurant thing, with his uuurrhhh dad? which is duck. Anyway Po has a dream to be an awesome kung fu master, to fight along the Furious Five and to be taught by the greatest kung fu master in the world - Master Shifu voiced by Dustin Hoffman, who is a RED PANDA which will stop you guessing for the whole film. Although there's a slight problem which is the fact the Po has no Kung Fu fight skills and he's fat. Continuing on, the peaceful village Po lives in is in danger, as there is talk that Tai Long, voiced by Ian Macshane, might escape from Prison, guarded by Michael Clarke Duncan. So after some accidents, some training, then some friendship and then some blah blah blah blah You can kind of guess that story line.But you can't sometimes guess why they would do some stuff they do, I mean what is it with that finger hold?First of all the animation, obviously DreamWorks where going for more cartoony look for this film, in which they succeeded. I have to except the character designs where ferpect.I don't understand why DreamWorks have gone through loads of trouble getting an all star cast when only two of the most noticeable stars talk. They had Angeline Jolie, Seth Rogen, David Cross, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu (both of which only said about 10 words each). Most of the less known actors got much more dialogue than the big 'uns, like Dan Fogler and Ian McShane that does exceptional as Tai Long and he's English. So basically Jack black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane to brilliant and the rest are OK.To be honest this film didn't have as much gags as I thought it would have, but the gags there where are very very funny. Most of the gags are about the panda's belly, which is totally fine as he's a panda. Some the best scenes are the prison escape, the bridge fight, Po's training and Po's big fight seen.So overall I'm gonna say this is a great film that will make pretty much anyone laugh, with great voice acting and very good animation. I liked it and so should you. SKADOOSH!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda redeems DreamWorks.,"Dreamworks Animation, after the mediocre third installment of the Shrek series, hasn't really been outstanding. Rather, it had dimmed in the shadows of oblivion. It's major rival Disney, on the other hand, has been successful with films like Wall E. But now with a star-studded cast and a smart script, DreamWorks makes a comeback with Kung Fu Panda, which is a film filled with ""awesomeness"". Jack Black does the voice of Po the Panda, and he does it great. Every scene Po is in belongs to him, in other word it makes the other characters look inferior, not weight-wise, although he is a pretty big animal. Another thing about this film is the absence of humans. Every character in the film is an animal whether a tiny insect or a frightening rhino. That sets the frivolous mood of the film, although it's not as frivolous as some might expect it. Had its fair share of plot twists and great jokes. Oh yeah lots of great jokes. Don't take this movie for a subtle one, and don't have little or no expectations of it because surely it will shatter your expectations just like it shattered the box office.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty freakin' awesome!,"Last week I saw Kung Fu Panda with a few of my mates, who'd been dying for its release. I must say, we were definitely satisfied with what we saw, i'd even say... Extremely impressed! From the previews, i thought it was just going to be another dreamworks animated film that failed to impress me (eg. Shark Tale, Shrek the Third, Bee Movie etc.), but Kung Fu Panda was full of ""Awesomeness"".Jack Black plays a fat panda, who wants to be a kung fu champion, like his idols... He plays the role fantastically! Big names such as Angelina Jolie and Jacki Chan also play characters, and although the film would have been fine with some no-name actors, they definitely bring some 'zing' to the film.The animation is certainly above average in the scheme of recent animated films, and the entertainment level is incredible. One of my only complaints is that it should maybe go for a bit longer. There was definitely room for a few more laughs, and my popcorn bag wasn't yet empty. I was a bit like.. ohhh, it's over? Apart from it's premature conclusion, i thoroughly enjoyed watching Kung Fu Panda.

"Kids! Have You Ever Seen A Panda Do Kung Fu? No, This Is ""wicked.""","This animated movie from Dreamworks has to be one of the best animation movies that I have ever seen.A sweet but lazy and a clumsy panda, named PO has dreams of fighting five legendary fighters - a tigress, a Viper, a Crane, a Monkey and a Mantis. But there's a problem and that is that these fighters are all trained in Kung Fu but the Panda isn't and he is working in his father's noodle restaurant, serving noodles to customers. But one day, it is announced that that there will be a selection process of choosing a ""Dragon Warrior"" and as everyone in the town go to watch this, PO accidentally (nothing happens accidentally) enters this competition and at the same time, there's breaking news that the evil Tai Lang, a Snow Leopard, has escaped from a nearby jail.Directed by Mark Osbourne and John Stevenson, the voice overs are by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie and Lucy Liu and is written by Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger.The martial arts movement for this animation was actually put on after the sequences were performed by real artists. But what has really made this into a good and watchable movie is that the story takes place in ancient China and the character of PO is such that it just makes one laugh but deep down one is aware that he is also a sensitive character.Although the movie is for children, I must warn that there is violence but it is mild and, in some cases, very funny.

Kung Fu Panda (2008),"For the first half hour the film is more or less typical of what I would expect from a Dreamworks, or any non-Pixar, animated film, which includes a few too many conventional ""Dreamworks moments"" and some safe comedy....... and then it became beautiful! I am thoroughly impressed with this animated feature! I was not expecting it to be full of such quietly respectful Eastern sentimentality, or as artistically rich in detail as it was. I'll have to go back for a second viewing because there were so many little details I know I missed. The entire last hour of the film, for me, was near perfect. Tai-Lung's escape from prison, the last words of Oogway, the Five's battle with Tai-Lung, Po's training, the final confrontation between Shifu and Tai-Lung, and especially the fight between Po and Shifu for the dumpling, was outstanding and beautifully done. This film evoked the kind of feelings that a film based on such a significant part of Eastern culture should evoke in me. It is easily the second best film of the year so far for me, and by far Dreamworks greatest achievement yet.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

They prove some comic relief but some of them lack screen time and dialogue except for Hoffman's Shifu.

The Panda of Bodaciousness: Kung Fu exceeds expectations,"It's not often you have to succumb to bodaciousness (grammar has to succumb slightly too). When you do, it's kinda fun.The hype surrounding Kung Fu Panda was an automatic put-off for me; another Dreamworks film, another comedy, another Jack Black vehicle. The merchandise hasn't completely filled the shops yet, but I had a feeling it was just a matter of time.I couldn't have been more wrong. Kung Fu Panda manages to combine the best elements of the entities involved in the film - Jack Black is at his antihero best (something I haven't seen since School of Rock), Dreamworks get back to their intelligently funny roots and the story flows with wit.These elements are so strong that they made it through the marketing process which usually sucks the soul out of other movies. The preview thawed me a little - who could resist a film that featured a fat, panting superhero bear? I began to think up ways I could sneak out to see the film without anyone seeing me. After all, I have my pride, and I'd been burned by Horton Hears a Who (seriously, did anything happen in that film?) but fate landed me in Folkestone, the Town With Very Little To Do, and I was in luck.The night was well set for comic surrealism. I lined up in a queue of 40-something women all wearing the same cardigan (they were going to see Mamma Mia) and thought I might be the only person going to see Kung Fu before I shuffled into a room full of 15-year-olds. The teens all stopped talking and stared as I shuffled down the aisle and took a seat in front. There was a tense moment before I told them all to go back to their activities and the previews started. Then the opening credits began to roll.Meet Kung Fu Panda. His legendariness is legendary. His skills the stuff of legend. His very paws oozing with bodacity. From the very first moment, the film makes use of the progress in martial art film over the last few years and the general youthful obsession with martial art heroes to tickle the funnybones of the audience. There is the usual underdog-makes-good storyline, but with enough gags and freshness to carry the tired dog along.Unlike most other animated films, Panda didn't advertise its range of stars by obviously referencing them in the looks of the characters. This meant that the characters were allowed to stand alone to be enjoyed on their own merits, rather than as cutesy versions of Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie or the many other talented voice artists attached to the movie.The thing I most enjoyed is how the film uses the rich history of martial art to support the comedy plot-line. The opening sequence is artful enough to rival the films it's referencing, such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers. Panda's fellow warriors, Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Viper and Crane, each stand in for genuine fighting styles and every name - particularly the panda Po, meaning noodle soup - has a meaning.

Still legendary,"I remember watching this movie about 12 years ago and was actually one of the first movies I ever watched, and I loved it. I watched it again now to dive back into the franchise before the new installment and clearly I wasn't dissapointed.It's insane thinking this movie was released 15 years ago as the animation was way ahead of it's time and it's absolutely stunning, and is one of the main treats of watching a dreamworks movie, and it helps it be completely timeless.Po's character development is incredible, from becoming a dreamer into achieving beyond his wildest dreams, and he is general a joy of a character to watch.Tigress and Shifu in my opinion are also beautiful characters to watch.The movie takes a much more serious tone then most animated films, as it's writing orients it towards inspiring the person watching the film, and I really appreciate that tone as it adds to it's great storytelling.The only slight problem is the pacing, which slightly hampers it as the movie sometimes doesn't feel continuous to it's previous scene even though you can still understand the general telling of events so it isn't too impactful.In conclusion, the movie is still a joy and a treat, especially for me and my generation, I was so inspired and touched and I will never forget this movie series.I am so happy that another move is coming after so
much time, and I just need another animated how to train your dragon film and dreamworks are well on their way to fulfill their redemption arc :)Solid 9.3/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pletty good, Glasshopper","Let's get one thing straight. I have always regarded Jack Black as a tolerable supporting player who, for some reason I can't quite fathom (although it seems to have something to do with some people finding him quite a bit funnier than I do), has achieved leading man status. That overall opinion hasn't changed, but that doesn't stop me recognising his voice work here as very, very good. The same goes for Dustin Hoffman, with a special mention for James Hong. The other voice artists are also good, but the parts they play don't really demand the names which play them - Jackie Chan has, what? five lines? Something like that.This film looks gorgeous. The backgrounds are simply breathtaking, the characters are well realised, and the effects are excellent. There are lots of gags, most of them quite funny, and lots of action too.I have two criticisms. One is that much of the action was too fast for me to follow. The other is that the movie seemed a bit - well, inconsequential. Maybe I'm getting used to the better scripted CGI animated movies regaling me with various universal truths, but I didn't detect much of that here. Just a relatively engaging story, well told.And that's perfectly fine, of course.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda is cool,"The movie was awesome. The best animation movie that I saw lately. I was never bored while I saw the movie. Not only Jack Black, but also Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu's voice is very proper. Especially Jack Black's voice acting is perfect in his cast of the Po. After I saw the movie that, totally I am a big fan of Jack Black. Po is very lazy, but he has brave. So He defends Tai Lung, saves his village and Master Shifu. My best scene that in the movie, is Po trained Master Shifu with dumplings and the legendary Furious Five fights Tai Lung in the bridge. Po is so cute, and I want to raise Shifu. :D",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"finally,a non-pixar masterpiece!",where do i start from-the cgi wasn't that great but that wasn't supposed to be this film's strength.its secret ingredient(lol)is of course its great lines.generally a movie would contain two or three such lines-this one is overflowing with it.the facial expressions were done marvelously and the voice over was brilliant especially for po.the greatest achievement of this film is that it will be remembered as the best animation film out of the Disney-pixar stable.but the reason i write this review is not for the movie-a lot has been written about it already.i have a question for all-why is it that ladies aged 45+ consistently give the lowest rating for any movie irrespective of the genre or period?most movies in the IMDb list of best movies lose their points because of these old women who for some reason refuse to give top rating points to even the best of movies.god knows what kinda movies these ladies prefer.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece!!!,"This movie blends the philosophies and elements of storytelling from Western and Eastern cultures so well.The animation is gorgeous and stylized, especially in it's use of color and fur texture. The choreography for the fight scenes in this movie is so breathtaking that I watch this movie whenever and wherever the opportunity presents itself, just to relive the action.Despite being a ""Jack Black Movie"", this film's goofiness is charming and has tons of heart, while not being overly loud or crass like most movies of this type. This movie is up there with Shrek 1&2, Madagascar, Megamind, Flushed Away, Over the Hedge, and Mr. Peabody & Sherman as one of the FUNNIEST DreamWorks movies ever. You will laugh out loud at LEAST thrice while watching this movie.This movie is the complete package. Funny, sweet, inspiring, gorgeous, action-packed, and has heartbreaking moments when needed!!

A superb rendering of Asian kung fun culture,"One viewer said dream works has a classic now. Indeed. This movie is really well made, there are four stories in one. Stories are the education of Po the Panda, moral despair of his master (with his heritage and the fight with Tai Long), the combat between furious five and Tai long and the combat of Po with Tai Long. Reference to Asian culture (taoism) is good (the secret is there is no secret - there is no bad news - this is no accident - every day is a gift ...) How come people prefer wall-E to this movie. That's right, in Kung Fu Panda there is not this ""luv is stronger than anything else"" stuff - by the way only Wall-E is chasing the robot. She? doesn't seems to care much, but will fall in luv when he'll become a Heeeerrooooo. At the same time KFP is less bitter and strange. In kung Fu Panda, there is hope and happiness, relation to culture and society. A very very good moment. 10 STARS;",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

If you are in the mood for a film with a great storyline and some very funny jokes (to be honest the panda is just funny every time) go to the movies and buy yourself one ticket to see ""Kung Fu Panda"" because you'll not regret it.

Breathtaking both in humour and in graphical splendour,"I don't think its often you see a movie that can deliver a belly full of laughter as well as moments of poignancy but The Panda film is one of them. It was a joy to sample this film full of sparkling entertainment more because of the refreshing balance that it delivered between adult humour and kids humour than anything else. Detractors and critics will point to the quite complete and singular focus on Jack Black's character and perhaps the jocular mentality towards obesity. However I think it fairly charmless to attack the credibility of an animated adventure comedy on the basis of politically incorrect humour, after all comedy has to live on the border of good taste. As for Jack Black his performance is everything we would expect of an expert comedian - and in particular some awards have to go to the effects team for getting the facial expressions of the creature so accurate and human-like.In short if you enjoy physical comedy, are not afraid or too politically minded to embrace some fat jokes, and you heartily enjoy fully rendered CGI images that swoop, dive, and lift over some awe inspiring scenery then this is the film for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
What seemed like another cool animated movie turned out to be so much more.,"Alright, that sounded like a really corny thing to say... but in all seriousness this was an awesome movie. I like most of those computer animated movies, but this was even cooler still. The movie was hilarious from the start, and kept it up throughout a large part of the movie. But the parts that weren't funny were what sets this movie apart from many others. It didn't rely on cheap laughs and one liners for the whole movie, (and barely at all for that matter) it had some some truly dramatic moments. And the directors knew when the right time was to leave the humour out of those moments. None of the jokes seemed thrown in for cheap laughs. They were all done at the right times and were really funny. It sort of had the feel of some of the Disney movies of the not so distant past, like Aladdin and The Lion King. The movie had me cracking up, and I'm the kind of person who tends not to laugh at much at the cinema, even if I find it funny. So I guess that covers how awesomely funny the movie is.The action sequences were great. It's clear that they weren't just thrown together to look cool, you can tell that a lot of research has gone into the various Kung Fu styles portrayed in the movie. Even if you don't like the movie itself, you should be able to appreciate the art the the fight choreography, which I think is up there with the best I've seen in animation, and definitely among the best in American movies. I liked the fact that all of the characters got a chance to show off their stuff. None of the martial artists really got a bum rap in that department, which was something that could have been a problem for the movie if they had. It's a bit of a shame that we couldn't get a little more history on some of the characters and some more screen time for them outside of the fights, but there was really no time for it in between the awesomeness. So it's not really a complaint, more an idea of what could be worked on, should there be a sequel.I thought the characters were really cool. Po was likable and made a good hero for the story. Shifu was great for the mentor character with personal problems. And of course Tai Lung was a great villain. Basically all the movie really needed. But on top of that you also have the Furious Five, who are all cool in their own ways. The voice acting was really good, and I thought they were all well suited for their roles. My personal favourite was Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, he was awesome. But Jack Black was good as well, and his voice really seemed to match the good hearted Po. I also thought Ian McShane made a great villain. A minor problem I had was with big stars like Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen only having a couple of lines. I have no problem with using celebrity voices, but I feel it sort of defeats the purpose when their character hasn't got enough lines to really identify the voice.No, the plot of the movie was nothing groundbreaking. A pretty standard tale of the rise of a hero. But what it lacked in that department it certainly made up for in style. The animation is fantastic. There were times when I forgot that I was watching an American movie, as it had all the beauty of China within it. You can see the effort that has gone into the animation to capture the Chinese culture, and I feel they were truly successful in doing so. I also loved the attention to detail, for example the fur on the animals and the way they've added in dust rising up from the ground when the characters hit it hard, just stuff like that. Even the 2D animation used in the opening credits was great. So I guess all that's left to say is that it is an awesome movie, and I plan to grab it on DVD when I get the chance, as I would like to watch it again. My little brother saw the movie with me, and he loved it as well. I'm sure this movie will soon become a franchise, and I hope it will be one that I can follow for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Everybody loves Kung Fu Panda,"Kung fu panda. What can i possibly say? This is literally the best animated film anyone in the world could conjure. Since its release i've seen it up to three times and will ensure i see it until I've learned all the lines. Basically, everyone should know the storyline by now. Its about a no good, fat and lazy Panda who by opportunity/destiny is chosen to be the dragon warrior. This is the funniest film you'll see this year. Tropic thunder might edge near but I really doubt it would be as funny. What exactly makes this animation so unique? It borrows basically the same concept as shrek only that it beats it hands down. Its originality really perplexed me, its been long since i""ve seen anything so unique. The graphics were also undoubtedly amazing. I could actually see a little bit of jack black in the panda. His expressions, his movement, everything was so jacky. And finally, the voice! oh my God, Jack really nails it here. I really hope there would be a part 2 to explain some of the unexplained aspects of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great movie that most will enjoy,"I found this movie great. From the very Jack Black style intro that is just great, to the ending that pretends to go clichéd and then doesn't, this is a very good movie. Jack Black suited the role of Po perfectly. The movie is just plain silly at times and then switches to serious, and yet none of the transitions are jarring, they are actually very smooth. The characters in interestingly outlined and you are given quite a few glimpses into the lives and struggles of the others. These glimpses were just enough, any more and there would be information overload, any less and the movie would look half though out. It was very masterfully done.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A Funny, Hearty Christmas treat I've seen","This is another proof Dreamworks made the best of their ""Dream-Works"" creations. Like Up I saw another hearty treat from them when I lounged myself for a marathon last 2009 Christmas. Kung Fu Panda got all the wits, talents, comedy, excitement and a bit of drama materialized into 3d entertainment. (I loved Martial Arts movies), and from the long years I saw them in real action pace I wondered how exhilarating would it be in 3D (I saw enough in 2D). Unthinkably and funnily it materialized through Dreamworks. Their sincerity and wit mixed in the story made it a modern-classic novelty success. I must say the cast are also brilliant (especially Jack Black). Jack Black's humor got well into the character of Po. The rest are humorously awesome. You'll even forget their playing the one! I mean, I didn't realize for a moment that Monkey was Jackie Chan, and Viper was Lucy Liu. Even Dustin Hoffman's voice as far as I remember (well, most recently I was fond of a lot of his old films!) is unrecognizable. One may think the story excites only kids but it caters anyone who finds entertainment open in their heart. I remember watching ""A Bug's Life"". I've seen it in VHS for almost five times and still didn't get tired of its simple but enticing story. Although it may seem thinly inviting in cover, I assure you its action and play is superbly enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still very fun today!,"So I gave it an 8/10 back when it came out but never wrote a review. I just rewatched it as part of my ""Kung Fu Panda marathon"" since number 4 just came out and truth be told if I had seen it today for the first time I might have given it a 7/10 since I have seen many excellent animated movies since 2008. Still, I won't change my rating because I believe back then a lot about it was quite original and refreshing. While the story is nothing groundbreaking, the writing and humor is on point with perfect delivery from the actors. And of course the animation is excellent and doesn't feel dated one bit 16 years later. All in all, still highly recommended today!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Enjoyable, entertaining film for all ages","Kung Fu Panda is an enjoyable and entertaining movie and not overly long at an hour and 30 minutes.Not surprisingly for a film targeted towards children, there is a fair amount of moralising in the form of the triumph of good over bad and persistence in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

He's known for Kung Fu Fighting,"Kung Fu Panda is a film from DreamWorks about Chinese culture. It takes place in China and about the well known Chinese bear the panda. It has the panda named Po obsessed with Kung Fu. He attempts to go into the event to see who's the dragon warrior and he ended up being the dragon warrior, though hardly nobody believed he was dragon warrior material. With that, it does bring in the theme of believing in yourself. You could do something if you simply believe you could do it. That theme and a bit of the cultural content and the PG rating makes it seem like a good film for younger audiences. I believe I have watched the first 3 Kung Fu Panda movies before but it likely been a while, so now I figured to rewatch them and review them with the fourth released earlier this year. I still like this film after rewatching years later.h.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Time for awesomness,I like this movie much. Po (portrayed excellent by Jack Black) is so funny and the orher characters are very good. Oogway is a character with much depth and he is also very strange and Shifu is Borg funny and also have depth. Tai lung is a very good villain and the fighting scenes are very exciting. The furious five are ok. Tigress is good but the rest dosen't add much to the movie outside the fights. I like the relationship betweeen Po and his dad.

So true,"Certainly! Here's an essay on the Industrial Revolution:---### The Industrial Revolution: A Transformative EraThe Industrial Revolution, spanning roughly from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, marked a profound transformation in human society. Originating in Great Britain, it brought about significant changes in agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and technology, reshaping economies and societies across the globe. This essay explores the causes, key developments, and lasting impacts of the Industrial Revolution.#### Causes of the Industrial RevolutionSeveral factors contributed to the onset of the Industrial Revolution. One of the primary catalysts was the Agricultural Revolution, which occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries. Innovations in farming techniques, such as crop rotation and selective breeding, increased food production and efficiency. This surplus allowed for a growing population and reduced the number of people required for agricultural labor, leading many to seek work in emerging industrial centers.Additionally, the availability of natural resources played a crucial role. Great Britain had abundant coal and iron ore, essential for powering machinery and constructing buildings. The nation's stable political environment and a strong naval presence facilitated trade and access to markets, further promoting industrial growth.#### Key DevelopmentsThe Industrial Revolution introduced numerous inventions and technological advancements that revolutionized production. The spinning jenny, invented by James Hargreaves, and the power loom, developed by Edmund Cartwright, transformed the textile industry, enabling faster and more efficient production of cloth. The steam engine, improved by James Watt, powered factories, locomotives, and ships, significantly enhancing transportation and manufacturing capabilities.Transportation infrastructure also saw monumental changes. The development of the railway system allowed for the rapid movement of goods and people, connecting remote regions and fostering economic growth. Canals and improved roads facilitated trade, further integrating markets.#### Social and Economic ImpactsThe Industrial Revolution brought about significant social changes. Urbanization became a defining characteristic of this era, as people flocked to cities in search of jobs. This rapid urban growth often resulted in overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions, leading to public health challenges. Child labor and harsh working conditions were rampant in factories, prompting social reform movements and the eventual establishment of labor laws.Economically, the Industrial Revolution marked a shift from agrarian economies to industrialized ones. It laid the foundation for capitalism, with a focus on production, profit, and competition. The rise of factories changed labor dynamics, fostering a shift toward wage labor and the growth of a working class.#### Lasting EffectsThe Industrial Revolution had far-reaching consequences that continue to shape the modern world. It laid the groundwork for technological innovation and economic growth, influencing subsequent industrial developments across the globe. The principles of mass production and efficiency continue to be central to contemporary manufacturing processes.Moreover, the social changes initiated during this period set the stage for future movements advocating for workers' rights, gender equality, and social justice. The awareness of the negative impacts of industrialization spurred significant reforms in labor laws, public health, and urban planning.#### ConclusionIn conclusion, the Industrial Revolution was a pivotal period in history that transformed not only economies but also societies. The interplay of agricultural advancements, technological innovations, and social changes catalyzed an era of unprecedented growth and development. While it brought about significant progress, it also posed challenges that necessitated reform and adaptation. The legacies of the Industrial Revolution are still evident today, reminding us of the complexities and consequences of rapid industrialization.---If you need any changes or specific details added, feel free to ask!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely Blinded By Awesomeness,"OK maybe I wasn't quite literrally blinded, but it was really good! The incredible animation visuals make this film great fun to watch, it has brilliant vibrant colours and some well constructed comedy moments. I was incredibly impressed with the voice acting in this film and the way the characters look like their voices. Jack Black and Jackie Chan looked like they had taken the form of a panda and a monkey and computerised themselves into the movie.This movie, be warned, doesn't take itself too seriously, as you may have guessed from the title of the movie, Kung Fu Panda. The outcome of the movie makes it appealing for children and adults alike and is the kind of movie that pulls you in and tortures you to keep watching (torture to be used as good not bad). And for what this movie is I am happy to give it 10/10.

There are some great characters as well as amazing storytelling, action, and emotion.Jack Black is a king, and hilarious af, even through just his voice he always gets me. The cast is filled with A listers also. I mean Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, etc. That's a crazy good cast for any film. Let alone an animated children's film. Tai Lung is the best animated villain in cinema. Lmao jk. But he truly is a great villain especially for an animated film like this. He was menacing.Overall, Kung Fu Panda is a great movie. It's got character development, action, emotion, good storytelling and great animation. As well as an amazing ensemble voice cast. Not much not to like.

A big furry piece of excellence,"An old computer programming proverb says: the best written code doesn't need any comments, for it's self-sufficient. The same can be said about movies: the best of them don't need to be reviewed, for they are perfect without any side comments whatsoever.But since IMDb makes you write at least ten lines of text for them to be passed as a review, here i go. I have first watched Kung Fu Panda back in 2008 and instantly fell in love. And every time i got to re-watch it, i kept falling deeper and deeper in love with it. Wall-E may be topical and artistic, but Kung Fu Panda is like a reflection of Po's soul: deep, kind and sincere. And that's exactly what we love animation for: that it turns us into little kids for a short time and helps us believe that there is good and beauty in this world and it's up to us to create and uphold it.A good animation film just sends you this message, a great one allows you to feel it, a brilliant one can make you truly believe in it.

White (and Black) Bears Can't Fight...,"Where does the fascination for Kung-Fu movies come from?My guess is that it relies on three simple levels: first, it's aesthetically appealing and visually gracious for what is still a fighting sport, unlike boxing or say, other martial arts, like Judo, any duel feels like choreography. Secondly, it is over the top in a very spectacular way, and thus explain its exploitation for video games, when the human body became as dangerous and efficient as some robotic armor. Besides, there's something fun in watching Kung-Fu movies, it is comical precisely because of the exaggerated moves and an actor like Jackie Chan based a successful career on turning it into comedy, without mocking the essence of Kung-Fu of course, but rather its applications.Last but not least, there's an inner element of underdog stories in all martial arts, but especially Kung-Fu because it's one of these disciplines where you have the feeling that you can defeat the odds more than in any sports, as most of the learning is in the brains before the brawn, and the cliché of the pint-sized Master, being the sum of all his wisdom and capable to triumph over an army of towering thugs, is inspirational to all the little guys who wished they could master Kung-Fu when it could help them. So, for all its underdog, comedy and spectacular premises, Kung-Fu was a darling for Japanese anime, and I, myself, grew up with a great cartoon called ""School of Kung- Fu"", but these were hand-drawn classic animation that didn't explore the true potentiality of CGI animation, like for video-games.Finally ""Kung Fu Panda"", DreamWorks' animated movie, released in 2008, knew how to handle the sports sub-genre with the perfect mix of special effects and comedy, telling the story of Po, a panda who's designated by an old master (or fool, or both) as the new Dragon Warrior, much to everyone's surprise, including Po. Po is a panda, so obviously, he's a fat, a bit lazy, a bit easygoing, so inevitably hilarious character, and he's voiced by Jack Black, who strikes again after his Lenny in ""A Shark Tale"". But ""Kung Fu Panda"" is much more fun and engaging, there's no pop-culture reference, only Kung-Fu archetypes. We're all used to: initiations, wise masters delivering wise lines with such a quick wit we all feel dumb in comparison, long stairs to mount, super-choreographed fights, but these elements never feel recycled because the story finds a way to be original within the predictability of its plot.Calling it predictable is a bit unfair actually, because there are many original things that strike: Po is a Panda living in a restaurant, his father for some reason, is a duck (James Hong) and there's absolutely no explanation, but his restaurant waiter Job, would serve the story (so to speak) in the most interesting way. Secondly, the panda has no personal pretension to seek any title, he's a fan of martial arts, but would rather watch the show (after triumphing over the stairs) than play the game. But the old turtle Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), tells Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) that he had a vision of the Dragon Warrior, Shifu displays the talents of his Furious Five, a tigress, a mantis, a crane, a monkey and a snake, but despite their talent, Oogway picks Po who accidentally disrupted the show. As he says, there are no accidents.There are no accidents indeed as another vision of the turtle is proved true as he foresaw: the redoubtable Tai Lung escaped from prison to seek a revenge. I wouldn't dare to spoil the backstory of Tai Lung, but along with Shifu, Po and Oogway, he creates a quarter of great characters. Tigress, played by Angelina Jolie, is a close runner-up but I don't know what the fuss is about with the all-star cast of the Furious Five, they always operate as a whole and are not given much dimensionality or depth as the others. If only for the interaction between Shi-fu and Po, the film was worth to watch, despite Seth Rogen or Lucy Liu's efforts. Tigress isn't really exploited to her fullest, and the training part is rather brief, so I think there was a wasted potential, although the final result is still entertaining.So we get a story where the hero doesn't consider himself a hero, nor does his master, but somewhat they're forced to believe in it, until the prophecy fulfills, it's one of these tales that encourage you to believe in your potential and the result would have been dull if it didn't use a clever use of Po's gluttony, and the wisdom of his father. The fight scenes are entertaining and spectacular, as the film had brilliantly explored the potentialities of CGI to make entertaining and spectacular stuff. In fact, it is a little overplayed as it gets closer to the appeal of video games, to the point you never get the feeling the characters can ever die, they defy gravity, they survive explosions or high falls so we're closer to Street Fighter than the real Kung Fu. But let's not make it a reason to dismiss the spectacle the film has to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm amazed this is rated as low as it is.,"How, in the year of our lord 2024, does this movie still have a 7.3?! Despite the weird premise, Kung Fu Panda is one of the funniest, coolest, and most philosophically interesting movies I have ever seen. Despite being released in 2008, the animation still holds up extremely well today, and must have been absolutely mind blowing back then.Every single character is charming and interesting in their own way, with the main dynamic of Po and Shifu developing very well. I loved how despite being the teacher, Shifu had to change his ways too, and learn from teh experience of teaching Po. And then the villain, Tai Lung... he's terrifying, awe inspiring, and has a genuinely heartbreaking backstory. And that's not even touching on Mr. Ping, or the Furious Five, or Grandmaster Oogway. And all of this comes together for some of the coolest, best directed action sequences in all of cinema. I'm not even joking.If you have the time, whether you're a child or an adult, GIVE THIS MOVIE A WATCH. You won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hard Not to Love,"How could you not enjoy Kung Fu Panda? It has some of the best animation I've ever seen, even for a 2008 movie. The comedy is on point, and I genuinely laughed at this more than I do a lot of comedy movies. The story itself is great, with plenty of good lessons and character development. The action is great and there's plenty of it. It's just the full package. While I wouldn't call it top tier storytelling, it's still up there. I've watched it countless times and really don't get bored of it even today.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dreamworks best since Shrek 2,"As well as being the year of superheroes, 2008 was also the year when Hollywood looked at Chinese history and culture. Two big films of that year were The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and the Forbidden Kingdom. Hollywood was looking at the big market China and East Asia offers, and therefore the money making potential. Dreamworks animation is one of the biggest studios in the world and is on a mission to challenge Pixar for dominate. They have made some good films like Shrek, Shrek 2 and Antz. But they have made some real duds over the years, like Shark Tale, Bee Movie and The Road to El Dorado and ended an association with Aardman Animations which did lead to Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Chicken Run. Luckily Kung Fu Panda is a return to form.In an anthropomorphic version of Ancient China, Po (Jack Black) is a young, fat lazy panda who works in his father's restaurant. His father wants Po to take over the restaurant but the Panda has a bigger ambition, he wants to be a kung fu master. Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), the wisest and oldest of all the kung fu masters has a vision that the evil kung fu master Tai Lung (Ian McShane) is about to escape from prison and cause havoc around the valley of peace. A new dragon warrior needs to be chosen to face the snow leopard. What baffles everyone is Po is picked to be the Dragon Warrior, above the Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen) and Snake (Lucy Lu). Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) sets out to make sure that Po quits and a new Dragon Warrior can be picked.Pixar films have a lot of heart and story behind them. The Shrek series sets out to be as entertaining for the adults as well as for children, and are filled pop-culture references. Kung Fu Panda sets out to be child friendly, family entertainment. The humour in is this film is slapstick, but it's good slapstick, and there isn't toilet humour which would be easy for films like this. They are good jokes throughout, mostly physical. There is also very good action scenes throughout, and because the film is animated, and the characters are animals, there is a much wider scope with what can happen. The directors and animation department do an excellent job in this film. The story itself is based on martial arts films, and it works well as a coming of age story. Its sends out a good message for children. They are a few Chinese proverbs during the film.The animation is excellent. It is crisp throughout the action. They are a lot of details with all the character designs, including minor things like spiky fur.There is a good voice cast, but for family films it shouldn't matter who is doing the voices. Children don't care and an adult isn't going to watch a film because it has a big name actor. Saying that Jack Black was perfectly casted as the lead character, and Dustin Hoffman and Michael Clarke Duncan offer good support. Ian McShane is good as always. However, casting big actors as the Furious Five offered nothing. It was the lessen known men, Seth Rogan and David Cross that were the big, particularly Cross who gave Crane a dead-pan nature. Jackie Chan should have been given more.A good family film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Hilarious and entertaining with a simple, meaningful message.","Such an entertaining movie. You can watch it time and time again and still find another hilarious line or part to quote. The animation is well done and character performances are great. Jack Black is hilarious, doing what he does best with sudden, random outbursts and slapstick humor.While the humor and story are spectacular, the reason this movie resonates with me so deeply is the message: 'To make something special you just have to believe it's special'. While simple and maybe cheesy, the way the movie showcases this message is incredible. Taking an out of shape Panda who cannot see his toes and transforming him into the Dragon Warrior. It is the same process as making the Secret Ingredient Soup - taking something ordinary and making it extraordinary by believing it is better that it appears to be. Wonderful message. Highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved the movie,"I loveeeeeeeeeeed this movie, im a big fan of these cartoon movies but i have to say this is one of my best of the best cartoon movies including Finding Nemo , Madagascar, Shrek 1 & 2 etc.... The cast for the cartoon voices was Perfect, u could actually visualize Jack Black as a panda and Dustin Hoffman , Angeline jolie were both very successful too. The story line was perfect with the timing not too slow and not too fast , it keeps u gripped and laughing and sending u real life messages throughout the whole movie. At the end of the movie u feel great somehow with a huge smile on ur face. Panda is character that resembles a lot of how we see ourselves and the other ninja characters resemble how others accept and reject us by our appearance. Definitely a movie for all ages. A 10 plus from me !",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kung Fu Panda was easily among 2008's finest movies. It's still AWESOME!,"Kung Fu Panda didn't seem all that interesting to me leading up to its initial release: I was afraid DreamWorks would squander a potentially intriguing premise by making it into a Shrek-3-esque pop-culturally-dependent fest of references; thankfully the actual movie wasn't a letdown in the slightest. It's funny, action-packed, visually energizing and kick-started a franchise that's still going to this very day thanks to its sequels, TV shows and theme park attractions around the world.Kung Fu Panda proves to be a great showcase for Jack Black's voice-acting skills and that he can be in a story that's equal-parts nonsense and no-nonsense kung-fu wisdom radiating from its central characters. This film is great stuff and is a surprising crowd-pleaser in its broad appeal, laugh-out-loud humor and genuinely well-done action choreography.Kung Fu Panda gets a well-deserved 4.5/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Almost perfectly balanced,"A near perfect balance of deep philosophy & comedy.The Master / disciple relationship between1. Oogway / Randall Duk Kim & Shifu / Dustin Hoffman ( in Oogway's higher state of evolution / serenity & Shifu's impatience in not catching up with his master's level of being evolved & the resulting ' inner peace ' that Shifu craves )2. .... & in turn between Shifu & Po/Jack Black ( With Shifu trying to hang on to Oogways final exhortation to ' believe ' , while convincing Po in turn that he can achieve the impossible ( which Shifu himself opposed before Oogway's departure ) is beautifully etched in the movie .This film is the journey of both Master ( Shifu ) & disciple ( Po ) in their pursuit for perfection - Shifu's pursuit of inner peace and Po's pusuit of Kung fu.James Hong voices Po's loving , fussy , industrious father .All the supporting roles are done well except for the tigress / Anjelina Jolie - a rather dull character who added little to the film , but took up so much space.Jack Black has done a stellar job & Oogway is by far , the most memorable cartoon character I've come across.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This 'Panda-monium' is Music to The Ears!,"In Kung Fu Panda, Jack Black provides the voice of Po, a portly panda who joylessly serves noodles in his father's shop. Po is a self-effacing kung-fu fanatic who daydreams of being a great warrior - in his head; Po destroys thousands of enemies, blinding them with the glare of his awesomeness. His plus-size silliness and an honest-to-goodness love for old school kung-fu set the stage perfectly for everything that follows. He idolizes both the art of kung-fu and legendary local fighters the Furious Five - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross), together proving to be a terrific voice cast. Under the watchful eye of a kung-fu master, a critter named Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), the Five stand by knowing one among them will be chosen as the prophesied Dragon Warrior when the time comes.Soon Shifu's master, the wizened turtle Oogway, declares it's time to choose the new master. But he doesn't select one of the well-prepared Furious Five to protect the Valley of Peace; instead he picks our slovenly, rotund hero instead as the fabled Dragon Warrior. Now afforded an opportunity to demonstrate his worth, Po tries desperately to prove himself to wise old Master Shifu and his new, skeptical dojo-mates. A lot of comic mischief ensues, as Po topples over, bumps into things and sends stuff flying like a fat, furry version of the Chuckle Brothers. The Five, initially seen as spiteful of Po's sudden fame, soon accede to the temple master, while Shifu learns to let go of his past failures and appreciate the wisdom of Oogway.Then something rather wonderful happens, ratcheting the film up to the dizzying heights. In an exhilarating sequence, Tai Lung – the psychotic snow-leopard who wants to get his hands on the Dragon Scroll that will afford him infinite power- escapes by negotiating the three fiendish levels of the jail in a flurry of punches, kicks and gravity-defying leaps that culminate in a magnificent series of vertigo-inducing shots. Everything comes together at the finale, when Po, having learned that his technique is based on his appetite, faces off against Tai Lung.As Po, Jack Black provides goof-ball hyperbole at its 'Jack Blackiest'. With an over-amped bravado and childlike excitement, he creates a memorable slacker who, in spite of himself, still manages to rise to the occasion. He's well-matched by Hoffman, who gives the diminutive Shifu a brooding soul and a sage humor. Co-directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson mix Black's good humor with breathtaking animated action sequences, allowing the film to play out as one heck of a tribute to the martial arts genre. From the devilishly clever sequence where the Furious Five take on Tai Lung on an unraveling rope bridge, to a hugely enjoyable training sequence between Shifu and Po and the final showdown between Po and Tai Lung, directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson take advantage of the limitless possibilities of CGI to bring us action on a scale, and of a type, rarely seen before.At the end, Kung Fu Panda proves to be dazzling, clever entertainment. The adventures of Po earn every smile, every gasp, every eye-popping thrill, and they do it all with a hearty, winking ""Skidoosh!""",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
EPIC.,"Honestly, love this movie. I don't care that it's a kids movie, the story is told so well and even though it came out years ago the graphics and the CGI are still to this day impressive. I remember when it initially came out that I fell in love with the art style and even know probably 9-10 years later I'm extremely impressed. I think Jack Black is hilarious as Poe and really sells the character. His comedic timing mixed with impressive visuals makes this movie a Must-See for children and adults.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"One word.... Kung Fu Panda , enough said","This movie was one of the best animated movies in the world.

And to big it even a bigger hit they had our great actors of our time like Jackie Chan , Angelina Jolie , Lucy Liu , Jack Black and the other amazingly great actors that we've seen before.Dreamworks now actually has a great classic.

A Fun-Filled Martial Arts Adventure with Heart and Humor,"Kung Fu Panda is a 2008 animated film directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson. The movie follows the story of Po, a clumsy and overweight panda who dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master. When he is unexpectedly chosen as the Dragon Warrior to fight against the evil Tai Lung, Po must train with the Furious Five and their master, Shifu, to save their homeland from destruction.The movie is a fun-filled martial arts adventure that combines heart and humor in a way that is entertaining for audiences of all ages. Jack Black delivers a standout performance as Po, bringing the character to life with his trademark wit and charm.The supporting cast is also excellent, with memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu, Angelina Jolie as Tigress, and Jackie Chan as Monkey. The animation is top-notch, with beautiful landscapes and vividly rendered characters that are both expressive and detailed.What sets Kung Fu Panda apart from other animated films is its blend of martial arts action, comedy, and heart. The movie's message about the power of belief in oneself, as well as the importance of family and friendship, is delivered with sincerity and warmth.However, some viewers may find the film's storyline to be formulaic and predictable, with the hero's journey and triumph over evil being a familiar trope in animated films. Additionally, some of the humor may be more appealing to younger viewers, with some of the jokes falling flat for adult audiences.Overall, Kung Fu Panda is a fun-filled martial arts adventure with heart and humor. Its excellent animation, memorable characters, and entertaining action sequences make it a movie that is enjoyable for audiences of all ages. I would give Kung Fu Panda an 8/10 rating and recommend it to anyone looking for a lighthearted and entertaining animated film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I don't get it!,"For the most part all the reviews I have seen are fairly positive, which they should be. What I don't understand is all the people complaining about a ""lack of substance"" and it's the ""same old children's movie"".Isn't that sort of the point here, folks? Children's movies aren't supposed to be groundbreaking, cinematic, deep movies that make you think really, really hard about the meaning. They're supposed to entertain children and their parents. I think this movie does it quite nicely. I just saw this movie with a few friends on a college campus and the crowd ranged from probably 3 to 50 with the majority of the audience in the 18-25 range (it is a college campus after all) and I heard some of the loudest laughs I have ever heard at a movie while watching this. I thought the jokes were very well thought out and the punchlines delivered by the actors very nicely.I think it time for people to stop with their unrealistic expectations of a children's movie. It isn't going to be as deep as you want it to be, because it is meant for a 5-10 year old to understand. The target audience is not a 35 year old who had to drag their kids to the movies, although the jokes are still very funny.Well done to the actors and the graphics people on making a very enjoyable flick!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

While watching it, I can say that I really enjoyed all of them, especially the second and last movie of the series, made me feel deeper emotions. I can watch this series without getting bored, no matter how long it continues. And I still watch it when I'm bored and have fun. All the other characters in the movie are also very nice.

Classic dreamworks,Kung Fu Panda is one of the animated films that defined the late 2000s outside of the Disney supergiant. It has an artistically creative opening that has a style that continues in later scenes. Jack Black is the supreme choice to play a fat panda and he does it. As a character Po is a great one track panda that brings humor to the table through his personality and through physical gags. The lesson of the film is kind of shoved in your face by the end and the characters definitely have very obvious character development. This plays to the target audience though so it is alright. The reason this movie is so great is purely because it is one of the most well-made and pure in nature animated films.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This Fat Panda Kicks Some Ass...,"The latest release from DreamWorks Animation Studios, Kung Fu Panda, is a charming martial arts film that the whole family can enjoy. This film borrows its general premise from a late 70′s kung-fu flick, The Five Deadly Venoms, except here the animals (and their corresponding fighting styles) are not represented by men in masks, the various creatures (panda, monkey, tiger, crane, viper, mantis, etc.) are played by themselves anthropomorphized, of course.The plot of Kung Fu Panda focuses on Po (Jack Black), an obese panda who dreams of being a kung-fu master and not of schlepping away in his father's lowly noodle shop. As fate would have it, the clumsy Po is surprisingly picked to be the next Dragon Warrior who is destined to save his peaceful village from the ferocious Tai Lung (Ian McShane).The plot though is really inconsequential here and the film's central theme of ""believe in yourself and you can accomplish anything"" is standard, kiddie movie fare. What really and truly makes Kung Fu Panda stand out above the rest are its glorious, digital animation techniques and its dizzying fight sequences. The most notable being, in my mind, the battle between the Legendary Warriors: Monkey (Jackie Chan), Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), and Viper (Lucy Liu), and the villain, Tai Lung, on a collapsing rope bridge. This sequence is truly breathtaking on the big screen and I don't think DVD will do it justice. Put simply, it is some of the best fight choreography I've seen in quite some time, digital or real world.My only real gripe with Kung Fu Panda lies in the almost criminal under- usage of some of its stars. While Black, Dustin Hoffman (as Master Shifu), and (especially) McShane shine in their voice acting roles, Jolie, Rogen, Liu, Chan, and Cross are left to die on the vine. Why sign up this big name talent (and pay their big name salaries) if you aren't going to give them anything good to work with? It makes no sense to me but I guess that's why I'm not a big-time, Hollywood dick swinger, right?Kung Fu Panda is fine, family fun that lacks the sly wit and humor of animated classics like, Shrek or Toy Story, but what it lacks in those departments it certainly makes up for in the visual pyrotechnics department. And I think everyone can appreciate some good fireworks on a hot, summer evening, so round up the kidlings and take 'em to see a fat panda and his furry pals kick some serious butt. You won't be disappointed",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie blinded me by pure awesomeness!,"It's funny. This is actually a very simple and also very formulaic animated movie but yet its better and also more enjoyable than the average one.Even though I like the Shrek movies, I also think that they are being overrated and this is perhaps the reason why I didn't watched ""Kung Fu Panda"" any sooner, since it also, like the Shrek movies, got made by DreamWorks Animation and also since I also wasn't too fond of their other animated hit ""Madagascar"". I must say that ""Kung Fu Panda"" is simply a very different movie and its good to see that DreamWorks Animation also try out some new things, despite the already huge success of the Shrek movies.Of course the movie is different with its characters but also definitely with its style and humor as well. I have the feeling this movie was made more to entertain and less to impress. The movie is basically made entertaining for all age categories. There is some slapstick humor for the children and some more subtle humor to enjoy for the adults. The comedy is mostly driven by the movie its characters and the voices behind them. The movie is often more funny in the way the lines are being delivered than by its actual written dialog.The movie is filled with some highly unlikely characters. Of course the premise itself alone already is of course an unlikely one; a panda who loves Kung Fu fighting. Besides that, there is a Kung Fu snake and even a Kung Fu locust, while the rest of the town seems to be inhabited by only bunnies and pigs. It are more small little things like this that makes ""Kung Fu Panda"" a real pleasure- and hilarious movie to watch.It's also a really stylish movie, not just in terms of its looks but also in the way it handles its action. The Kung Fu sequences really feel like Kung Fu fight sequences, although it of course goes over-the-top with it. It provides the movie with some nicely choreographed fight sequences, that are being shot with lots of style. The movie also features the most hilarious slow-motion sequences since the original Pink Panther movies, with Peter Sellers.The movie really benefits from it that its main voice is being provided by Jack Black. He really carries the movie in a great way. No wonder his name is so big on the cover, despite the fact that the movie its other voices are being provided by some much 'bigger' names. It also are some unlikely names perhaps. Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan for instance are not actors who are known for their voice-work and are perhaps also a bit too 'big' normally for jobs like this. You can also wonder though why some actors were picked for this movie. Yeah sure, it's nice that the movie has Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu involved but you can also wonder why, fore they actually add very little to the movie. Most of them also have a quite small role within the movie and Jackie Chan for instance recorded all of his voice-work for the movie in just a couple of hours, on just one day.The story is kept very simple and too be honest, it's also very predictable. The movie really doesn't offer any surprises story-wise and it's a real formulaic one. Of course it also features some messages in it, like basically every animated movie feels the urge to do. Yet the movie works out so fine and entertaining. Hard to say why, the movie really shouldn't work as the way it does. Maybe because it doesn't take itself serious at all and it doesn't pretend to be more than it is. It knows it should purely entertain and not as much impress with clever written side-plots or stunning looking animated sequences. The movie is made as pure entertainment and as entertainment the movie simply does not fall short.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

~Watch this to find your purpose in life*,"So I am writing a review on the trilogy of kung fu panda directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson. I had watched first sequel of it when I was a kid and at that time I laughed a lot because of the actions of the characters in the movie but I rewatched this movie now and now I appreciate this movie because of the life lessons, this movie taught me.It taught me that to find your purpose is to find yourself and who you are
It taught me that we often meet our destiny on the road we avoid.Kung Fu Panda 1 taught me to accept my present
Kung Fu Panda 2 taught me to accept my past
Kung Fu Panda 3 taught me to accept my futureIn the end it taught me to believe in myself, be happy in my present and not to worry about my future.Talking about the quality it has the best action scenes and a lot of suspense and a lot of life lessons with a lot of dramatic background music and motivating scenes. It has become my favourite movie which helped me to find 'inner peace'.I recommend everyone who are reading this review to watch this trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious,"I can never get tired of this film, no matter how many times I watch it. The characters are superbly realised, well-voiced, and engaging throughout. The visuals are stunning, with landscapes, backdrops, and object design superb, and character design which suits the setting whilst also adding a great deal to the characters themselves, while the 2D segments are equally beautiful whilst adding variety to the tone of the story. The story is straightforward, but manages to be dramatic and moving without resorting to melodrama, and is above all enormously entertaining. The humour, too, is pretty simple - juvenile, in many cases - but it never fails to make me laugh. A rollicking good ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very good movie but I was expecting more,"I have heard just praises about the film from everyone and I guess if I would have watched it 5 years beforehand it would have been even better. I am not saying it is a bad movie it is far better than your average American animated movie it has some value to its core the cast is very interesting dialogues are brilliant and the action scenes are awesome the movie could have been a bit longer to flush out the side characters a bit more I felt they were given a short hand and the movie rushed a bit excited for the next instalmentsFAVOURITE CHARACTER :: master Chofu

Best Cartoon Ever!!!!!!!!,"It is a very brief description, but I want just highlight that this cartoon is the best in cinema history. You can watch it for over and over times (as many of my friends and I have already done) and enjoy the nice movie.I believe the previous cartoons never been such a nice one, that you could see it many times (even I know a person over 30 years old that still love the cartoon more than any kids).There are many wise tips (for teens and youth) and many funny stuff in the movie that I believe really seen in the previous cartoons.I believe the only score we can give to this is 10 out of 10!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
My favorite movie,"Every time I see this movie, I learn something new about myself or how to tackle problems, and how important it is to believe in yourself when trying new things in life. ""If you only do what you can, you will never be more than you are,"" says Master Shifu, and that quote alone speaks volumes. Kung Fu Panda is a masterpiece that shows how embracing your inner potential can lead to greatness. Po's journey from self-doubt to becoming the what he was destent to is inspiring, reminding us that the impossible becomes possible when we believe in ourselves.My absolute favorite character is Master Oogway with his relaxed style and wisdom and ability to make others grow as persons without telling them the correct answer but by giving them the tools to develope.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unique and warm-hearted,"In shortit's awesome. Kung Fu Panda is the best CGI-animation movie since The Incredibles. Clever writing, gorgeous animation, fun action, and stellar vocal work by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, and(drumroll please)Jackie Chan! The latter lends a feel of authenticity to this kung-fu themed flick, but you don't have to be a martial arts aficionado to enjoy the ride. Like The Incredibles, this works on multiple levels: kids movie, adult comedy, fantasy, and action movie. Jack Black is immensely likable and Dustin Hoffman charms. There's even some decent morality and philosophy going on. And it'll make you laugh. What more do you want? **** (out of five).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Movie,"The last time animated film that I saw was Ratatouille (great movie). So there has been a while since I've seen one. I'm not a big fan of animated film, but every now and then when there is one that I'm interesting in watching, I go and watch it. In this case, Kung Fu Panda. What caught my attention was the idea of a panda doing kung fu, which I though was pretty hilarious.The story is about a Panda name Po (voice by Jack Black), who is a big fan of kung fu. Sometimes, he dreams fighting bad guys with the legendary Furious Five; Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper, and Monkey. One day, Po's dreams comes true when he is pick to be the Dragon Warrior because the vengeful snow leopard Tai Lung (voice by Ian McShane) breaks lose from prison. Now, he is on the way to confront the dragon warrior. Meanwhile, Po trains with the Furious Five and Master Shifu to save everybody from the evil Tai Lung. There is more to the story, I won't spoil anything.From the beginning, the movie manages to keep the rhythm going until the end. The story was well told and I really liked how they explain the back story of some of the characters. What I also like about the story was that it has Chinese elements to it. It almost felt like I was watching a kung fu movie, but animated.I thought the cast of the movie were the right choices and they all did a great job. Jack Black does the voice of Po, the lazy fat panda. I thought he was hilarious through the entire movie. Justin Hoffman was great as the voice of Master Shifu. He was funny, but serious at the same time. The Furious Five were voiced by Jackie Chan (Monkey), Lucy Liu (Viper), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Seth Rogen (Mantis), and David Cross (Crane). They all were pretty hilarious too.The action and visuals in the movie were amazing. I thought it was a very action-packed animated movie, which I haven't seen in years. I was really amazed by the animation though. It looks very real and it looked I was watching a live action movie.Kung Fu Panda is one of the best animated movies I've seen in years. It was absolutely amazing. It has a great story, cast, action, and the animation was incredible. I can't wait for the next movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best,"Kung Fu Panda is my favourite ever film. The soundtrack in particular is amazing. James Cameron did such an amazing job. I feel like I can identify with Po, growing up and not wanting to cook noodles. I like to do the dance moves in my bedroom and feel its educational on many levels, not just a great cardio workout. My girlfriend and I role play the characters, she's the snake, I'm the praying Mantis, ready to strike. Peace.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Audacious martial arts comedy,"Jack Black, playing completely against type, is an animated panda named Po who's been mistaken for the mystical, world-saving Dragon Warrior. Po's lack of ability - not to mention a recognizable waistline - runs counter to all that Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) teaches, and it doesn't ingratiate him with his idols, the Furious Five, either. This fast-paced comedy adventure is heavier on actual culture than pop-culture references, which is forever to its credit, and the game work by Black and Hoffman aid the rather generic storyline (fat boy must overcome odds to beat skilled ninja) immeasurably.There really is plenty to like about this movie. Let's start with the casting. Jack Black is a formidable, engaging comic personality to begin with, and he infuses Po with such exuberant naiveté and vulnerability that he's just like one of us, if we too were slovenly, belching pandas. Hoffman is also spot on as the wizened and wise Master Shifu, a red panda (although with far less red fur than you'd think), stereotypically tough on his charges but with a heart of gold. Somewhere in there, anyway. Maybe it's just a heart of emerald, or something.Aside from those two marquee names, Ian McShane (of Deadwood) is the nefarious Tai Lung, a former pupil of Shifu who has just broken out of prison, stronger than ever and with revenge on his mind. Considering he's voicing a creature in a PG-rated animated film, McShane's Tai Lung is full of menace and hatred, a vile enemy who's apt to scare the youngest audience members. But I'm sure the adults can handle his intensity, if they look away every now and again.Po has idolized the Furious Five all his life and desperately wants to see who will be selected by Master Oogway, Shifu's master, as the Dragon Warrior. Through an awesomely funny yet contrived circumstances, Po is chosen. ""There are no accidents,"" intones Oogway mystically. Being chosen as the Dragon Warrior doesn't gain Po any favors with Shifu's current students, the famed Furious Five - Crane (David Cross), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Monkey (Jackie Chan), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie), who thought that one of them would be The Chosen One (tm). And so Po must prove himself to the other students and to his master, who just wants him to go away.One debit is that the supporting cast seems to be there for their names. Liu, Chan, Rogen, and Cross, four excellent talents, barely get any lines at all, and although Jolie gets a little more, uh, voice time, she doesn't really bring anything extra to the table. Stunt casting, is how I feel about it. Stunt casting.Even so, I laughed my ass off, despite the wholesome moral of even the littlest person making a difference or something. The point is that Black made me believe in Po. When he's jumping up the side of a cliff to get a sacred scroll, so was I. When Po is eating Master Shifu out of house and home, so was I. And when Po believed in himself, so did I. This movie was full of moments that make me remember exactly why I watch movies in the first place: to laugh and to believe.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
kung fu fanatic,"Kung Fu Panda adopts a different, less zany tone than one might expect from a movie with that title, especially considering that Jack Black has been brought on board to provide the lead voice. While it would be unfair to say that the movie doesn't present its share of comedic moments, the animated production as a whole jettisons non-stop jokiness in favor of something a little more serious. Thus, Kung Fu Panda ends up presenting a message about believing in oneself that might not have come across as successfully had it tended toward outright fatuousness.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Skadoosh!,"Animated films rely heavily on the appeal of the actors voicing the various characters. Get a group of them who could care less about the material and you'll get a quick-to-DVD release (see SHARK TALE). But get a bunch that really gets into it, and you can capture lightning in a bottle. It's happened before. I consider FINDING NEMO and HOODWINKED! to be the prime examples of this type of success. And KUNG FU PANDA now resides in close company with them.Whomever cast Kung Fu Panda deserves some serious recognition. All of the voice characters, without exception, were perfect for their animal type. From Dustin Hoffman's wise Shifu and Angelina Jolies rough Tigress to Jackie Chan (as Monkey), Seth Rogan (as Mantis), Lucy Liu (as Viper) and the unforgettable Jack Black as Po the Kung Fu Panda, every one of them were awesome shining lights of pure ...um ...awesomeness.The story is standard fodder: a nobody Panda (Jack Black) seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a shlepper of noodle dishes. But Po (the Panda) has always been infatuated with the Kung Fu masters. And when a call comes down from on-high that a new master is being chosen, Po rushes to the tower to find out who it might be (will it be Tigress? Or Viper? Or one of the others?). Surprisingly it turns out to be the rotund and out-of-shape Po.Training begins and Po is neither liked nor respected by any of the Kung Fu fighters (yes, the song is in there, too, of course). But once Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) learns how to motivate Po, the training begins in earnest.Problems arise, however, when word spreads that an enemy of the Kung Fu lands has escaped his prison and whomever the new Kung Fu Master might be will have to deal with him.The antics and battles are funny and epic. Using his blubbery size, Po often bounces his way to success, or eats his way into the audience's heart (particularly funny is when he finds a stash of cookies in a high cabinet and does a perfect split in order to reach them and gobble 'em down).It is a telling story that shows us you don't have to be some foxy 007 type in order to succeed. Using your natural abilities often times allows you all the power you'll need. And Jack Black's sloth-like nature was a perfect fit for Po and those who enjoyed Kung Fu Panda.Skadoosh!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brilliant animated movie!,"In China, a lazy fat and lovable Panda named Po (Voiced by Jack Black) is a daydreamer who dreams of being a famous warrior to join the famed Furious Five. Of course it's all pipe-dreams, he works for his unusual Noodle restaurant owning father (Voiced by James Hong) and must make his dad proud for the business. One day, Master Oogway (Voiced by Randull Duk Kim) and Master Shifu (Voiced by Dustin Hoffman) decides to throw in an event to chose who the Dragon Warrior will be, opportunity knocks for Po as accident gets chose by Oogway to be the Dragon Warrior to defeat a powerful and strong escaped convict named TaiLung (Voiced by Ian McShane). However the furious five such as Monkey (Voiced by Jackie Chan), Tigress (Voiced by Angelina Jolie), Mantis (Voiced by Seth Rogen), Crane (Voiced by David Cross) and Viper (Voiced by Lucy Liu) with Shifu all seem to dislike Po as they don't believe he is the true Dragon Warrior but according to Oogway they must train him from fat oaf to savior of the village.Hugely exciting, hilarious and heart-warming animated martial arts comedy from Dreamworks is their greatest CGI animated work since ""Shrek 1 & 2"" and ""Over the Hedge"". This movie is a first time for Dreamworks not to use modern music (except at th end credits) or pop culture references but straight storytelling. There's good timed humor and great animation abound with an imaginative opening sequence and end credits with traditional animation. The music score by Hans Zimmer is very Asian and well done, the film also uses heart to go with it's brains with a secret message of what the secret of truth means.This with ""Wall-E"" are great examples of true animation and storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A legend of awesomeness.,"'Kung Fu Panda (2008)' tells the now timeless tale of an affable, Kung-fu-crazy panda who's thrust into the spotlight, and then forced to face an almost unstoppable foe, when an ancient martial arts master names him the elusive 'Dragon Warrior'. What it does better than nearly all others of its ilk is hit home its incredibly powerful, wonderfully positive message (""there is no secret ingredient"") in a scene that never fails to make me tear up. This profound message - which, for my money, might just be the best ever committed to animation - is paired with a bevy of otherwise marvellous themes to create a holistic, layered experience that's as affecting as it is entertaining. The central dynamic between our protagonist, Po, and his reluctant master, Shifu, is supremely satisfying; it leads to some truly excellent development of both players, marked by their relationship to the secondary characters as well as to each other. Even if the supporting cast generally don't get full arcs like Po and Shifu do, they all feel as rounded and relatable as they need to be. The humbly wise and usually prophetic Oogway represents someone truly at peace with their place in the world, interestingly playing out the classic 'mentor' role for the actual mentor and student of the movie, whereas the charmingly confident and uncompromisingly callous Tai Lung (perhaps the third most developed role and an overall intriguing antagonist) represents someone who cannot accept who they are, which leads to a phenomenal piece of puppeteered performance late-on when he unexpectedly receives an apology instead of his perceived 'reward'. The film is generally quite traditional, with characters who fill archetypal roles and a structure that's known as a fundamental cinematic technique. However, it does this with flair and maintains a firm grasp on its characters and themes throughout. Because of this, it ends up as a very tight and rewarding experience that comes together as neatly as possible and doesn't waste a single scene. It's just so well-written. It also has its roots in Chinese culture and martial arts movies, taking a page from a multitude of books to come up with its own visual and narrative style that's sort of adjacent to 'Wuxia'. This gives it a unique, visually appealing aesthetic when compared to 'western' animation of the era, even if the basics of its movement are consistent with the then (and even now) favoured more 'realistic' approach. The fight sequences are inventive, fast-paced and energetic. They're exaggerated yet grounded, with a focus far more on the fluidity of movement than on the brutality of battle. The complex bridge bout is technically masterful, the emotionally-charged father/son face-off is visually stunning and the sprawling final brawl is gratifying as it is fun. Each action scene is used to push the narrative, or the character development, in some meaningful way and they all look and feel unique, reflecting not only the fighting styles of the combatants but also their personalities. Bringing the latter to life is an excellent voice cast, probably one of the best assembled for an animated affair. However, it would have been nice if the cast had included a few more Asian actors to reflect its setting - adding to the already present Lucy Liu, James Hong, Randall Duk Kim and Jackie Chan. I feel this lack of representation is reflective of the piece's age rather than its intentions, but it's still worth mentioning. It's almost inconceivable that this is made by the same studio as 'Bee Movie (2007)': it's easily one of the best animated movies of the twenty-first century. Along with only, perhaps, 'Shrek (2001)' and 'How To Train Your Dragon (2010)', it totally blows DreamWorks Animations' otherwise relatively stale reputation right out of the water. In fact, I'd even say it gives Pixar a good run for their money. It's highly enjoyable, emotionally affecting and thematically rich. Plus, I haven't even mentioned how funny it can be or the fact that its score is one of the best I've ever heard. It truly is awesome. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Much better than I thought!,"I thought Kung Fu Panda was going to be a good movie, but nothing more than that, though. I have to say, I was in for a real treat! The animation is superb, starting from the stylized dream and credit sequence, to the CGI. But all those special effects weren't window dressing. The storyline is strong, and within it, a good message that you can do anything if you can put your mind (and body) to it when you can!As another reviewer pointed it, it was refreshing to see an animated movie that is pop culture free. It was also a treat to see some more lesser known animal species depicted in Kung Fu Panda, which rarely are seen in animated movies, such as Red Pandas and Snow Leopards.I highly recommend this to someone! I am 27 years old and proof that animated movies aren't just to be enjoyed by children, though I am absolutely certain they will love it just as much.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was totally Fun and Awesome,"The movie was totally comedy and fun with Po. Po was very funny with his belly.

In the scene, when Po tries to get into the Jade Palace and sees who the dragon warrior is, that scene is totally funny.

When, the furious five fights with Tai Lung in a bridge, that fight scene is totally awesome. In the last scene, when Shifu fights with Tai Lung, that scene is totally cool. After that, Po fights with Tai Lung with his belly, that scene is totally funny. When Shifu introduces Po to the training hall and the furious five will be training and Po gets into trouble with the spikes, fire etc., that scene is totally funny. When Shifu trains Po ""Kung Fu"" with food, that scene is totally funny. When Shifu tells Po ""Let us begin"" and that time he fights with the furious five and in the last, he fights with Shifu, that scene is totally funny.

Classic,"""Kung Fu Panda"" is a film that tells the story of a panda named Po, who is a fat, fuzzy creature who works for his father, Mr. Ping, in a noodle shop. The film presents his adventures in beautifully drawn Cinemascope animation, and is suitable for children and younger teens. The story revolves around the panda's journey to become a martial artist, and the film is filled with a variety of creatures who don't seem to notice their differences. The film is available in some IMAX venues and is a must-watch for fans of the panda's adventures. In the Valley of Peace, Po, a pudgy, lives in an ancient temple with countless steps. The people gather to witness the Dragon Warrior's choice to engage Tai Lung in kung-fu combat. Five contenders, the ""Furious Five,"" are selected: Monkey, Tigress, Mantis, Viper, and Crane. Tigress appears to be capable of serious damage, but the others are less impressive. Mantis, particularly, is a top contender. All five have been trained by the wise Shifu, who is portrayed as a more dimensional character. The final selection is made by temple master Oogway, an ancient turtle, who chooses Po, despite his pudginess. The story highlights the challenges faced by the Dragon Warrior in a world where kung-fu combat is a common practice. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is an animated film that features a series of action sequences, with combatants appearing unable to be hurt, even when falling from heights. The film features extended combat with Tai Lung on a suspension bridge, hand-to-hand combat with Po and Tai Lung, and an energetic competition over a single dumpling. Although the story is predictable and Po doesn't overwhelm the audience with his charisma, it's elegantly drawn, action sequences are packed with energy, and it's short enough for older viewers. For kids, the film is a bit of a mess. 'Kung Fu Panda' is a delightfully entertaining film directed by Osbourne and Stevenson, focusing on the main story of Po's struggle with Kung Fu. The film is a sincere effort, with no pretension or clichés. The voice cast includes Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross, and Randall Duk Kim. Jack Black's comic timing is excellent, making Po both endearing and funny. Dustin Hoffman's voicing of Shifu is also excellent. Jackie Chan's lines are a bit lacking, but the music and CGI are good enough. The film is colorful, appealing to the eyes, and funny, making it a winner with both adults and kids. Overall, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a delightful and entertaining film for both adults and kids.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Second best animated feature of the year!!,"The evolution of the martial arts genre has been of particular interest to me lately, as I recently bought a Bruce Lee collection and have been watching a few of his old classics and comparing them to the newer species of movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Shaolin Soccer. I wasn't all that excited about the switch to zero gravity that we saw in Crouching Tiger, but the impact and the sheer style of Shaolin Soccer was completely unexpected and pretty damned amazing. Also, the Shaolin Temple, where Chinese kung-fu originated, is about a 45-minute drive from where I live in central China. I've been there a couple times and the kung-fu shows that they put on are pretty spectacular.With that in mind, I was curious to see how kung-fu would be portrayed in a kid's movie, although I should say that I expected something truly goofy with a title like Kung Fu Panda, but I was surprised and relieved that the movie avoided being a childish kickboxing cartoon. True, it's about a Panda that is so fat that he has trouble getting out of bed in the morning, but in the film as a whole, the childish moments, the sort of over-the-top laughs and cartoonish fat jokes were mainly designed to get laughs and, more importantly, create a charming and likable main character.And it would be foolish to say that the movie doesn't have it's laughs. Jack Black provides the voice of Po, a young Panda entering the last stages of his childhood, where he is beginning to wonder if taking over the tiny noodle shop run by his father Mr. Ping, a stork, is really that future intended for him. They live in the Chinese Valley of Peace under the stately shadow of a temple that towers overhead.The temple is of vast importance, too, not only historically but as the location where the ceremony to choose the Dragon Warrior will be held. Po has fantasies about becoming the Dragon Warrior, fantasies that seem at once ridiculous and inevitable, given the fact that Kung Fu Panda, for all its strengths, is essentially an underdog story. Unfortunately, Po's job is to keep his head out of the clouds and drag a noodle cart up the endless steps to the mountaintop temple and sell them to the people going to watch the ceremony. He is understandably disheartened and disillusioned.Po's central challenge is not just to find a way to enter the ceremony and win the Dragon Warrior title, but first to find a way to tell his father that he is not interested in carrying on the family business, that he has bigger dreams. This is the serious issue that the movie approaches, and it handles it much more seriously and effectively than I would have anticipated. The ceremony itself, on the other hand, is where the movie has fun with itself.You see, there's a battle between five contenders, the winner of whom will be crowned the Dragon Warrior and will then go on to kung-fu fight the much-feared Tai Lung, who has escaped from prison and is on a mad quest to secure dominance over the valley. ""Tai lung,"" by the way, in Mandarin is written like this - 太冷, and it means ""too cold.""Now, the head monk at the temple, a giant turtle named Oogway, is in charge of selecting one of five candidates who is the most qualified to take on Tai Lung and stop him. I missed the part where they explained why they don't just send all of them, but no matter. The whole thing is for fun, you remember. The five candidates are a spider-thin praying mantis about as threatening as a spider-tin praying mantis, a monkey voiced by Jackie Chan, a Tigress (Angelina Jolie), a Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross), although after a series of fortunate events Oogway ends up choosing Po.The kung fu takes place without the constraints of live action, so it's obviously quite different from the traditional kung fu film, even the modern ones that make wide use of special effects, but there is plenty of fighting action and it's pretty impressive. The only drawback is something common to almost all animated movies and cartoons - the characters seem generally impervious to damage, even after suffering falls and hits that should kill them. The little birdies fly around their heads for a minute and the show goes on. Sure, it's for the kids, but it definitely makes the kung-fu a lot less effective.Much of the comedy, however, is derived not from the slapstick fighting but from the that Po is a die-hard kung-fu fan and is suddenly thrown into close proximity with the Furious Five, who are nothing less than idols to him. Jack Black is provided with endless comedic opportunities in voicing a character who is resolutely chasing his dream of becoming the Dragon Warrior, while at the same-time becoming hopelessly tongue-tied and star-struck just by being in the presence of his competitors.The animation isn't anything new, and we've either hit a wall as far as the possibilities of creating realism or there just wasn't any need for this movie to push the computer animation technology any further. I suspect the latter. As we may remember from the disappointing 2000 film Dinosaur, there are times when too much realism can make an animated movie a lot less fun than it should be.Kung Fu Panda deserves the Oscar nomination that it has gotten for Best Animated Feature Film, but it won't win and it shouldn't. It's a charming and fun romp that is short enough that adults will be able to sit through it, but it doesn't carry the depth of meaning that movies like Toy Story or Shrek or this year's WALL-E do. The kids, however, are going to flip for it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good film,"Good film. There were also a number of beautifully-crafted emotional moments throughout. I loved the inspirational talk of Master Oogwei and Po (loved those words of wisdom), the talk of Master Oogwei and Shifu with the peach blossom petals, and of course the touching moment of Po and Shifu after the battle, and even in that small extra scene after the credits. The voice acting was also very good. Jack Black as Po, so natural the comedian, wow. Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, really great. I did not expect it to be him. If was fun to discover after the movie that is was Angelina Jolie who voiced the Tigress, Lucy Liu, the Viper, and Jackie Chan, the Monkey, among others. And even more minor characters like the menacing head of prison security rhino Commander Vachir voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan, all very good.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Super Panda-monium!,"'Kung Fu Panda' is an absolute delight! A comic underdog story that satisfies on pretty much every level, its a film that is not only a riot for kids but a joy for adults as well. Our protagonist is Po - a big, cuddly Panda living with his surrogate father in China & working as a noodle maker/server in the Valley of Peace. This, however, is clearly not where he belongs as the big guy dreams of becoming the ultimate master of kung fu...only he has no plan or physical attributes for the same. Opportunity knocks when Po is picked by the sage-like master of the kung fu temple as the chosen one to face the evil Tai Lung. All manners of hilarity ensue as Po is put through the wringer by his trainer Shifu (the excellent Dustin Hoffman). Featuring an elaborate & spectacular prison-break sequence where the fearsome Tai Lung escapes, 'Kung Fu Panda' consistently regales with stunning artwork & detailing. The colour palette used is striking indeed and every character is imbibed with lifelike ticks and mannerisms. The voice-over work is superb. Jack Black as Po and Ian McShane as Tai Lung are particular stand outs. A family film to be enjoyed & treasured, 'Kung Fu Panda' is no.3 in my hierarchy of animated features - after 'Shrek 2' & 'The Lion King'.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Absolutely terrifying! Edge-of-your seat suspense and a hot, young cast of Pandas!!!","I entered the theater not knowing what to expect, and received a first-rate, terrifying chiller. The pandas gave spectacular performances, and it would be a real shocker if one of them doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. The only problem I had with this film was that the pandas showed an alarmingly large amount of nakedness which is not suitable for young viewers. (Would it have honestly killed Dreamworks to have put some clothes on those things? Anyway, the cinematography is astounding, the directing is crisp, and the pandas made every scene believable as heck. I hope one day in the near future I can meet the fine cast of pandas who delivered such amazing performances. My favorite part was when the main girl panda karate- chopped her mother's head off.

He gets that opportunity thanks to a Red Panda Kung Fu Master named Shifu (played excellently by Dustin Hoffman) who struggles with being at peace with himself and his past failures with teaching and raising former student turned evil Tai Lung (played wonderfully by Ian McShane). Simple story to follow, but executed with so much care and thought.Great voice acting, Great pacing, and great cinematography.

Hits hard,"Kung Fu Panda is one of my favorite animated movies of all time, and one of my favorite movies of all time in general, it is truly brilliant, whoever hasn't seen this movie, make some changes and do yourself a favor.Kung Fu Panda is tied with Mulan and Ratatouille with the funniest animated movie ever, every time I watch this I am riddled with laughter from one of the greatest animated characters ever, Po, a truly inspiring character with some of the greatest character arcs in animation history.And Jack Black is absolutely perfect as him, what an impeccable casting, along with the brilliant Dustin Hoffman and one of the greatest animated villains ever in Tai Lung, a broken man who just wanted what he was promised.And it's also got some of the best animated fights in movie history, with a truly exceptional ending.Kung Fu Panda gets an A+",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
So fun,"Since I was fat during my school years, this animation gave me motivation. Of course, I didn't do kung fu, but I lost a lot of weight by running.

A powerful message of unique attributes accentuated by brilliant animated kung fu,"Many people give animated films flack for being directed at children. DreamWorks movies have historically leaned toward the younger demographic with plenty of fart jokes while still having the occasional adult jokes sprinkled throughout. The problem with discounting the medium on the whole is that there are some things it can do very well. Kung Fu Panda (2008) not only has a great message about playing to our strengths, but it also uses the fact that it's animated to present some extremely well-done kung fu fights.Jack Black brings Kung Fu Panda to life with Po, the kung fu obsessed panda who doesn't fit the physical model needed to practice the martial art. Despite being chosen as the next Dragon Warrior, Po must learn kung fu so he can protect the land from one of the most dangerous practitioners of the fighting style. It's important for kids to see that he struggles with the traditional teaching methods, but he can still achieve success by learning his motivations and playing to the strengths of what makes him unique as a panda.The beauty of an animated film comes down to the amount of control the animators have over what's on the screen. By planning out all the kung fu moves in a series of brilliant battle set pieces, Kung Fu Panda didn't have to rely on actors being able to perform these amazing stunts. Instead, these kung fu fights were only limited by the imagination of the animators. It's a lot of fun seeing these battles take place since the kung fu on display is basically a deadly dance between two skilled individuals. Of course, even with all of its strengths, there are still the handful of fart jokes that bring it down a notch.A powerful message of unique attributes accentuated by brilliant animated kung fu, I give Kung Fu Panda 4.5 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Po is very well introduced in the first few minutes, the development of his path is very exciting and his student-teacher relationship with Master Shifu is spectacular.

The villain is my favorite of this film love that we get to know him more from his origin story from tigress.

Another flawless masterpiece by dreamworks,"A movie about Jack black as a panda who does kung Fu is obviously a silly concept. But when you handle it very seriously with a unique message, that's truly not silly. This is awesomeness at it's very finest. The soundtrack is killer, characters are impactful and every single one, you care about, the story and plot may be silly, but that is what makes this better. And the best part about this movie?

Very Good Movie,"Rating: 8.7
Overall, a very good children's movie as Jack Black's performance, the animation style, and the writing come together to make this film a must-watch for younger audiences.Good to Very Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is very good as they take a simple plot and make the most out of it with its visuals and fighting scenes; the direction on a microscale is very good as this is where a lot of the playful comedy comes out and where Po learns the themes and messages of the movie; the direction of actors is good as a lot of the performances feel elevated as many of the actors tailored their personalities to their characters; the storytelling is pretty formulaic for a children's movie, but it does do a good job in providing some unique, quirky behavior that gives Kung Fu Panda its charm), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Great from Jack Black (It feels like they wrote this character for Jack Black as he uses his personality and charm to create Po), Very Good from Dustin Hoffman (Uses his experience as an actor to show a wide range of emotions, and this plays an important part in Shifu shifting his tone towards Po; Has a good relationship with Jack Black), Pretty Good from Ian McShane (Plays the antagonist well), Very Good from James Hong (Gave the character a lot of life and helped show the father-son dynamic between Mr. Ping and Po, and it also felt like the character was written for him), Pretty Good from Angelina Jolie (Given the biggest role out of the Furious Five, and does well in her scenes by being somewhat distant to Po), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone plays their role well, but it just feels like a lot of their talent is underutilized (especially the remaining members of the Furious Five))), Good to Very Good Story (The concept is very good as it simplifies the hero's journey/chosen one trope to a level children can understand and does a good job at incorporating ancient Chinese culture/wuxia into the subject; the plot structure is laid out well as it does not try to overcomplicate the story (has one simple conflict and uses its short runtime to resolve this); flow between sequences is good as the film does not waste any time with its short runtime (each scene feels necessary and there really could not have been any more time added); character writing is very good for a kids movie as the film does a good job at portraying Po as a multifaceted character that needs to believe in himself to reach his full potential, and the film does a good job at showing how the other characters change their attitude towards Po's journey during the movie), Good to Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue is written for children to enjoy more than adults, but does a good job in trying to push this limit; the humor is pretty quirky and mostly suited for children, but is still pretty good; the symbolism is really prevalent as there are many themes and messages that echo in mature movies about the hero's journey and self-belief; the foreshadowing is pretty standard for a children's and hero's journey movie), Very Good Score (Used well throughout the movie and does a good job in incorporating ancient Chinese themes), Good to Very Good Editing (Really shines in the scenes where they mix animation styles as well as the fighting scenes; a good amount of the cuts felt seamless), Good Sound, Great Animation (Feels polished and groundbreaking for the time, and does a good job at capturing ancient China and large-scale battle sequences that are sprinkled with Kung-Fu), , , , , , Pacing is very good for its short runtime as every scene felt intended and the right length, Climax is executed well as it shows off the film's great animation as well as the culmination of Po's journey, Tone is pretty similar to other children's movies/Dreamworks films (but did have tones that echoed wuxia and ancient China), 'Kung Fu Panda' is the perfect title for this movie (really flows off the tongue and like, yeah, he's the Kung Fu Panda)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
pretty good for kids and dads,"What a relief! A movie that dad can watch with his kid. Thank you thank you thank you. I had 5 hours of bob the builder, and so this was a pleasant relief. The jokes were funny and cute, the dilemmas were touching and sad, and ending was only a little bit corny. The violence was overboard and cartoonish (sort of like bugs bunny back in the day--sure, someone is going to be shot by a shotgun, but no lasting effects if you're the good guy). So, it's okay for the kids, i felt.The only reason I didn't rate this higher? Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu....not that they actually took anything away from this movie, but they sure didn't add anything, either. This movie could have been made with Jack Black as Po, Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, and whoever the next 5 extras in Hollywood as the fierce five. So...while it didn't really take anything away from the movie by having them in there, since it didn't add anything, I figure it was to stoke some stars egos to cast them in a dreamworks movie. For that reason, not a perfect score....",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Splendid Fun for the Whole Family,","Kung Fu Panda is a great movie with a well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. It's very warm family entertainment as we follow a kung fu loving panda who must prove himself as the chosen one. Po is a hilarious protagonist whom you also care for, he is lovable and easy to route for. He stands out as a Dreamworks whose presence is as memorable as Shrek and Alex the Lion, thanks to a great character arch and excellent casting.However, I did find that there is not as much humour aimed at adults here. It is much more childish than the likes of Shrek, which have plenty of great innuendos that are subtle and hilarious for an older audience, which left me a little underwhelmed that it was not present here.The cast is outstanding and suit the personas of their characters perfectly Jack Black was the perfect choice for Po and is joined an all star supporting cast that includes Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan, to name a few.The plot itself is nothing outstanding, but the film shows that all you really need to make an enjoyable animation is a dedicated cast and hilarious dialogue. Funny, innocent and beautifully animated. Kung Fu Panda may not be as memorable as some of Dreamworks previous work, but it is certainly worth the watch if you are looking for a good family film.A panda must prove himself as a worthy associate to kung fu legends the Furious Five.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Plot and animation combined into one sumptuous film,"After watching this film, I was amazed.The first thing that grabbed me when the film started was the animation. It's yet another showcase of Blu-ray technology for those who have it. If you have Blu-ray, don't miss out! What rivals the animation is the plot. It's very tight, and is very fast-paced. It respects the kung fu genre and doesn't make a mockery of it. The humour is fast-paced as well, with oodles of laugh-out-loud moments. It's been a while since I laughed so much watching an animated film.The voice acting is high caliber, with Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman having great chemistry together. The other voice acting is very nice as well, with Angelina Jolie adding gravitas to the proceedings as Master Tigress, and even Jackie Chan cast as Master Monkey just shows the respect that the movie has towards the kung fu genre.This film will be regarded as Dreamworks Animation's first real competition for Pixar Studios. Dare I say it surpasses Pixar's current offering WALL-E based on plot structure alone. How this film rates less than WALL-E is beyond me. Are people that blinded towards the Pixar brand?",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Why Kung Fu Panda is a DreamWorks Masterpiece,"The film is a really good movie overall with the voice actors, the amazing art for the background and entire plot of the movie, for the child viewers, it's probably a funny movie and has good PG-rated humor. (Plot) The Dragon Warrior has to clash against the savage Tai Lung as China's fate hangs in the balance. However, the Dragon Warrior mantle is supposedly mistaken to be bestowed upon an obese panda who is a novice in martial arts. (End) It has some decently good comedy here in the beginning plot aswell as some near the middle and end. The cast is also one of the best additions to this film, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the character, Po, then Jack Black. As well as James Hong who plays Mr. Ping. One of the most memorable characters in the film is Oogway (played by Randall Duk Kim) a wise character yet still kind of cooky editions in some scenes. The action scenes are BY FAR, some of the best parts in the film, some very memorable moments for a 3DCG movie. Kung Fu Panda is one of the most complex movies DreamWorks made animation wise.The camera work, the lightning, audio play just all fits into the movie. Some of the greatest 3DCG in the 2000s era in just 2008 alone it's amazing. Still to this day in 2022 it holds a special place in some viewers hearts for the lovable and memorable characters. It's also more then just a cute ha-ha Jack Black comedy movie, it's a whole Kung Fu movie. I feel that it needs to be noted that it was originally shown as that genre and not a comedy. All of the action set pieces just match. There are no random scenes that aren't needed, every scene just fits and are needed to show memorable moments and educational parts. It REALLY needs to be noted that we're talking about a DreamWorks film from 2008, and it already seems as if we're in 2015 from this film.Overall, Kung Fu Panda is an amazing movie for any and all ages and needs to be reminded that it is a 2008 film and that it's more then just a comedy movie, it's a Kung Fu movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
AMAZING movie,"Kung Fu Panda is probably the only Dreamworks movie I have ever seen that I enjoyed more than Pixar. Its even at the same level of animation- if not higher.There were hardly any flaws in this movie. The animation was beautiful and colorful, every voice was excellent for there rolls, the display of Chinese festivals and history was great, and the music was definitely at par with this year's WALL-E.Jack Black is the perfect panda. He's silly, he's lovable- they couldn't have picked anyone better for the roll. Dustin Hoffman is a GREAT Shifu. All of the furious five (Crane, Viper, Tigress, Mantis, and Monkey) have excellent voicers. My favorite character is going to have to remain at long legged, graceful Crane for now, but the hilariously voiced Mr. Ping is a DEFINETE close second.The only flaw I could cockily pick out (after seeing the movie at least five times) is the plot, which could be improved. The movie is about chubby Po, who's love for Kung Fu is completely disguised while working at his father's Noodle Shop. But then, after pure accident, Po is picked to fight against Tai Lung, the kung fu master that has such a temper he can ruin the valley of peace with a twitch of his pinkie finger. Tai Lung has escaped from jail- and he's COMING. It's up to Po to stop him... Most of the movie was spent showing Po's hilarious training.But what the movie lacked in plot (Don't get me wrong, the plot was EXCELLENT, but its a review so I better get all the cards out on the table) was made up in its characters, great jokes, animation, and pure entertainment.Also, if you've got VERY VERY small kids, you might want to wait until their a little older, depending on how sensitive they are. The awesome, action packed fighting scenes in this movie might be considered frightening for younger viewers.A little side note: Secrets of the Furious Five is awesome, too. Buy the DVD- with all of the features, its definitely worth it! I would recommend it to anyone!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Captivating Animated Family Action Movie,"13 June 2008. The amazing blend of animation, sometimes unfamiliar voices from known actors, and the strong script make for a compelling and surprisingly well-told story-based animated movie. While the animation wasn't as always sharp or realistic as some recent movies, it some ways it made for a better movie as it was told periodically in fantastical, magical ways. Jack Black's character and his on-screen persona was softened with references to Mr. Black's sometimes obnoxious comedic antics while Dustin Hoffman's wise sage role also dampened Mr. Hoffman's sometimes redundant on-screen persona. Mr. Hoffman's character in some ways brought out a finely nuanced, new side of Mr. Hoffman's acting ability and character something that was well captured in one of his previous outstanding roles in Tootsie (1982). As for the rest of the cast, such as Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, they are for the most past unrecognizable as their on-screen personalities and this was well and good for it made the movie have to stand more on its own that depend on their past characters but on their acting abilities to bring to the screen new characters. Only James Hong, a well-known Asian character actor's role was strongly presented, the father of Jack Black's character. Overall, this animated feature blended strong moral lessons along with creative martial art scenes and comedic humor that all came together to make this movie an entertaining, but emotionally sensitive movie. The only important element missing was the edgy, biting realism that today's more contemporary mature audience requires. Eight out of Ten Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Total Awesomeness!!,"I have seen countless trailers for this movie on Nickelodeon when it first came out. I really thought it would be a really stupid movie.I was totally wrong! I watched this movie on-demand and fell in love with it! This was the funniest, greatest, most visually stunning animated movie I have ever seen!! (Other than the always incredible Pixar movies) The movie was just so funny! Jack Black did an amazing job, and he made me laugh the whole time! This movie delivered big laughs all the way through, and balanced it out with some more serious, heart-warming scenes, which were great.The animation was incredible! The landscapes were beautiful, the fight scenes were detailed and exciting, and the characters looked like you could reach into the screen and pet their fur! I loved the slow motion moments.Another thing, the story was really cool and well written! It kinda seemed like a mix of a classic nickelodeon storyline and the storyline for a Japanese cartoon. It was nothing less than entertaining! Don't think its just another Hollywood mess-up full of clichés and fat- jokes. It's a great movie for everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Perfect execution of a subtle concept,"Of course this film is directed toward a child audience, but there is plenty for adults to appreciate.First, the excellent design. Every frame - credits too - is simply gorgeous. Then the casting. Jack Black is The big fat panda. James Hong, Randall Duk Kim, and Ian McShane are likewise irreplaceable. Seth Rogan and David Cross could have exchanged roles, as could Lucy Liu and Angelina Jolie, without significant alteration to the story. The rest of the voice actors - yes, even Hoffman (not quite filling the hole in the world left by Mako Iwamatsu's passing) - could have been anyone. (But that's almost the point!) The action, the visual jokes, the pace - all perfect.But what really gets me is the sustained ironic take on the mono-myth formula. Again and again the implied allusions to the ""foundling prince whose coming was foretold"" are set up only to be shrugged off without explicit acknowledgment. The writers of this film get it: we all know that story - it's in our bones - so there's no need to waste a moment of dialog on it. What keeps it light and alive is the repeated thwarting of our anticipation that the clichés will take over. It never happens; the clichés remain pawns, the butts of jokes.Finally, what makes this film great. This story doesn't merely put a new twist on a timeless tale, it turns the hero myth on its head: the chosen one can be Anyone, even an antihero can become a hero: ""There is no secret ingredient."" What an affirmation for the doubt-fettered children of our over-informed cynical age.PS If you love this film for the same reasons, don't bother with the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Legendary Animated Kung Fu Film,"KUNG FU PANDA (A-): Po is an overweight panda with a passion for kung fu, but he is clumsy and works in a noodle shop with his adopted father. One day, the kung fu school hosts the choosing of a new ""Dragon Warrior"" who will join the current all-star team of kung fu masters, ""The Furious Five,"" and defeat the impending threat of Tai Lung. Much to the surprise of everyone, the head of the kung fu school, Master Oogway, chooses Po. No one is more surprised than Dustin Hoffman's voiced ""Shifu"" who cannot imagine such a figure becoming a warrior. Po, voiced by Jack Black with an childlike innocence and boundless enthusiasm, struggles through training, but eventually him and Shifu make some breakthroughs and Po defeats the villainous Tai Lung before the end. While I don't quite like the, ""Just be confident in yourself"" messaging of the film, I love pretty much everything else about the film. The kung fu setting here is not just a gimmick, this film exudes a love and understanding of what makes the genre so special. The audience gets to experience through Po's eyes the basic joy of the good vs evil kung fu setup, the creative training sequences, cool weapons and moves, the pop philosophies, and the dance-like choreography of its best action sequences. The animators went out of their way here to honor the genre in a beautiful art style, character designs, and thoughtful action sequences that are some of the best in their genre. Po's fantastic, funny, and charming, but it is Dustin Hoffman's Shifu that I think most of the adults watching the film connect with. His arc of going from a strict taskmaster broken from a formerly failed student to someone widening his moral imagination to see someone like Po as worthy of grace, love, and training. This is a kung fu tale worthy of the legends it constantly references.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun film - good for adults and kids!,"This is the new animated film from Dreamworks and I am pleased to say that it is very good! It is so good, in fact, that some (myself included) could consider it better than any of the Shrek films! :-)The main character of this film is a podgy panda called Po, who finds himself, randomly picked, to become the blessed Dragon Warrior of China and fight the evil and very powerful snow leopard Tai Lung. However, Po has a number of problems: He has never practised Kung Fu, he does not at all have the skill and energy and he is way more interested in food. However, the leader of China, an ancient tortoise, believes that this chubby panda can become the dragon warrior. This is going to take a great amount of work, both for Po and for his trainer, Shifu...I like this film because of the stunning CGI, the plot, the characters and the moral of the story: You can be who you want to be if you just believe. ""Kung Fu Panda"" has its frightening and violent fighting scenes, its touching scenes and its funny scenes.I recommend this to anyone who likes fun films and who like pandas - for both adults and children!

I Love Kung Fuuuu...Panda,"Looking at the trailer, there was not a lot of confidence in this film. Outside of Shrek, Dreamworks movies of the time were not know for quality. And Jack Black voicing a panda who learns kung fu, didn't look like the movie that was going to change their reputation. But man, we're they ever wrong. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is Dreamworks best movie, and one of the best animated films of all time.Let's go beat by beat and see how this movie works so well. Starting with the characters, this film has a terrific ensemble cast. They are filled by a cast of big-name stars, and each bring a unique energy to their character. The Furious 5, Po, Po's Dad, Master Shifu and Shen are all great memorable characters that work well off each other.The action takes the appropriate step up for any animated scene. They are able to make each of the action scenes as over the top as possible. The fight scenes are some of the best action scenes in any animated movie ever.The comedy has its fair share of slapstick. Some people may write that humor off as being too low brow or childish. But it is all done with expert timing, creative writing and likable characters to make all of the jokes land.Beyond the animation, voice acting, jokes and action the movie has profound themes and a compelling story. They're lessons that kids need to learn, and they are taught in a manner they are going to remember.""Kung Fu Panda"" packs a punch, and just keeps right on kicking.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful!,"This was a cleverly produced, computer animated film! It had a brilliant concept which is suitable for all ages and be understood in many different ways from all ages. For children, it's fun and cuddly adventure and heroic action and for the mature level; it's deeply spiritual as it deals with one to never abuse one's power, never to stop believing in something, someone or oneself and everything happens for a reason.This film, however, is so powerful as it deals with one's spirits light and dark, the greatest ways of addressing ones' problems, nothing is impossible, people envy one another when they cannot be like him or her; and then, are respected once that task has been fulfilled.

Pudgy Kung Fu Fighting Pandas Rock!,"Pudgy Kung Fu Fighting Pandas Rock! My family and I caught this one on DVD. I say family, but its just my hubbie and I. First off, we are true animated film fans  there are very few  if any  that we have not seen. That said, KFP (Kung Fu Panda) was in the head of the class. This one graduates summa cum laude with movies like Shrek and Monsters, Inc. As a kid, we loved the karate films like: The Karate Kid - Parts 1 thru12 *LOL*, The Last Dragon, and of course, those endless karate film marathons on the television on Sundays. We couldn't wait to try out the latest ""crane technique"" on our brothers or sisters. You remember when. This one had us nostalgic for that same golden era. The artwork was amazing and crisp  you felt that the characters were people with all the human factors that endure. The acting was great and the comedic timing was spot on. We really enjoyed watching this DVD and strongly recommend this for adults and children alike.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Pleasant Surprise,"Kung Fu Panda was released in 2008, and is a very enjoyable children's film. Even though I had seen this film a few times before I watched it yesterday evening, I still found myself laughing out loud. This is not the genre I particularly enjoy watching, but I was still very entertained.A stellar cast, which is led by Jack Black, consisting of Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, David Cross, Seth Rogan, James Hong, and Ian McShane all portraying kung fu fighting animals. Jack Black was the perfect casting choice for the obese yet ambitious panda who was our lead, with his fun voice to say the hilarious and often improvised lines for his character. Dustin Hoffman was also enjoyable, with his growly tone giving voice to the grumpy and masterful martial artist of a red panda. Angelina Jolie was the only weak link in this cast, I'm not a huge fan of her acting in the first place, but for a role as important as hers I felt that her character was very inconsistent with the rest. Thankfully the rest of the cast, with the interesting and fun voices of James Hong and Seth Rogan, was able to distract from her character to result in a hilarious arrangement of characters.Mark Osborne and John Stevenson were the directors of this film, whose work was best seen during the interesting fight scenes. The choreography in these fast, fantastical, and funny fight scenes, was very well thought out and very creative. I was laughing very hard during the martial arts fight scenes with their use of the characters like the quick snake and the fat panda, making it both hilarious and kind of cool. The opening scene I was not too fond of, the way that the directors visualized it was very inconsistent with the rest of the movie, which was likely intentional, but unsuccessfully funny. Also, throughout the whole movie was a very entertaining score co-written by Oscar winner and Oscar Nominee Hans Zimmer and John Powell, respectively, my two personal favorite film composers. Overall, this movie was pieced together very well.Kung Fu Panda was a surprise to me. I have always found that the quality of animated films to be up to par with any other films, with the exception of How To Train Your Dragon and Pixar Studio's films (specifically Wall-E,) is very rare. In comparison to many live-action films this movie falls very far, but as an animated children's movie with the sole intention of making kids, and some adults, laugh, this movie was very good. Kung Fu Panda was nominated for Best Animated Film at the Academy Awards in 2009, but lost to Disney/Pixar's Wall-E.I give this movie a pleasantly surprised 7.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Hell yeah, go Dreamworks","Animation studios should fight out it out like the other ones. Yes, i think this movie does just thatWhat's not to like in this movie? OMG from premise to the end, the movie keeps you engaged like crazy. You knew the Panda was gonna end up a fighter, but you don't know how. Are they gonna the route of Karate Kid, is it gonna end like Rocky but i think both these movies are unsuitable for kids, so how are they gonna succeed?Well, you take the funny route, but then will it just be a slapstick comedy which just passes on scene by scene with no correlation? No, that is where exceptional direction comes to place. And you see that throughout the movie. Everything in this movie is just perfect for kids and surprisingly for adults as wellBut apart from that lot of clichés in the movie.The hero, a underdog who always fantasies Kung fu, Check.The Villain,who wants to take on the underdog, Check.A master who does not trust in the hero, Check.The list could go on and on, but the director pulled off a masterpiece even with all these and that's remarkable. I have never been a fan of Jack Black, i liked him after Tropic Thunder, but the voice of Po in this is just perfect, no one could have done it better, he has the right voice of a innocent wannabe kung-fu champ and a fun panda, perfect casting. Other supporting characters are also done well, the only let down was Jackie Chan, am a big fan of him and would have seen him a bigger role, but i guess his actions are more enjoyable than his talks and hence was given a mellow character, i respect that.Tai Lang is the scariest and perfect villain ever created by any animated movie. In my world, that guy could stand toe-to-toe with any human villains and still kick ass. He is just my favorite and the scenes he is in, just steals the show, the detailing was fantastic, he makes you feel, yes he has got to be the Dragon Warrior, come on, not the Panda, but the back story for not making him is buyable.I have never been so entertained ever since Incredibles and i would say if the movie just had a little bit more Wow moments and better Family ties, i would say its better than incredibles. well that's a personal choice. But all in all a fantastic movie, you will have fun, laugh and made for everyone in the family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I cant describe how surprised I was.,"When this movie came out in 2008, I had no desire to see this film. Even then I was 12 at the time and I just didn't have any interest me. Can you blame me? I mean the movie is about jack black as a Kung Fu fighting panda. However people loved it. It was getting great reviews. I just couldn't rap my head around something like that being good. I gave in and rented it when it came out in the prepubescent days of Redbox. Well my dad rented it :p. Ever since then I've watched this movie at least once a year or more. Great and unbelievably surprisingly movie. The main character Po is funny, kind, and overall great main character. The story is engaging and actually pretty serious. This is an overall comedy but it does well in mixing in dramatic scenes. For a movie called Kung Fu Panda there are some rather serious character arks. The animation is awesome, the characters are awesome, the whole movie is awesome. If I had one problem is that the villain is a little bland. He does have an insanely bad ass opening scene. If you haven't seen this movie, please ignore the fact that the movie is called Kung Fu Panda and see this excellent film for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Kung-Fu Panda is so Awesome!!! Big Action, Big Comedy, Big Adventure, Big Heart & Big Panda.","Chubby, slacker panda Po get chosen as an ancient prophecy, The Dragon Warrior, & must train under the patient guidance of Shifu master. But everyone is unsure if Po is really the right choice as the ""Chosen One"" so Po must prove himself worthy of the title.Kung-fu Panda is simply Awesome, such a fun piece of action comedy entertainment that's full of adventure & the beauty of ancient Chinese/Hong-Kong culture. Comic great, Jack Black is perfect as insecure Po & totally dives into the character & becomes Po. Jack has done so much comedy stuff, films & voice work, so he knows how to do this stuff with his eyes shut lol & yet he makes Po a lovable character that is so enthusiastic about Kung-fu & Food. Po is like a big kid, he has action figures of the furious five, that are his heroes & is in love with Kung-fu action & when he gets picked to be the leader of the group, well his excitement is beyond measure.The voice cast is fantastic with standouts like Dustin Hoffman as master Shifu, he is hilarious & legendary in this role, or atleast his voice is. The humour mainly comes from the crazy relationship of Shifu & Po as they bicker & argue whilst training , the training montage is one of the best scenes in the movie, it looks beautiful. Actually Kung-Fu Panda is definitely one of the best looking movies from the incredible DreamWorks studio. I'm a big fan of DreamWorks as they gave us greats like, Bee Movie, Shrek, Shark Tale, Monsters vs Aliens, Over The Hedge, Madagascar & more, most of which became mega Blockbuster franchises.Kung-Fu Panda boasts brilliant action sequences showcasing it's stunning animation & style, the entire movie is beautifully designed. There's a stacked cast doing great, fun voice work here with the likes of Ian Mcshane as an awesome villain, Seth Rogan, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, James Hong & many more rounding out the awesome Furious Five Warriors & the other supporting characters.This is one of my favourite, & most watched animated movies, along with Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar, Bee Movie & others (that ain't from DreamWorks).A part from gorgeous Cinematography, the scenery & landscapes are stunningly beautiful & a fun music score & some truly incredible martial arts action, there's lots of heart too. There's a sweet story of a nobody becoming a somebody, a chubby loser becoming a deadly warrior, an insecure Panda becoming the confident Dragon Warrior. Po must train to become the legendary Dragon Warrior in order to protect the Valley & it's citizens from an old threat that will soon be Unleashed. Crazy fun ensures.There's lots to enjoy with this fun, fantasy action comedy adventure with a top notch cast for kids & adults to enjoy. I watched this many, many times with my kids so i feel a little connected to it & have a little Nostalgic soft-spot for the film & will always love this first Kung-Fu Panda adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Floppy panda is accidentally chosen to be a kung fu warrior, will he succeed in his pursuit to fulfill his destiny and defeat the villainous Tai Lung?","Kung Fu Panda is an excellent movie filled with fun, action, and good lessons to learn along the way. This movie also has many of our favorite stars including Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, and of course the great Dustin Hoffman. The movie gets a little serious at times but balances it out with humor and the animal characters are guaranteed to delight.The movie conveys the invaluable message of the utter importance of being yourself and believing in yourself and others even if the odds are against you. I love this movie and could watch it a million times and never get sick of it. In my opinion Kung Fu Panda is the best animated film ever made. Definitely ten-star worthy. A must see for any form of living organism; which means you!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's my Favorite Movie now!,"this is, i believe, the best 3d animation i've seen in years! it's very hard to create something like this. the animators must've spent months in rendering and clean-ups. the story's quite good; the comedy is new & refreshing; and the voice acting was right on!- except of course for the voices of jackie and lucy, i didn't heard them that much, they didn't have big roles here.i wish that they don't try to create a part two of this. this is enough i believe. if they try to create another one like this, it would ruin its name and the very essence of it. - like the other movies that had their sequel. (^_^).v.. | that would be very bad, especially for the fans.it's good in the theaters but it's more enjoyable on dvds.three cheers for dreamworks *yey* for delivering us something like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
