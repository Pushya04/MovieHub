A Quality Piece of Hard-Hitting Naturalism,"8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the ""Free World,"" are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"So, rappers CAN be actors...?","I was afraid of this movie. For a long time I feared that one day, Eminem WOULD make a movie - and that movie would suck!!!!Along it came, and you know what? It didn't suck. Man, was I relieved.I have never been able to put a finger on Mr. Mathers' rapping skills, I think his technique is amazing. His rhymes are sharp and intelligent and he always performs them with pure justification. But could he take this to the big screen? He succeeded. In his debut movie he managed to play it real and natural. He had good on screen chemistry with pretty much all the characters, but especially with Brittany Murphy (Uh, gotta love that sex scene... That was hot.)The final battles in the movie, are the absolute climax. If you ever had any doubts about Eminmems talents - one way or the other - you definitely know his worth now!Some might say that it must be easy to play yourself, and it's not a secret that this movie is somewhat autobiographic. But it sure takes guts to put yourself out there like that, well done.So 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The perfect movie for Eminem,"Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith (Eminem) is desperate to be a rapper. It's 1995 Detroit. With the support of his friend David 'Future' Porter (Mekhi Phifer), he aims to overcome his personal problems. His mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger) is a drunk. He leaves his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) when she tells him that she's pregnant. He chokes on a head-to-head rap battle. He has no place to go but to move back into his mother's trailer. His mom's boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon) is a jerk. He has a part-time grimy auto parts job and then he meets Alex (Brittany Murphy).Eminem is basically playing himself and he does a good job. He's surrounded by good actors. The sense of the place is the standout of this movie. The Detroit locations have the proper grittiness. The desperation is palpable. The rap battles are exhilarating. The story is relatively standard with nice touches. This is a matter of the perfect story for the perfect lead. He's not really acting as much as being himself.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Yes!,"Rap is not my cup of tea.
But this movie is very well interpreted and perfectly holds water!",,Anonymous,Music
Huh. Eminem isn't a terrible actor.,"I think the most impressive thing about 8 Mile is that Eminem isn't a terrible actor. Or maybe he's just playing a character so close to himself that he doesn't have to act. The story is predictable, so there's not a lot of tension while watching it. Also, I found myself wondering why these untelevised, unpublicized rap battles were such a big deal for grown adults. Nevertheless, it's a satisfactory underdog story that I'm glad I finally watched.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
this is a movie you can really 'lose yourself' in.,"This movie was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised! I wasn't an Eminem fan going into the movie but I'm certainly one now. Seeing how different things are on the 'other side of the tracks' was a big eye opener for me.  I loved the script, the actors, the music - basically I loved everything all the way down to the lighting.  It's got everything for everyone in it! Comedy, drama, action, fighting, guns, drugs, sex, and of course - Bunny Rabbit. I loved the movie. I laughed so hard I cried at times and then I just flat out cried at others. I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone whether they are an Eminem fan or not. Do be careful trying to get into it though. We had to go to four different movie theaters before my 16-year-old friend could get in. They're checking I.D.'s on this one BIG time. Anyway - go see the movie! You'll love it! I swear on my grave it's the best movie that I've seen in a long time!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good, but nowhere near perfect","8 Mile tells the story of a white kid on the wrong side of the tracks living in Detroit with a dead end job and a trailer park mom.  Deep inside, he aspires to break free from the chains of the reality of his life through the poetry and passion and rawness of rap; the one place he can possibly gain a feeling of purpose and hear his own voice.  Obviously, it's no big secret that this storyline runs very parallel to that of of Eminem's own roots and his own aspirations.  Where fiction and reality collide is blurred and that works for the picture.  First off, I think Curtis Hanson did a great job rebuilding that world and protecting his novice lead.  He understood the material and I was drawn in to the world that he recreated.  Also, the cinematography widely lends itself towards upping the ante of the picture and making you feel the authenticity of a world and a place where many of us have never traveled nor never will.  As for Eminem himself, at first I found him a little stoic, but given the fact that this guy has never acted before, regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, I thought he did a decent job in front of the camera.  Hanson was wise to protect his lead with awesome supporting work from Mekhi Phifer and pretty much everyone else that portrays his friends and peers in the film.  Eminem obviously was a little green and surrounding him with these actors gave the movie and Eminem's journey more credence.  Brittany Murphy was also very good, but I found her character to be a bit expedient.  She definitely was not used to her full potential and I felt that if they had used her relationship with Rabbit to a larger or deeper extent, it only would have lent more to the film. One of the scenes I was most impressed with was the sex scene between Murphy and Eminem.  Gone were the Hollywood antics of glossing it up or ghetto fabulous and I felt that Hanson captured something that was fascinating, uncomfortable and realistic that I haven't seen in a Hollywood film before.Now for what I feel made this movie not rise to the top...  First off, when Kim Basinger first came on the screen and opened her mouth, I thought the rest of the film was going to be destined for failure.  Not only was she weak in the role, she was grossly miscast.  There are so many actresses in that age range that I find it mind boggling that Basinger was used for something in which she stood out like a fish out of water.  The film also almost lost me in the beginning due to the length of the first scene in the bathroom when Eminem is psyching himself up.  The placement of the scene wasn't a problem but it went on way too long - I would have prepared an edited down version.  If you're watching Robert DeNiro for that long looking in a mirror, yes, it'll probably work, but to put that type of pressure on a first timer with no training, especially since it's shortly followed by Basinger's first scene was a risky move and one that I think they could have found a better choice for.  The other thing that kept this film from being a totally strong film for me was the screenplay itself.  I kept finding myself asking why the hell Scott Silver had some of these extraneous scenes in the story.  There was a good story to be told here and a whole world to be explored by the general public that doesn't know that much of it, and the script and film could have and should have been a good 25 minutes shorter and tighter.Anyway, still an intriguing film.  And interesting insight into a different side of life and I commend Eminem for taking the risk.  It's a lot to bite off and half the country is just dying for a chance to decimate him.  If for nothing else, this film is worth the last 5 minutes.  When he was up there battling, I actually started clapping and cheering out loud in the theater - no matter where he stands as an actor, when he's in his domain, he is fantastic, whether you like what he's saying or not.A 7 out of 10 for a movie that was actually worth spending a budget on. Not perfect, but definitely it's own thing with some good moments.  And when they're good, they're really good.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A piece of History of Hip-Hop,"8 mile is the best movie i have ever seen.
the story of this movie is about Eminem life and what he had done for become what he is now. from when everyone bully him to when everyone respected him and his music 
if you count Eminem is not an actor he done very well as a protagonist.
I recommend this movie because Eminem is one of the best artist in the work and who follow him have to see it for understand what he went through when he was younger.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Understanding the Lost Youth of America..,"8 mile is not a rags to riches story, nor does it show how a rapper achieved stardom, its about a man trying to find his voice and himself in a doomed place. Eminem stars in this autobiographical piece & gives a rather fantastic performance. The cinematography brings out Detroit's Dreary & Hopeless ruins & its wasted youth who just want to get away from this place. The supporting cast did a good job & the rap battles at the end were Fire !! But the story isn't that powerful & very contained. The subplots aren't really well developed especially the romantic angle. Still a very fun watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A warm reception for Eminem fans everywhere,"""8 Mile"" is the new film that features controversial rapper Eminem in his first starring role.  The film itself is loosely based on his life growing up in Detroit.  Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr. a.k.a. ""Rabbit"", a young man who is struggling to make things better for himself through ""battles"", which are freestyling rap contests that are usually held at a local nightclub. Rabbit chokes when it is his turn to take the microphone for the first time. His best friend, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the host of these battles and strongly believes Rabbit has potential, but the problem is that Future often makes his decisions before consulting with Rabbit first.  Rabbit's home life is not much better.  He's broke, has no place to live, he's stuck in a dead-end job at a steel mill, and his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) has fooled him into thinking that she is pregnant.  Rabbit's mother (Kim Basinger), is on the verge of being evicted from her home and is slutting around with a man who is about the same age as her son.  Things in Rabbit's life take a turn for the better when he later falls in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring young woman who dreams of becoming a model and moving to New York to start life a new.""8 Mile"" certainly is a moving and very touching drama.  Eminem proves here that he really can act and in fact may have a future in motion pictures. This does not mean we will be hearing him thanking his producer Paul Rosenberg next year at the Oscars, but we can expect to him to receive a lot of praise for future movie roles.  It's quite obvious that some people will not like ""8 Mile"", just because of Eminem's controversial history.  The film also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time.  Eminem's hit single ""Lose Yourself"" really does have a lot emotion put into it.Eminem, since he burst onto the music scene in 1999 with his critically-acclaimed/lambasted album ""The Slim Shady LP"", he has been met with a lot of controversy, as well as praise.  Despite the often humorous content of his songs, there are many dark under tones in them as well.  In my opinion, too much has been made about his lyrics, most of which revolve around topics like homophobia, murder, and his failed relationship with his on/off wife, Kim.  Despite all of this, I think that people have overlooked the fact that he said the only thing that truly matters to him is his daughter, Hailie Jade.  Also, if people believed Eminem really was a homophobic, do you still think he would have agreed to perform ""Stan"" with Elton John?As a longtime fan of Eminem and his music, I try not to let such criticisms get to me, but sometimes you just have to say ""What the hell?  Are they really necessary?""  I don't think so.  The problem is that people today are just too biased when it comes to people like Eminem.  He's not another Vanilla Ice and ""8 Mile"" is not an attempt to cash in on his success like ""Cool As Ice"" was.I have a list of grievances that people need to realize about Eminem:First of all, do not disrespect this man.  I feel that many of the people who hate Eminem have never actually listened to one of his songs.  In my opinion, they have only listened to small clips that have been played on some discussion about his controversial lyrics.  If you actually listened to some of his songs, you'll realize that he is a very distraught young person with a lot to say.Don't watch ""8 Mile"" with a predetermined mindset.  People who have already made up their minds about Eminem's talents are less likely to enjoy themselves much more than people who believe in him.To non-believers, if Eminem really did not have any talent, like so many people seem to think now, how is it that all of his records: ""The Slim Shady LP"", ""The Marshall Mathers LP"", ""Devils Night"" (with group D-12) and ""The Eminem Show"" together have grossed more than $12 million?  I think that it is a clear sign of TRUE TALENT.Also do you believe had Eminem been black and rapping about such ""controversial"" subject matter, that he would be famous like he is now?  No, because most likely no one would dare even produce him.  That said, I'm African-American and I don't care that Eminem is white and is rapping about such things.I think that too many people have made his race too big of an issue. Eminem knows that he is white and will be nothing else.  He does not display to us a ""thuggish"" image that some people think that any rapper should have. Also, he does not rap about the things that some people seem to think is destroying rap music.Eminem does have quite a future in store for him.  I'm sure that we can expect to be seeing a lot more of him later on.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Good movie about struggles in life.,"This is a surprising good movie. It by no means is a great or truly memorable movie but it's a professionally made and good looking movie that is well worth to watch.The story isn't that new or original and the movie is quite formulaic and predictable at moments. Still the movie is perfectly watchable and good thanks to the profession it is made with. The story is told in an interesting way and the movie has some nice build up characters in it. It's mainly thanks to Curtis Hanson his directing and the perfectly dark atmospheric cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto that this movie is better than your average formulaic movie about a wannabe rapper from the wrong side of town.Also Eminem does a great job. Basically he plays himself but it works well for the movie its story. Even in the scene's with other professional actors, such as Kim Basinger who plays his mother, he holds up fine. I think he surprised everyone with his acting performance.Even though the movie has many formulaic moments in it and not many surprises, it still has some well constructed and build up sequences in it. All of the rap-battles in the movie are very enjoyable, especially the one at the ending. No, I'm not really into this type of music but I'm also not a hater of it. I simply enjoyed the rap-battles for the art of it. It's really like fighting each other with words and some of the sentences are just simply brilliant.Everyone that's open for it should be able to enjoy this movie. It's formulaic but made with lots of profession, which truly compensates for this.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Powerful silences,"Those who are saying `8 Mile' shows a vanilla-ed Eminem may have a point: this movie introduces him to a non-rap audience just as `Wild Style' introduced us to hip-hop.  But those who say Eminem is sanitized here for mall viewing have an odd notion of language.  Perhaps his CD's contain more inflammatory material than is aired in this movie, but what gets said here is most definitely not for any suburban grandmothers who aren't stone deaf.It's surprising - admirable, really - how well Curtis Hansen and his crew keep track of the plot from scene to scene when not much of it seems to matter other than Rabbit's problems with his mother, Stephanie Smith -- Kim Basinger.  Bassinger is a blue ribbon southern white trash trailor park mom. You can't help feeling that with minor tweaking she could be the mother of a Grosse Pointe prep school boy, a lady whose problem was overspending instead of imminent eviction from a stinky trailor.  Bassinger makes trashiness look attractive, just as she made movie star decay attractive when Hansen directed her in `L.A. Confidential' six years ago.  Rabbit's problems with girlfriends aren't significant, though he has two of them, an ex and a new one. Both are delicious but primed for rejection.  Rabbit's closest relationships are with his emcee pal `Future' (played by an utterly charming and huggable Mikhi Pfifer) and his slightly retarded token white homie, Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones).But his closest relationship of all is with himself, as is clear from the first scene, where Eminem is doing rap gestures in the competition shed men's room, looking in the mirror, hearing his music in his head --and this is fine, because it's what a young man has to do:  get on friendly working terms with who he is.  The movie is about his going off to be on his own and give up his rowdy playmates to become a winner, and he walks off by himself in the final scene.  The comparison with Shakespeare's Henry IV isn't out of place.  The Shakespearean parallel was used explicitly for Keanu Reeves' character in `My Own Private Idaho' but the theme is really more central here. Eminem isn't a cold personality like Keanu Reeves in Van Sant's movie. He is close to his mates and they're always touching hands and gently hugging each other.  The hands and the hugs are one of the main images that stay with you after seeing `8 Mile.'Eminem as shown in `8 Mile' isn't totally motivated by his anger at all. His anger is very contained.  He seems able to turn it on and off at will and release it only when he needs it --  to trounce rap competition or throw out his mom's sleazy boyfriend.  It's his ability to control his anger that makes both Rabbit and Eminem winners.Eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen.  Paradoxically he projects a powerful inwardness, so that his turning away from everybody makes his face jump out at us.  His effect is of authenticity, because he doesn't put on a reaction to please the audience or suit the scene, but he is always there, moving with the scene and in fact creating it.`8 Mile' isn't just a vehicle for Eminem.  It's too well made a movie to be that.  But without Eminem `8 Mile' wouldn't exist.  The only importance of the rapping contests emceed by `Future' is that first Rabbit shies away from them, and then he enters them and wins them.  You have to wonder how the rapper/actors feel who are in the movie only to be put down by Eminem.`8 Mile' cannot escape from the limitations of the fictionalized star biopic.  There have been dozens of movies about emerging music stars and their families, their early sponsors, their first big breaks, and so on, many of them with more range and specificity of detail than this one. This movie only takes its hero to the moment when he walks away, having shown that he can be a star.  The whole focus is on his personality, and in particular his stillness.  The most important moments are those when Rabbit/Eminem stands with mike in hand, silent, waiting for inspiration to strike.  Even when he choses not to compete and hands the mike back, this moment is full of power.  In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence, raw potential, to a new level of clarity and confidence.This rapper is good just standing there.",,Anonymous,Music
8 Mile,"8 Mile, directed and produced by Curtis Hudson, portrays Marshall ""Eminem"" Mathers' life beautifully, incorporating the hard racial profiling, Em's real life events, while also adding in some believable fabricated scenes. Hudson doesn't come from the same background as Eminem, so you can tell that Hudson & Eminem had a great, trustworthy bond, creating this movie together.Mali Finn didn't cast quiet the all-star cast people would come see, but there was just enough raw emotion & charisma in all of the characters, to really build a great film, driven by the characters.The screenplay by Scott Silver, was very raw, and ghetto natured. The emotional scenes seemed too scripted; Eminem's raps saved the script from being just okay.The music and score all produced by Eminem, winning an Academy Award for Loose Yourself, was well thought out, beyond clever, and memorable. I personally tried to root for the antagonist rhymes, but they were all just inferior.The cinematography by the up and coming Rodrigo Prieto was beautifully lit, with these dreary and dark scenes, to set this dull tone. The art directors in Phillip Messina, Kevin Kavanaugh & Harry E. Otto, shot this in the best location possible, Detroit. All of the scenery was genuine to the feel and look of Detroit.Overall, Curtis Hudson did a very good job adapting his style to be able to put out such a genuine movie, with the great assistance from Eminem.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Film,"Watched this for the first time in 10 years recently. What a great film. A real statement of its time.

"Pretty good semi-autobiographical drama, but could have been better","Being that this is his first big role in a feature film, I was excited to see how well Eminem could act. I'm happy to say that he pulls it off perfectly. I didn't even think about that it was Eminem in the lead role, as he portrays his character perfectly. Even though it's similar to his real personality, it must have been hard for him. The rest of the actors mostly perform well too, actually pretty much everybody except Kim Basinger is completely believable. Unfortunately, she seems a bit out of place in this film, and she didn't portray her character too believably, in my opinion. The plot is interesting and keeps your attention, for the duration of the film. The characters are all believable. The cinematography is excellent; it really makes you feel that you're there, in every single scene, in every battle. Being a rap fan, I really enjoyed the rap music aspect of the film too, though I guess people who aren't into rap will dislike big parts of the film. I also felt that the ex-girlfriend subplot was a bit underdeveloped; it could have been take a bit further. Apart from that, and the acting of Kim Basinger, this couldn't have been much better. I really liked that it wasn't entirely autobiographical, that would have been predictable and probably boring, especially for us fans of Eminem who know his background well. I like what they did with the theme, and where they took the plot. Overall, a pretty good drama that could have been better. I'd recommend this to most fans of dramas, and fans of hip-hop/rap/Eminem. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music

OK Movie with a great sound track,"I saw this at the cinema when released, when I was around 12 years old, being a massive Eminem fan.Just rewatched this movie today - I must say, it has a nice pace to it and flows along nicely.I liked a few of the rapper cameos and the soundtrack is a banger.Eminem's acting is OK, at times questionable.Interesting that talents like Kim Basinger and Michael Shannon signed on for such minuscule roles.Mehki Phifer is great, as always and young Anthony Mackie is another star. His opening rap verse was quite good as well, in my opinion and is often overlooked as it's only short and at the start of the movie.A lot of story goes into such a short, face paced film that's based over a few days.The battles were mind blowing in 2002 but are somewhat cringe by today's standards. My favourite verse is Lottos at the end - his voice, performance and bars are all very hard.This movie holds a great place in my heart with the nostalgia factor - being a massive Eminem fan in the early 2000s but it is quite corny and lacking. I'd encourage people to watch if they like Eminem and/or hip hop but lower your expectations.Ain't no such thing as half way crooks!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Drama,"I don't care for too many dramas, but ""8 mile"" was an excellent movie. Eminem was a better actor than I could have dreamed for him to be. He put on a great show, and kept me interested throughout the entire movie. Mekhi Phifer did an excellent job and is definitely a rising star in Hollywood. Brittany Murphy could have done a better job, but I didn't like her character development at all. It seems that she flip flops around so much that in the end you really don't know which side she truly plays. Kim Basinger did a good job. I don't watch too many of her movies. The last movie I saw of hers' was ""Bless the Child"" and that was a major let down.As for the plot, don't go into the movie thinking that you're going to see the life of Eminem. This is not about Eminem's life. Eminem said it himself in an interview. Mekhi Phifer even said that he didn't want to do the movie because he thought it was about Eminem's life and that Hollywood was just trying to take advantage of a rising star, but this isn't the case. This is just as any other movie, but this is Eminem's acting debut. Even though there are certain things in the movie that relate to Eminem's life (ex. 8 Mile Road,) this is certainly NOT an autobiography.If you go into ""8 mile"" expecting to see an action film with explosions and such then you're in for a let down. ""8 Mile"" is an amazing story about a white wannabe rapper trying to make it in the underground world of rapping. There isn't much action in this at all because it is a DRAMA, not an action.

Dark but interesting,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. I thought it was a departure from the typical movies that star Hip-hop artists nowadays, which typically glorify the hip-hop lifestyle. Which is a very material lifestyle. This movie was pretty dark.I thought Eminem did a good job acting. I mean he's not going to win any Oscars for this role, but he does a very good job acting. If not for who he is, then you wouldn't pay too much attention to his acting because that's how competent he does.As most of you already have heard, this movie was based on Eminem's life, but none of the events are actually factual. His relationship with his mother (Basinger) is much more amiable than it is in real life, or at least how it comes across in his music.Brittany Murphy acts as his love interest, but most importantly his muse.There are some scenes that leave you scratching your head. One of which is the Eminem-Murphy love scene in the plant. It seems out of place and bad for the pacing of the film. Also Taryn Manning's role as the ex-girlfriend is almost unnecessary. The presence of her character is a key plot element that sets up the film, but the appearance of her character in the film by its end seems unnecessary due to the fact that it is underdeveloped. I wonder if there were more scenes involving Manning that were ultimately deleted via editing.Overall I enjoyed the movie. Some may not enjoy it as much, but that's probably because they go into the movie with different expectations. If you're expecting something other than a hip-hop based film that subtly comments on social/economic/racial issues, and is a pseudo-rags to riches story, then you  might be sorely disappointed.",,Anonymous,Music
"Great movie, shows the struggles of a poor man","There's a problem or two that I might have with this movie, main one being that it's too short, but I think it represents so well how the life in the ghetto sucks. It just plain sucks. It sucks being poor, having no education, worrying about what you're gonna eat, or if you can get a minimum wage job, it sucks when you can't rely on family and friends, and when you get assaulted and the cops can't do anything. It shows so many struggles, and the main character just struggles with them and tries to cope... he's not some super badass macho alpha hero, he's just a regular guy who tries to live, just like many other people living in poor areas.I think it needed a little bit more depth, or subliminal messages about staying strong and positive.

Not Only for Rap Fans,"I confess to be the age of rap fans parents, and my musical taste is far from rap. However, this is a surprisingly good movie, that makes justice and throws light on the world of the rappers. There is social content, there is artistic logic and truth, it is a strong documentary and emotional film and story.Much was said about the acting of Eminem - what can I add. If one is an artist, you may be multi-faceted, and this may be the case with Eminem. He is good, and may some day make a career by acting other parts than himself. Overall, I liked the movie, and I am surprised! 8/10 on my personal scale.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not all its cracked up to be.,"So many people have told me that this film is brilliant, that it bridges the gap between rap and poetry, that is has an amazing and compelling story.Well let me start by saying this - a year ago I wouldn't have contemplated watching this film, but in that time I have grown to admire and respect Eminem as a musical artist, the man is a genius at what he does.8 mile does have an interesting story, and I take my hat off to Eminem for his strong performance. The problem I had with the film was this - the rap battles (except for the final one) They were like something seen in the playground at school; I just couldn't take them seriously at all. They just seemed childish and nothing like the cutting edge rapping I had been told was in the film.Not bad, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Convincing and entertaining...,"...though sticking to a certain music-movie formula, and not sticking to the total truth of Eminem- the atmosphere that he must of felt in those days in Detroit's slums is excellently captured by director Curtis Hanson, and the rap scenes are finite, but non-fans of Eminem who see this movie may get the wrong impression about him, and fans and observers of his last three albums (like I) will see that he skewers much of his material.  For instance, the relationships between his mother (Kim Basinger) and pregnant girlfriend are not what Marshall dealt furiously about on his 2nd and 3rd albums.Having said that, I enjoyed 8 Mile, as that it doesn't go for cheap emotions, and Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith's misery and frustrations are projected splendidly by Eminem, since this is basically a version of how he made it- he starts off in a trailer, clothes in a garbage bag and a car that breaks down constantly, but has a gift to come at people at the right times with rhymes.  I even thought (in a sense) that Basinger did a decent job with Rabbit's mother, and she doesn't seem too much like a Hollywood starlet here.Bottom line, fans of Eminem and those who identify with the underground Detroit lifestyle will have a captivating couple of hours with Mr. Shady on screen, and maybe others will too.  However, fans of Hanson should know this isn't his best picture.  Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Music
8 Mile will have potent impact on America's youth.,"It is rare that an established filmmaker and production company create something that young people are able to grasp the complete meaning of. Intellectual jargon or unnecessary vagueness of plot often take precedence over lucidity and appeal.Eminem's ""8 Mile"" has managed to break this cycle, presenting in poignant audio/video style the nature of the life so many of our nation's youth live, and how despite it all there always remains the possibility to break through.The film's meaning is largely overt, not subtle, and makes itself available to a much wider variety of viewers than most films with any sort of dramatic moral.  Just look at the box office reports for ""8 Mile""s opening weekend.I won't attempt to speculate on the effect the film will have among our youth, but I personally believe it will be positive in nature.  It will be impossible for this film to become as transient as an action blockbuster or as esoteric as a cult classic.  It's depth and range of appeal are simply unparalleled in our time.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Amazing movie,"Everyone somewhat has an hip-hop culture is like: drugs, money, and rapping. However, 8 mile goes way more in depth than that. It shows the real struggles that the main character, Jimmy goes through not only to be respected as a white rapper but just to support himself. It shows not only the physical but mental barriers that he has to go through to achieve his goals. It doesn't only focus on the struggles he faces while rapping but the struggles he faces daily at work and at home.
This movie focuses on Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) as he struggles to try and achieve his dream while dealing with problems at home and work. He had to move back home with his alcoholic mom, her new boyfriend, and his little sister, Lily, he doesn't have a car because he gave it to his ex girlfriend, and he has a bad job at a stamping plant. To make matters worse, his dream, to become a rapper, seems nearly impossible. He has skills but nobody will even listen to him because he's white and nobody around him thinks he can rap except for his friends. Throughout the movie, Jimmy has to take care of problems at home and work while trying to gain respect in the hip-hop community in Detroit.
8 mile is something different. Unlike most movies about celebrities' lives, (even though this movie is loosely based on Eminem's life) this movie doesn't focus on the person becoming famous, it focuses on the struggles it takes to be recognized even on a very small scale. Given the cast and premise, you'd probably expect 8 Mile to be an over-exaggerated version of hip-hop culture or a movie just showing how great Eminem is. However, this movie is neither of those things. It's not even about Eminem, although it does loosely follow his life. There's also the fact that this movie does a great job of realistically portraying hip-hop culture. The cinematography is perfect, it's mainly shot in Detroit and has lots of nitty gritty shots that fit the whole, almost gray tone of the majority of the movie, going well with the natural, realistic feeling the movie has.
Of course, like every movie, it has its flaws, but 8 Mile definitely doesn't have many. The grayness and bleakness can be a little overshadowing and the ""villians"" in the movie, the ""Free World"" are perhaps a little over exaggerated but the solid acting makes up for it.
Not to mention, probably my favorite part, 8 Mile has rapping, lots of it. Obviously, this is a main plot of the film but it's integrated in a way that it fits in with the rest of the film. The rapping is so amazingly done, the way the actors deliver their lines makes it feel like it's not scripted and they are real people actually trying to win the rap battles. The best part is with Eminem's character and how they integrated just the character, not him into the it, the rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper. Also, it's always great to watch someone just get totally roasted which happens constantly throughout the movie, not just to other character's but to Jimmy (Eminem) as well. It's also a plus that Eminem does a great job portraying Jimmy Smith throughout the film. In no doubt because he resembles that character.
All in all, 8 Mile is a great movie. Sure, sometimes it's a little bleak but the great acting and real- life feeling of the film more than make up for it. I'd recommend this movie if you like the Rocky movies, or if you've watched and enjoyed movies like Straight Outta Compton, Notorious, All Eyez on Me and if you're a fan of hip-hop. Although, I would really recommend this movie for anyone who wants to watch just a good movie, I think anyone would enjoy this movie, it's that great.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Eminem's big movie debut,"Eminem proves he is an outstanding actor and makes the story unquestionable.B. Rabbit is a no one with plenty of ambition as well as his vocabulary intact, but when you're growing up on 8 mile it's not easy becoming anything, less alone a white rapper. He can't even bring himself to challenge the local rappers on stage during the weekends. In the middle of him trying to land his breakthrough he finds himself fond of the ambitious, but ditsy Alex (Brittany Murphy), but she turns out to be bad news for him. Will he stand the challenge of the Free Worlds Gangsta Boys? It's a good storyline (nothing new, but you haven't seen it 10 times before either). Brittany Murphy disappoints in this movie if you've liked her previous movies. This is Eminem's acting debut, but not his autobiography.

"A cliched, boring, predictable movie, with absolutely no surprises.","The main problem with the hype surrounding this movie is that it misleads you into thinking that what you are seeing is something original, something that has not been done a thousand times before. It promises us that the film will be frighteningly realistic and distrubing, with performances so honest, because much of it is Eminem's so-called life story.What this movie really is is nothing but a movie you have seen one hundred times before, the only difference is that the characters names have been changed! One mans struggle to beat his tough suburban upbringing, rise above the oppression and make a name for himself?!?! Please, how hackneyed can you get? At least 2pac did a good job of playing the very same role!The ending is so predictable you just wait there bored, waiting for it to eventually get there, and hoping that just maybe the film will surprise you along the way. It never does. This film is an embarrassment to film making!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Ok, I need to say something.","I was moving around IMDB just now trying to sort of fill in the blanks of some random credits that I'd missed in my movie catalog, and I ran across this review of 8 Mile from this college student in NYC. Now, I never really write reviews because everyone's opinions vary distinctly and it seems kind of pointless to try to show them the ""magic"" of a certain movie if they refuse to see it, or to tell them how horrible it was as though I think that I'm really that much better of a director, writer, or whatever. But after reading such lines as ""if you liked this film, you know nothing about film"" and so on, I simply couldn't contain myself.First off, let me start by saying that I in no way respect Eminem as an artist. I personally despise rap and the ""culture"" that it creates in society full of pumped up punks trying to act tough or ""hard"", as they struggle in a societal structure that they perpetrate upon themselves. In fewer words: I hate listening to constant bitching and dated slogans about bitches and benjamins. And after hearing about Eminem's wife-beating and all around socially retarded mentality, I wanted less to do with 8 Mile on the probability that he may be receiving a percentage of the ticket sales. But, after a time, I ended up renting it at Blockbuster for the hell of it, at least to give it a chance. I popped it in, and I was all set and ready to hate every minute of it... but ended up sitting through a movie that actually left me with a smile on my face.For those who've not yet seen the film, I'll give some background of the story. Eminem plays Rabbit, a struggling Detroit freestyle rapper trying desperately to make a name for himself in the bustling Detroit underground music scene. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother, miserable and bitter of where her life has ended up (in a trailer park, barely able to make rent or take care of herself). Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's best ally and, in some ways, his father figure; playing the role of the protective, guidance providing, loving role-model. Conflict stirs in Rabbit's life as, through his bouts with stage fright and homelessness, he begins to question his ability to make it in the world of music as he wishes to; nearly becoming content to simply abide life as he knows it. But through his experiences and how he works through his own personal problems, he starts to see his path better and more clearly.Now, I grew up in a very small town. A farming community in the middle of nowhere, where my nearest neighbors where half a mile away. I hated every minute that I was there and felt trapped in a world there that I didn't feel welcome in or a part of. Aspiring to become a filmmaker when everyone tells you you're an idiot for even thinking of it isn't easy. Which is probably why I related so much with this film. Rabbit's own experiences as well as his mother's criticism of him and his life make him feel trapped within his station of life, feeling as though his own specific voice isn't being heard, and trying desperately to change that. Anyone who doesn't recognize this is someone that I would generally think was lucky enough to not be born into this type of community structure with ideals that conflicted with the generally accepted norm; as it's thoroughly developed throughout the story. And the story... the story develops nicely over time. It never feels rushed or thrown together hastily just to make a movie with the star power of Eminem. That COULD have happened, and it COULD have made a lot of money for everyone involved. Instead, a director was chosen who understands pacing of a story, importance of cinematic elements throughout a story (i.e.: not just putting actors on screen to say their lines and that's it), and who just understands the elements of how to tell a good story on film. They even gathered a supporting cast of actual actors who've proven themselves as true artists within their craft in the past, and didn't just hand off the part to one of the executive producer's nieces or nephews or whatever. Scott Silver's loose adaptation of the life of Eminem was tweaked just enough to skew from Eminem's specific life, and become more universal in it's ability to portray a struggle that millions of artists go through around the world. All of these elements, along with my surprise at the actual acting ability of Eminem, combine to tell a story that feels deeply personal while very universal, and can be related to by more people than simply myself. It tells a story of never settling for what you can get just because it's easier, and that hard work and dedication are the only ways to dig your way out of a perpetual cycle that you may find yourself a part of.To close, this is by no means the best movie that I've ever seen. Not even close. But that doesn't mean that it's not a prime example of filmmaking at it's best. A movie doesn't have to be the best thing since disco in order to be any good... it simply has to have a purpose and a message, and portray those with clarity and honesty; which this movie accomplishes in spades.See this movie.",,Anonymous,Music
A rap version of the American Dream,"8 Mile is a sort of autobiographical movie, showing Jimmy (a version of Eminem), a rapper trying to make it big despite everything working against him. He broke up with his girlfriend and gave her his car, meaning he now has to live with his mother who is about to lose her trailer home, not to mention he must tolerate her horrible boyfriend. He has an unambitious, unsatisfactory dead-end job and he must face prejudice and the race barrier in order to become a rapper.The plot is somewhat predictable and follows a well-known formula. The movie's greatest success is its deconstruction of the American Dream. It creates a realistic, gritty world where young people are trapped and any attempt to escape seems hopeless. Its social commentary is more valuable than its underdog that defies the odds story.The movie still manages to be quite funny, both during the rap battles but also when Jimmy hangs out with his friends. The dialogue and the chemistry between them makes the viewer feels as if he is one of them.His girlfriend didn't add much, if anything she felt rather odd. Jimmy's relationship with his mother was much more interesting, though wasn't really developed as much as it could.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing movie. period.,"I am probably one of the biggest Eminem fans walking this earth, so automatically I'm going to love this movie. But in reality, I do really love this movie, even if Eminem wasn't the main actor. It really is able to portray the life of those less fortunate than most, looking to get to their dream.Of course right away most think this movie is about Eminem's life but it truly isn't. There are tiny little facts that can relate to him (having 4 guys that are always there for him, and one main one...which would be D12 and Proof being his best friend) but the movie isn't about his life. If it were, then he definitely wouldn't be on good terms with his mother in the movie and the little girl would be his actual daughter.Eminem does an excellent acting job, along with Mekhi.

Eminem raps his Way into the Hollywood Spotlight,"It doesn't matter whether you listen to rap a lot and are an Eminem fan or heard of his music occasionally on the radio, ""8 mile"" does an exceptional job at captivating the audience to the point that by the end of the movie, you are rooting for ""Rabbit"" - the nickname for eminem used in the film - to win and succeed. ""8 mile"" is about the backstory of a famous rapper at the time of its release in 2002, Eminem starring as himself in the movie. The story takes place in 1995 in Eminem's hometown of Detroit, which adds credibility and a realisticness to the story line.He grows up in a poor neighborhood ""across 8 mile road"", a road which is mentioned many times throughout the film and very strategically. 8 mile road is used as a symbol in the film of the barrier the poor ""white trash"" lifestyle ""Bunny Rabbit"" is living in during most of the film to the rich and famous lifestyle full of power and clout that ""Eminem"" reaches after the film, and aspires to reach during the movie.The filmmakers did an excellent job making this story line based off the life of Eminem seem to be real. Even though it is not 100% an accurate documentary like some of the rapper themed movies that were coming out at the time, ""Biggie and Tupac""(2002) or ""Rhyme and Reason""(1997), it still displays similar emotional aspects to what you would think he may have gone through. Convincing the viewer of this realistic storyline creates some extra emotional attachment to Eminem (Rabbit) making it all the more intriguing even for those not interested in rap or not familiar with Eminem and his backstory.This rebelliousness you see in ""8 mile"" is a common theme in many films especially those coming out around this time. The style of the movie was also somewhat basic. The classic underdog movie where in this case a poor person grows up under harsh conditions and finds a way to get success and achieve his dreams is not as creative as it could be and is very common historically in films such as the ""Rocky"" series or ""Karate Kid"". This lack of creativity makes the film very predictable as you are never during the film left wondering whether or not Eminem will win the final rap battle or get the respect he aspires because it is blatantly obvious he will. Besides the basic aspects of the film it still does a great job portraying the life of a unique and obscure character in Eminem.Another thing that the movie does well is its use of subtle yet specific camera angles. Towards the beginning of the movie, Eminem's first rap battle is displayed with a close up of his face for an extended period of time looking very nervous and still, while towards the final scene of him rapping in front of the crowd they specifically chose a low angle shot of Eminem looking down on the crowd and at his opponent as well conveying his power and confidence in that scene. This does a good job of showing how Eminem's character has grown from his mistakes and gained more confidence. *Once again a common theme but still a strong one*.The editing in the film is minimal and not noticeable. The soundtrack is great and is well placed in scenes creating an uplifting and badass emotion while watching Eminem embark his journey into the spotlight.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""8 Mile"" Review: Eminem's Gritty Journey into Detroit's Hip-Hop Scene","""8 Mile,"" directed by Curtis Hanson, delves into the gritty, raw world of Detroit's underground hip-hop scene, showcasing Eminem in a semi-autobiographical role that highlights his rise to fame against the backdrop of poverty, adversity, and personal struggles.Set in the early 2000s, the film follows Jimmy Smith Jr. (played by Eminem), a struggling young rapper known as ""B-Rabbit,"" as he navigates the challenges of urban life in Detroit. The narrative unfolds against a bleak industrial landscape, capturing the socioeconomic hardships faced by Jimmy and his friends, who are trapped in dead-end jobs and dilapidated neighborhoods.Eminem's portrayal is raw and authentic, reflecting his own experiences growing up in Detroit. His performance captures the frustration, determination, and vulnerability of a young man striving to break free from his circumstances through his passion for rap music. The battle rap scenes, in particular, are intense and electrifying, showcasing Eminem's lyrical prowess and the competitive spirit of the underground rap battles.The supporting cast, including Brittany Murphy as Jimmy's love interest and Kim Basinger as his troubled mother, adds depth to the narrative, portraying characters grappling with their own demons and dreams. The chemistry between Eminem and Murphy is palpable, adding a poignant layer to Jimmy's journey of self-discovery and redemption.Director Curtis Hanson masterfully captures the essence of Detroit's urban culture, infusing the film with a gritty realism that immerses viewers in Jimmy's world. The cinematography captures the stark contrasts of the cityscape, from abandoned factories to vibrant underground clubs, enhancing the film's atmosphere and authenticity.The soundtrack, featuring Eminem's iconic songs like ""Lose Yourself,"" serves as a powerful narrative tool, underscoring Jimmy's emotional journey and the pulse-pounding intensity of the rap battles. The music becomes a driving force in the film, echoing Jimmy's struggle for self-expression and recognition in a cutthroat industry.While ""8 Mile"" primarily focuses on Jimmy's pursuit of success as a rapper, it also explores broader themes of identity, class struggle, and the pursuit of the American Dream. The film resonates with audiences not only for its compelling narrative and electrifying performances but also for its exploration of universal themes that transcend the hip-hop genre.Overall, ""8 Mile"" is a poignant and captivating film that showcases Eminem's talent as both a musician and actor. It's a gritty, authentic portrayal of urban life and the pursuit of dreams, leaving a lasting impression with its powerful storytelling and compelling characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Good, but Nothing Special","I was part of the very first audience in the world to see the final cut of 8 Mile. Universal Pictures and MTV held a special screening over here at Michigan State University last week, and the events of the night will be aired on MTV's Jammed, mostly because of the post-screening concert that Eminem held. But I digress...The film itself is decent, but nothing special. The storyline is good, but it can get to be slow at times. The writing was good, but nothing really spectacular comes out of any of the characters mouths except for when they are freestyling. The acting was good, but it certainly won't win any awards. Eminem himself had relatively few lines, making it difficult to judge, which makes me curious if the producers were still worried about his acting ability. Kim Basinger for some reason tried to somewhat glamourize her role. The real insanity of his mom didn't come across as well it should have. Britney Murphy and Mekhi Phifer probably delivered the best performances, although neither actor is used to the best of their ability.Growing up in the metro-Detroit area myself, it was nice to see that they actually filmed the movie in the city and surrounding areas, unlike last year's Exit Wounds which obviously wasn't shot anywhere near the city. Eminem's trailer park was in Warren for example, not Detroit. For people who don't know the Detroit area though, there is going to be some confusion while watching the movie. Especially when the characters make references to Cranbrook, and the various area codes in the region.Like I said earlier, the movie is good, and there are no serious flaws with it, but it simply lacks that something special. Go see it if you're an Eminem fan. Go see it if you're from Detroit, if only to see Detroit on the big screen. It might be your only chance, even though it paints a bad picture of the city. If you don't fall into one of those two categories, I'd wait until it comes to video if you really want to see it, because the film really doesn't have a whole lot to offer to you.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Life is a dumpster,"Well, Eminem looked in the dumpster that sits malodorously behind some trailer park and said, ""Yo, here's the makings of a movie like on my life, yo!""  So they took the rotting, dripping remnants of a bunch of real movies, added a past-its-date movie star (Kim Basinger), and, knowing a huge audience pre-existed for any Eminem offering, voila!I happen to be an Eminem music fan, but his first acting effort is flawed by a few things, some may be beyond his control:  The relentlessly depressing and muddled story of the existence of the main character, an actual lack of good rap,  a lack of any sympathetic character the viewer can care about, and direction that one can almost hear as ""now give us (him/her/it/them/me) a long angry glare, Marshall"".The parts they found to put this mess together were ripped from the rotting corpses of, ""Permanent Record"", ""Rocky"", ""Bye, Bye, Birdie"", ""West Side Story"", ""Flashdance"", ""Karate Kid"", ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Sling Blade"", ""Footloose"" ""The Champ"", etc.Despite all this, Mathers does show some potential as an actor.  With some training, practice, and a good director he may actually be able to turn in a decent performance.  He's a talented guy, once he gets his hand away from his groin.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a great story  but has good moments and a good central performance,"Jimmy Rabbit is a white kid on the poor (black) side of town.  Growing up with this influence he has developed rapping skills but is too intimidated to showcase in the cruel `Shelter' battles.  Split from his girlfriend, Jimmy returns to his Mum's trailer park home and her young boyfriend.  He keeps his job in a pressing shop while working on his rhymes and trying to work out who, out of all the hopes and promises, will be able to help him work his way out of Detroit.After missing preview screenings and not being able to go when friends went, I eventually saw this a few nights ago.  I was maybe better prepared by this point because the hype had been watered down by a few bad or balanced reviews of the film in the media.  This helped me lower my expectations so that I wasn't let down.  The plot is, well, difficult to describe because there isn't really one narrative to speak of, rather it is Rabbit's story. As a result it is a little rambling with things just drifting through the film.  However that it still works is to it's credit.  The film holds the attention and the story still has enough in it to follow it.The telling is what does it the best I think.  The direction is good, with washed out cameras not willing to glamorise anything.  The biggest smart move was the liberal use of hip-hop through the film.  Occasionally we get a beat of a song but it isn't wall to wall music like many rapper's films. Even where a Eminem track is played, Em's voice is limited to a few broken up words  saving his skills for the climax.  Some of the film doesn't work  I got tired of several rap scenes in everyday situations and it didn't grasp me as reality (although in fairness I don't know if this is the norm in some lives).  Also there are a few too many scenes of meaningless violence that didn't come across as normal life for Rabbit but instead felt like the film trying to show Rabbit to be tough and ready for action.It is difficult to write a fair review after seeing the climax  which his why I left it a few days before writing this.  The climax is a series of short battles in the Shelter that are pumping and exciting.  Not to spoil it but some of the rapper's lines are cool  until Em takes his turns and rips the place down.  It was so funny and funky that I wished that he had made some of his own joints that sharp in his recent Benzino disses.  This is where he shines in the role but he also does well generally  maybe not worthy of an Oscar nomination but certainly very good.  He makes his character likeable but not easily, and he avoids being a sympathy figure.Phieffer is not as good and didn't convince me as well as I've seen him do. He can act but here he is not really a good character.  The support cast are all pretty good and are believable and only a few are clear stereotypical groups.  Happily the usual rapper cameos are minimal and not in your face too much.  There may be more but I only spotted Xhibit and Obi Trise and neither of them took anything away by their presence.  Murphy is pretty good  sexy yet trashy  but her character and her sub-plot didn't really have anywhere to go and just became another part of the wandering story. Basinger is OK but she isn't as bad as I expected her to be (or felt she needed to be).  She didn't need to be like his Mum in the songs, but a little less `victim of circumstance' would have helped buy into it.The message is worthy but heavily made and the story part of the film just didn't totally come off for me  instead it was a bit ordinary and not well written.  However the telling makes it worth seeing  the direction is pretty good and the liberal use of music is one of the many good touches, meanwhile Eminem ensures that it is always worth watching  whether doing witty disses in a car park, ripping the opposition in a battle or just being understated in a good role.  Understated!  Now there's a thing I thought I'd never say again about a rapper in a lead role of a film since Pac died!Like him or loathe him, Eminem prevents an average (at best) story being unwatchable by the sheer strength of his presence.  However those who aren't fans of hip-hop or Eminem may wish to avoid this, as there ain't too much else on offer.",,Anonymous,Music

"Obviously flawed, but authentic - and some classic moments, too.","Although ""8 Mile"" has obvious flaws - a total lack of story, for one - I enjoyed it a lot. First and foremost, it is decidedly un-Hollywood in its authenticity; Curtis Hanson never forces the action and has managed to capture real hiphop on tape - even up to selecting all the classic songs from 1994-1995. If it wasn't for the presence of Kim Basinger (way to classy to portray a trailer park mom) and Eminem (whose acting didn't add much for me), the movie could've easily passed as a good documentary.Still, Eminem's presence and rhymes make the film work, and make the final twenty minutes classic.

Upon introspection, I realised that the very essence of 8 Mile was its non-flashy, keeping it real kind of setting. Honestly I expected a rags to riches story, but I got the exact opposite. The movie is the story about one and a half months in a young white man's life, where his mindset undergoes major change. When you realise that the movie is trying to show this, it starts to shine, when you realise the 'realness' of the movie it shines even more, and finally when you watch Bunny Rabbit walk of the screen with a peace sign in the air, no better than he was in the start, with 'Lose Yourself' jiving in the background, you know the movie is worth it. Watch the movie, enjoy the battle scenes, decide its nothing great, but then give it some thought, you'll see what I see. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Eminem is multi talented.,"Not only a successful rapper but he also got a bit of Tom Hanks also, meaning he can act! Wow! I thought this movie would be the worst junk ever, I've seen other rappers films they were terrible. But this is different, or it may also help that Eminem has a good supporting cast. Well the movie itself is a mixture of rap battles, street life and plenty of the F word. Overall the film story revolves around Eminem who plays a rap chap who battles other rap chaps. So its the plot of him doing his rap stuff with his ""Homies"" in other words his friends. I would recommend this film to all Eminem fans and others who like Rap like Doc Dre etc. Only down side its boring after you have watched once through so don't buy the DVD unless you love Eminem.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"A Movie Related to Afro-American Culture, Using Music as a Weapon","`B-Rabbit' (Eminem) is a young man living in a poor district of Detroit. He spend his time working as a worker in a sheet-metal stamping press for parts of cars and with his four friends, participating in raps and hip-hop competitions. He dreams on being successful with music and consequently leaving that poor area of Detroit. He is living temporarily with his mother Stephany (a Kim Basinger without any glamour) and his young sister Lily. He meets Alex (the charming Brittany Murphy) and starts dating with her. The climax of this movie is the dispute of rap in the end of the plot between B-Rabbit and the Free World group. I myself expected much more of this movie than offered. It is not a bad film, but it is very related to Afro-Americans culture. There is one great aspect to be highlighted in this movie: Hollywood loves to show these ghettos of poor people as places where only drug dealers, bandits and criminals live. This movie redeems these poor areas, showing simple, honest and working people fighting for survival and having some fun. Further, his rap dispute, as a type of social relief valve, is also interesting: men and women fighting with words, trying to defeat the weakest. Music as a weapon! I do not follow the work of Eminem, but his performance has also surprised me: his cool character is great. All the cast performs an excellent acting. I myself like Brittany Murphy very much and Kim Basinger surprised me without any charming, as a drunken and looser mother. My vote is six.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Scratch below the surface and you'll realize it's not that great of a movie,"8 Mile tells the story of Eminem without telling the actual story of Eminem.A Broke, white-trash kid rises up through the tough Detroit rap scene. The premise is good and portrays Detroit's musical underground well.The movie does a damn good job at building the scene of desperation that comes with extreme poverty. This is a side of America that doesn't get covered too much in movies. But as the movie progress, the movie keeps beating that same bush again and again.Hate to be that guy, but more film time could have been dedicated to progressing the story. No need to show constant reminders how bad B-Rabbit, Eminem's character, has it.First off, the good.There's real chemistry between every actor. You get a real sense of camaraderie between B-Rabbit and his crew. You'll understand the conflict between Eminem, his mom, and Greg. The character development is well-done.The director took special attention to keep the story true to its setting and time. Set design and soundtrack are on point. The tiny details are well taken care of.But that's where I draw the line.I couldn't agree with the plot. We never understand why winning a rap contest means so much for B-Rabbit. If it's held weekly, then it shouldn't be such a big deal to lose and/or win. Even in the film, he loses one week to win in another. B-Rabbit's goals do not make sense at all. Some of B-Rabbit's actions in the film doesn't make sense, either.And the antagonists don't get much character development at all. They don't even say much at all. There are only a few lines spoken by the ""boss"" in the entire film. How can I understand the antagonist(s) if they don't even speak?The ending itself feels a bit...empty. B-Rabbit wins a rap contest, but his situation is still the same. He got a lucky break but he could be in the same spot next week. The film doesn't feel complete at all.If more time was spent on the screenplay, it could have been far better.2/5. Hope my brother isn't reading this review. He loves this movie a lot. we",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Not as good as I expected,"I have a lot of respect for Eminem's music, and really enjoy some of his material. After all the hype from unlikely mainstream sources that said this movie was legitimately good, I expected to be impressed, but I wasn't.The music was good, the raps were good, and the sets were great, but the film itself was unimpressive. The plot just plodded along, and the characters never really drew much emotion from me. It was just a pretty bland story, with pretty bland acting. I expected Bunny's mom to be more intense, I expected Bunny to to be more interesting - more like the persona I hear in his music and see in his videos.",,Anonymous,Music
Way better than most musician movies,"I remember when this movie came out I as a young girl and I absolutely loved it. I didn't care for rap (and I still don't), but I had a huge crush on Eminem after it. Rewatching it 10 years later makes me less impressed, but I still believe that it was in general well done.I would like to say that Eminem did a good job. I don't think it was an Oscar worthy performance or that he did something extraordinary, but he was convincing and didn't make me cringe. I am even surprised now that he didn't do more acting. I used to think he will become an actor like Justin Timberlake did.Of course it shouldn't be too hard to act when the movie is his semi biography. One can see the problems with his mom that affected him so much in life that it was basically all he was talking about back in the days of the movie. Glad to know that he kind of stopped now. One could first think of Kim Basinger as a surprising choice given the age difference they have, but one should remember that Eminem is playing someone much younger than himself and this makes her a pretty good choice. I would like to know what his real mom thought of this, she must have been flattered.I think Brittany Murphy is a very talented performer but in this movie she was awful. Same unnatural facial expression all the time. She was even horrible in the sex scene that would otherwise be very hot.I think one of the things that annoyed me the most in the movie was trying to make Rabbit look like the good father for his sister. I hate those techniques to get sympathy from the viewer. And it was so sweet it was vomit provoking.I think the scenery was great, including the factory and its lunch yard. It give a wonderful and fitting mood to the movie I still think the movie is good.I believe it is made more for the age group I was in 10 years ago, his i why I loved it then. Also if one likes rap it definitely meas on enjoy it and especially the battle scenes much more. And I am not even talking about Eminem fans, they will love it",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Authentic, with an Amazing Soundtrack","This semi-autobiographical film stars Eminem as a Detroit rapper who very much resembles Eminem. That's on purpose, and there is an honesty and goodness in this movie that may take you by surprise. Everybody, including me, who has lived in Detroit any time since the 1960s recognizes the authenticity of this story and the cityscape against which it is told, and the soundtrack is a musical revelation. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Thanks Curtis Hanson!,"Curtis Hanson is turning out to be one of our great directors.  LA CONFIDENTIAL was a look at LA during the 1950's that was near perfection as far as films are concerned.  WONDER BOYS was a highly entertaining look at characters who live in PITTSBURGH, again the city was as much a character as any of the actors.Now Curtis brings us a look at DETROIT in 8 MILE and I was so impressed. Yes I am a fan of Eminem and yes I think he's cute (that combination of bad boy and lost little boy is just irresistible) but the movie is a quality drama which I think all audiences will appreciate if only they'd open their minds a little and go see it.I was so happy to be in a theater with a mostly under 25 crowd (at 31 I was the oldest person in the place!) and we were there to watch a quality film about a kind of life that most of us can only imagine.  The audience of young people were silent at first - the anticipation of Eminem's entrance was almost palpable.  And throughout the film the audience continued to be engrossed by the realistic characters and the story.  A whole audience entertained by drama and acting and not one special effect!  Not one!We weren't there to watch a stupid brainless action film or a gross-out comedy.  8 MILE is one of those classic films that most A-list actors can only hope to appear in maybe once or twice during a long career and it's the kind Eminem makes on his first time out?  The boy has brains for sure and talent.  I don't think the John Garfield, James Dean comparisons are too far off - Eminem  has charisma to spare.  I don't think I want to see him continue to do more acting because 98% of the films he could do are such crap.  How do you follow up a truly great film like this?I'm so impressed.  I just hope that older people and hip-hop haters will get out and see this film too, it'll open their minds.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
8 miles and 10 stars,"Eminem. The greatest rapper of all time! That's my opinion anyways, and a lot of others too. This movie, based on his life, the start of his career, is brilliant! I've seen it time and time again, and I'm going to keep seeing it until the end of time. Yes, it is that good! So believe me when I say, watch it dog, watch it today.This movie is filled with both action and comedy, brilliant music and awesome beats. It has got hot chicks, drunken bastards, gang wars and stupid dicks. The start, ending and the rest of the movie was simply brilliant. So I won't get started and describing or saying anything else about any of that. It started at the bottom and it worked its way up, until it hit the top. It has got a lot of different characters. Characters that's played by great actors. There was no bad acting in this movie, not one bit! The script is brilliant, because it is simply brilliant and great in every way, and the fact that it's based on a story from the real world doesn't hurt either. This movie is just 2 hours of brilliancy! That is all there is to say about that.So, it is filled with loads of great scenes and awesomeness. The best part though I must admit was the lyrics they came up with. When you see this movie, and you really should, pay attention and listen to what they rap, the wordplays, the rhymes, the insults and the funny words that come out of their mouths. And if you have already seen it, watch it again, you know you won't be sorry.I could go on and on and on about how great this movie was and the fact that I couldn't find a single bad thing to say about it even though I have probable seen it 30 times or so (I am not kidding. That Is not a lye or overstatement, that is the truth.) but there is no point in going on saying that the rapping and all the other music was great and that I know the lyrics to all the rap-offs in this movie, word by word, or that it is so great that it is a sin to go your entire life without watching it. There is no point to it because you already know all this. I have already said it was perfect, give or take and that nothing is negative about it so going on and on about how unbelievably awesome it is, it's just a waste of time. So I am going to end this right here and right now. I am giving 8 mile 10/10 stars and with a perfect score I highly recommend it and expect that you see it as soon as you can get your lazy ass out of that chair and away from your computer screen and move it over into the couch in front of the TV.Rating: 10/10 Goodnight, bonsoir, guten nacht, god natt and Buenos noches.Peace & love God BlessJ.J.Shevy",10.0,Anonymous,Music
8 miles,"This movie is a pretty good movie, its's full of everything you need to have in a movie. A plot, sex, violence,drugs a dilemma, dram comedy its all there. Eminem is perfect for this movie because its about is true life growing up. I find this a better than Hustle and Flow because you know who its a true story too. Also the movie is good cause the main actor Eminem is faced with so much obstacles its intense and when he succeeds it makes it more exciting. The only thing i didn't like about the movie is the love area of it, there really wasn't any of it just lust.

WOW! 8 Mile/Mathers has style!,"Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of modern rap.  L.L. Cool J, and some of the other older rap, I could respect.  When I first heard Eminem on the radio, I really didn't feel one way or the other about his music.  I did howewer like the unique way he put words together and the peculiar rhythm which somehow seemed to flow more naturally than Shakespeare. However, It wasn't until I watched 8 Mile that, I saw an even deeper side of the artist.  He was very passionate in his acting. The movie captured me and I believed that was his life.  He showed an intensity and a natural inner fire that most actors in Holllywood wish they had.  I rated this movie 10 out of 10.  Again, I'm not a rap fan, but if Marshall Mathers/Eminem/Slim Shady is in another movie I'll be there!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"zzzzzzzz, oh good the Ending.","Right before I went to see this movie my friend told me that the writer wrote this ""script""  by just sitting around with Eminem and gang and recalling old stories of the hood.   This is exactly what you'll see on the big screen.  If you are from Detroit , like me, and you are into music, like me, you'll enjoy at least 20 minutes of this film.  If you don't know anything about rap or its roots add another 5 or so minutes of enjoyment, other than that it couldn't have been more boring.  Like when you sit around sharing stories with your friends you might think that they are great,  but to anyone besides you and your friends they are kind of boring.  Thats how this film is.Its kinda , or really boring depending on your background.  A 40 minute docudrama would have been perfect for this material but a 2 hour film ZZZZZZZ.   Wait for the DVD, watch the first 10 minute skip to last 20 minutes and you'll get you $$ worth.  If you feel like you have to get more Eminem here's an idea;  stop the DVD around minute 10 and  stare at your latest picture of Eminem for 45 minutes then restart the movie at the 80 minute of so mark.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
It's OK...Not a Great Film.,"I feel Eminem is the best lyricist ever, definitely the GOAT of Hip-Hop.But his foray into acting was mediocre.Subpar acting from most of the cast aside, the film was OK. Worthy of watching once, not worthy of repeated viewing.While the film stays interesting (barely) till the end, the movie lacks depth, structure, and suffers from a generic script.The rap battle scenes are the highlight of the movie and doesn't disappoint.A real bio film on Eminem's life story would have been much more compelling.If an unknown actor played the lead character (Rabbit), as opposed to Eminem, I doubt there would be so many great reviews on IMDB.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The exhilaration of seeing and hearing young people fight with `vocabulary' rather than guns.,"Eminem is a `wonder-boy' product of the whitebread underclass of outraged, disenfranchised youths  from a bleak Detroit in ` 8 Mile.' Curtis Hanson directed `Wonder Boys' with the same sense of caring about youths emerging for better or worse into their adulthood. But the star of this film is Eminem, and although it is a fictional story about Jimmy Smith, Jr. (called `Rabbit'), it is a loose adaptation of Eminem's rise from the ghetto of Detroit, on the dividing line of the 8-mile strip separating blacks from whites.The comparison with `Rocky' is inevitable and not wholly inappropriate. In sports and rap, blacks have proven formidable.  When a white like Rocky or Eminem can emerge as a powerful force in either field, the world has to notice, and films have to record and adapt.  Eminem's astounding ability to rhyme and chant obliterates all color barriers.For a white guy like myself, the joy of `8 Mile' has nothing to do with turning up my nose at the brothers with my own white hope; rather it is the exhilaration of seeing and hearing young people fight with `vocabulary' rather than guns.  Rhyme and reason rule. The art form is important as it comments both on culture and creativity.Director Hanson said, ""I saw here an opportunity to make a serious movie about the emotional struggles of contemporary adolescents in this country. This captures the angst, insecurity, frustration and anger, search for direction and identity.""  That statement emphasizes the teenage universal search rather than the obvious power of hip-hop, to Hanson's credit. The producer, Brian Grazer, also made  `A Beautiful Mind,' another exploration of genius that transcended math in favor of the search by a gifted human being for a place to be himself.This fictional biography doesn't claim to be a definitive revelation of the difficult rise of Eminem.  It does show the inner struggle of Rabbit to break from the comfort of having a job in an auto factory, similar to Bjork's bleak plant in `Dancer in the Dark,' or striking out into creative territory dominated by blacks but promising release from the trailer park where his mother (Kim Basinger) is imprisoned. Lost in this somewhat sanitized adaptation is the angry homophobia and misogyny so characteristic of Eminem in real life.  But gained is the sense that hip-hop is an important cultural contribution even white boys can offer.",,Anonymous,Music
"I hate to admit it, I enjoyed it","First let me say that this is a FICTIONAL account of Eminem's life! Sorry all you young gullible fools, I know you WANT to think that this is true but its NOT. So get over it! Anyway, I hate rap and I went to see this film with a chip on my shoulder and even though its far, far from being a top ten film of the year I have to admit I was somewhat entertained. Eminem is not bad in the film. He gives that raw type of performance that studios and directors look for when they put singers(!) in films. The film does have a gritty and dirty look about it that I found effective and of course, the big competition at the end! It was exciting and fun. I was very entertained by the rap competition, in fact I think it made the whole film work. Like the big match at the end of ""The Karate Kid"". But I did have some problems. Kim Basinger is horribly miscast as his mother. She doesn't work, lives in a trailer home and of course dates some worthless bum. Brittany Murphy plays the cheapest, filthiest whore since Jennifer Jason Leigh in ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"". Her character really has no redeeming quality and I felt like I needed a shower after her character was onscreen. And all the dumb dialogue...Yo Dawg! The shooting with the paintball gun I thought was a backfire for the makers of the film. If you want us to root for the guy he's going to have to act a lot more mature than shooting passerby's with a paintball gun. But I was entertained and the competition at the end is a rouser!

One hit wonder,don't be put off i am not referring to Eminem's career.unfortunately this movie does not really capture Slim Shady's prominent career and is in no way a non-fictional narrative.The greatest moments in the film are when you see Marshal rapping and the end rap sequence will blow your mind if you are into that sort of thing.Otherwise the movie is a bit of a let down. Eminem proves he is not an actor with his either very timid or all out yelling approach to his script. You will not see character development in this film but i don't think that was really the point.I cannot compare it to 50 cents movie as i haven't yet seen it but if you like Eminem you should like this film. I give this movie a 7 out of 10 simply due to the power of the rap battles and also in the special features of the DVD you really see Slim Shady reel some spit.,7.0,Anonymous,Music

One shot and it almost hits. But just lands outside the wire,Boyz in the hood meets Good will hunting with a sprinkling of Rocky. A decent and watchable movie. Nothing particularly groundbreaking. But what it does it does well. Found the whole underground rapping scene to be amusing and thankfully not too over the top on its attempts at being too serious. Basinger is excellent as his despicable mother and Eminem himself is believable. The supporting cast are all capable and help to bring the world to life. Its enjoyable and the sound track is polished. Its not anything we haven't seen before in the genre. Poor guy tries to survive and make something of himself in difficult circumstances.

An interesting film about America's latest success story.,"Even people who are not familiar with Eminem and his music (and, quite possibly, people who can't stand either of them) can enjoy 8 Mile because even though it is obviously a film based closely on his own life, it does not require any previous knowledge about him or his life or his music in order to understand and enjoy the film.Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr., a young white kid living in a trailer park in Detroit with his trashy mother and who aspires to succeed in the rap music industry. The thing to consider here is that it's already known that Smith is going to succeed, which is the only theory that I can come up with as to why they left out that last act, where he actually does succeed.Rap music is unfortunately associated almost entirely with people who are p**sed off at the world, hence the fact that every rap star in the world is frowning with all his might on the cover of every CD. Given that, it may not have been a good idea to see Smith succeed and get a reason to smile at the end of the film, because a happy ending would cancel out the need for angry rap music. On the other hand, it is more than a little disappointing to see the movie build up for the whole time to the scene where Smith is finally successful in the underground battle, only to skulk out of there with the same mopy attitude that he had throughout the entire film.Eminem is very successful in his role, even generating some early Oscar buzz (I was pretty impressed, but I'm not sure I'd go THAT far.) because he understands the material so well. He is basically playing himself, telling his own story, so he's had his whole life to think about this and he knows exactly what he wants his audience to see. He also avoids the fate of being yet another musician who turns to acting, only to release a film that often is catastrophic to the rest of their career. Britney Spears has recently made this mistake by performing in the hideous crapfest Crossroads. I think that the reason Eminem succeeds so well in his role is because he is not pretending to be someone else which, given the content of his music, is not something that he would probably be good at. Instead of a flailing musician trying out acting, 8 Mile instead comes across sort of like a film version of an autobiography.Kim Basinger adds wonderfully to the film as Smith's mother, who's dating a guy the same age as her son and who reveals shocking sexual details to him, somehow hoping that he can give her advice. I loved Roger Ebert's counterargument to people who say that she's just too beautiful to play such a poor woman, saying in his review of 8 Mile that, given the amount of ugly people who live in huge houses, there should be no reason that a poor woman couldn't be beautiful. Brittany Murphy provides an interesting romantic interest, perfectly capturing the skanky nature that you would expect from the kind of person that her character is, but she is the second biggest loose end in the film, right after the fate of the main character. It is clear that she was sleeping with whoever she met that she felt would be the most successful, so obviously she and Jimmy can't make up and get back together at the end, although they exchange a look just after his victory at the battle that suggests that he either forgives her for what she did, or she has just changed her mind about who has the brightest future and is ready to come back and start having sex with him again.Regardless, however, of these weaknesses, 8 Mile is an inspiring film that comes along at a time when an inspiring film is very much needed, among all the goofy action and cheesy junior high school crap that's pumped out in record quantities these days. It doesn't show how Eminem came to be the phenomenally successful rapper that he is today, but instead portrays a young kid from a poor neighborhood who focuses on a goal and achieves it, even in an area in which he is clearly an outsider.As he says at the end of the title song, `You can do anything you set your mind to, man.'",9.0,Anonymous,Music

A Compilation of Idiots Who Can't Act Doing Dumb Stuff and Driving Around in a Broken Car,"8 Mile is a biography following rapper 'Eminem' in a week leading up to when people started to notice his talent more, starting with a couple of freestyle rap battles.Eminem was hired to play himself in this movie, and he does a great job...at rapping. He really does, the rap battles are the best parts of the movie, and whenever the script demands that he open his mouth to do so it's something of a treat to listen to.As for his acting, I really can't say the same. He holds the same deadpan expression for the entire movie, whether he's being beaten up or trying to show compassion. It's always just wide open eyes like a fish, a drooping face, and a slightly gaped mouth constantly moaning 'duuuuuuuh...' At least that's how it looks. With the subject matter this movie handles, an effectively emotional performance would make or break pretty much every major scene, but all we got was deadpan Eminem trying to put some level of emotion into his voice or face but failing miserably. He's a horrid actor, and I'm so happy he never continued. As for the rest of the cast, they aren't anything special either. This is closer to being the writing's fault, but nobody bothers to try to push their characters past black stereotypes. They all talk the same, walk the same, and act the same. They're just different sizes and shapes. Now you could argue that they actually acted like that in real life, this is a biography after all. However, I am all for changing the source material for the betterment of the film. This is a film, it's entertainment. If a better actor were chosen for Eminem we could have gotten a deep and engaging character, but we just got Senior Deadpan over here. I'd have changed the source material if Eminem really was this boring of a person, then hired a better actor.As for the writing, it's one of the main reasons this movie sucks. None of the characters are written to be interesting or deep or anything. I didn't care about any of them, especially not when they decide to spend their nights lighting houses on fire with people still in them. And yes, there is actually a scene where that happens. It's absurdly stupid. There are plenty of other dumb scenes, like two characters sneaking off during their lunch break to engage in intercourse in a factory, surrounded by machinery. Machinery that could probably kill them if turned on at the wrong moment. Then the male party in this scene has the audacity to get mad when his female counterpart goes and engages in intercourse with someone else. Maybe that would be a bigger deal if they'd known each other long enough to be 'going steady'. They knew each other for two whole days, and spoke maybe twice. It's a one-night stand, male party, do you seriously expect her to be committed to you? Apparently. I don't want to say much more, but more stupidity ensues from this already dumb situation. Seriously, there's nothing to this writing. Even the dialogue is uninspired and uninteresting. It's hopelessly average at best, horridly stupid at worst. It's like the screenplay was written by a sixth grader who just learned some new swear words and had a couple sex-ed classes. The movie is overloaded with cussing, and while I have no problem with cursing in movies, it's used in so much excess that the audience becomes numb to it, and whatever effect it had beforehand is completely lost. I couldn't tell when a line of dialogue was supposed to be emphasized because a) cussing happened in every sentence, which would normally bring emphasis to a scene but instead blended in with the rest of the dialogue and b) because all the acting was so dull that it was impossible to tell whether the characters were trying to emphasize anything they were saying.Like I said earlier, the characters are all completely bland. Every single one is just a blatant embodiment of their own racial stereotype, save for Eminem. Although he's just a white guy acting black, so there's really nothing to his character anyway. There's this fantastically awful scene where a character forgets to take his finger off the trigger of his gun and shoots himself with it. It makes me wonder how completely stupid you'd have to be to actually manage that. And again, I don't care if it really happened, though I find that to be the most unbelievable part of the whole movie.Overall 8 Mile is a walking trash can filled with all it's qualities. The writing is garbage, the characters are junk, and the acting is rubbish. There's nothing to this movie, save for the handful of rapping scenes.

Perfectly watchable-but not brilliant,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs8 Mile is controversial Detroit rapper Eminem's eagerly anticipated acting debut.It was probably a good idea for his first time in front of the camera to stick to material relatively close to home and appear in a movie that is more-or-less semi-autobiographical.Does he pull it off?Yes,he more than passes muster.Being his first time,he hasn't quite mastered a naturalness that he would need to develop in order to be considered a truly amazing acting force,but he certainly tries very hard and carries himself very powerfully.The rest of the main cast,Kim Basinger,Mekki Phyiffer and Brittany Murphy,however,turn in merely adequate,passable performances which are less acceptable for more experienced actors.It doesn't help much that they are given such contrieved,unoriginal dialogue to work with,though.The film's other real fault is that the story has no real sense of structure or coherence.Although the central character and the situations and people he becomes involved with are very engaging,there's no real actual plot to follow and this ends up becoming quite a distracting hinderance.A good recommendation about the film however,is that it really comes alive towards the end,making you just able to care about the end outcome.The rapping sequences are great fun to watch too,watching the characters spurt out catchy,bouncing tunes that get lodged in your head,especially during the 'choking' scenes.Although this doesn't quite match up to director Curtis Hanson's original movie L.A. Confidential,it is easily on a par with his last film,Wonder Boys.***",,Anonymous,Music
Scenes from the underbelly of America,"When pop stars make films, these are often based of fictionalised versions of themselves, and Eminem's effort, '8 Mile', is no exception. But there are some things that make this movie more intriguing than most in the genre: firstly, his life story, a white kid growing up in a poor, mostly black district of Detroit who became a major rap star, is genuinely interesting; secondly, the director, Curtis Hanson, is a cut above the typical director of such an effort. And the film delivers on most of this promise: Eminem actually acts quite well, and the decayed environment of urban Detroit is a grimly fascinating slice of America relatively rarely depicted in the movies. As for the rapping, even if you don't like this music in general (and it's aggressive, misogynistic tendencies are very much on display), the idea of tongue-tied street kids finding their voice in spontaneous performance makes for an entertaining narrative. The film is quite long, however, and a little shapeless - unlike Eminem's real life story, there's no fairytale ending. The film obviously needed a real rapper to make it work, but this is no empty star vehicle, but a grimy and unglamourous film about life on the underside of the U.S.A.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"look...if you had...one shot...to watch ""8 Mile""...would you go for it?  (you should)","Semi-autobiographical look at Eminem's early years in Detroit while he was trying to become a rapper. Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr (Eminem) is a young man living in a trailer with his white trash mom Stephanie (Kim Basinger). But at night, he goes to the rap contests, and the contestants all try to out-dis each other.More important than the fact that this movie stars Eminem is its focus on trying to make something of oneself in an environment where everything seems as bleak as can be. The ad-libbed songs definitely add to the movie's gritty feeling, with the type of profanity that one usually expects to hear only from a Joe Pesci character. But above all, it humanizes the rap world, showing why it is like it is.I recommend this movie under all circumstances.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A good drama,"""8 Mile"" is one of those movies that will never be forgotten as time passes by. It is an entertainment milestone that tried hard to be fairly successful, and it succeeded.Eminem's acting in the film was pretty good, along with co-stars Brittany Murphy and Mekhi Phifer. Kim Basinger was OK too, though she had better roles in previous films.The musical scenes in the movie are a real treat for rap & hip hop fans, as well as R&B fans. There is also a handful of classic & old school hip hop songs playing in the backgrounds of certain scenes, which would definitely be good for the hip hop fans.The movie wasn't disappointing, but it wasn't so great either. It was a good film to see, and it's even better when you have the DVD with all its special features. However, don't expect this movie to be over-the-top, because it isn't. It's a well-made drama made in favor of hip hop.To conclude, I recommend this movie to all hip hop lovers. But if you don't like hip hop, then just rent the movie and see if you like it.I give the movie a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Grit, Guts and Glory... Spittin' the Detroit Story","Yo, gather 'round, open your ears, let's give this a whirl,
We talkin' bout 8 Mile, bout a Detroit boy in a tough world.Film's as raw as a fight, as real as the street,
Story of struggle and triumph, can't help but tap your feet.B-Rabbit, our boy Eminem, spittin' rhymes so tight,
In the heart of Motor City, under the neon light.Mom's spaghetti on his sweater, he's nervous, but on the surface,
Ready to drop bombs, prove to y'all he got a purpose.Ain't no Superman, ain't got no cape,
Just a blue-collar bro, lookin' for an escape.From the trailer park life, the factory grime,
Only got one shot, gotta make it prime time.Kim Basinger, playing the mom, she got the pain,
In a life gone south, under the Michigan rain.Brittany Murphy shines, a bright star in the gloom,
In the raw, rusted heart of the American boom.Detroit's the backdrop, the grind and the grit,
Where dreams are a luxury and despair won't quit.Through rap battles and beatdowns, the hardships he been through,
8 Mile tells it straight, gives respect where it's due.Directed by Hanson, he ain't missin' a beat,
Cuts to the core, no easy feat.Captures the struggle, the hunger, the rage,
Each frame's like a verse, every scene's a page.The film's got flow, like a rhyme that won't stop,
Like Eminem's lyrics, it rises to the top.It's about finding your voice, when the chips are down,
About standing your ground, in the face of the clown.8 Mile's the journey, from the bottom to the top,
About taking your shot, no matter what, non-stop.It's rough, it's tough, like a Detroit winter's day,
But like Eminem's journey, it's the only way.Yo, this ain't just a movie, it's life on the screen,
8 Mile's a champ, if you know what I mean.The beats are solid, the story's tight,
An anthem for anyone, fighting the good fight.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Eminem Confidential,"While everyone was and is stating that this movie is not a biography of Eminem, his transition into movies, wasn't to difficult. Playing a rapper while being one ""in real life"" that is. What really surprised a lot of people, was the director. The man responsible for L.A. Confidential would direct a movie about a rapper? Has rap gone mainstream enough for that to happen? Or couldn't he find anything else suitable to direct?While the underdog story works quite fine and Eminem justifies being chosen to star in this movie, you can see where it all will lead. Like a sports movie sort of. Still the ending is pretty good and leaves you with a good feeling, of having watched a movie about music, that conveys also in the drama department.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

This flick should have had English language subtitles.,"Okay, I admit it. I'm just too damned white to get this flick. Suck the rap battles out of it and you have just another very ordinary story about the struggle to get out of the ghetto.  I personally wasn't impressed with the performances by any of the principals, which were good just not impressive, or anything else about the film. Maybe I'm just not tapping into that whole seething urban roots thing. So for all you ""caspers"" out there, especially those who go all the way back to ""Blackboard Jungle"" like me, pass on this over-hyped flick. You've probably seen it all before.

A western without guns,"After 1 1/2 hours you realize you haven't seen them sing at all. Then they draw their metaphoric guns, it becomes like High Noon. The experience of how the film draws you into its world allows it to explore the catharsis of art and pain. The things he's singing about, you have now seen with your own eyes, so it is as shocking for us as it is the audience, because suddenly he rises above even we, the viewer. The doorman going from hating him, to respecting him, becomes participatory with the audience. And the stakes couldn't be any lower. This isn't a TV show in front of millions of people, or a boxing match covered by national media. It's just a basement rap-off. Notice how the song is about authenticity and respect, and he destroys the other guy for having no authenticity, for not earning his art. He has earned it through poverty and pain. Interesting this is not the measure of how the world works--a Clarence will go farther in life in every institution, highlighting how rare an Eminem is in the world. Also illustrated, with the factory manager. So he got extra shifts, who cares? He gets to work a terrible job even more, and it's treated as some kind of victory. Well. The universe is rewarding him with more responsibility. It is treated, cinematically, as a gigantic victory for him.This film, 8 Mile, is teaching us the most brutal of lessons, that enlightenment comes through participation, presenting the most rigged, unfair, horrible conditions through both spiritual constructions (stoicism, buddhism, christianity), and genre film constructions (samurai, western, sports). However art is the most potent of cinematic symbols because it is the direct proxy for mastery and nirvana. It is also why it also doesn't show him getting famous. His small victory here, scales in our imagination, however, he could easily be pushing the rock up the hill for his whole life. Enlightenment becomes a process, just in the case of it being productive for the viewer, it must come with capitalist rewards to make sense for us. This is just the easiest shorthand for a film. He takes the new shifts, accepts the suffering, and churns it all into Art, by mastering this craft he is portraying integration, he becomes Enlightened. Because there is no material equivalent to godliness, so you are just handed the entire kingdom. He becomes 'Eminem', a billionaire, rich, famous, all his dreams happening; but it is just one way there, no other way, and it doesn't show it happening. It fades out at the crescendo, showing wisdom. The good films sort of hint this direction because it puts it in our hands.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Film with  Great Realism,"Found this film very entertaining which had a great message to tell about the people who love rap music and the great talent it takes to perform with great style. Eminem, (Jimmy B-Rabbit-Smith Jr.) was well liked by many of his friends in Detroit, Michigan, who worked in an auto parts factory in plastic molding and at the same time was a very good young rapper. Rabbit had many white and black friends as well as an ex gal friend who told him she was pregnant and another Alex, (Brittany Murphy). Rabbit appeared at a rapper contest and when he got up on stage, he froze and was unable to utter a word, which made things bad for him and many people began to talk in bad ways about his being a very poor rapper with words and music. Kim Basinger, (Stephanie Smith) plays the role of Rabbit's mother who lives in a trailer and shows the fact that she has a bad life with her present boyfriend and never seems to have any money. Poor Rabbit has to put up with her boyfriend and at the same time care for his young sister who loves Rabbit very much. Enjoyed the great performance by Mekhi Phifer, (David ""Future"" Porter) who gave Rabbit all the support he needed to get a head of this music business. Great film, enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Sooooo bad. . .,"Alright, after seeing 8 Mile I have decided that it is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  I don't think there is any way I can compile a definitive statement on how bad I felt the movie was so I will simply list all my gripes about the movie.  I am going to spoil some of the movie so if you haven't seen this movie yet you may not want to read this.1) Eminem gets to beat up a guy twice his size because it's his movie.2) The scene where they have sex in the factory is just stupid.  You can't do that.3) The scene where Rabbit is trapped in a burning building and can't get out.  Dramatic music starts playing and it gets really tense like OH MY GOD WHAT WILL HAPPEN.  Then he very calmly and cooly goes and jumps out the window and nothing happens.  The movie just leads you one way and then cuts back another way and does it quite poorly.4) The cameramen and cinematographer have an inexcusably bad understanding of how to shoot a movie.  The camera jumps from one side of a scene to another completely at random.  This may not bother some people but for me it's very jarring and disorienting and makes the movie look amateurish.5) Another technical gripe.  The lighting is dramatic ALL THE TIME.  In every scene one side of Rabbit's face is completely blacked out.  Even in scenes where there is clearly a light source on the dark side of his face.6) Why do the people who've just burned down a building (a felony) just stand around proud of themselves and not even worry for a second about cops or anything?7) There are about five scenes in the movie where Rabbit's crappy car wont start.8) They never say whether the little girl in the movie is his daughter or his sister.  I am guessing sister but they could have made it clearer.9) The movie has no introduction and no conclusion.  You are just thrust suddenly in to Rabbit's trailer-park life and how he has just broken up with his girlfriend but there's no real explaination or background for either of those.  In some movies they do this well where there's some mystery about things that are slowly revealed, but in 8 Mile there is no purpose for this.10) The ending of the movie has no point.  He wins the battle, his friend offers for him to host the battles with him, and he says ""No, I just gotta do my own thing."" and walks off down an alley.  What's the point?11) The whole point of the movie is how these people are all living their lives wrong and not doing anything and are never going to get better.  But then his mom goes to bingo and wins $3200 dollars.  Not every movie has to have a cheery ending or a beautiful message, but what kind of a moral is that?!12) More about the ending.  I couldn't tell whether it all worked out for him in the end and they lived happily-ever-after or if his life got screwed up.  What happened?!  What's the point of all this?!13) People say this is supposed to be such an accurate description of early/mid-ninties Detroit.  I have two problems with that.  Does everyone in the entire town rap?  Is it really that hard to replicate conditions of an urban setting a whopping 10 years ago?14) What is the point of that other white guy Cheddar Bob who shoots himself in the groin?  I mean, you could say comic relief but he's really more stupid than funny, and all his other friends are by far funnier (i.e. when one of them calls the other one Fredrick Douglas)That's all the complaints about this movie that I have the energy to think up right now.  I have nothing against Eminem, and his acting surprisingly was not the worst part of this movie.  However I hope this horrible movie discourages him from trying to act and sticking to rapping, which not-surprisingly was the best part of this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"Very human, despite its' raw and profane nature.","This movie was a long time on my list, but it was only now that I have seen it. Much better than expected despite the already great reviews.Firstly, it feels very authentic in its' representation of the lower class population in Detroit. It starts with the grey, grainy cinematography and proceeds to the profanity, drinking, violence, impoverishment and eventually the lack of opportunity versus the desire to get out of this life (especially from the younger population).Secondly, it's the marvelous cast. Eminem shines. His dedication is imprinted everywhere. From his genuine outrage to his caring for sister Lilly and the amazing soundtrack. Pure genius. Kim Basinger is amazing. Very believable as the egocentric mother. One of her better roles. I could name other actors as well but all did a great job, so I'll save space and just say that all played very believable characters. Some played positive characters, others the negative side, but none of them were boring or annoying, so kudos to everyone involved.The last and probably the most important point for me is the humanity displayed in the movie. Though 'Rabbit' is rapidly ignited and quickly drawn to violence, it's not the violence that dictates his actions. It's his love for music, his will to make things better and his love for his sister Lilly. '8 Mile' doesn't promote violence, but rather determination, drive, dedication and discipline. Things that help succeed in life.I also agree with the view that there are no free things in life and one has to find his own path. Each shortcut you take either shortens or cuts your success.I was moved by this great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Mediocre, but I expected far worse.","A young factory hand wants to become a rapper - but he is handicapped by being poor and white.All right, cards on the table. I don't like Eminem. Well, in truth, I think he is a bit of a moron. I also don't like rap much either. So I guess I didn't come to this movie with much hope for it - but you know, it is not that bad. Not that good either, but for a star vehicle it is not at all bad. I expected much worse. A modern Elvis movie, maybe.This is a film from the put-filters-on-the-camera and wobble-it-a-lot school. Makes it look like a documentary and, therefore, more real. Or so the propaganda goes.There isn't a lot of originality here, but it is at least a good taste stealer. Rocky and the Karate Kid spring to mind. The thing that surprises is that Marshall Bruce Mathers III (Em') is cool and collected before the camera. A bit one-note, but not a bad first try. Maybe his secret is that he couldn't care less about how he looks or acts - like the way he says things to offend people in his lyrics.Wrong-side-of-the-tracks Detroit looks like the slum it really is and the support characters look real enough too. If only the central music was any good it might please this over 40 - but it doesn't. Doggerel verse is no big deal and besides - where has rap gone in twenty years? Nowhere! Rock has taken some of its tricks, but rap remains dumb and stuck. Guys moaning and about their lot and girls they would like to have sex with.There might be a sequel - and if this makes enough money there is bound to be - but I won't be watching. This was plenty for me. There are enough pros behind the scenes to keep this going to the end, but there is little to really make it essential viewing. Even for a hardened rap fan.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Incredibly grounded, and very entertaining- 8 Mile is a job well done","Entertaining, incredibly grounded, and certainly inspiring- 8 Mile is more than just a rise to fame like origin story- it's about the choices made that lead us to who we become. Eminem is surprisingly great as 'Rabbit', a rapper with a gift, but having a hard time showing it. The film is very cleverly acted in general as well, with all the performances feeling more than real, and not just average stereotypes like most of these types of films. The film is really entertaining to watch, even with its nearly 2 hour runtime and its slow progression of plot most of the time. It's written superbly well, and directed with a very careful precision that I can't help but admire. The film does aim to please, and seems to nail that fact most of the time, but can prove to be tedious in certain progression of its story. In the end, 8 Mile is a more than impressive job inspired by and starring one of the greatest rappers of all time. The film is very grounded, very realistic, as it should be, and written and directed with great passion. It's inspiring, entertaining, and by all means an impressive feat.

The Vidiot Reviews....,"8 MileWhite rappers have it harder than black rappers because they can't rhyme anything with the N-word.Which is why the white-boy in this drama is so respected when he spits.White trash wannabe rapper B-Rabbit (Eminem) not only has to cope with his alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) and her abusive boyfriend (Michael Shannon), but also life in a dead-end job.His only refuge is the weekly rap battles at a local club, where his nerves keep him from performing.But when he catches his girl (Brittany Murphy) cheating, B-Rabbit gets the confidence to compete in a battle royal arranged by a gangbanger (Anthony Mackie).With a surprising performance from Eminem in a role that parallels his own upbringing, 8 Mile's gritty realism and follow-your-dreams mentality doesn't come off as clichéd as with most urban productions.Furthermore, it's not your pigment that makes you a decent rapper; it's your level of misogyny.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Worthy Performances, Thin Plot,","8 Mile is a great film with a reasonable plot and a terrific cast. Eminem certainly does an effective job in a movie that is essentially his baby, his performance is very deep and personal, he certainly does not hold back, bringing his story to life through a fictional character. However, the plot was missing something, every scene is somewhat formulaic and predictable, you know how each each will end as soon as it begins, it is short on surprises. The highlight of the movie is certainly the rap battles, I am a fan of Eminem's music, but I feel people who are unfamiliar with his art can still appreciate the drama and intensity of these scenes, the raw emotion of the cast is overwhelming at times.

This Sucked!,"I saw this film yesterday and I have to say I can't see what all the fuss is about.The acting is deplorable, especially Kim Basinger, and Eminem has 2 forms.

WTF was all that about?The direction was clunky and unprofessional. Maybe that's what was desired but it just doesn't work very well. Plus, who the hell would have sex in a factory?Sure the rapping was good but that's all it was, a long music video depicting Eminem as the ruler of all he surveys.

At least he had a little bit of screen presence.If you have yet to see it and expect this brilliant masterpiece some people will tell you it is then don't bother.

One of the best films of 2002.,"Based somewhat on Eminem's true life story of growing up in the suburbs of Detroit, 8 MILE is really not as bad as you would think. The film is actually pretty exciting and Eminem acts so good, you would think he had been doing it for years. He certainly delivered one hell of a performance and I was extremely impressed. The remaining cast members were also very good.The story is very powerful and above all- enthralling. I was generally absorbed by every second of 8 MILE. After hearing numerous terrible reviews from several of my friends, I was expecting a crap film. But, no. This is a true masterpiece.What I think let a lot of people down is that rap music is not really the entire plot of the story, but it is more of a sub-plot used to show the life of a young man trying to deal with the problems of life. The film is not only about rap and really isn't what all the little blurbs lead you to think. 8 MILE is really a moving tale of trying to survive in the world.I recommend that you see SAVE THE LAST DANCE if you like this film. That is somewhat similar. All I know is that 8 MILE is a film that makes you think about your life and will surely make you not want to waste any of it.

This film ALMOST made me understand rap music,"I found this to be a semi-pleasant surprise and gained some sympathy for the Eminems of the world along the way. To be honest, if he'd been black I wouldn't have been able to relate much.I also learned what could motivate people to participate in this belligerent, mostly insulting form of music. It seems to be a matter of desperation, plus some innate obsession with rap as an art form. That part must be very internal, since I've never come close to feeling it myself.I find rap mostly tuneless and grating, like listening to people hollering while banging on garbage cans. Prodigal musical talent doesn't seem to be required, just a chip on one's shoulder from life's hard knocks or whatever. This film at least got me thinking there's more to rap than pure criminality.There was still a lot of mindless thug-talk, but not quite of the type I expected. It did open my eyes culturally, to a degree.It seems when you come from nothing and have nothing to lose, latching on to a rude set of ""musical"" principles might indeed be your only way out. The Eminem character was lucky to be brighter than the average underdog, and found a way to rise above his situation by sinking into another one.I'll never understand the whole ""culture of attitude"" (coming from any race) but this was a well-told story in its own right, enjoyable to watch, never boring, and quite funny at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Surprisingly good.  Much Kudos to the director Curtis Hanson.,"﻿I am one of those people who dismissed ""8 Mile"" simply because it was an Eminem movie.  I really don't care for Eminem, and I really don't much care for the current hip hop in general either.  But what can I say? All my friends wanted to watch it, so I ended up watching it with them.  And guess what?  I liked it.All the cast, including Eminem, are uniformly excellent, and I really have to give lots of kudos to the director Curtis Hanson (who has also directed much-acclaimed ""L.A. Confidential"").  He managed to capture the ever-so-subtle glint of defeat from Eminem's eyes in the beginning sequence of the movie, as well as the just-as-subtle glint of triumph near the end. I'm sure Eminem possesses the natural instinct and screen presence to be a good actor (especially in a role that should be familiar to him), but I doubt that he would have been as impressive as he was in ""8 Mile"" without Curtis Hanson guiding him.  And Kim Basinger (who won an Oscar for her performance in Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"") shows us once again that she is as compelling an actress as she is beautiful.Plot-wise, there really isn't anything new here.  It's a ""boy faces the obstacles in his life, finds his own path, and becomes a man"" story.  It's almost formulaic in a sense.  In fact, I think this movie could have been extremely predictable and boring, if it weren't for Curtis Hanson's wonderful direction and the subsequently excellent performances of the cast.To sum it up, if you're an Eminem fan, then by all means watch ""8 Mile."" (Like I need to tell them)  Although one of my friend said that he wished there were even more rhymin', I doubt fans would be disappointed.  And if you're not a fan (of Eminem or hip hop in general), I still suggest that you consider watching this movie.  It's a very decent drama, at the very least. Definitely not some movie to be dismissed simply because a rapper is in it. Good stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not the Milestone It Was Said to Be...,"Granted, this movie was not horrible and I was surprised to see that Eminem could actually act.  While watching this movie I was entertained and did actually care about the characters.  It was when the movie ended I became indifferent about it.For about a week and a half before the movie released in theaters, movie critics from all over were hailing this film and giving out accolades like water in a marathon.  Because of all this I went to this movie with relatively high expectations and they were not met.  Sure the movie is entertaining for the 2 hours it runs and it does have some neat rap/flow scenes, but in the end I did not really see the point the movie was trying to stress.  For the type of movie it is it left you hanging and wondering about it too much.  It seems as if the film makers wanted to make this film as real as possible (which they successfully did) that they forgot the reason that they were making the movie.Now, I did enjoy the movie for the most part, but I kept waiting for something to happen that would turn the plot and it never did.  It is not a movie I would watch again nor would I recommend it (the audience who will appreciate it for what it is worth is a definite younger audience).Because the movie kept me decently entertained but really put out no substance I give 8 MILE a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

I don't even like rap...,"Except for Tupac because of reasons.But regardless of my taste in music, Eminem is my God. Heck he could be singing opera and he would still be my God.. Although I will admit he's not the greatest actor but I don't care. Just seing him on the screen fills me with awe!.. And this movie almost tricked me into liking rap music because of his writing. Jay Z described him as ""Lyrically insane"" and I couldn't agree more.. The final rap battle is stuck in my head and I know it by heart. Word has it that Papa Doc never recovered mentally from the verbal abuse he had to endure.Although this is partially a biography, I would still love a sequel.

"Good, but not good enough","While 8 Mile may be an interesting look at what was, at the time, still a subculture, and a movie worth viewing, I found it to pale in comparison to Curtis Hanson's last two films:  Wonder Boys and L.A. Confidential.  Why did it pale in comparison?  Two reasons.  One, the casting.  Two, the script. Eminem should be given some slack as this is his first theatrical endeavor and with that taken into consideration, it's easier to let him off the hook for the lack of range of emotion and the stiffness that he gives off intermittently throughout the picture.  But Kim Basinger as his mother?  I'm sorry, but in her first scene, I cringed.  If ever there was an definition of what miscasting is, this would be a prime example of it.  That being said, Hanson managed to make only this one blunder in casting and the rest of the actors only help to protect his lead and give the film more dramatic credibility.  Which leaves the script.  In my opinion, if the script had been tighter and more cohesive, half the other problems that came through, even with Ms. Basinger in it, would have been swept under the rug.  But the script lacked direction much of the time.  There were multiple scenes in the film that didn't really do anything to make the film stronger.  If anything, they diluted it.  Besides from that, Hanson did a good job of directing a first time actor in a lead role and a wonderful job in recreating what seemed to be a very authentic world.  Certainly not a waste of time, just frustrating when one compares it to Hanson's last two films.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Incredible drama,"8 Mile is an incredible drama that's inspiring, extremely witty, gripping and enjoyably grounded. It also definitely doesn't feel like your average biopic even if it's narrative is really formulaic. Eminem gives an incredible lead performance and Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Phifer and Evan Jones are all great. Curtis Hanson's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and consistently energetic. It's well paced and the soundtrack is excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"It's Aaa'ight, but it ain't that good tho","The story is based with a good premise about a struggle from the bottom. But the development wasn't that good. the side conflicts are too messed up they don't really intertwine, they are more like entangled on each other. The whole movie is just one slow work when it's about pace building. The editing doesn't help clear the mess up either. Although I must say that the mood of being quite gloomy and cold was maintained well and stable throughout the entire movie.The acting is quite nice. Eminem did quite a nice job, one so predictable considering he is playing his own real-life experience. Kim Basinger also do quite good, although she doesn't really get the drift. So does Brittany Murphy in her role. The real attraction from this movie is those tight rap battle scenes and also.the freestyle lyrics. A 6 out of 10 is from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Pre-wrapped rap,"Much of the action in 8 MILE takes place at ""slam poetry"" competitions. The best way to describe these events as they are portrayed in the movie is to envision a bunch of over-sized children, standing around a garage/clubhouse, pretending to be Don Rickles spouting insults in the form of obscenity-laden Dr. Seuss rhymes to the pounding rhythms of bad disco; not so much as comedy routines, but as a form of warfare designed to humiliate and degrade an opponent. Rap -- music for people with no musical talent performed for people with no musical appreciation -- has taken the art of poetry and left it beaten and bleeding in the gutter. An art form created to extol on the beauty of life and to reveal the innermost sentiments of the poet has become a popular entertainment composed of superficial crudity, anger and mean-spirited verbal sadism.Eminem, the great white hope of rap, adds at least one extra element to the mix: Self pity.Obviously, I don't ""get"" rap. As poetry, it is as complicated as nursery rhymes, without the innocence. The lyrics tend toward the hateful and condescending, a tough-guy attempt to justify poetry by turning it into a weapon. Melodically, its seems to depend on a pounding beat, which quickly becomes monotonous. And those who defend it as an urban art form, a from-the-streets poetry that cannot be divorced from the racial and social roots from which it sprang, seem to be making a desperate attempt to overlook the inherent racism, sexism and homophobia of the material. If you criticize the message, you're criticizing the source; i.e., to hate rap is to reveal yourself as a racist.Into this milieu came Eminem, a.k.a. Marshall Mathers, a white boy in a black man's game. Unlike his predecessor, the artificially flavored poser Vanilla Ice, Mathers could at least claim to be from the streets. And apparently he is good at his craft, though personally I can't tell good rap from bad rap. But, it seems his main contribution is that he legitimized rap for white audiences; primarily white, middle-class teenage boys who feel they can now do the ""black"" thing and not look too foolish (though Justin Timberlake, disproves this). Eminem became sort of the Pat Boone of rap. But, being white, Eminem could still be criticized for his racism, sexism and homophobia by critics who would feel uncomfortably politically incorrect doing the same about black rap. Presumably, minorities have a right to bigotry that whites don't.Anyway, that is where 8 MILE comes in. It seems to be an attempt to legitimize Eminem as a more mainstream celebrity -- to clean up his image, in much the same way PRIVATE PARTS tried to make Howard Stern look like a swell guy. To its credit, the film doesn't try to give us a major whitewash, preferring instead to perpetuate Eminem's prepackaged image as an embittered rebel. The film has been compared to Prince's PURPLE RAIN, but it perversely has more in common with The Beatles' A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. That landmark musical took The Beatles image of being impish pranksters and joyous musicmakers and centered it in a pseudo-biographical slice of life comedy. Eminem's film does the same in the other direction, placing his crafted image as a put-upon, angst-ridden, victimized teenager against a pseudo-biographical backdrop of urban depression. It is telling that while The Beatles sang about love and longing, Eminem's repertoire seems to consist largely self-pitying rants about how miserable his life is. He seems to appeal to the same core audience that identifies with Holden Caulfield and reads ""The Catcher in the Rye"" repeatedly -- assuming, of course, that Eminem's fans actually read.I don't know just how accurate the film is, but I do have trouble believing that improvised poetry sessions would attract large numbers of disenfranchised urban youths, or that a largely black audience would get all charged up over hearing a white boy spouting badly rhyming verses filled with references to ""Leave it to Beaver."" The film's genius is that even though it is yet another story designed to show white superiority -- even when invading a uniquely African-American culture -- it makes the white boy appear to be the victim of the racism.As for Eminem, I don't see any long term cinematic success for him. Though he wears the persona comfortably, there just aren't that many roles for mopey, dopey, petulant, perpetually unhappy twentysomething teenaged boys. The film itself will find its place as a cultural oddity and as fodder for trivia games: i.e., What is the only Oscar nominated song not to be performed at the Awards show because of its use of obscenities? Answer: Eminem's ""Lose Yourself"" -- which, by the way, is the only Oscar-winning song to include the word ""vomit."" That says something right there.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A lot better than expected.,"To be honest, I started hearing the hype a couple of months ago. Normally, you start to believe the hype and build the movie up in your head.  By the time you get to see the movie, there is no way in hell you're actually going to enjoy it.  Basically, see this movie with an open mind.I'll be honest, the plot of the movie isn't going to be the most complicated or original piece you've ever watched.  The power in this movie is from the performances of its cast and the vision of its director.  8 Mile is a moving movie if you can get past the hip-hop subculture.  Eminem does a convincing job of playing a tortured an unconfident man trying to make it.  It's pretty much a typical coming of age story, but it will capture you for the most part, for most of the movie.",,Anonymous,Music
One for rap fans,"Eminem plays aspiring rapper Jimmy (nickname Rabbit') who lives in a trailer in Detroit with his mother (Kim Basinger) and his little sister. The story of 8 Mile' is pretty uneventful.  When we first meet Rabbit', he has just broken up with his girlfriend but he soon finds new romance in the form of Brittany Murphy.  We see him hanging out with his buddies and by day, he works at a steel pressing plant while trying to build up the nerve to compete in the rap duels' which take place at the local club.  Although Rabbit' has the raw talent, his nerves get the better of him at his first attempt and he freezes when he is passed the microphone while an all black audience heckles him.The lead role is one which is hardly going to stretch Eminem but he does give a credible performance and I emerged from the cinema liking him a bit more than when I went in.8 Mile' is a very well acted film but I did not find it a great film.  This is one which will be enjoyed more by rap fans.  During the rapping scenes, I felt like I would have benefited if the speed of the lyrics were either slowed down or printed on the screen as subtitles.  Also, the ending was a little abrupt which for me took away the sense of personal triumph which Rabbit' must have been feeling.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"Explosive, 21st Century Take on the Macho Rock 'n' Roll Movie","""8 Mile"" forcefully brings rock' n' roll movies into the 21st century.While it has striking similarities to Elvis Presley and Beatles movies in how it uses autobiographical elements to make its similarly charismatic lead star comfortable in a new medium to sort of present his own story, Curtis Hanson's direction and the cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto (of ""Amores Perros"") create a thrilling environment for him to explode.Like ""L.A. Confidential,"" Hanson is terrific at getting up close in macho environments and bringing us right into their verbal and actual violence. While I'm quite sure my ignorance of hip hop slang and culture led me to miss references and the point of much conversation, it did seem to me that Hanson captured the why and how behind Eminem's rage.The movie's climax is the epiphany when his constructive genius takes over as he learns to channel his anger into his lyrics, and to even take it a level beyond the insulting toasting of the local Detroit battle-of-the-rappers to forge a new persona (what will eventually become Slim Shady among other images) and a new kind of rap that will sweep the nation.It is ironic that here in Detroit (or as the dialog and the credits call it - the 313) how few of the young adults have cars (even though Eminem's character is working in an auto parts plant), and are constantly cadging rides from each other to avoid the humiliation of taking the bus.Of course the women in this desolate Motor City, that is an urban recall of the ""Mad Max"" movies, are either beloved innocents or are traitorously duplicitous; I was taken aback how much of a calculating groupie Brittany Murphy's character is, unlike the usual devoted, loyal girlfriend in such movies.If the closing song is originally written for the movie (and I don't know if the sing-along audience had seen the movie before or knew the soundtrack), it should be considered for Academy Award ""Best Song"" as it brilliantly describes the movie and the character's post-life.It was not appropriate, however, for a parent in the row behind me to bring a small child to this film (and not just because the kid talked through the whole movie); even if they expose them to profanity-laded rap music at home, this is a mature movie with mature scenes that would be quite disturbing to young children.(originally written 12/15/2002)",9.0,Anonymous,Music

I was pleasantly surprised with how good this movie was, even though they say it kind of parallels Eminem's life, you can tell they've tried to show a more kinder/intelligent side of Eminem that he obviously doesn't portray in his songs. All the characters were played well, they weren't over the top nor did they change who they were in the film like most other Hollywood films.Eminem definitely deserved the oscar for ""lose yourself"", this film deserves more credit",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A very good movie about a fantastic artist,"I have seen a few of these ""musician trying out as actor/actress"" movies and this is by far the best one. Eminem, or Marshall Matters or Bunny Rabbit is not a fantastic actor, but he does good in this movie about his late teenage years. My favorite part of the movie is when he is battling the guys from the gang ""Tha Free World"" and manage to say to the gang ""how can six d*cks be p*ssies?"" I laughed hard at that one :) I really don't know if this is a correct display on how he grew up but all in all this is a good movie. Kim Bassinger does a great job as Eminem's disturbed mom. If you like hip hop and battling you will enjoy this movie. I rate this movie 7",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Rabbit Run,"Full disclosure, as someone born and raised in Michigan, near-ish to Detroit and a big fan of Eminem, I have a pretty heavy bias here. The fact that Mathers is actually a decent actor (admittedly he's playing a version of himself here) really was a surprise treat and he's obviously an incredibly skilled rapper. Some of the battle scenes where he's going at it with these other people were incredibly energizing. There's also a really fascinating case of racial discrimination involved here that's pretty unique really and it could've very easily been offensive but I thought it was handled very well, possibly because it's based on a real story.This is a really solid movie, fan of Eminem or not. Obviously fandom is going to improve the experience but the story here is universal enough to go beyond that. It's all about someone beaten down and oppressed trying to use the skills he has to make something of himself. It's the American Dream at it's core. Absolutely worth a watch, be ready for some harsh language and hard to watch moments but the performances here are all really incredible.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
good overall hip-hop movie...,"This is a good movie as far as showing part of the World to many who don't care about this culture, just exactly how life in it for some can be. A rate it a 7 because it could be better in almost every area, this is mainly for Eminem/Rap fans in general I'd have to say, so if you don't really like Rap don't bother. But, if you have an open mind and would like to just find out more about the HipHop culture then this is a movie I suggest. Eminem does a very good job in his acting debut, showing many emotions many fans & parents of fans never knew about, especially the way he connects with his baby sister in the movie. I think this movie could have a sequel that'd be better then the prequel showing him just break into the Rap game as an underground cat and making his way up. But, yeah hope you like the movie and enjoyed my comments.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Grass Is Greener At The Trailer Park,"There's no denying that Eminem has an intensity that's initially charismatic along with a definite rhythmic and verbal flair sufficient these days to enrapture large portions of the suburban young.  What isn't adequately observed, though, is the extreme narrowness of his art as revealed in this film.  Essentially, he's engaging here in merely occasional poetry, extended rhymed insults which don't merit hearing - in my view - apart from the circumstances which give rise to them. Nevertheless he has been hailed for these in some quarters as a genius, whereas he reveals at most a modest talent.  His acting, too - if indeed he is an actor - has been overrated, given the limited requirements both the story and the semi-biographical role in ""8 Mile"" place upon him. Largely, he moves through the film in a single mood, one in which a charismatic intensity is joined to a pretty consistent, if cryptic, self-fascination. His role is actually the sentimental one of noble savage, but freed of lumpenproletariat trappings, so we find him here - oddly enough - both defending gays and sporting not a single tattoo.  A low view of women, however, remains essentially intact. The film in itself is a contemporary variant of that genre which has been called the ""slum pastoral."" Virtue, authenticity and even real creative spark are to be found apparently only where both philosophy and experience would lead us least to expect them - among certain  insulted and injured trailer park types. Presumably, a middle-class or even more privileged upbringing by itself would disequip one for real achievement in the field of rap music. In short, this film reeks of what the satirist Tom Wolfe in a different context identified as a mind-numbing ""nostalgia for the mud.""",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"A lighter film than expected, a street feel good movie. Enjoyable none the less.","I was very surprised by the lightness of the film, having heard that this was the unofficial story of how Eminem started, and hearing how tough and violent his life had been, I had thought this film was going to be far grittier and tougher than it was. As it stands, I was surprised by the ease of the life of the character, he had a job, his Mum was actually not that bad, and many of the fights that were started were purely down to him. However, that said about the story, the Rap battles were powerful and enjoyable, and some of the scenes have surprising humour  I laughed so much when the poor guy shot himself. Eminem also shows a good talent for acting; although one would suspect he is simply playing the character he played most of his life. Overall, a good movie, but if, as the title song suggests, you have one chance at making it, this characters chance wasn't that apparent. A not truly bad family life, and life just seems to turn around for everyone before our hero's chance seems to arrive, and after all that it doesn't seem like a payoff after all, especially for something that promises a feel-good pay off.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Cause There Ain't Such Thing as Half Way Crooks.""","I enjoy hip hop from time to time. Much like other genres, it's one that has infinite potential, though I'm unsure if the artists who perform rap always take on that potential. Certainly, hip hop has managed to diversify and expand into different genres and ideas over the years, but there's still this sense of holding back, of not going to its fullest potential. It's an issue that I see in many genres, of many different types of mediums.It's ironic that many people have dismissed rap as vulgar, inflammatory music for the masses, considering that's how jazz, rock n roll, and country started. Trashy genres that attracted a niche audience before being taken over and refined by better craftsmen. Yet hip hop is different from those genres, as it mainly relies on lyricism, rhythm, and good production, rather than a combined effort of skilled musicianship, lyricism, and vocalization. Even such people like Ben Shapiro have dismissed hip hop/rap as an art form, as well as a form of music. Though he has certainly been taken to task by other commentators and critics on this matter.To counter Shapiro, I've encountered rap albums that have turned out to be just as impactful, thoughtful, and touching as any other piece of music that I've encountered. For example, I found Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City to not just be better than 90% of rap albums being produced today, but one of the most thorough and moving explorations of growing up in an impoverished neighborhood and the struggles with experiencing and avoiding the allure of crime and the lingering trauma that comes with it that I've ever encountered since Boyz n The Hood and NWA's original Straight Outta Compton, his following album To Pimp a Butterfly was another one that I found to be just as touching, profound, and soulful as any other album that I've heard in my life. On the other hand, it's a wild, surreal journey into the psyche of a man, exploring issues such as mental illness, political strife, and moving on from traumas of the past. Biggie Small's Ready To Die also comes to mind, combining dark, introspective lyrics with fun loving, celebratory anthems in a way that has never fully been topped (though his friend and later rival Tupac Shakur would give him a run of his moneyThen there is Eminem (alas, we're getting somewhere), an artist that I find myself impressed by as much as I'm frustrated by him. I think that he could certainly make something to the quality of Good Kid, MAAD City or Ready to Die if he really put his mind to it, but I find that he takes the easy route a lot of the time and seeks to be provocative for the sake of it. He's even lamented on this limitation that he's put on himself over the years, in his own words:""I've created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more.
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver.""But Eminem remains interesting to me. There's a raw intensity to him, both in his music and in his personality. Even in his interviews, you can see a tension within him, as if he's withholding something from us that he's holding on tight to. There's also an intense anger and hatred that seeps through his work as well, which bleeds from the intensity that comes from his persona, even with the fun loving Slim Shady, there's still that intensity and danger to him.It leads us to 8 Mile, which I found to be probably one of the most honest explorations into Eminem's life. This comes hardly as a surprise, as the film is autobiographical of Eminem's life, considering that 8 mile is the road in Detroit where Eminem grew up. But I also found it to be one of the greatest expressions of Eminem's talents as a lyricist and as a rapper, as much of the film's most excellent moments comes from the rap battles, such as the ending one between Rabbit and Papa Doc, which has become one of my favorite film scenes of all time. The utter rage and adrenaline that runs through the scenes makes it just as intense as any thriller that David Fincher could dream up, also retaining wit and a mastery of language. It showcases the power of rap, and its unique form of self expression.Much of the strength of 8 Mile comes from the performances, Eminem shows an immaculate screen presence, now granted he is playing a version of himself, but he brings that intensity that keeps him so interesting, while also not afraid to show vulnerability and humanity, and most of the other characters also stand out, much like Rabbit's loyal friends Cheddar Bob and Future, or the late Brittany Murphy's turn as Alex, or the sleazy Wink. But the one who steals the show asides from Eminem is Anthony Mackie, who manages to rival Eminem's intensity as his rival Papa Doc, bringing a raw anger and intimidation and also showing a gift for rapping, bringing a nice flow while also bringing the intensity and aggression that makes hip hop such a challenging genre to master. I also appreciated the general progression of the characters and their lives and personal arcs that they go through, feeling natural and not at all cheap or tacked on.There's a few films that I often recommend to hip hop fans and aficionados for good measure, like Boyz n The Hood or City of God. But I'll gladly add 8 Mile to the list of great hip hop films. Perhaps some day, we can be in a world where we can listen to our music freely and without scrutiny, and without worry about if it can actually be considered music.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
entertaining,"I did enjoy this movie while watching it but afterwards, when my adrenaline lessened, my opinion kept sliding down on the rating scale 7.5.....7......6.5......6.The characterization is flat and the story is limited. Throughout the whole movie I was waiting for the last rap battle to take place (Ok, already, stop the BS and get to it)--which was fabulous, and I will probably purchase the movie just to watch that scene again. And I can't help but like Eminem;  he is a charizmatic individual. I did enjoy the glimpse into lives that are completely unlike my own. And I am a sucker for Eminem's music. So I would recommend the movie for a one time viewing, but probably not much more than that.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Modern day Saturday Night Fever......kind of,"I'd heard good things about this movie and then eventually I saw Scary Movie 3(what was I thinking renting that?), in which there is a brief parody of 8 Mile. It intrigued me enough to rent this. I certainly enjoyed this movie, which was good on many levels.The story is set in the mid 90s in the poorer districts of Detroit. It follows a white rapper trying to succeed in an almost completely black music style. The similarities between Saturday Night Fever and 8 Mile represent themselves in the main character's families, their work, their friends and in their one real talent. In the case of Saturday Night Fever it was dancing, in this movie it's rap music.This was a good movie to watch and the performances from all the main characters were excellent. It's difficult for me to relate to the environment in which the movie was set and the prejudices a 'white trailer trash' rapper would face, not having experienced anything like it.

A good modern story reminiscent of the old school days,"Let me start by saying, I had little knowledge about Eminem before going to see this movie. I am a fan of rap music up until the early 90s, but haven't been too interested in anything that I've heard recently. I can't name you an Eminem song and the few minutes of his music that I'd heard before this movie definitely weren't my style. When I saw a preview for this movie, it looked like it might be mildly interesting, but definitely wasn't on my must see list by any means. Yesterday I read my good friend Vince's review of the movie at Qwipster's Movie Reviews and decided to go see it. It was a good modern story reminiscent of the old school days where rappers would ""battle"" each other with freestyle raps. I love the scene where B. Rabbit dogs the guy in the lunch line who is making fun of other people. Back in the day, these battles were common. Rappers Kool Moe Dee and L.L. Cool J had an ongoing feud and each would come out with songs dissing (before dissing was a word) each other. But more commonly, it was just a way to trash your enemies in the street in a non-violent manner or a little good-natured ribbing among your friends. The overall story was a semi-autobiographical tale of a young man struggling against the odds to make it big. Not knowing Eminem's story, I can't say how close this movie is to his life, but it's a pretty good story. Though fairly typical and predictable, it's well acted especially by Eminem and Kim Basinger. I think it's safe to say that I won't become a big fan of Eminem's music, but he was good in this movie.*** (Out of 4)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Nice Musical!,"8 Mile is a very good musical. I was reluctant to see this at first, but I got this on Christmas of last year so I had to see it. 8 Mile stars Eminem as a white rapper. He lives in Detroit and his whole life is messed up including family life. He appears in rap battles, but can't seem to win. All the sudden, his talent is recognized. What will happen? You just have to find out. First off, that acting was actually better than I thought. They all had great chemistry together. I liked Kim Cattrall as the mother. Second off, the music was great. I am not a big fan of rap music, but I liked the the songs especially ""Lose Yourself."" Finally, this movie has many apparent messages hidden through the plot.

"A great film for Eminem fans, but for Curtis Hanson followers...?","Two kinds of filmgoers may want to see 8 Mile, fans of Rap/Eminem and those who thought Curtis Hanson's ""LA Confidential"" was one of the best films of the last few years. Eminem films are likely to be very happy. The high vote given the film by females under 18 confirms that. Eminem turns out to be a surprisingly good actor and the music is brilliant.Followers of Curtis Hanson like me may be less enthusiastic. The film is certainly interesting and well made, but lacks the mix of excitement, tension, mystery, comedy, sex, drama and star performances that makes LA Confidential interesting to watch over and over again. Eminem plays Jimmy's, whose relationships with his friends, family, workmates and girlfriends are well handled, as are his efforts to break into the commercial world of Rap music. But this is all quite low-key stuff compared with the dazzle of LA Confidential. And Detroit at night or gloomy daylight is at the opposite end of the USA to sunny Los Angeles.Maybe there lies a clue to why Curtis Hanson chose to make this film.

a movie that makes you smile,"8 Mile is what a lot of the critics say. They praise it with great reviews and when I saw this in theatres I knew I HAD to get it on DVD because it wasa great 2 hours. Sure it relates a lot with Eminem's real life but a lot of it is a story. This movie is so good that people who saw Rocky will like this a lot because 8 Mile has its moments that have the feel of Rocky. Yet this is still a rap story of a white man named Jimmy Smith Jr.. He feels he must win a rap battle in order to get some recognition in hopes to be a rapper. He has his friends Future, Chedder Bob and finds romance in a beautiful girl named Alex. As things progressively get worse in ""Rabbit""'s life, he still finds a need to win one of the competitions, through all of the crap that is in his life. This movie is (of course) more for the teens, as they will enjoy it so much more than saaaay, teen parents who hate rap, language, sex, and drugs. But the ingrediants that the adult may dislike are the very ingrediants that make 8 Mile a winner for all who enjoy today's realities. 7.9/10-- my professional rating",,Anonymous,Music
Wiggerdom 101,"I took to watching this film like I take to swallowing pink antacid. I had been subjected to the music, of course, since I live in a major city where unrestrained car stereos blast all sorts of monotonous dribble. I was most resistant to experiencing the culture of trailer trash sensation, Eminem. Since I am what Eminem would call a ""faggot"", I feel that I must speak on his level when commenting on his art. It is art. I recognize the artfulness in it all: His lyrics, his film, his persona. I also recognize the cold blooded nature of the culture he promotes and glorifies. I would conjecture that some black men might also protest about this portrayal of black male culture. Yet, I also know that this wigger world view is out there in America. So, I have to admit that the film served an educational function for me. It was akin to watching one of the many films about Nazis or the KKK. I also know now to avoid wiggers and their kin, since they seem committed to a culture of violence and intolerance. The intolerance is the most base kind, since its chief targets are education, achievement and good manners.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Best film ever!!,"Ok admittedly I am Eminem's biggest fan ever to begin with, but there is no bias!! This really is the best film ever!

"Really, one of the best musicals I've ever seen.","I will say this, despite my reputation for hating popular movies (look at my other reviews!) I have to say that 8 Mile ranks right up there as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Certainly it's one of my favorite musicals, even though it REALLY doesn't count as a musical per se. Eminem stars as a rapper trying to Make It Big while facing, oh you know, the White Trash Blues, eg, living in a trailer park, a next to nothing job, Kim Basinger etc etc. The only thing the of course keeps his motivated is his music, and trying to make it big in Detroit. Although he is quite talented, a lot of red tape stands in his way, eg, power hungry producers, gang members, Gillian Murphy, etc etc. What an amazing debut Eminem gives here. I guess since this is partly geographical, Mathers was able to put some of his own life into the character, but, with the glut of rap stars now appearing on the silver screen, Mathers is one definite standout. It will be interesting to see how he takes on a completely different character role (like he is rumoured for in the 'Have Gun Will Travel' movie).",10.0,Anonymous,Music
8 Mile - The Best Movie of The 2000s,"Summary: I am a big Eminem fan (a Stan, mind you). So I watched this movie mostly for the prime reason of Eminem being one of the actors. I did not really have high expectations for this movie. It ended up as one of the best movies I have ever seen. I also ended up watching it a total of 7 times. Not getting bored a single time. I know the movie from the beginning to the end, story line is great. Interesting and mind capturing, great deliverance and all actors were decent to good, excluding Eminem who was a GOD as an actor. One of the very best one.The movie is about this fellow white ""wannabe"" rapper Jimmy, who is seeking a better live and wants to quit living with his mom.Actors: 8 / 10 - Plot: 9 / 10 - Story line/Events: 10 / 10 NOTE: Some actors were half decent, some very good. So that is why actors get an 8 out of 10. Recommended: YES! Great rap moments, tho should be noted if you're not into hip-hop this will not be a movie of your biggest interest.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A good all round film a few mistakes but its still a good watch.,"This film is basically the rap version of rocky. A story of a useless nobody who battles his way up to the top of his game.I think Eminem is brilliant in it considering its his first film. Some of the moments in the film are very funny, and the rap scenes are the same top quality that we should expect from Eminem. However there are some bits that don't need to be in there and could of been edited out. i also feel that some of the more experienced actors aren't used to the ability they can create. Inparticular Kim's performance isn't that convincing because she is playing a totally unchallenging role. The fight sequences are well worked they all look real and aren't unbelievable they are kept simple and realistic.So all over a good watch, could of been better but still worth a quick look. Better than i thought it would be. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
What a waste of time,"What's the difference between thnis film and ""Cool As Ice"" starring Vanilla Ice?  This film has a better soundtrack.  That is the only redeeming quality of it, is that there's a catchy tune during the end credits.

A white guy trying to get respect by winning a ""rap battle.""  Yes folks, a ""rap battle.""  These gangstas don't use guns to take out the enemy, they use raps.  What a ridiculous film.

"It wasn't bad, but....","After viewing '8 Mile' I have to say that it definitely didn't deserve the accolades it received from critics, but it isn't a bad movie.  However, to anyone that watches this movie and thinks it's the greatest thing since sliced bread I do have two words for you: 'Purple Rain'.  This movie is basically a remake of the famous 80's movie starring Prince who battles his way from an alcoholic family and his own demons to ""win"" against the mean-spirited bad guy musicians played by Morris Day and the Time.  Scene after scene copied Purple Rain to the extent that I kept expecting Eminem to bust out with ""Baby, I'm a Star"" in the final scene.The film is shot well and the performances are actually good in parts. Kim Basinger is so good as the white trash mom that it makes you wonder how she channeled that performance without a little trailer park in her blood. Brittany Murphy is an exception (as usual) who fumbles around in her role like Ray Charles strapped in a Tilt-O-Whirl.Eminem, for his part, does a fairly decent job glaring and strutting about. Although I am no fan of rap music, the music throughout the movie is enjoyable and the ""rap battles"" are fairly engaging and funny at times.All in all, not a bad night's rental. It could have been much, much worse.",,Anonymous,Music
"Karate Kid goes to the 'hood, yo.","I had the opportunity to attend the first public screening of '8 Mile' at the Toronto Film Festival. It was introduced by director Curtis Hanson as a ""work in progress"", and was attended by a large contingent of Hollywood power-broker and film-executive types, all of whom I'm sure were curious to witness the outcome of the movie and gage the audience's reaction. Despite the director's caveat that the film didn't yet have final sound or picture, it was for all intensive purposes finished. And the result? A decent, if highly manipulative and incredibly formulaic movie. To Hanson's credit, the direction of the movie is skilled, and it rarely imposes itself on the flow of the narrative. As is his style, he rejects wacky angles and pretentious blocking and simply allows the characters to tell the story. And what about those characters? Well, despite all the public hand-wringing and worrying that Eminem has been doing about the quality of his performance, he is actually quite good. The real surprise isn't his acting ability, which is fine, but the extent to which he allows the film to grind down his badboy edges. Hardcore fans who are expecting Eminem in all his lewd, violent, shocking, homophobic, misogynistic glory simply won't find him here. Instead, we get to see Eminem as a caring brother, decent son, hard-worker, loyal friend, and a brave guardian of the rights of his female and gay co-workers. In fact, Eminem's character has so many wonderful virtues, the occasional angry or violent outbursts he has feel almost saintly. It's all more than a bit disingenuous. For Eminem the rapper, this is somewhat risky proposition, because in discarding his real-life thug image in favor of the role of virtuous hero, he may ingratiate himself to a legion of new fans who like his sensitive side, but he may just as easily end up compromising the well-cultivated bad-ass persona that has led to his success.  That's because in terms of pure rawness, 8 Mile is closer to a Disney flick than it is to one by Harmony Korine. But then again, as a giant love letter to himself, '8 Mile' was bound to feel more like a fluff piece than a candid window into his life. It portrays him as a persecuted, mythical hero type who has to overcome insurmountable obstacles in order to transcend his miserable, squalid circumstances. But somehow, it just doesn't seems consistent with his own personality, nor does it make for a very compelling or truthful film. In fact, the script mirrors manipulative crowd-pleasers like Karate Kid and Bloodsport so closely, it feels like they've simply dropped the template onto Eminem's life, inserted rap contests instead of Martial arts, and voila, you have instant mass appeal. 8 Mile is competently executed adolescent fare that is designed to capitalize on the current popularity of a modern icon using a well-trodden formula. As a film, it is both well-produced and unoriginal. Which would be quite consistent with his music, I suppose.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not great but interesting,"""8 Mile"" is basically a biopic of singer Eminem. That he plays the lead character in the film just gives more reason to believe this. Kim Basinger, who plays his mother, allegedly based her own role on Eminem's accounts of his real mother.It's about a young white rapper from Detroit who wants to make it big but has to cope with personal issues along the way, which he vents about through his music.Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"") is a surprising choice for director but it works out well - the film has a grungy, gritty urban feel to it.The acting is pretty good - Eminem got a lot of attention when the film came out but to be fair he's really just playing himself; I wasn't in awe of his performance as some critics claimed to be.

Walking down 8 Mile Road,"Warning! Content of this commentary is absolutely weak in its grammatical aspect, because it's author is Russian, lives in Russia and is just a 16-year old boy.If you look through this new 50 Cent's piece of… let's say hip-hop movie (be accurate - watching it may cause some mental disease), you can remind 8 Mile and say to yourself, that Hanson's film could be much worse. Of course you can also say that this project would never happen if Eminem hasn't been so popular. But he has, so this movie inevitably happened (just like Get Rich or Die Trying'). And first of all it's a film about rap and it's an Em's biography. But Curtis Hanson is the man. He didn't try to catch the whole rap history, not even tried to shoot the part of it. He only made very good Hollywood drama about… maybe we can say lose cannons - white people (B-Rabbit, Cheddar Bob) of hip-hop, and about modern (still, though 10 years had passed) juveniles. And he completed this mission. He worked like a good spy - for two different sides, categories of people. I mean this movie is interesting to both hardcore rap fans and 'normal' people (sorry for such classification, I pretend to be a rap fan myself). It works because we have, the first, a strong dramatic line (our hero 'lost himself') and love story (despite it's rapper style), the second, a good atmosphere of the hood (but there's nothing good in it really). And what (who) makes this film great is Em. There were so much pros and cons, arguments and battles (even in Russia) about his acting ability (or maybe possibility), but he had done the job as good as he could and even better, especially during his rap episodes. Having no problems with acting, he also perfectly shows emotions through his texts. But even if he had some, actors around him were ready to help the star with their considered performance. The only thing that decreases my final mark is, as I was saying, Hollywood production. Curtis Hanson is still the man, but I don't understand why he decided to restrict his actions by creating the proper atmosphere and chemistry. 8 Mile is too standard with such photography and edit. There is also nothing to read between the lines, Eminem has his music deeper. Though we have to think about his future destiny, about possible career of Murphy's character, there's nothing beside that. Other characters are as simple as spoon witch Neo tries to bend. I think it's 8. P.S. Once again I say sorry for my language.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Definitely a Stroke movie for Eminem,"This movie shows some of the grit of modern day mo-town.  The acting is generally solid, and while the story may be in-part autobiographical, it's one big tribute to Eminem.  He's heroic in almost every scene, saving little girls, trying to get his mom on the right path, sticking up for his love interest until he finds out she's sleeping around, overcoming racist black folk in Detroit who don't want him to succeed, and spreading his genius for rapping.  It doesn't get overly laughable, but it is ridiculous at times. The tension in many scenes is good, and the dirt and seediness are captured. If you're a big fan of Eminem, you'll probably like this movie, but all in all, I give this a modest recommendation.  To the extent the film is biographical, it appears to be quite biased.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Must see for any eminem fan,"If your a fan or interested in the rap legend Eminem this is a must see for everybody really!

Kim Basinger's performance is solid as usual, she plays eminem's(rabbit's) useless momma, which he still loves. she's really good. Brittany Murphy plays rabbit's love interest! yet again another solid performance! this film concentrates on how maybe eminem's life was in some parts, or attempting to give you an idea of what it's like for some people trying to make a name for himself, and try to live a good life although you do bad.

Love the song pass on the movie,"I just love Eminem's music. As he says, there is nothing else that speaks to the soul of tortured people. If your life sucks or when it sucks at times, put your headphones on, crank up the volume and listen to the anger and beautiful poetry just take you away.That said the movie is pretty bad. The story is predictable, the acting is amateurish, there isn't enough of his music. I really wish they did his story some justice with some decent actors and not him definitely. They could've added some more tension, developed the characters more, the girl friend especially is super under developed. His motley crew are just one dimensional.The movie definitely can be skipped. Just listen to his music :)",6.0,Anonymous,Music

8 Mile goes the distance.,"I never took much interest in Eminem, I just assumed he was a silly man with a chainsaw who liked to rant and rave with no good reason. I never imagined that I would want to see a film with him in. Then I saw the trailer for 8 Mile and I was fascinated. Hang on, I thought to myself...this looks like it could be ok. So I went to see it, half expecting to hate it.I know nothing of rap or hip-hop. It is a culture that has eluded me so far. So I went to see this film without even a vague understanding of the background to this music we hear everyday on the radio. I came out from seeing this film finally seeing the point, finally seeing what all the fuss is about.Eminem impressed me so much. His acting skills, his verbal dexterity. He could have taken advantage of this film and really used it to kiss his own behind. But all credit to him, he chose to show us his human side.I can't think of another artist in his position who would expose themselves like this.The story is refreshing and the scripting feels natural. The acting from the rest of the cast is great-though I often missed a few things as I couldn't keep up with all the American slang (I'm soooo uncool!). I have shown it to several people who have all commented on how much they enjoyed it considering they didn't really want to see it.In short the film has turned me in to a bit of a fan. I went out and got the film and the cds. I no longer think Eminem is a chainsaw weilding fool, but a talented and interesting man with something to say. Marshall, if you are out there, I am sorry I got you so wrong.I guess what I am trying to say is even if you think you can't stand the man, give the film a shot. You may just be suprised.",,Anonymous,Music
Much better than expected,"This movie turned out to be much better than I had expected. Even if you (like me) don't care much for Eminem or his image etc., this movie will surprise you.

I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected; it's certainly not a ""teen movie"" made just for hip-hop fans or fans of Eminem aka Marshal Mathers. The DVD special features are also worth checking out, especially the reels of the impromptu battles between the ""extras"" used in the movie from Detroit and the winners of those contests battling with Eminem.

Who knew that Eminem and Ralph Macchio had so much in common?,"8 mile is a decent movie, but the Karate Kid formula is getting old.  It is this cliche Hollywood formula that drags down the movie for me.  This is the urban retelling of the Karate Kid, just substitute rap battles for karate tournaments.  And yes there is a Mr. Miyagi character played by Mekhi Pfifer, just none of the ""wax on...wax off""...but wait he does tell the DJ to spin the record, so in essence he IS telling the DJ to turn the ""wax"" on and off.  Hmmmmm.There is even a group of rappers called the Free World that are this movie's equivalent of the Cobra Kai.  And you guessed it, they harass our poor protagonist Eminem.  The analogies can go on and on....see if you can spot the rap equivalent of ""The Crane.""  Actually get together with some of your friends and this could be a great drinking game...see if you can spot all The Karate Kid similarities.Granted, this formula is still fun to watch at times, and this movie is one of the better recreations of it, but I think what tainted it for me was the fact that this movie held itself out to be of dramatic importance and full of depth.  Even some critics led you to believe that this film is full of dramatic power.  It really isn't.  Watch it for the formulaic fun that it can be, especially if you like rap music, but don't forget the formula from whence it came.  Maybe we could even get a sequel where Eminem-san will use the rap equivalent of ""The Drum.""  We can only hope.  Til then...""Wax on...wax off...wax on ...wax off...""",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"Eminem Shines in a Gritty and Authentic Tale of Struggle, Ambition, and Hip-Hop Triumph","Curtis Hanson's film 8 Mile, which explores rap culture and the brutal reality of urban existence, is a captivating and genuine work of art. Eminem plays Jimmy Smith Jr. In his feature debut, and he gives a strong, unvarnished portrayal that reflects his own path from hardship to achievement. The movie follows Jimmy, a teenage rapper from Detroit who is having trouble making it through difficult circumstances in his family, the competitive underground hip-hop scene, and poverty. The story, which captures the spirit of the early 2000s rap scene and offers insight into the personal hardships that shaped Eminem's ascent to fame, is both compelling and emotionally poignant.

"`8 Mile' shows that despite the environment that surrounds an individual, success can be found through inner strength and an unwillingness to settle for what one is handed in life.","`8 Mile' shows that despite the environment that surrounds an individual, success can be found through inner strength and an unwillingness to settle for what one is handed in life. This theme is reflected most often in the character of Jimmy `B-Rabbit' Smith, played by Eminem, who is a fledgling rapper trying to find his voice in an environment that does not want to accept him. In many ways, this is a simple coming of age story, but I think the best comparison still comes from Sylvester Stallone in `Rocky.' Both Stallone and Eminem's characters are in negative environments, they both are looking to move up and out, but only have one real vehicle to do it. Stallone's was boxing, Eminem's is rapping.The inner strength theme is also played out through the film by the techniques that the director, Curtis Hanson, and the cinematographer, Rodrigo Prieto, use to tell the story. They are especially effective at using shot angles to convey the emotion of Eminem's character. In the opening scene of the movie, when Eminem is handed the microphone, they are quick to focus solely on him and the audience surrounding him, intimidating him. They use high angle shots to make him look smaller, more vulnerable, and also do their best to keep his battle opponent out of the shot, as to symbolize that Eminem's current battle is with his surroundings, not his opponent. They are also quick to zoom right in on Eminem when he is first handed the microphone, making him look trapped within the screen, symbolizing his trapped feeling on stage. The entire opening battle scene is symbolic of Eminem's feeling of helplessness, that he has no control over his situation.Hanson and Prieto do a wonderful job of weaving this theme of the sometimes negative impact environment and circumstances can have on an individual and how they can overcome these obstacles. Without this theme, `8 Mile' is nothing more than a showcase of the pitfalls of the inner city, falling into the usual belief that nothing positive comes from these areas. This theme changes the entire movie, making it a message of hope and courage, showing that an individual can overcome the pratfalls and accomplish their goals if they refuse to accept failure as the inevitable.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
8 Mile,"There is a close-up two-shot near the end of Eight Mile where Jimmy Smith (Eminem) is facing Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie). Both characters are in profile in a shot very reminiscent of Sly Stallone facing off with Mr. T in Rocky II. This is as it should be. When we look at the structure and theme of the film, Eight Mile could easily be described as Rocky does rap.In the Rocky movies (and for that matter in Flashdance), working-class nobodies in dead-end jobs are given a shot at the big time-a title match and admission to an elite ballet school respectively. While the formula is similar in all three films there are marked differences that make Eight Mile more than just another formula film.In this film, the American dream mythology is pushed to the background, and the lives of the inhabitants of the neighborhood are moved to the foreground. This movie also ends differently than the others, and the difference is important, but giving movie endings away is a major violation of the film critic's creed.I like movies where the setting becomes a character in its own right. Here the setting is just south of Eight Mile Rd. in Detroit. Eight Mile Rd. separates the poorer black community from the wealthy white suburban community, and Eminem plays a white rapper on the wrong side of the tracks.As the movie begins, we see him nervously preparing for a ""rap"" battle in which contestants go onstage and disparage each other in their rapping. Jimmy chokes and is forced to leave the stage in disgrace. Among his interracial group of supporters, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the one who sees real talent in Jimmy's rap and continues to push him.Kim Basinger plays Jimmy's mom, a woman who attaches her dreams to empty promises, alcohol, and bingo games. When Jimmy's fortunes take a downturn he is forced to return to the trailer where his mother lives with her live-in boyfriend and Jimmy's younger sister.If the movie were primarily about rap music, I probably would not have seen it. When I do listen to rap it is usually in my role as sociologist (as opposed to my role of music lover). I am not a fan of rap, particularly the misogynistic, homophobic form that Eminem is noted for. But the film is primarily about social conditions in America's abandoned cities and the inhabitants who are trapped and disenfranchised.While I am not a fan of Eminem the rapper (or for that matter, Eminem the person) I am now a fan of Eminem the actor. His performance is solid and has a stamp of authenticity that serves the film well. His work is enhanced by solid supporting performances from Phifer, Basinger, and Brittany Murphy. If you are interested in an engaging, slice-of-life film depicting the part of American society that most citizens ignore or avoid this is worth a look.If, however, your primary moral/aesthetic criteria for art involve the presence or absence of the big three (the big three being language, sex, and violence) be forewarned. Because the film depicts rap artists the coarse language is a given and it is pretty raw. The violence is minor compared to other similar films, but there are several scenes depicting sexual promiscuity here. The sexual promiscuity is used to reveal character (or lack thereof) and while graphic it is thematically redemptive in that it does show the negative consequences and shallowness of these fallen encounters. While the sexual encounters depicted are more graphic than viewers will see in the upcoming James Bond film, they are more positive precisely because they don't glorify the promiscuity as the Bond films do. In the end, this is a powerful film that goes beyond the cliches to give us an interesting depiction of urban America, but it is a rough ride. If you are easily offended by depictions of fallen humans in all of their brokenness, this film may just leave you shaken, not stirred.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Why isn't this movie #1 on the bottom 100 list?,"A friend gave me tickets to it.

Gritty!,"Waddya mean this movie is predictable? What's a blue-collar white rappin' guy gonna be doing that wasn't depicted here?Anyway, I thought that the movie showed a lot of guts in depicting the 'real America' and not the one where everyone lives in million-dollar houses in predominantly white suburbia. It showed a realistic depiction of  a blue-collar guy finding his own way. Sure some of the characters were a little on the 2-dimensional side but sometimes people are like that in life too.As for Mr Mathers performance; I'd like to announce that this is a fine start to a promising acting career. Many have tried before (Elvis, Whitney, Sting... ad nauseum) and failed. So, the script didn't exercise his acting ability too much but I believed in the character.Sure this isn't the 'true-to-life story of Marshall Mathers III' but it is analogous to some degree. The rap battles were particularly well photographed, directed and performed. The rhymes were awesome and hilarious and they showed Marshall's true talent.Look beyond the hype and I think you'll find a well-told tale.",,Anonymous,Music
Good Hip-Hop Film,"I'm not of rap music in general and I didn't think I'd enjoy a film starring rapper Eminem. But I did enjoy it very much. It is very enjoyable and intriguing. I even found myself enjoying a lot of the rapping, much of which was improvised I believe.There is a lot of rapping in the movie but it is crucial to the story. The story and acting are both very good. It tells an honest story about a man struggling to make ends meet in the ghetto. Recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Finally, a movie with a music star that's not just not bad, it's actually very good.","The entire cast and crew did such an excellent job with this movie that it could have easily been the best movie of the year if Scott Silver's script hadn't messed up a thing or two here and there. Finally, a movie with a music star that's not just not bad, it's actually very good.The discussion first starts with, who else, Eminem. He has come under some scrutiny because he is playing a character that is very loosely based on himself. Because of this, everyone seems ready to brush off his performance as either ""ok,"" or, ""pretty good."" There are two big things that disturb me about that. First, didn't Adam Sandler just get heaps of praise for playing a slight deviation from his normal characters in Punch-Drunk Love? Many seemed to think that it was the best performance of the year. And second, and most importantly, if anyone can name me just one other person - actor, director, music star, or anything else - that could have played Rabbit, please, let me know. There is not a rapper with as much talent in his lyrics or his rhymes as Eminem, so there is not another soul on this planet that could have played Rabbit (and if anyone E-Mail's me with the suggestion that Vanilla Ice could have done it, please, go find some help for yourself). Because of all this, Eminem gives one of the best performances this year. He is emotionally charged and you can tell that without him this would have been a bad movie. I don't know if it's because he's one of the biggest music stars in the world or something else, but he has a screen presence that is huge and magnetic.The rest of the cast holds their own. Mekhi Phifer is easily the standout as Future, Rabbit's best friend. I didn't know much about Phifer before this movie, but he is definitely a promising talent. He never tries to take over a scene from Eminem; he knows he is on the side to play Rabbit's best friend and advisor. The women in the movie are played down quite a bit. Basinger who last won an Oscar when working with director Curtis Hanson, won't be getting one this time around, but she does what she can with her screen time. We love and hate her as Rabbit's mother and I think that she does a good job of playing the typical trailer mom. A lot of critics seemed to think she was too beautiful to play the character. This is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard. Are these people honestly saying that there are no good looking people at all in trailers? Obviously, since all the rich higher class people are so beautiful. The other major female role is Rabbit's girlfriend, Alex, played by Brittany Murphy. Honestly, I'm as familiar with Murphy as I am with Phifer. Her character was the weakest one out of the bunch. We never got to know her at all, and I don't know if it's even correct to call her Rabbit's girlfriend. All they did was fool around once and we are expected to like her and take her words of wisdom to heart. Note to Scott Silver: don't put in a love interest just because you think there should be a love interest in the movie. Murphy herself is attractive, but not much more. She doesn't get to test her acting chops as much as she may have liked to.Now, the movie itself has some scenes that will blow you away. The very beginning is one of the best opening sequences I've ever seen. The very first shots show Rabbit standing in front of a mirror preparing for a battle. He looks at himself as if his reflection is the enemy, he makes fierce rapping hand gestures at himself and goes through all the lyrics he can think of in his head - analogous of a boxer waiting in the wings before a fight. The battles are all incredible; a battle is a duel between rappers where they each get 45 seconds to trade insults. In the end, the winner is judged by the roar from the crowd. The battles are easily the highlight of the movie because of their originality and their capability to take the movie onto another level all together. There are official battles hosted by Future and everyday battles at work or on the street, both of which work in their own ways. It is incredible how these insult trading sessions of freestyle rap can completely engulf you into the world of 1995 Detroit. I immediately understood that these insults were not personal, that they were a way of fighting without physically beating the hell out of each other (though there is a decent bit of that too outside of the battles). Every time Rabbit was one of the performers the energy just shot though the roof and my eyes and ears were at full alert. There is one scene in particular during a lunch break at Rabbit's job where a girl raps about the hardships and unfair treatment they get at their job. A man responds and puts her down, seemingly winning the battle before Rabbit steps in and puts him in his place. And then there is the final battle; it definitely does not disappoint. Each rapper gets a 90 seconds and  Rabbit gets to go first. He tells the crowd everything that his opponent is going to say about him from white jokes to cracks about living in a trailer with his mom, and then he goes on to decimate away his opponent and his entire gang.Another vital element of this movie is the settings. Hanson wisely chose to shoot in Detroit rather than cut costs and go across the border into Canada. Hanson now has an even more impressive resume adding 8 Mile to L.A. Confidential, Wonder Boys, and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle. The eerie run down image of 1995 Detroit is both realistic and visually wonderful. Hanson has always been known for being able to capture the essence of a large city well with Pittsburgh and L.A. being the settings for his last two movies. Will someone just give this man an award? He is one of the most consistently brilliant directors right now but his commercial draw is almost irrelevant, especially when compared to names like Soderbergh or Shyamalan. Though he is a less impressive screenwriter (what was he thinking with A Knight's Tale?), no one can question his talent as a director.For 8 Mile, although the script seemed to be left up to Eminem for the most important exchanges, Silver had a good message at heart. Instead of having the typical rags to riches story, he instead takes the approach of showing a young man who is going to work through his hardships and earn enough money to make it big himself without some multi-million dollar record deal coming out of the blue. After the final battle Rabbit goes back to his job where he has worked hard to earn extra shifts and make more money. In a sense it's anti-climactic, but it is abrupt and doesn't dwell on itself for long enough to bring the movie down from it's climax. Instead, it strikes the right tone as the movie fades out to the best song of the year (for a movie or otherwise) ""Lose Yourself."" I don't think a song has ever captured an entire movie and it's themes as well as ""Lose Yourself,"" and there may never be another song quite like it. Will Eminem get an invite to the Oscars? Don't bet on it, but it's not like the Academy ever gets it right anyways.As I left this movie I felt myself wanting to go to a real life battle, and if I weren't fearful for my life I may have done that. I got the same feeling coming out of 8 Mile as I did coming out of The Legend of Bagger Vance. Coming out of the latter, I wanted nothing more than to go play golf all alone on a beautiful serene golf course. Coming out of the former I wanted to be Rabbit - a poet from the ghetto who can work magic with his lyrics off the top of his head.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

8 Mile (2002) - Eminem's Inspiring Journey,"Before watching this movie, I was already a huge fan of Eminem's music. His songs have always been powerful and captivating for me. Eminem is nothing less than a hip-hop emperor in my eyes. One night, while searching for a film to watch, I came across 8 Mile. I decided to give it a try, and by the time it ended, I was thoroughly impressed and felt an even stronger connection to Eminem.To be honest, this is one of the best biographical films I've ever seen. The storyline is brilliantly crafted and seamlessly delivered to the audience. The movie portrays Eminem's struggles and his journey to success in a raw and authentic manner. It also does a fantastic job of capturing the essence of Detroit during that period, adding a rich layer of realism to the film.However, when it comes to the performances, I can't say they were equally remarkable. While the script and narrative were outstanding, the acting, in general, felt a bit weak to me. That being said, Eminem's performance stood out as natural and compelling, especially considering he was portraying his own story.What I appreciated most about the film was how it didn't sugarcoat anything. It presented Eminem's hardships and triumphs in a genuine way, making the experience all the more impactful. By the time the movie ended, I realized how quickly the time had flown, which speaks volumes about how engaging it was.In conclusion, 8 Mile is a must-watch. Whether you're an Eminem fan or just someone interested in hip-hop culture, this film delivers an inspiring and raw story that stays with you. After watching it, I gained a deeper appreciation for Eminem and the struggles he endured to reach the top.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Very good,"Set in the gritty and iconic streets of Detroit and starring Eminem in his acting debut, the movie revolves around a young, aspiring rapper named Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith who's trying to escape his dead-end life while chasing his dreams in the world of underground rap battles. What I love about 8 Mile is how it captures the struggle of trying to make a name for yourself in a tough environment. Detroit serves as not just a backdrop, but almost a character in its own right, showcasing the raw energy and hardship of the city during that era. The conflict between local rappers and the portrayal of gritty living conditions makes it all feel real and relatable. Eminem delivers a surprisingly strong performance, bringing authenticity to his character's struggles. And the soundtrack is fire! It's basically an almost perfect movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Stuck In Detroit,"To anyone over 30 and not familiar with rap music and its culture, watching Curtis Hanson's 8 MILE is bound to be a rather distancing experience. But given an open mind and the willingness to accept the movie on its own terms, this semi-fictional account of white rapper Eminem's nascent rise to fame has its rewards. That it's your basic ""A Star is Born"" story coupled with references to past ""troubled youth"" movies (the films of James Dean come to mind) makes the movie quite accessible to older audiences. Shorn of its profane language (there's a lot of it)and obligatory sex scenes, 8 MILE is a rather unremarkable tale of a young man's desire to escape the confines of work and life in downtown Detroit for a better life as a successful recording artist.At every turn Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith is confronted by stumbling blocks, be they domestic (his ""trailer trash"" mom is dating one of his former high school chums), work related (he's not on good terms with the boss at the auto pressing plant), or social (he's an outsider, being a white rapper in a Black rappers' world.) The world of contemporary Detroit, circa 1995, dominates this movie as much as Eminem's star performance. Eminem (real name, Marshall Mathers, for the uninformed) portray's a version of himself here - a kinder, gentler version. His Rabbit, for all the swearing and incendiary rap lyrics, is deep down a sweet natured fellow given to occasional outbursts of angry frustration, understandable considering what he has to deal with. As with ""Rocky"", another movie that vaguely resembles this new film, 8 MILE gets a lot of mileage out of pitting our hero against seemingly unbeatable odds . The city of Detroit, depicted here in all it's paint-peeling austerity by noted cinematographer Rodrigo Priesto, would give anyone pause. This kid's triumph over adversity makes for a fairly absorbing film experience, but aside from it's distinction as Eminem's fist big movie, the overall impression is one of numbing deja vu. What gives the project distinction is Eminem's very appealing performance. Under the expert guidance of director Hanson, Eminem proves to be a magnetic screen personality. Not a natural actor, he does come blazingly alive when he's in his own element. The rap music sequences are compulsively watchable, even though the uninitiated may weary of them after awhile.Dramatic scenes involving Rabbit's mom (played in convincing, frowzy fashion by the usually gorgeous Kim Basinger) are realistically put forth, and there is able support by other cast members, particularly Mekhi Phifer as a rap club owner and Tarryn Manning, striking in the brief role of Rabbit's ex girlfriend.Unlike most of Mr. Hanson's previous films, 8 MILE lacks the narrative drive that made L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE RIVER WILD so distinctive. For all its kitchen sink drama and stabs at realism, it emerges as only a middling achievement.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Direction by Curtis Hanson!,"Surprisingly good film starring the notorious rapper, Eminem. Directed by Curtis Hanson who's done such films as L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys. Brian Grazer of A Beautiful Mind produced the film. I admit, I had my worries about this film from the start. I'm not an Eminem fan and when I heard that he was making a movie, I thought this was going to be another teen-music sensation disaster. Some of you must remember Brittany Spears' film; Crossroads released back in February of 2002. And what about the Lance Bass flop, On The Line. Not to worry though, 8 Mile was excellent. The reason I went to see it was because of Curtis Hanson, whose work on L.A. Confidential was enough for me to want to see this film. I was very impressed by most of the performances in the film. However, Kim Basinger, who portrays Eminem's character's mom, isn't all that great. She is believable at times, while other times she's phony. But over all, the film was very impressive. It's important to point out that this film is not about Eminem specifically, but rather, loosely based on his life. ***",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Rocky Of Hip Hop,"Well, first thing off is that i am a big Eminem Fan and with this sort of movie it helps greatly.  I really enjoyed 8 mile.  There are many scene in which the hip hop generation will yell and scream for more.  If you are not a fan of hip hop then you may go in with your doubts, i say push your doubts aside and get in there.  the depth of the story of a single man trying to fight his own battles, both in rap and during his traumatic home life.  The other thing which has to be said is that Marshall Mathers can ACT.  Although at points the plot seems a little slow eminems performance never does, he really brings out the difficulty of the life he once lived.  The rocky relevence is in reference to the rap battles which take place through out the film.  Just like the battles in Rocky you'll want to punch the air with excitment and cheer loud when Jimmy Smith Jr finds his voice.

A truthful semi-autobiographical account built upon a recognizable movie formula,"Eminem's film debut stands firmly on its own as a truthful semi-autobiographical account built upon a recognizable movie formula, thanks in large to Eminem's well-rounded performance and director Curtis Hanson's ability to make the young rapper's struggles come off as authentic despite utilizing a handful of rather worn plot devices in order to get to them. Let's call it good workmanship. Or clever moviemaking. The picture not only recalls Saturday Night Fever, but also turned out to be just as significant for rap music as the 1977 film was for disco culture. And that's a well-earned accolade, because 8 Mile certainly goes about its task of informing and illuminating its audience on rap battling and the burgeoning Detroit hip hop scene with dilligence. Also, the ending is very tasteful. Based on a savvy script by writer Scott Silver (later of The Fighter and Joker), but it's Eminem's own pennings which really sparkle in here.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Mom's spaguetti.,"More than 20 years ago, the most important and bleak film in the history of Gangsta rap was released. Indeed, I am talking about 8 Mile, a feature film starring the famous rapper Eminem, made in 2002. Undoubtedly, a classic film that combines the gloomy world of the music industry with a satirical tone in some sections.This tape explores several facets of music that we had not seen, in the skin of ""Rabbit"", a rapper with great aspirations. However, to achieve this he will have to participate in a roast battle. Beyond how simple the premise may seem, the combination of funny and dark elements, characteristic of Eminem, and also the handling of a great soundtrack, gives it a touch of tension that few feature films bring with them. However, its most iconic point is the main theme of this one, ""Lose Yourself"", composed by Marshall himself.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Do you like rap music?,"You needn't to to appreciate this movie that makes you go deep into the world of rap like it's practiced and lived by the youths in the poor neighbourhoods, slums and trailers of Detroit mostly inhabited by Afro-Americans but also by some whites, all of those youngsters living together without showing any serious racist attitudes. This is also half biographical of Eminem the greatest rapper ever known and who does the main character in the movie. It's a very realistic movie showing the vivid relations between all those rap performers and fans and the contest rap battles they are involved in, trying to win a place in the sun which means to get a possible contract with a radio station or a record editor. These relations are sometimes very friendly and solidary sometimes antagonistic and violent. Besides this we have the depiction of the difficult relationship between the young rapper whose role is played by Eminem and his mother whose behaviour is not very orthodox, while at same time he cherishes and tries to protect his little sister. The dialogues are very realistic too in terms of corresponding to the real language that these youths use to express themselves.

Do better,"My first impression after I saw 8 Mile's trailer a few months ago was the same many people had. At that moment I was sure I wasn't going to see this joke of a movie, which only purpose is to keep selling that character called Eminem, who is funny, yes, he is, but I didn't necesarialy consider him an artist of any kind. Man if I was wrong! This is not quite an original movie, neither a blockbuster happy-ending flick. Luckily, it was directed by Curtis Hanson, a man who knows how to direct actors, like Kim Basinger, and people who wanna be actors, say Eminem or the girl who play his sexy girlfriend of the week. Before I get any further, I'd like to remark this: one thing that came to my head the moment this film started was, 'hey, what about 'Dancer in the Dark', I think there could be some similarities'. And I was right, just compare Eminem and Björk. Both music artist who tried acting the only way a non-professional can do it, feeling it for real, as if they wouldn't be acting at all. And this time works, as it worked with the emotive Dancer in the Dark. You keep comparing this two movies, I already did. Back to 8 Mile. Music, this movie wouldn't even exist without music. I'm not gonna say I'm a into hip-hop or rap, but I can feel music, I can feel the beat in my chest. This is one of those movies which have the right music at the right moment, and you can feel it. The scenes when ""Lose Yourself"" tune was beating in the background, with only one or two words of the lyrics we've heard on the radio, were ones of the best. As touching as these scenes were the battles scenes. Sadly my ear is no so good yet to understand english that well, that fast. (By this time I forgot about the subtitles in spanish, they were all wrong and didn't capture the core of the rhymes). Perhaps I could understand half of the rhymes, I bet you guys laugh more that me, although I catched some great lines and managed to laugh from time to time. In order not to make this too long, I'll add: you can do a great movie capturing the beauty even in ugly places, disturbing realities, and letting the hit song go on at the last scene as the hero walks away down by the alley.

8 Mile,"Definitely much more than I expected.From start to finish this movie had a flow like no other, it's dynamic like the lyrics played throughout it, the music in this film makes it feel so much quicker than it really is. The words engulf you, so much words and rhymes to think about and digest, every scene has a point, a reason, every moment is meaningful and fulfilling. The film although filmed in a dull way shows how reality was for Eminem, how it is for many people, the vague weather and setting of the movie creates this dull undertone of the movie making a realistic atmosphere and story. I also really liked how all the characters were introduced through music, each character had a distinct meaning and personality making this film that much more immersive. Being a big fan of music from that time and rap in general probably elevated my opinion on the film, I'd imagine not enjoying the film as much if I wasn't aware about the music played and the time period shown. Overall an amazing film in all aspects.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I went a second time with 5 teenage girls (again my daughter roped me into going).The Movie? not great but entertaining. A white man in a black man's world... A Rocky flick? This poor dude was fighting it all! He managed to keep his head up and made me feel good about the music my daughter is into. The ""f"" word was almost as prevalent as in ""South Park- the Movie"" Who cares anymore.. words are just words. There was some violence: Surprise... This is Detroit.  Leave really young kids home unless you want to give lessons in the birds and the bees afterward... I'd go no lower than 13.. and a mature 13 at that.All in all I liked this film.. I'll listen a little closer to Rap from now on... and become a little younger. I rate this movie:6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Good movie,"I didn't realy expect that this movie would be good, but I was surprised after watching it. I especialy was impressed by the lyrics of the (rap) battles.  Also the acting of Slim Shady could be much worse, like more famous singers who also try to score in acting. I would recommend this movie to all those who like rapmusic.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Just watch the rap battles on youtube,"1 week in the life of a white young rapper in Detroit where he has no money and doesn't fit in an African American culture.Very basic storyline with no depth in the characters and with events that has no logic (Eminem's new relationship specifically: suddenly happening and suddenly vanishing).Also, for a non American, I am surprised by how poor the neighbourhoods shown in the movie are. Not sure if some parts of Detroit are that deprived or not.Acting is really simple, Eminem is surprisingly not bad. Some comedy by the support actors, but nothing worth mentioning.The only good thing about this movie is the 3 rap battles which anyone can find them on youtube.

"Extremely entertaining, a MUST-SEE!","I went into this movie with high expectations, and 8 Mile did not disappoint.  With its modern humor and incredible rap lyrics, it kept me glued to the screen. Even if you don't like Eminem, you should see this movie. It portrays a young rapper trying to survive and make a name for himself in the ghettos of Detroit. It features many young talented actors. I wouldn't recommend it for old people or young children, but if you don't fall into one of those categories, be prepared to be amazed.",,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining and Original,"8 Mile is one of the surprise films of 2002, the reason why is because it was actually pretty good. Eminem makes a memorable debut as the star of this film. And most of the acting by the lead actors is pretty strong (Basinger and Murphy) are good as well, but some of the supporting cast is a little weak.Overall 8 Mile is entertaining and original. It gives us a good look at the ghettos of Detroit and the life of those struggling to make it in the rap industry. The direction could have been a little stronger (there were some scenes that appeared ""thrown in"" and some of the acting and dialogue was weak, but other than that this is a solid film; easily it is one of the years top 20 motion pictures. B- or 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A battle life!,"I appreciate a lot the acting of Eminem, he's so natural when he play the part even if he's acting a written script. I'm surprised about the many things that happen to this guy in so few time, he needs to face everything. It's so easy to empathize with him during the whole film. I like a lot the story as is written, it's so easy to follow. I appreciate discover what mean to partecipate a real battle, you have to be so mentally fast and creative to surprise the others and win, but at the same time you have to be able to follow the music and sing properly.

"Yes, it is official Eminem CAN act...","I was very fortunate to catch a sneak preview of ""8 Mile."" This movie has a little bit of everything to offer: Comedy, Drama, Sex, and a very raw look at the Detriot Hip-Hop scene. After seeing this movie you know longer question Enimem's talent. He can rap,act and look good doing it. He plays Jimmy Smith Jr. A.K.A ""B Rabbit"" a white freestylist in black Detriot. Everything seems to being going wrong in his life: he's forced to move back home, he has a dead end job, and his girlfriend left him. Jimmy has a dream of being a big rapper, but before he can accomplish this he has to get over his stage fright. After choking on stage he becomes more determined show all his talent. It all comes down to an EXTREMELY intense ""Diss-Off"" which makes for an awesome climax. You will walk out of the theater wishing you could rap.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Lives up to the hype,"Another rapper making a transition to acting?  Eminem receiving worldwide acclaim for his performance with some promise of an Oscar nomination? This is the kind of stuff the press just has a field day with.  But guess what? This is not your standard vehicle for an up-and-coming hip-hop star. Directed by Curtis Hanson, who made the wonderful ""LA Confidential,"" this is a deeply moving, thought-provoking, unpretentious drama that sheds light on a world I knew nothing about:  the world of rap battles.I'm not the biggest fan of hip-hop, but it's an art like any other.  What I don't understand is when a movie is filled with profanity, sexual content and violence, it's deemed as realistic, yet when a rap song contains those same elements, it's deemed as exploitative.  These rappers are simply placing a mirror up to reality.  How can you write about beauty and happiness when it barely exists in the world you live in?  These rappers live in a world filled with gang violence and drive-by shootings, so they have to write what they know about.  Martin Scorcese lived in a rough neighborhood growing up, and that's why he makes hard-boiled films about gangsters and other characters of that sort.  And rightfully so, he receives much acclaim for placing that mirror up to reality.I never knew about these rap battles, and I found them to be very interesting.  They're like boxing matches, only the competitors fight with words.  They search for each other's weaknesses, and do their best to mock those weaknesses via rap lyrics.Now onto Eminem's performance...Yes, he was magnificent!  Some critics and audiences claimed it wasn't a stretch for him, since he's playing a character that's so close to who he really is.  First of all, acting is not just about being ""another person.""  Just watch Prince's ""Purple Rain"" and you'll see what I mean.  Was Prince playing a character vastly different from himself?  Of course not!  But he was still horrible!  Acting is about expressing yourself and showing emotion.  And Eminem did a beautiful job at showing emotion, and what impressed me the most was there was a lot of scenes in which he had no dialogue and had to express the way he was feeling nonverbally.  I know, as an aspiring actor, that the hardest thing to do in acting is to be silent.  It's easy to scream your head off in an intense dramatic scene, and let out all your aggression.  But to communicate your emotions simply through facial expressions and body language?  That takes talent.  Not to mention that's a huge challenge for a first-time, inexperienced actor.  I'm sure Curtis Hanson saw something great in him or else he wouldn't have hired him in the first place, because Hanson is a very reputable director and is not a whore for the industry, who'll allow any popular music star to walk onto his set to make a boatload of cash. Second of all, Eminem's character wasn't a carbon copy of himself, but an extension of himself, just like the story was inspired from moments in his life, but it's not exactly an autobiography.  I recall one critic saying that if playing yourself in a movie were so easy, then anybody can act.  That rings very true.  Acting is something many people say they can do with their hands tied behind their backs, but once they're in the spotlight, they freeze up. So for all of you smart-alecks who feel that Eminem's performance wasn't a stretch, I'd like YOU to make a movie about your life, and let's see how effective your performance turns out to be.  Much easier said than done.The story is touching and powerful, yet at the same time surprisingly honest.  There are a few contrivances, like Eminem finding out one of his best friends is screwing his girlfriend, and we're faced with the cliched scene in which he catches them in the act and beats the crap out of the guy. But other than that, the story is amazingly realistic, which is especially evident in the film's conclusion.  It's not a tragic ending, nor is it happy.  It's actually a character-driven ending.  How often do we see those in movies?  The whole film is pretty much character-driven, failing to take the easy way out by manipulating the audience left and right with corny melodrama and sentiment.  Each character is rich and multi-dimensional.  I assumed that Eminem's trailer-trash mother would be the standard foul-mouthed, abusive wench.  But instead I grew to like her character, despite her drinking and sleeping around, because I got a real sense of her humanity and love for her son.  The most powerful scene, in my mind, is when Eminem gets the crap kicked out of him as his little daughter watches from the window.  At that moment I was nearly brought to tears.The performances by the supporting cast are also great.  Kim Basinger is great as the mother, and her performance (along with the way the character was written) helps add humanity to the role.  A less-experienced, less-talented actress would've probably watched every ""Jerry Springer"" episode for research and hammed it up to extremes.  Mekhi Pfieffer, who never disappoints, is also great.I'm proud that the song ""Lose Yourself"" won the Oscar, which is the first for a hip-hop song, because its lyrics are rich with meaning and I thought it would be immediately snubbed simply because it's a hip-hop song.  But luckily, the Academy voters kept an open mind, because it's really a beautiful song.I don't care if you're 18 or 60, love hip-hop or hate it, I recommend you see ""8 Mile.""My score:  9 (out of 10)",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Good movie with no real point,"This was a good movie to sit through and enjoy. The acting was good, yes it really was. Curtis Hansen is a great director. But the story has no real ending. If this is Eminem's life story then I was not impressed. I have seen better endings in a muppet babies show. I can not believe that this is being considered for the Academy Awards. The acting was good but by no means was it great. If Curtis Hansen was directing me, I could have done just as good. And considering Eminem is playing, pretty much, himself, he shouldnt get an oscar nomination.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Fight The Power,"In another era of American film, James Stewart might have been cast to star in this film. Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. (played by rapper, Eminem) is cast as a classic under-dog who overcomes incredible odds to achieve his dream. In one of James Stewart's most memorable roles, he portrayed a character who faced up to impossible odds, and vindicated himself from a political corruption debacle on the floor of the United States Senate. In 8 MILE, down-and-out White rapper, ""Rabbit"" Smith, in a stunning upset, wins over a skeptical audience, and triumphs as a major player on the city's musical scene. And, in an ironic use of Race, the fact that he is a White Man, in nearly all-Black Detroit, Michigan, only plays as one more strike against him. 8 MILE also boasts a great supporting cast, and Marshall Mathers (Eminem) has a very engaging Screen Presence.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"For Better or Worse, It's All About Marshall","As publicity-focused biopics go, 8 Mile is one of the better-executed examples. Although it's self-serving at times, this is also an impressively open and honest take on Eminem's roots and the self-imposed blockade of excuses he laid out for himself before catching so much as a whiff of stardom. The plot outside of Mr. Marshall Mathers is fairly simplistic and limited, though, with most of the cast simply orbiting the star and reacting to his angry, frustrated outbursts. I found the battle raps to be as intense and exciting as a good action scene, and the choice to limit them to a few key moments was a smart move that doubled their importance. Eminem himself is startlingly good in the lead role; it may not too much of a stretch to play yourself in the cinematic story of your own rise to fame, but I've certainly seen plenty try and fail. Authentic, street-smart inspiration that offers a fresh take on a tired old tale.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Not bad,"This is actually not a bad movie. It is a bit limited in scope, a week in the life of a young working-class guy living in a dilapidated part of Detroit. Split-up from his girlfriend, having to move back in with his Mum and her violent boyfriend in a trailer, fired from his job - at the start of the movie his life has hit rock bottom. All he has left are his buddies, and his only outlet is the rap scene where he is struggling to be accepted because he is white. And initially it goes wrong there too, when his talent fails him in a critical contest ('battle').In the middle part of the film he slowly finds himself back, but it is not an easy road. He meets a girl and loses her again, there is violence with a competing rap gang, big trouble with his Mum and her nasty boyfriend, and he struggles in his new job in a steel factory.Then, at the end, he 'finds himself', goes back into the rapping 'battles' and soundly defeats the reigning champion who is also the leader of the competing gang, and all should be well.But is it? Many people call this a typical Hollywood story, but the film does actually not have the typical Hollywood ending: he doesn't get the girl and he only goes back to his mind-numbing job in the factory instead of breaking through as a rap star. He may still escape, but we don't get to see it and we will never know. Equally likely he stays stuck here for the rest of his life - the film doesn't tell us.I think this is a fairly effective film with exactly the right bleak atmosphere, shot in the winter in an awful run-down part of Detroit, almost a slum. There is some good friendship and some nasty hatred and mindless violence. Eminem's acting is not all that bad given his lack of experience, although most of the time he is just in some kind of sullen mood. The actors playing his buddies keep him straight, but Kim Basinger is simply awful. An interesting glimpse of a sub-culture that many of us won't know at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Total waste of time,"This movie serves an example of how ""dark"" movie can be bad. Not being able to focus in a single scenario flow, this movie takes turns and dazzles you with pointless rap all the time there is nothing that actors can tell you. Is this movie really a musical? I guess not, since it pretends to be more of a drama, and the music supposed to give you a background to the hard life scenes from the Detroit poor people. I wonder how much Ms. Basinger was paid to agree on such a stupid role, she can do much better than that. Eminem, as always, is better musician than actor.I guess if this movie was shot, say, 15 years ago, it would be shown all over the former Soviet Union, just to show how life in US sucks, and prove that Russian people do live much better than that.Of course, not being black makes you miss some important things in this movie, taking into account that around 90% of cast is black. However, the movie should be entertaining, or at least bearing some ideological point. I didn't find one here. I am happy I didn't have to pay a full ticket price too.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"An Ambitious, Great Movie. Congratulations Eminem!","I just saw this movie yesterday, and I loved it. The acting was fabulous, Kim Basinger was great, and Eminem made a brilliant debut in this film.

It could have had a stronger, more ""happy go lucky"" ending, but hey, not all endings are perfect. I give 8 Mile a 10 out of 10!!!!",,Anonymous,Music
"Better than what I expected, even with Eminem as the lead","Eminem stars in a film about a white rapper trying to cut it in a black dominated musical genre and eventually comes out on a top. Hmmm, did Scott Silver really think this was an original idea? Well, beyond that, this film actually proved to be rather satisfying, presenting an image of rap and the hip-hop aesthetic in a cinematic format as opposed to high-gloss exploitation like The Players Club or All About the Benjamins. Eminem's frequent outbursts seemed too many and too quick, but his acting style was fairly consistent with the rather static character he sought to portray. If Rap wants to be taken more seriously for its style and impact, then they should follow the lead of this film. While the film is not without its problems, it is a much better alternative than some of the other hip-hop schlock that has been released in recent years.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I loved Eminem the actor .,"8 Mile.Jimmy is a young rapper known as B-Rabbit having a tough life that makes his dream of being a famous rapper looks farther than he ever expected .Fist of all ,this a review from an Eminem fan and that changes a lot .A man is struggling to seize everything he ever wanted ,what a repetitive story, right ! It might be ,but this one is special ,at least for me.The vibe ,everything is about it,90's ,hip-hop and the street where rapping was a lifestyle ,a way to express your feelings ,not just a source of income .Jimmy got nothing and he kept doing it as everyone else who loves what he does .It was very realistic ,the dramatic and the musical sides both were interesting and by the end those rap battles were dope ,I really enjoyed it especially with the most iconic credit scenes with the iconic lose yourself ,seriously ,I lost myself hyping and dancing on that soundtrack .I realized that Eminem can do well acting ,he was perfect for the role ,who can do it better than the goat himself ?Brittany Murphy ,she's pretty and crazy ,man she's perfect !That was a little bit of a not well structured review ,because it's about rap and nothing about it follows the roles .",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Good but over too soon,"Before I watched 8 mile I was expecting to see Eminem portraying himself to be the best thing since sliced bread and that the film would be ruined by this. However although it started perhaps a little slow it got going and the second half was a good film. However just as I was getting into it, it was over. It was a film building up to the ending came the showdown and then that was. So many questions unanswered.Overall looking back I really enjoyed it, it was even a look into the background of rap and shows the realities of what it takes to become big.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
This one hit a bit close to home,"I grew up in New York City just as rap was evolving into the art form we see today. I remember the breakthrough as if it were yesterday: it was 1979, disco was dying out, rock had yet to come back, and music generally sucked. The #1 songs from Billboard that year -- ""My Sharona"" from The Knack"" topped the charts for several weeks, for God's sake -- were from hunger. Music needed a fresh new voice, and rap was just the ticket. ""Rapper's Delight"" from the Sugarhill Gang actually cracked the Billboard Top 40 (it hit #37), and I still can sing all 15 minutes of the song, usually without error. That's the point: I'm WHITE. So were many of my private school and upper-east-side friends who also knew all the lyrics.We weren't ""eight miles"" away from the other side of the tracks, but about four or five from the South Bronx, where rap was born. Debbi Harry's ""Rapture"" was an homage to her obviously many trips on the #4 train to and from the Village (for example, the lyrics ""Flash is fast, Flash is cool"" referred to Grandmaster Flash, while ""Fab Five Freddy"" also got props in what is actually the first rap song to hit #1). Because of this, I can relate to what it's like to be a white rapper, even now. Eminem, the king of the white rappers, works in this film because he has the same ""street cred"" that my peers and I sought by taking rap seriously when no one associated it with whites.The movie ""8 Mile"" tells the story of ""B. Rabbit,"" a Detroit-based rapper with a crappy job, who lives in a trailer park with his mother, and who dreams of the day he can get his demo produced and get out of the slums. He's hard-working (unlike his peers) and also realistic (he talks of living ""down here"" rather than ""up there""). Like many working stiffs, he defines himself not by his work, but his hobbies. He begins the film by losing a ""rap battle"" (a freestyle rap competition), and suffers the humiliation of being ""not white, but white with a mic."" Racial tensions fly, along with the occasional bullets, but the main weapon of choice for these ""gangstas"" are their lyrics, which they all know can lead to riches.The ""villain"" of the film is ""Papa Doc,"" the leader of the ""free world"" rap group, and the reigning rap battle champion. Papa Doc has street cred, and Rabbit wants to take it from him for his ""crew."" Mekhi Pfeifer turns in his usually grating performance as ""Future,"" and one has to wonder about his motivations (watch ""Scary Movie 3"" for a humorous statement of the obvious from Anthony Anderson). Rabbit is troubled, conflicted, but his trials and tribulations are meshed together in a way that every artist can only hope for.One thing I've always liked about Eminem is that he's not a white rapper trying to be black, but that he puts a ""white"" spin on rap, mocking his race's perception as more grammatically correct, less ""gangsta"" and always the racial underdog. For example, his line ""notice that this man did not have his hands up"" in the final battle would have been spoken differently (but not inferior in any way) by a black rapper. Somehow, he manages to do this without appearing racist, but rather a mere product of his upbringing.This movie's main objective is to show the world of hard-core rap to a mainstream audience, and I can't imagine anyone watching this film while paying attention and not understanding the culture, at least on a surface level, by the end.One other note: Brittany Murphy stunk, as usual.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Being the New Kid, Affiliations, and Spaghetti Sauce","8 Mile is the sleazy, urban remake of The Karate Kid. Eminem plays the Daniel character, the ""new"" kid who has been poking around where the more popular kids hang. He's got talent, but can he show this talent to the other kids (rappers)? There's the girlfriend who has affiliations with both Daniel, I mean Eminem, and the bad kids. I use the word ""affiliations"" VERY loosely here (pun unintended). There's the struggling mom who loves her kid but cannot provide the crucial life lessons Daniel/Eminem needs, so we have Miyagi (Phifer), the wise teacher/counselor/companion. But there's no Karate in 8 Mile. Just rap. So ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,""  right? Not so. There are some hurtful things being said here. Hurtful rap. And to add insult to injury--or rather injury to insult--there are young guys with guns out waiting in the street outside the ""Hall of Rap"" who seem quite willing to pop caps into people. Johnny and his Cobra gang from the Karate film seem like real pansies next to these hooligans. At least Eminem didn't get spaghetti sauce all over a perfectly good outfit at the club, though! Talk about hurt. So in the sequel to 8 Mile, Eminem will get the you-know-what kicked out of him by Johnny and his Cobra cronies (many now with illegitimate kids, beer bellies, and memories of ""the old days"").

Like I said 8 Mile was clearly without a doubt one of the best movies of the previous year when it came to crowd pleasing. Director Curtis Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver have tailor made a great first movie for Eminem. In his portrayl of Jimmy Smith Jr.,Eminem gives the charcter depth and while watching the film I didn't see Eminem, I saw Jimmy. Some of the film's best scenes invole no dialogue, scenes such as Jimmy writing and anazlying his surroundings are deep and give you a feel of what a rapper goes through trying to write hye lyrics. The supporting cast all give excellent performances Mehki Phifer who serves as Jimmy's main supporter contiunes to make star making movies. Omar Benson Miller as Sol and Evan Jones as Cheddar Bob provide a lot of comic relief. With the little screen time they are given Kim Basinger and Brittany Murphy do good as the female leads.

I will never say I hate Eminem,"It was six months before the movie came out I went to see The Count of Monte Cristo.  While I am there I see a preview, and got me interested, thinking that even though it isn't my type of movie I thought knowing Kim Basinger was in it was making me happy.  Wondering, who the cute guy was in the movie.  When finding out it was Eminem I was in shock, my mouth was open for fifteen minutes.  Knowing that I don't like him or his music shock me that I wanted to see this movie. For months I waited, and also when I saw the preview I was wondering who sang the preview to his movie.  When finally Eminem's new music CD came out I found out that Cleaning Out My closet was not only the song that I heard from the preview, but I enjyed that song.  Not only did I get the CD I enjoyed most of his songs.  When it came to the movie, my boyfriend had doubts that this man could act.  Knowing that I have not shown any interest in any of the rapper's acting, I thought that he was probably right.Even though I thought maybe his acting would suck, I still went to see it not only because I believed maybe I could be wrong, but I would like this movie.  So I went to see it and I am happy I did not only did he prove me wrong, but he has a really good talent not only for acting but singing. Also my boyfriend agreed he was as good as he expected, and enjoyed the movie, then what he really thought.Eminem shows both his acting skills and his singing skills in this movie, and it was worth every second.  If you hate Eminem and haven't seen this, do because not only will you maybe like him, but you will have a different point of view in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Were the reviewers smoking crack?  It was a cliche from start to finish, filled with ""Did they really just say/do something so lame?"" moments.  Was the sex scene supposed to be sexy?  Was I supposed to believe that the girlfriend could just TELL he was going to make it? How?I was hugely disappointed.

impressive acting debut,"Rapper Eminem makes a spectacular screen debut in `8 Mile,' a film designed to showcase the performer's talents as singer, songwriter and, now, actor.In this semi-autobiographical tale, Eminem plays a young white rapper named Jimmy who is struggling to achieve respectability and recognition in an area dominated almost exclusively by black artists.   We've seen this story before in films ranging from `The Hustler' to `The Cincinnati Kid' to `Rocky':  the hotshot, talented newcomer attempts to make a name for himself in some specialized area (be it pool, poker, boxing or rapping) by challenging and defeating the highly respected and established reigning champ.  In terms of plotting, `8 Mile' offers little that is new or exciting, but what makes the movie work is the fine sense of detail and texture that writer Scott Silver and director Curtis Hanson bring to the world they are showing us.  Set in 1995 Detroit, the film superbly captures the unmitigated bleakness of its urban setting:  from the burnt-out, abandoned buildings to the graffiti-covered walls to the dank, cavernous music clubs to the rundown trailer parks.  Jimmy is caught in a world that offers the poor working class stiff little opportunity for hopes and dreams beyond those he can make for himself - and Jimmy has found rap music to be the best chance for his ticket out.  Yet, Jimmy is no pie-in-the-sky idealist.  He knows that he can't afford to put all his eggs into one basket and so he remains levelheaded and pragmatic in his aspirations and goals. Beyond the obvious handicap of his skin color, Jimmy is also having to cope with a crumbling relationship, an alcoholic mother, her abusive boyfriend and some `concerned' parties who, despite what they may say, may not always have Jimmy's best interest at heart.Each of these characters has the potential to become nothing more than a hokey stereotype, but the acting and the writing keep most of it real most of the time.  Kim Basinger, Mekhi Phifer, Britanny Murphy and several others all turn in fine performances in their roles, but it is Eminem himself who makes the film work.  Jimmy, despite all the frustration and rage smoldering under the surface, comes across as a decent guy who wants to make something of himself and to help those people who mean the most to him in the process. Eminem is a natural on the screen, and it will be interesting to see if he will be able to so successfully inhabit a character who is not so carefully tailored to fit his ready-made persona.  My suspicion is that he will, though only time - and his next few roles - will tell.`8 Mile' affords a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that many of us have hitherto viewed only from the outside.  Especially intriguing are the `hip-hop battles,' wherein rappers come on stage and challenge one another to perform spontaneous mutual put-downs, with the audience getting to determine the contest's winner.  No matter what one may feel about rap music itself, one has to admire the talent involved in composing these rhyming verses extemporaneously.  The music may sometimes be execrable, but the love of language that pours forth out of the mouths of these young practitioners is actually quite encouraging and captivating (though one wishes that that talent would be channeled in a more positive direction at times).An interesting side note:  at one point, Jimmy recites a rap defending a homosexual co-worker.  After all the bad blood that has gone down between Eminem and the gay community in the past, I wonder if this is the rapper's attempt to make peace and bury the hatchet.  If so, it is a gesture well worth making.",,Anonymous,Music
Go With the Flow,"A surprising success given that most music scene films are abysmal.  I know little or nothing about rap music and seldom listen to it.  Even so, the music fit perfectly with the tone and pacing of 8 Mile.  If you flow with 8 Mile's tone and pacing, you can overlook some of the script's awkwardness.Eminem may prove himself a credible actor.  Few singers have gone on to have successful careers as actors.  He may join the short list with another pretty face (Mark Wahlberg).  He showed a screen presence uncommon in a first film.Few films and set in the Detroit area and most of those were filmed elsewhere (i.e.; Grosse Pointe Blank).  I enjoyed seeing familiar locations having lived downtown Detroit and frequently walked by the Shelter and Michigan Theater.  The parking structure built inside the once grand Michigan Theater probably cannot be duplicated elsewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Good, not bad, but certainly no masterpiece","I tried to be as unbiased as possible while watching this movie, while I'm no real big fan, i like Eminem's music, after watching 8 mile, I can tell you his acting talent is pretty good, but its hard to tell he's playing jimmy or himself, he will have to do another, non-(semi-)autobiography, movie for that to see, the rapscenes(aka battles) are very nice in this movie, just for this I'd recommend it to anyone who likes that kind of music. Now about the movie itself, it builds up slowly, lots of details describing his youth(i guess), has some comedy in it, some drama, but overall i think it tries to show he(Eminem or Jimmy, hard to tell) is really not that bad of a person, which might be kind of exaggerated. I liked watching it, but i think the end should've been different, its like they ran out of film and had to make a quick ending....what a pity.Recommendations: if you don't know what to go see and you don't hate eminem, check it out.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Powerful,"As powerful as a fictionalized account of Marshall Mathers' life can be, expertly crafted by a cinema master.  Eminem's work is superb here, lending dramatic depth that my fellow fans and I would expect from an artist of his caliber. Not your typical Hollywood fare.

A great film,"This was a pretty good film. Not a very good location, though. Eminem deserved to have a follow-up to this film. Mekhi did a good job on his co-star role. Thumbs up to Brittany and Kim. Just like Purple Rain, Flashdance and Saturday Night Fever, only with Eminem in it. It shows his past life and is very similar to it. It's about B-Rabbit (Eminem in his debut film) who must live through poverty with his mom, Stephanie (Kim Basinger) and his half-sister Lily (Chloe Green, if I'm not mistaken). His slutty ex, Janeane lies to him that she's pregnant when she really cheated on him. But he has ""Future"" (Mekhi Phifer) his best friend and his new girlfriend, Alex (Brittany Murphy). Eminem should have gotten an Oscar for his first film. Not Razzie worthy. It's really worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Eminem's decent movie debut,"Eminem's big film ""8 Mile"" was made in a period where it was almost a habit for superstars to have their own movies; Spice Girls with ""Spice World"" some years earlier, Britney Spears with ""Crossroads"" and Mariah Carey with ""Glitter"". Despite this reviewer haven't seen the two latter movies, I'll guess I'm not wrong when I suggest that ""8 Mile"" is different and has more credibility than the previous ""superstar"" films.""LA Confidential"" Curtis Hanson as the director was a odd, but still interesting choice, cause a movie starring the superstar rapper Eminem isn't something that you would associate with him, but with Curtis as the director gives the movie immediately credibility. The reviewers and public (in my country) had only positive things to say about this film and when I finally saw it with those recommendations in mind, I turned out to be the opposite of disappointed.""8 Mile"" is a gritty, but good and dynamic movie. It shows that a drama can be dark and gritty without being to gloomy. It shows that a movie can be dynamic without being too overdone. It shows that a movie can be violent, without being too explicit.Like most of us knows (since it has already been some years since this movie's release), this isn't Eminem's biography, but still parallels the rapper's real, tough adolescence, which is enough to consider this movie as different and more valuable from the other ""superstar"" films.Eminem is the one who carries the movie and it's nice to see a different and more calmer side of him. Still, in all consideration, there's no denial that he's a much better rapper than he is an actor. The best acting in the movie is from Kim Basinger as the rapper's mother. The rest of the cast does only a decent job, despite Mekhi Phifer as Future and Evan Jones as Cheddar Bob, two of our protagonist friends, are those who distinguish them self from the rest of the friend-group. Brittany Murphy as the love interest Alex delivers a decent performance, without being particularly memorable.Like mentioned earlier, this flick is entertaining and engaging. There are some party, sex and action segments and a decent drama to keep the audiences attention and making this a memorable film. In fact, it's safe for non-Eminem fans to watch the flick and enjoying it. But there are some sections who are too slow and could have been cut to tighten the movie up. The relationship between Eminem and his little sister Lilly is a cute one, but could have been more developed. And some of Eminem's secondary friends are at times annoying and distracting.But since this movie is starring a rapper, there are some of rap in the film and the rap battles are without doubt the highlights. And in those segments is where Eminem proofs why he's one of the best, white rappers out there (despite his content in his lyrics is another discussion).Despite ""8 Mile"" is at times too slow, it's overall a great and entertaining movie that deserves to be seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Good introduction to Rap,"I knew nothing about this so called rap-music but after watching this film I knew at least something and, to some extent, even became interested in it. What hit me first was Eminem himself, for I completely forgot that he was not an actor of any kind. His 'acting' was brilliant because he knew what he was doing and what he presented was just himself. It became also evident that the story of the film was similar to that of Rocky movies. The world is an odd place, but a human can become a master his destiny with hard work and will.The fact that Eminem succeeds in playing his role is also due to good supporting acting. Other actors and actresses are great in their roles, especially Brittany Murphy who seems to have established herself in playing crazy girlfriends roles. Overall work of actors helps to make the whole movie a very enjoyable viewing and it shifts the attention out of the everyday banality this movie actually represents. '8 Mile' will give you a good feeling and it helps you to forget desperation that some modern films with similar social subject rather induce than remove.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Taut and restrained account of a man digging on through the hostilities of his life, as the allure for escape into music and away from everything else takes stage.","As the credits to 8 Mile roll, such a thing is accompanied by one of Eminem's songs; a song which I initially had a hard time differentiating to that of his many other records and thus merely sat accordingly. As the text continued to roll across my screen, I began listening to it more intently, and then, as half a minute or so passed, I realised I was probably listening to it as intently as I had ever done so any previous Eminem track that I'd previously caught through whatever means. Against most odds, and this is the startling thing, I actually came to begin to rather enjoy listening to it; actually came to begin to rather enjoy listening to the pace and tempo of the thing; actually came to rather enjoy the pace and rhythm of what I was hearing combined with what it was I had just seen in the film itself, something I was still in an immediate process of digesting anyway. Such a moment caught me off guard, but told me deep down that 8 Mile had worked.Eminem is an American rap artist whose successes around the turn of the 2000's somewhat lingers in the backgrounds of my memory. Around about the time of the film's 2002 release, and a further few years before that, I recall he was mostly all the rage amidst those then of my age – for what reason, I knew not then and know not now. I'd heard the guy's music, but didn't pay an awful lot of attention to it; the tracks striking me as more often than not just a lot of angry talking, bordering on ranting, in a rapid manner which was peppered by four lettered words that became even harder to decipher when your only true exposure to it was listening to ""Real Slim Shady"" on the radio during Sunday's Top 40 count-down – this a weekly occurrence that always saw the whole thing cut to ribbons out of censorship anyway. Curtis Hanson's 8 Mile puts all of these things aside and tells a cutting tale of a man, whom does not share Eminem's true-to-life name but is nevertheless an interesting case of what appears to be an example of pseudo-biopic film-making, with a passion and a skill slowly finding his forte with such things whilst learning of some harsh realities along the way.Hanson begins proceedings in a grotty public lavatory in a dingy night club, at least it looks like a night club, because the young and rather innocuously named Jimmy Smith is there practising for the building's true purpose: to host these things called rap-battles that pit two guys on stage and has them face off with each other via their lyrical abilities so as to verbally shoot the other one down. Our Smith, stage-named B-Rabbit and played by Eminem, stares at a cracked mirror amidst the filth, a literal reflection of a man whose skills and place in this world at this point are unfixed. He exits for the stage, a lone Caucasian amidst many African-Americans, upon winning the toss of the the coin, he concedes to go second in what is a defensive act that sees him on the way to ""choking"" and leaving embarrassed and beaten having been unable to get started.Hanson paints an enlightening and rarefied image of this underworld of rhymes and egotisms, his general locale is pent-up and aggressive with one looking to get the better over any one other; but it is not necessarily an existence imbued with violence and criminal gamesmanship, rather, rap battle duels are limited to that of verbally berating the opponent in a controlled manner in a specified zone most can occupy. This is a world full of young, impetulant youths angry and embittered and yet words, not guns, often drive the hostilities; words whose perpetrators must think creatively and logically so as to formulate and be able to use as ammunition to force victory. These face-offs carry with them concealed aggression, but are calculated and organised in a methodical and mature manner: if you win the consensus of your audience, you head through to the next round in a tennis-bracket inspired set up. By day, Smith is a factory worker with a hard-up boss and dreams of being a rap star, the lyrics to his tunes of which he scrawls down on his palms so as to remember. Work seemingly consists of walking a few feet every so often in a steel-mill and hitting a button before waiting a few seconds and repeating the process; his bus rides to this place are fraught with roadside iconography establishing his dishevelled roots here, in 1995 Michigan; streets consisting of seedy looking bars and such that are shut down but probably not looking too dissimilar now to what they resembled when they were open and thriving.The presence of Smith's mother Stephanie played by Kim Basinger, working with the director again after L.A. Confidential, and her daughter Lilly (Greenfield), whom she had with a temperamental Michael Shannon character named Greg Buehl, pepper proceedings. These people face eviction from their trailer park home, as Stephanie strives to win big at Bingo and provides Smith with extra incentive to succeed at his dream. Brewed in amidst all of this is Brittany Murphy's character Alex, the object of most of the men's gaze and Smith's constantly on/off girlfriend in what is a strand that amply supports the primary content. But Hanson's film is first and foremost the tale of Smith chasing his dream of becoming a musician, a goal verbally reiterated early on by a connected character whose monologue on demo tapes and such lays things out and allows Eminem's character to undergo a transition beginning and ending on the stage which rejects the initial paths it alludes to us it will venture down, in what is a well made and intriguingly downplayed drama in spite of the lead's raging fame.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

This is a very well done picture that is definitely a must see,"8 Mile (2002) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a poor white young man in the slums of Detroit looking for his calling. He has some friends that want him to do rap battles, some friends that want him to make a demo tape and pursue going mainstream and a family who wants him to be realistic. In the middle of all of this he recently broke up with his girlfriend, started a new job in a mill and meets a new girl with hopes and dreams of her own...is there any hope for success for this young man in this chaotic world?This movie is directed by Curtis Hanson (The Hand that Rocks the Cradle) and stars Eminem, Brittany Murphy (Clueless), Kim Basinger (Batman),
Mekhi Phifer (Dawn of the Dead), Michael Shannon (Revolutionary Road) and Anthony Mackie (Avengers).The storyline for this picture is very compelling and has great realism. Hanson delivers great cinematography and kept a dark hanging over the entire movie. The characters were entertaining and the circumstances, dialogue and chemistry between the cast and characters were perfectly portrayed. The soundtrack was awesome and the rap battles were superb.

Pure potential,"""8 Mile"" can not overcome the fictionalized celebrity biopic's limitations. There were hundreds of movies about young music stars and their parents, their early promoters, their first major breaks, and so on, most of them with more range and detail specificity than this one. This film only takes his hero to the moment he walks away, showing he can be a star. The entire focus is on his personality and his quietness in particular. The most important moments are when Eminem waits silently waiting for inspiration to hit with a mike in his hand.In this movie Eminem takes to a new level of clarity and belief the expression of absolute imminence, pure potential.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"""You can do anything you set your mind to, man.""","Eminem's head-on foray into the big screen is not as good as I remembered. While it is a solid film with a lethal soundtrack and some fine grim imagery of 1990's Detroit, it is fairly lacking when it comes to story and writing. Eminem is Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith. A steel-stamper at a car factory in Detroit. He is back living at home in his mother's trailer following the breakdown of his relationship. He dreams of making it on the rap and hip/hop circuit, but he is faced with prejudice on every stage as he is a white man attempting to make it in a black game. He chases this dream at 'The Shelter' where he engages in rap battles. After a bad night, he decides that something has got to happen with this soon, or he is out. He can't chase this dream on these bad streets much longer.""Lose Yourself"". One of Eminem's best songs was born from this movie, and it epitomises the soundtrack. Eminem is brilliant as Rabbit. It could have been a disaster, but watching his performance again last night I noticed he was modest and fairly humble. ""8 Mile""s slight downfall is it's script. There is only so much Mathers can do here. We get a lot of what I'd call dead-end scenes of Rabbit and his crew bickering, meditating on life and getting in and back out of broken up Ford Escorts. Brittany Murphy's character was completely pointless. The last rap battle is truly epic and represents a tremendous character transformation. We root for Jimmy in them final scenes like we do for the underdog fighter in a million and one boxing movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Good intriguing movie,This is a good movie with a very intriguing plot about a guy from a tough background with an exceptional talent.

"A mostly good and sometimes moving rap drama, with a notable lead performance","After several years of massive commercial success, controversial rapper Eminem got to star in this fictionalized biopic. I was sixteen when this was released, and knew very well who played the lead role. I remember hearing Eminem's Oscar-winning hit from the soundtrack, ""Lose Yourself"", many times when it was current and liking the song. I remember being interested in seeing the movie for a while, but lost that interest before it happened. I think ""8 Mile"" was brought back to my attention by the sudden tragic death of Brittany Murphy last December. I knew she provided the voice of Luanne Platter in the long-running cartoon sitcom, ""King of the Hill"", but I had never seen her in any live action roles. Finally watching this film nearly eight years after its release, it certainly didn't blow me away, but was still a memorable experience.Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith is a young, troubled aspiring rapper whose life is very troubled at the moment. He has just failed miserably at a local rap battle, too intimidated to compete, and currently lives in a Detroit trailer park with his alcoholic mother, Stephanie, his significantly younger sister Lily, and his mother's rotten new boyfriend, Greg Buehl. He cares deeply for his sister, but life with his disturbed mother isn't easy, and Greg certainly isn't helping. Jimmy has recently broken up with his pregnant girlfriend, Janeane, and currently has a dead-end job in a metal-pressing factory. He is trying to get his rap music career off the ground, but this proves to be difficult. One day at the factory, he meets a young woman named Alex, who is on her way to New York and aspiring to be a model. She soon becomes his new girlfriend, and it eventually turns out that the wannabe rapper will get to make his demo, so it seems that life is getting better for him, but unfortunately, his troubles are far from over.Eminem (born Marshall Bruce Mathers III) didn't have a major acting career prior to this film, and certainly hasn't done a lot of on screen acting since. Nonetheless, his performance as the protagonist here is very impressive, playing a very flawed, short-tempered character, but one with redeeming qualities, such as his affection for his sister. Since ""8 Mile"" is partially biographical, based on Eminem's past, it was obviously a perfect role for him. The beginning may be a little shaky, but most of the film is intriguing, showing different aspects of the protagonist's life, including his dysfunctional home, his group of friends, his workplace, his rivals, and eventually his relationship with Alex, the character played by the late Brittany Murphy. Some scenes are very gripping, such as the fights Jimmy has with Greg. There are some weak parts of this movie, such as scenes where it's hard to pay attention to the dialogue over the loud rap music, and one particularly overlong sex scene with Jimmy and Alex. Certainly not everything in this rap drama works, but most of it does, to varying degrees.I was in high school when this hit 2002 release came into theatres and then into stores, and I'm sure many of my peers saw it around that time. I even heard one of my fellow students talking about a four-year-old boy (a cousin or something) she knew watching the movie and quoting from it, which she seemed to think was really cute. A four-year-old watching an R-rated movie is pretty messed up, and for some reason, hearing this may have been what put me off watching it! However, even though it took years for me to get around to watching ""8 Mile"", I was reasonably impressed when I finally did. It's certainly not a film everybody could handle, with all the swearing, violence (sometimes with blood), and sex, but if you're old enough for all this and can take it, plus you're into the rap/hip hop genre (or at least some of it) and don't hate Eminem as a rapper, it could be worth watching, even if you don't think too highly of him as a person.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Not for me!,"This is not my kind of film. Rap is all rhythm. If you like the beat well and good. If you're looking for a happy tune you won't find it in hip-hop. It seems to me it's a new way of making cutting remarks or nasty insinuations. Eminen as Rabbit Smith does it very well. His character is maintained as an unsmiling teenager throughout the film, unhappy, unpleasant , poker-faced and ashamed to be still living with his mother. Very protective of his little sister we see another side of his character if only for a few minutes. This is the only heart warming scene in the whole film.The supporting characters are all good as they prowl the city streets in cars. Apart from the 45 second hip-hop contests there is not much to the story. Rabbit's mum has a sexy admirer but the partnership breaks up over a noisy argument. This adds a bit of life and action to an otherwise fairly boring film. Rabbit gets a job working the big metal presses which turn out parts for the assembly of automobiles. Rabbit relieves the boredom of this repetitive work with a little sexual workout in a quiet corner of the factory.This film should appeal to the younger set who are happy to listen to hip-hop and get a laugh from the suggestive lyrics. but don't expect a lot of drama.

Overrated,"8 mile was way too overhyped and overrated. I don't understand why it got such excellent reviews. I was expecting more from this movie. Eminem is a good actor, he's got talent. This movie is about a rapper wannabe and I think they call him rabbit or something like that? Well anyways, he's mom is a trailor trash { kim basinger}, and the only reason why he even sticks around with her is because of his young sister. Kim Basinger did a great job, even with all that trailer trash makeover she still looked beautiful. The only reason why this movie was any good was because of all that loud music that just makes you want to get up and dance and all that beating up and stuff.

The song ""Lose Yourself"" is always a classic. The rapping and disses are always fun to watch and hear. However, there are some things that don't cut it for me. Such as the weird decisions such as introducing elements that don't go anywhere or some weird deliveries by Eminem. Sometimes the movie just doesn't come together all the way and it throws it off a little. However, it does retain its story and tells it well.

Good Movie,"Rating: 8.1
Overall, an entertaining movie that has really great moments and showcases great hip-hop, all lead by a good performance from Eminem as he drives the movie to a great climax of Rap Battles, but is held back a bit from the pretty standard/boilerplate elements and not great performances from the minor characters.Good Direction (Helps move the story pretty well and does a good job getting a good amount out of the main actors (but really falters when working with the supporting/minor characters); the direction really gets highlighted during the rap battle scenes as he is able to create such a captivating environment with scenes that are just so entertaining to watch), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Good from Eminem (Has some moments of inexperience but really plays the lead well as he draws from personal experience to help tell the story), Pretty Good to Good from Mekhi Phifer (Plays the best friend character well and is able to work with Eminem nicely), Pretty Good from Brittany Murphy (Is not really given that much to work with but does a pretty good job at playing the female lead well), Pretty Bad from Kim Basinger (Really suprising how poorly she plays this character given her last performance with this director won her an oscar; just does not hit any of the depressing notes that are needed from her character and does not work well with other actors), Pretty Good to Good from Michael Shannon (Really steals the show in the scenes he is in as he shows glimpses of an actors that will have acclaim in the future), Bad to Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of inexperience and lack of depth in any of the characters)), Very Good Story (The semi-autobiographical nature of the story really looks into Eminem's upbringing to show how hard it was for him to grow and make a name for himself in the rap community), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is very simplistic and is a bit lacking in comparison to the other; the lyricism of the wraps are very well written and definitely a highlight of the movie; the foreshadowing and symbolism is a but surface level as the story really is meant to show the race divisions of Detroit and the Rap community), Great Score/Soundtrack (The score is just an interpolation of Lose Yourself but that song is just so good that this is a plus; the soundtrack), Pretty Good Cinematography, Good Sound (Really helped when mixing the hip-hop elements with the story), Pretty Good Editing, Plot Structure was pretty standard and boilerplate (the typical underdog story getting his shot at the end), Pacing was good (there was no need to cut or add any time), Climax was great and the best part of the movie (it really shows how Rabbit finally gets the confidence to show off his lyricism as he spits some of the most famous bars not only in movie history but rap history), Tone was set well (helped with really establishing the scene and the grime of the ghetto in Detroit)",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Throughout the film he begins to see that the better path in life would be to set more realistic goals in order to be successful.The message of the film is two fold. While an individual can succeed by setting those goals and compromising on their dreams from childhood; a community can also prosper when it's citizens pull together and focus on what needs to be done. This message is not lost on the director of this film. The setting of this film is in the city of Detroit. A city that has fallen on hard times with the how the economy has come out over the last decade. Several times throughout the film there are instances that show the apathy and regression of the city of Detroit while the characters stagnate.It is only by experiencing where his life is heading and what decisions have the most value can our main character able to move past his stagnation and begin to grow. This tends to be true in reality as it is easy to have a perfect idea of what someone wants their life to turn out as but it is harder to accept that that always can't be the case. Sometimes a person has to find their niche in order to find some success in life. This doesn't always bring about instant happiness but the acceptance of this fact always the growth to happen to earn your own happiness.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Rubbish!,"I'm not a big fan of rap .. I've listened to a few songs of the so called the legend of rap ""Eminem"" .. I didn't like his songs, it is a bad way to use the language .. using nasty words in songs .. I don't like also the way Eminem acts .. especially his bad manners with almost every relative to him.Maybe he is a legend to rap fans .. I believe his just nothing but a big lie.The movie is really awful .. possibly the rap songs are the best thing about the movie .. I can't believe that Curtis Hanson did direct this movie! .. Hanson could do much better and I was disappointed when I was watching the movie just out of curiosity.Kim Kim Basinger was good.In the end, it is just a bad movie .. it sings only rubbish.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
you can do anything you set your mind to,"OK,We all know eminem and his music. Some people get the wrong impression with some of the lryical contents he seems to project, or maybe are put off by the way he raps because of the bad examples that may influence children that are young and want to have the same attitude towards life. But lets be realistic here,times have changed and life has changed,and we all got to admit that films,music and everything in society has changed as well teenagers and adults know that,they experience some dramatic situations,they know what is going on out there and that times got hard and life always becomes more and more complicated. but lets put his music aside and talk about the true meaning of this movie. although it is mainly about hip hop culture and eminems lifestyle,there is a positive message which a lot of us can relate to. a lot might not understand whats so positive about this movie because they don't want to face the real facts of life and keep themselves close minded,but on watching this movie who has an open mind and knows that everything in life requires sacrifice or lets even say practice and if you are in a hard situation you gotta see what your main options are and find out if you can create something with your talent or call it a gift,whatever and eminems talent was rapping and letting loose his angry moments which im sure every each and every one of us have.and this isn't easy, there are lots of fish in the sea that have what your skills require,so you really got to work hard at it and be original, sharp and motivated,keep on thinking positive even when the rainy days come,in fact when they come struggle harder, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.in his first battle he knew that he was capable of doing what he was set up to do but he felt the tension of being rejected. his friends knew he had what it takes to be a great mc and one of them in particular wanted him to show and prove to himself that he can make it, he believed in him till the end,he knew he was going through a rough time and supported him mentally and phisically.and the second time he entered the battle he proved to himself and everyone around him that he had what it takes to be a perfectionist when it comes to hip hop,and that is a satisfaction and proof that you can do anything you set your mind to.and the lesson here is not to give up,or let go of an opportunity that comes your way, believe in yourself, and that is why i give this movie a 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The best singer's movie debut in 3 decades.,"Probably the best movie debut for a singer in 3 decades. What makes this movie awesome is the whole package: the story, the performances and the amazing main character arc. My only possible critique is that there are a few scenes that could have been edited and maybe the director could have pushed better performances out of actors on a few scenes.The best performance probably goes to Brittany Murphy. Not an easy role to take but she makes it believable. Kim Basinger does an excellent performance within the limited screen time that she got. Eminem seems somewhat stiff on several scenes, but it fits its movie persona well.The final battle scenes and the main movie theme song are so well made that they hold their own.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

What has happened to Movies?,"I cant understand what has happened to movies. Movies that not that long ago would got review ratings of 4-5 are now getting 8+ to 9. Changing lanes, Panic Room, etc.. and now this junk called 8 Mile. First off, Mathers cant act. Im sorry but he's being spoon fed by the director the whole time. thats not acting. and from i've seen lately, who cant act now days? It seems any rapper that gets a movie made is a ""natural"" and comes off the screen with this presence,etc... There's no doubt that Mathers would not have even got a try out for this or any other movie unless is was has big in ""music"" as he is so that pretty much tells you what he shouldnt be doing. Norton, Crowe, and even Cruise have nothing to worry about from Mathers, but the fate of the movie biz does!

Extraordinary,"Simply an amazing portrayal of a man trying to get out of poverty and how the environment around him influences his life, develops his culture, and creates his views of the system. The rap is the masterpiece of the movie. I simply like how he fused his passion with his reality. Not to many people understand Eminem and his crazy world...simply because they haven't lived it. Although the movie does not exactly follow his life, it is something occurring everyday to individuals who are misfortune being born in areas such as abandoned Detroit; working in factories as the only option immediately available. Lose Yourself...talk about a song that motivates! One shot, one opportunity..would you take it or just let it slip... if that song does not motivate your ass to get up and pursue your dreams then there is simply no hope for you!This movie is a 10!

Highly overrated,"This film received fairly positive reviews and I even heard some Oscar talk concerning Eminem's performance.  I disagree and here is why:  The acting in this movie was generally laughable.  I wasn't expecting much in the way of acting from Mr. Mathers and that is exactly what I got.  His character was one-dimensional and featured the same line delivery for almost every single line.  Evan Jones as Cheddar Bob was silly and annoying.  I am thankful that The part of Janeane, played by Taryn Manning, was a small role.  I was embarrassed for her- I cringed every time she spoke.  Having Kim Basinger (who actually can act) in this movie really magnified the short-comings of the rest of the cast, although it wasn't one of her better performances either.The only part of the movie I was able to enjoy was the rap-battle sequence at the end but this scene had its flaws as well.  The writing for the final raps was clever and smart but I was disappointed by the uninspired ""style"" of rapping by the combatants.  In Eminem's musical career, he excels by vocalizing in a way that is fresh and original but that is not the case here.  The director focused a bit too much on what they were saying (which was good) and not enough on how they were saying it.A more impressive acting performance in recent times by a musical artist was Bjork's in ""Dancer in the Dark"".  Neither she nor Eminem will likely have enough acting range to form a long-term career in the movies but her very real portrayal in that film was noteworthy.I give ""8 Mile"" a 2/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Rap Battles!!!,Very good movie. Everyone's acting was superb and the story was excellent. The rap battles were really well done and no one could have told that they were lip sinked (which they were). The last rap battle he did was his best. The lines were just outstanding. Eminem's performance was out of this world. Not one scene in the movie shouldn't have been there. If they were going to make a sequel to it I think that would be a very good idea (if they could find a story line to base it around. It's a movie that you can tell has had a lot of time and effort put into it. Overall this would have to be one of the best movies ever made about a person's life. I really hope they find a story line for the sequel.,9.0,Anonymous,Music

Anyways, this movie gives a good message, cause you need to follow your dreams, though their is stuff in this movie not good for kids, and a little grose at times, but this is an amazing movie, one of my favorites. If you watch this movie, trust me, you won't be disappointed. It's moving, inspiring in some ways, entertaining, fantastic, and well a great movie.

Not very good at all.,"I didn't think about it until now, but I saw this movie in theaters and I thought it was a waste of film.  Eminem is gay anyways.  This movie was aweful, though it was a remake I didn't like it.  I never liked Eminem anyway.  He is not a good actor at all and what made it worse was they put in Kim Basinger (who is a good actress) and I don't have as much respect towards her anymore.  They shouldn't have made this film.  All it did was give Marshall Mathers a bigger head to make his think he is all big and bad and which he is just a plain loser and once he's dead nobody will remember him anyway.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"""It's poetry in motion like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin'""","Once again I'm not able to write an objective review. I've been listening to Eminem since I was twelve. Many of his lyrics are stored right in my brain. His Infinite from 1996. is what made me a hip-hop fan even to this day.This autobiographical music drama is going to exhilarate Em's fans as well as hip-hop fans. Some others may find this movie boring or even ridiculous. When it comes to acting Eminem did a pretty good job for a rapper. I remember him speaking how hard he had worked in order to impersonate B-Rabbit. He had very little sleep (maybe few hours a day), took sleeping pills, wrote lyrics on set in spare time, had to drive long mileage to his place and back to the set. His fans know him well: if he's passionate about something he'll act almost like an addict.Other B-Rabbit's crew members did a solid job in acting. They were fun to watch and looked like they knew each other for years; even his opponents! I can only imagine Em's fans seeing B-Rabbit (Eminem) going toe-to-toe in a rap battle with Lil' Tic (Proof, R.I.P.) who was Eminem's best friend and amazing hype man. His fans know Proof's death almost ruined Em's career and sadly almost ended his life. Seeing them on stage, years after Proof passed away, makes me melancholic about early 2000's when Dre, D12 and Em swept the whole world with funky and violent Slim Shady as a leader. Look at his raw energy when he performed Square Dance (his concert intro theme) on Anger Management Tour 2002! You can clearly see the difference now without Proof. Back to the movie.When I was a teenage boy I almost fell in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy, R.I.P.). She was just to cute and cool! That short haired blonde girl played B-Rabbits girlfriend and did it amazingly; who can forget her cool, mellow swagger? Kim Basinger played Stephanie Smith, Em's mother he wrote so much about. She played his mother exactly as I had seen her from Em's songs. He's now sorry for writing ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" and ""no more plays that song on shows and cringes every time it's on the radio"" (Headlights ft. Nate Ruess). Michael Shannon (now starring in Midnight Special, 2016.) played Greg Buehl, his mother's boyfriend for whom B-Rabbit sings ""He's tapping my mom and we're almost the same age"". In reality, Michale is two years younger that Marshall.Now the music for which 8 mile won an Oscar. Opening scene hi-hats from Mobb Deep's Shook Ones pt.2 stick with me permanently. Feel Me Flow played by Naughty by Nature as well. What about Outkast's Players Ball, The Pharcyde's Runnin', Wu Tang Clan's C.R.E.A.M, Biggie's Juicy and many others? Not to mention first hip-hop song ever to win Academy Awards - Lose Yourself. 8 mile's soundtrack will delight all hip-hop fans and make them nod their heads.Story itself will be very familiar to those listening to Em. It's truly inspiring and in that ""stands head, shoulders and heart above other movies made that year"" as Joe Morgenstern from Wall Street Journal notes. It's a story about passion for something. And that's Em's life story. Now, fourteen years after movie was made, Eminem's made such success and has won so many prizes that's it very hard to list all of them. Wikipedia notes he won 155 prizes and was nominated for 311 on them. He's won 15 Grammy awards and was nominated for 43 more. Sold more than 120 million albums. He's now 44 and still doesn't look like giving up or doing something else.In conclusion: 8 mile is a modern poetry in motion for which hip-hop fans will forever be grateful. Great punch lines and multies in wintry 1995. Detroit? You've gotta love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Surprisingly good drama, avoiding the usual Hollywood cliché's","I was surprised how good ""8 Mile"" was, really. I thought this was going to be another one of those ""rapper's road from rags to riches"" type of films. And let me tell you something, this is NOT the case here. It's just a very good drama. I love the realism in this film, and the fact that it avoids cliché's. There is no big-time gangsters with big guns here, there is no certain way for big time success - it's about hard life of young men in the poorest parts of Detroit. Unlike 99% of the rappers out there (50 Cent being the best example), Eminem actually did a good job with his role, and he did show some emotion range. It would be interesting to see him in another film in the future, I think he has some acting talent... The supporting cast is very strong, and I think that helped Eminem too (although I agree that Kim Basinger's acting wasn't really convincing). The film itself is dark, realistic, down to earth. There isn't really a bad guy, and even the main characters' rivals The Free World crew aren't that awful. The freestyle battles were really impressive, you could see that a Lot of thought was put into that part of the film, especially the last 15 minutes. All throughout the story, you get to hear that every says Eminem's character is such a great rapper, but you barely hear it. Until the end of the movie, where the big battles go through, and then you actually see what his character is all about. Although Britanny Murphy's character's motives weren't clear, I liked that about her, because that's sometime how life is. You cannot always tell what a girl or a man actually want. I thought that all of the characters had depth in them, they were definitely not one-dimensional. By the way this is not supposed to be Eminem's biography, it's just based on some experiences he had growing up in Detroit. I really cannot understand how could anyone compare ""8 Mile"" to that piece of trash excuse for a movie ""Get Rich or Die Trying"". 8 Miles is heads and shoulders above the second film I mentioned, and to me it's the best rap movie behind ""Huslte and Flow"". I definitely recommend this movie, not only to Eminem fans (I am not a fan too). I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. It's not really a rap movie, come to think of it. It's a movie about life, about struggle, about finding the way to make your life better, rather than getting stuck in one place. And isn't that something we all search for?...",9.0,Anonymous,Music

In Detroit, 8 Mile was the border between the black and the white neighborhoods.Jimmy can rapping, can very good rapping, but it turns this is not enough for success, people were thinking that rap music is only for black people and very hard to convince them of this otherwise.

Enjoyable movie let down by story,"I found ""8 Mile"" thoroughly enjoying, however it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen.  I don't think the story was original well structured or had a decent ending.  I also found that a lot of it seemed to consist of hackneyed ""large group of extras cheering and snarling"" shots, while many of the scenes were of the ""gang meets gang and they get angry"" variety.Eminem's performance was very good.  I was disappointed that Brittany Murphy had such a small insignificant role, given the way the movie was advertised.Kim Basinger was also good, although there were a couple of moments where I found her accent not convincing enough (it wasn't THAT bad).The movie was well shot and the sound was done well.  I liked the handheld, sweeping feel and the dirty, brown PD and cinematography was quite suitable to the setting (Detroit).  It reminded me a bit of ""Ali"".  As I've mentioned, the acting was good (I would go so far as to say some of it, including from Eminem, was excellent).  Dialogue was good - and not just in the rapping.The humour was good.  I found myself laughing, however most of this was at Eminem (rabbit)'s words in the finale.The only thing that I think caused a number of problems was the story.  With a more original, more structured story, with better conflict and resolution, and cause and effect, the movie could have been better.The characters in the group were not well developed and were based on trite stereotypes - the white, stupid guy provided comic relief (as does the fat guy), the taller intelligent guy with glasses spent the movie saying things that were supposedly 'intellectual', and so on.  The characters in the rival gang 'free world' seemed to be even more devoid of personality.However, the good direction, art, sound and technical quite an enjoyable movie.  Utimately a good movie that has been let down by what is, in my humble opinion, a weak screenplay.I won't see it again in cinemas.  Maybe I'll get it on DVD one day.",,Anonymous,Music

"Hey, People who hate this movie: Shut the f*$k up","Sorry to be so blunt, but I really hate everyone who hated this movie. It is a formulaic story true. If you wanted to see this type of story, you could stay home and rent THE KARATE KID or ROCKY. But just because it's been done before, doesn't mean it doesn't have value. After all, who doesn't like THE KARATE KID? Isn't that a variation on the ROCKY story? On the film itself, I think everyone who's criticized Eminem on this site is doing so largely because they approached the movie thinking ""boy, I hate that damn Eminem. How can anyone say that kind of thing about their mother. And all that terrible language and insensetivity really bother me"" Okay, you don't like his mode of self-expression. You don't have to. But at least appreciate that his performance was quite good, especially considering that he had never acted in a film before. His eyes told a lot, and I really connected with his character, in part because of his strugle, but mostly through his interactions with his friends, which I felt came off genuine and real. Agreed, Kim Basinger's Oscar should be taken away for her performance. She was lousy, and I'm still trying to figure out hom a woman from the slums of Detroit has a southern accent. But overall, this was a good film. It wasn't the best movie ever, but it was a really good movie. So all of you who don't like it should just shut up.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"wow, this was boring","Firstly, let me just say that I don't have anything against Eminem. I'm not a fan of his, really, but, as far as hip-hop goes, I like him more than most other artists.The hype for this movie when it first came out, was, of course, ridiculous. Eminem was riding the wave of his popularity so it was clear that a lot of people were excited to see this film. I wonder how they felt after seeing it. I didn't see it in theatres in that I wasn't interested in the slightest and wound up seeing it after it came out on video. A friend of mine who is a HUGE Eminem fan immediately bought it and forced me and another friend to watch it with him. Well, I can sort of understand why people have compared this movie to Rocky, as it tells the story of underdog living in a tough situation and eventually overcoming some sort of adversity, but everything in 8 Mile just seems so over the top while, astonishingly at the same time, bland. I mean, no wonder the audience feels inclined to root for Rabbit - the guy is surrounded on all sides by a bunch of complete pricks. Even the girl he starts to get involved with turns out to be a worthless skank who never even cared about him.As for how the movie is put together, each scene is a weak ripoff of scenes we've seen in lots of other movies. And the whole vibe is so stagnant - nothing really evolves or changes in this movie - not even Rabbit. Unlike other underdog movies, there's no real sense of improvement on the part of the protagonist - i don't know exactly what it is that gives Rabbit the courage and ability to suddenly start rapping well. At first, he chokes, but then, when the stakes increase, he doesn't. I'm not really sure why. There's no montage of him practicing, really. He just scribbles some words on the bus and spends the rest of his time goofing around with his moron friends and being beaten up.In the end, he succeeds only on the most mediocre of levels and brings about literally no change in his life. Everything basically remains the same as when the movie started. Perhaps Rabbit has gained some valuable life experience but the whole thing sure was underwhelming. Not to mention tedious.The rap battles were cool enough, I suppose, but lacked the intensity and drama of something like a boxing match (a movie boxing match like in the Rocky movies anyway) and by the time of the final battle, I can't see how anyone watching could really care anymore. There wasn't really anything about it that separated it from the ones we'd seen before. And nothing particularly significant seemed to be at stake - not even credibility. It was pretty apparent at the movie's ""conclusion"" that Rabbit still had his share of enemies and doubters, even after his victory. He wasn't suddenly regarded with more respect, his ex girlfriend was still the same whore and his mom the same alcoholic loser. I suppose this all makes the movie more realistic but it also makes it disappointing and dull. Well, it was already pretty dull.If you really like Eminem, then you'll be happy to see a movie where he's not only the main character, but a character that closely resembles himself in real life. Otherwise, I really can't see the point in watching this crap. The underdog story has been done before and done better. As far as making a movie about the hip-hop world goes, maybe they should give it another go. This time, they could try to refrain from using tired clichés, hateful characters and bland plots and subplots.Another movie that takes advantage of an individual's popularity at a given time to make you give a damn that turns out only to be a waste of time that will most likely annoy and bore you simultaneously.

Poor Little Millionaire,"They almost did it.with the tactically placed billboards all up and down the Base Line.with the theme song that reminisced 'Eye of the Tiger' played over a montage of clips that almost looked like a boxing movie.with all the internet ads on every pop up screen.thinking people began to wonder.'Could it be a good movie?'A hard life.a troubled past.poverty.bad family.shady girlfriends.pasty-faced kid sisters.what else could explain his degrading, distasteful, yes even disgraceful decent into hip hop? The Man wants to know how he can prevent it from happening again.The Plot- Eminem plays Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith a young man seemingly from the ""right side of the tracks"" which Detroiters know as neighborhoods north of Eight Mile Rd. However, all is not what it seems for the suburban hero of this film. He lives in a trailer park with a garden variety of ""la garbage blanche"" including his trampy mother and her out of work boyfriend. With only a dead end job in his life, he rests all of his hopes for success in a rap music career. This is the story of one week in Rabbit's life.  The month starts out in humiliation and ends in triumph.The Acting- No Kudos to Marshall Mathers for believably playing himself. No kudos to academy award winning actress and Georgia Peach Kim Bassinger for playing the hillbilly-esque trailer park dweller with hair that blew in directly from Beverly Hills.  Mekhi Phifer is an exceptional actor who has yet to disappoint me. I even liked him in Clockers.The Opinion-I am very proud of the rap element that was introduced in the film. Detroit stepped up and delivered very good performances by members of the Mountain Climbaz, an up and coming Detroit rap group.It is apparent that Eminem is seeking to prove to the urban culture that he has a right to sing the blues while also validating his decision to ""act black"" to the masses. Futile endeavors. You can't buy cultural acceptance with money but maybe with a few strategically placed sound bytes, (Tupac if you like the West, Notorious if you like the East).This movie is neither heart wrenching nor powerful enough to change opinions of Eminem. The people that think Eminem is a loser will continue.the people that think that Eminem is a god will continue.the people that don't care will continue.I had to resist the urge to take offense. First of all the name of the movie should have been called 'Gratiot Ave' because that's all it shows. With the exception of a bus with an Eight Mile sign there was no trace of the base in the film. It will be hard for Mayor Kilpatrick to speak about the growth and development with nothing but scene after scene of abandoned and dilapidated buildings being seen by the whole world. Brian Grazer made Detroit look like Lebanon. Not to mention that the significance of 8 Mile Rd. was not sufficiently explained for the sake of the rest of the country that does not know Detroit's geography.It is an insult to all the forefathers of rap to make a big deal about the poverty and struggle of one just because he was the first of his kind. Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Tupac Shakur, Common, they were also born poor with crosses to bear some bigger than Eminem's. I can't see too much sympathy coming from the African-American community just because of the impoverished past of a millionaire.The great Rap Music door was closed to Eminem because he is white and he had to kick it in. That took a lot of courage and determination. Historically, the doors of every other industry and trade have been closed to African-Americans and we have had to kick them open time and time again, generation after generation. Some still kicking in doors even today. And we don't do it for a record deal and millions of dollars. We kicked doors in to feed families and to have a fair chance at a house with a white picket fence and to prove our equality.  Cry me a river Marshall.",,Anonymous,Music

I can tell this is loosely based on Eminem's life, with some fictional parts. The friends that played Eminem's friends all represented his real life friends.

We have a new winner.,"""8 Mile"" has recently won the most questionable Oscar of all time.The worst that can be said of previous Oscar decisions is that they've been aesthetically misguided: ""Hamlet"" (1948) being awarded Best Picture despite being inferior to ""The Red Shoes""; ""Forrest Gump"" winning the same award despite being no good at all; that type of thing. There have also been one or two doubtful procedural decisions. Denzel Washington won Best Lead Actor even though he wasn't, in fact, the lead actor of the film he won the award for - but whether or not he was the lead is itself an aesthetic judgment, of sorts, and anyway, it's ARGUABLE that he was the lead, at least to the extent it's arguable that the musical score of ""Chariots of Fire"" is superior to that of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".But declaring ""Lose Yourself"" to be the best song is to make a simple mistake of classification. ""Lose Yourself"" is not a song. I'm not saying anything against it here. I'm sure it's a very fine piece of rap (and I'm not saying this in a patronising way - I really AM sure it's a fine piece of rap, and what's more, I find myself liking it), just as I'm sure that ""Kubla Khan"" is a fine poem. But anyone who calls either work a song has failed to grasp the meaning of the word. Songs are sung. Rap is rapped. To rap is not to sing.If I loathed rap in an exaggerated way before seeing ""8 Mile"" it was probably because it had been sold to me as music, and while some (but not all) rap may in fact be music (in a borderline kind of way), its virtues are not musical virtues; and even the most musical rap comes nowhere near to being a form of song. ""8 Mile"" wisely leaves the music side entirely out of it. The impression we get of Detroit here is of a city alive with an artform unlike any other, one combining verbal and vocal dexterity, timing, rhythm, and the ability to cultivate a kind of false truculence. And Rabbit does it differently again. For most of the film he comes across as being inferior to many of those around him. His friends and enemies alike have smoother, more relaxed, in almost every way more impressive delivery; Rabbit comes off as being detatched and studied, so much so that he's almost embarrassingly awkward at first, although his style shows its strengths towards the end.At least one reviewer claims that ""8 Mile"" shows Eminem not to be honestly expressive after all, and he's right. That's what's refreshing about it. The idea that art should be expressive of the artist, or that the best art is on average more expressive than the worst, or that more expressive art is on average better than less expressive art... well, some of these claims MAY be true, but we'd need to conduct a cunning statistical survey in order to find out. It was the claim that it was ""expressive"" that helped turned me off rap in he first place. I thought I was being told to like bad music on the grounds that (like an anguished scream) it expressed something. ""8 Mile"" shows me that some rap is not so much bad music as good something-else, but rap as a genre probably includes a lot of bad something-else, too, and that stuff is no doubt expressive, too. I like the fact that Eminem's closing song says ""lose yourself"", not ""express yourself"".I still feel it's something of a waste of a film to give us this vision of Detroit, sketch out for us the virtues and nature of rap, and then mold the material into no particular form, not even that of a struggling artist eventually making it. The story progresses from the point at which Rabbit has stage fright to the point at which he no longer has stage fright. That's it. A lot of other story strands must go nowhere in order for so much good film-making to come to, compared to what's promised, so little.Despite what you may have heard there's nothing wrong with Eminem's performance. It may be that this is the only role he can play at all, but so long as he plays it well, what business is this of ours?",,Anonymous,Music
EMINEM - BRILLIANT!,"Marshal Mathers is extrordinary in his range of acting ability.  The characters were great and they all had awesome depth.  Michelle Pfeifer is superb - the only problem I had with this movie is its slow buildup to a let down.  I really think they should have focused more on the buildup to the music.  There were some amazing scene's all throughout the movie, but I felt it dragged in certain places and some things didn't go together.  I think if they would have focused more on the music and showed some definate movement towards a greater goal it would have been off the charts.  I felt like we were just floating through his life, not really knowing where to go, which I suppose is the effect they were going for.  I just kept waiting for this big build-up to the climax - that never came.  But again - the actors give a performance of a lifetime and there are some amazing scenes - it's just missing the something to bring it all together.  Marshal has an incredible acting ability and I can't wait to see him explore it in all aspects to follow.  He can only get better.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Terrible, vulgar, repulsive, but enough about Eminem...","8 Mile of course is going to be the movie that people are going to love simply for the fact that the foul-mouthed eminem is in it. In the film, eminem is a poor, persecuted white boy who is being cruelly put down and crucified because white rappers are always being viciously put down and snagged on by black guys with dreadlocks, baggy pants, thousands of gold chains with dollar signs on them, and a firearm somewhere on them. Eminem of course curses, then he curses some more. He eventually gets on stage to do a ""rap battle"", which of course he loses, which really surprises me since anyone with the mental age of a six year old could easily perform any kind of rap song and wave their hands in the air like some kind of psychotic moron on crack. The whole point of the movie however is to try and make eminem look really great, which it miserably failed to do at least for me and here is why: The movie in several ways tries to mimic eminems early home life, trying to show his mother did not love him and so on. What message do I get out of this movie? Part of it is ""Be a rapper because anyone who does'nt even have a voice can do it, all rap is is basically talking in your own voice range and throw in a few hundred four letter words,"". The movie tries to glorify eminem in that he is really cool because he talks about raping women and killing them in his so-called ""Music"". Eminem is a very little man, and I can only conclude the same thing about the myriads of empty-headed baggy pants followers who I can only conclude never bothered to try and listen to any kind of music. In 10 years, no one will care about eminem at all, except for maybe eminem of course.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not really an Eminem fan, but I loved the movie!","I won't go into as much detail as certain other people have gone into about this movie... I wasn't really thrilled about being dragged to this movie because I don't really like Eminem all that much.  However, I thought the movie was great!  I was pretty impressed with Eminem's acting, even if his part really wasn't much of a stretch for him.  I thought the cinematography was really good... very realistic and raw.  I think Britney Murphy actually sucked and her part should've been pulled because she had absolutely no importance in the plot other than for a little T&A.  The rapping scenes were really cool and even pretty funny!  So.... GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  (if you don't mind a lot of language and a little sex...)",,Anonymous,Music
The Eminem Show,"Wow, who knew that Eminem was so darn great? He's a hero, a fighter, a lover, a talent, a prodigy, is envied and adored by his neighbourhood, and is just about the coolest guy around... Gee. He's practically a messiah.It takes some kind of ego to make a film like this. Eminem's ""based on a true story"" autobiography is written like a band's promotional bio, and comes off as terrific propaganda. The guy makes himself out to be the greatest common-man's hero since Atticus, and tops it off by giving himself Herculean qualities of strength, reserve, smarts, and let's not forget he's the greatest rapper ever... Oh yeh, and everyone around him is useless and just wants to be near him or loving him. My hero... (sigh...)Anyway, if you can get past the ego-polishing, 8 Mile is a good bit of entertainment. The movie gives a great view of the struggles of underground artists, particularly musicians just waiting for their ""break."" I like the message too, and despite all the negative imagery and events, the true moral of the film will sink in with kids: work hard, keep at it, and you just might succeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Real Marshal Mathers III stands up!,"Singers should stick to singing and actors should stick to acting, but rappers, it would appear, can do whatever they want. Although far from critically successful, Ice T, Ice Cube, Tone Loc, LL-cool-J and even Busta Rhymes acquire regular billing in B-grade schlock and, at times, have all been top of their game in their primary profession. There is no doubt that Eminem is at the top of his game, so naturally, celluloid has beckoned, but there is no Eminem here, or Slim Shady, forget the monikers as it is time for the real Marshal Mathers III to please stand up, and he does.8 Mile refers to the stretch of road that separates black urban from white suburban Detroit. In a place of poverty and crime, a man is measured be his street cred and this cred is measured by his ability to rap, or, by being a friend of a rapper. Mathers plays B.Rabbit, a white rapper with loads of untapped talent, held back by fear, his friends, his colour and domestic issues. It is a complex time for Mr. Rabbit and 8 Mile studies his struggle to raise himself above the adversities that surround him.Thus, 8 mile is very formulaic and predictable, elevating the world of underground rapping to the same heights as nascar in Days of Thunder, Jet-fighters in Top Gun and almost every other hero-struggles-but-eventually-wins-the-day scenario. However, it is propelled above the masses by never rising above its station and by superb performances from Murphy, Phifer and Mathers himself. Scott Silver's script allows the many supporting roles to flesh out, without grabbing the lime light, but perhaps the audiences knowledge of Mather's life aids us in what is, supposedly, a semi-autobiographical movie.8 Mile manages to present a world that many might believe does not exist by portraying it with reality and reason. There is little in the way of unbelievable theatrics and despite the massive draw power of its star, comes across more like and independent film than a Hollywood blockbuster. This is in large thanks due to Curtis Hanson whose direction is inspired. Like B.Rabbit's life, the film is gritty and dark, but allows enough humour to remind us that we are dealing with real people in a world where you never know who your friends are. B.Rabbits talent is also held back just enough to make the finale twice as rewarding, as Eminem's detractors root for Shady to cuss and rhyme more opulently than his opponent.Obviously, in a movie such as this, music is going to play an important part and 8 mile kicks more goals than not on a soundtrack that his heaped with legends of the past (TuPac, Notorious BIG, Montell Jordan) and the present (Mathers himself). In a film with so many lyrics, the question posed is how much Mathers himself contributed to the rhymes, but they are often more witty than gross and may help to open the eyes of non-believers'. There is no doubt that the Lose Yourself' track and single is a killer tune and pleasantly, the rap-offs' are generally left to the skills of the combatants rather that the production team and there is no D.R.E label anywhere in sight.8 Mile is a formulaic movie that, plot-wise, comes along way from shattering the boundaries Eminem's music career has with reckless abandon, but, it does portray his world without the gloss of MTV. However, with such a mature performance, returning to that music scene and taking his lyrics seriously may become and issue for some of his fans. How could B.Rabbit be Eminem? Whether he likes it or not, the past is definitely that for the king of Black' music, despite a finale which raises some possible racial concerns (white man leaving the black to the ghetto) that although subtle, are noticed. 8 Mile is a success for all concerned and I look forward to the next step in the career of this, the figurehead for 21st century culture.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Real Slim Shady,"Directed by Curtis Hanson, ""8 Mile"" is essentially a vehicle for hip-hop heavyweight Eminem to tell the tale of how he went from a trailer-park dwelling blue-collar worker to a pop music superstar seemingly overnight. Rather than capture all of the glories of fame, ""8 Mile"" instead focuses on the rapper's rugged beginnings and, although only loosely based on his life-story, humanizes the rapper, who at the time of the film's release, was the most controversial force in music.The film opens with our hero, B-Rabbit (as portrayed by Eminem), practicing his routine in front of a bathroom mirror before engaging in a rap competition. Unfortunately, he fails before he even begins, and the rest of the film follows him as he struggles with poverty, his overbearing mother (Kim Basinger), his lesser-motivated crew of friends, his ex-girlfriend, his current girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) who will apparently do anything for her big break and a posse of hardcore rappers who may or may not see him as a threat, but see fit to beat him down at any opportunity anyway.The amazing thing about ""8 Mile"" is how realistic and down to Earth it really is. A vanity project this is not, as Eminem clearly had a story worth telling and the film doesn't skimp on the dirt. The cinematography goes a long way in capturing the gritty feel of a decaying city and the people that inhabit it. From the decrepit trailer parking and crumbling buildings to the broken down vehicles that cart the characters around to their various jobs and musical endeavors, everything in the film has a genuine feel. You truly feel like you are on the cold streets of Detroit, alone and depressed. Even Eminem, arguably the most successful pop-culture figure at the time, looks miserable and underfed, which is only amplified by his random fits of rage which come all too naturally but feel justified within the context of the film.They say it's tougher to play yourself than a character, and if that is so, then Eminem would have been wise to further pursue a film career (you know, aside from his hilarious cameo in ""Funny People""). His performance in this film is grounded and realistic, and we often find the rapper acting circles around more seasoned pros like Brittany Murphy (whose role suffers for being poorly written) and Mekhi Phifer (who plays essentially every character he's ever played before, albeit, with dreadlocks) and is sure to convince anyone regardless of whether you're a fan of his music/public persona or not. A few minor flaws do little to drag it down, and in spite of its oppressive tone at times, it's an uplifting and inspirational film that is likely to win over even the most cynical viewer.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Lose Yourself,"In 8 Mile, Eminem is Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith a slightly fictionalised version of himself living in a working class neighbourhood of Detroit. Rabbit has moved back to his trailer thrash mum (Kim Basinger) after a break up with his girlfriend.Rabbit works hard, his friend gets him gigs to engage in rap battles in clubs where he is dubbed as Elvis, AKA as a white guy trying to sell a piece of black culture. The trouble is Rabbit gets overcome with nerves every time he tries to perform in front of a crowd and take his rival down.8 Mile is an underdog story as the working class guy makes good with the help of his multi racial friends.Director Curtis Hanson uses all his Oscar winning skills to try to sell this as a real, gritty film. Eminem is rather flat swerving somewhere between mournful and angry. Each time he goes to his mother's house it ends up in some sort of a fight. Basinger never convinces as a rough lower working class mom type.The script wants to be a modern version of Saturday Night Fever but it lacks that film's showboating.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Utterly engaging,"When music stars make the transition to movie making, the results have been eclectic to say the least. David Bowie was surreal in the mind-bending Labyrinth, Madonna has been decent in her movies in general (With the exception of the panned Swept Away), and there was the dreadful Crossroads with Britney Spears. S Club 7 Seeing Double was another example of a shocking attempt at bridging the gap between music and film.Bearing all this in mind it would be highly understandable to be somewhat skeptical of 8 Mile given it stars Eminem in his first big-screen role. The supporting cast is hardly strong (With the exception of Kim Basinger) clearly designed to give him the limelight, so ultimately the quality of the movie depends on him. However, the doubters, after watching this, would surely be willing to consume humble pie because 8 Mile is a thoroughly enthralling story which is universally well acted and extremely well directed.Eminem is essentially himself in this, though his name is Rabbit. He plays a trailer-trash young man who's locked in the slums by circumstance, and who is trying to use rap/hip hop as a vehicle to escape. Sure, it's been done before, albeit not this exact setting, but the lack of originality in premise is more than made up for by the quality of the acting, and the way the story is told. In his first film, Eminem is breathtaking. Yes, he might not have had to do a lot of research into the part due to his clear familiarity with the situation, but just because he empathises with it does not automatically make him a good actor in front of a camera.The movie opens with a rap battle, where 2 rappers try to outwit each other in front of an audience. Rabbit is up next but freezes on stage and experiences ridicule from his peers as a result. The rest of the movie sees him struggle to make ends meet, hold down a job, keep his family together, attempt to regain his reputation and all the while never being sure what tomorrow holds.Britney Murphy plays his love interest, but it isn't exactly a match made in heaven and the story does a good job of conveying her as apparently out of his league initially before making us realise she's the same as the rest of them, albeit with a hint of glamour.Director Curtis Hanson does a terrific job with this film, making it fast and dynamic, but not too quick as to be incomprehendable, though he *is* guilty of slightly overdoing the stereotyping, which is prominent throughout.Generally it is extremely worth seeing, and although the ending is pretty predictable it is still well made.Good job.",,Anonymous,Music
EXCELLENT!!!!,"Eminem proves that he is more than just a rapper in this gritty tale about a young Detroit star in the making. His performance shocked me in a way I never thought possible. Kim Bassinger and Britney Murphy back him up as the women in his life,his mother (Bassinger) and ""love"" interest (Murphy) , who did a very nice job in the acting as well. I did however, feel very puzzled at the end of the movie, (DON'T WORRY... I WILL NOT GIVE AWAY THE ENDING) because it did leave alot of unanswered questions. But as soon as I got home, I was able to solve the hidden message behind the film. All you have to do is think about it and you will be just fine. I strongly recomend 8 Mile.

It seems a lot of people haven't got the point of this film,"First of all, I've read plenty of comments from people saying that there's not much of a plot to the film. Correct. The film is simply about a week in the life of a amateur rapper and how he battles his confidence to finally prove himself, despite all the bad things happening around him. That's all. Read the tagline - 'Find your voice'. This film simply told you how Rabbit found his. Hollywood *could* have put a lot more side stories into the film, but they weren't necessary; the story kept its focus on Rabbit, where it belonged - even though it wasn't very exciting at times. I was also glad there wasn't some huge happy ending where Rabbit got famous. Instead we have more of a realistic storyline -- after all -- no-one goes from being a nobody to a megastar in a week. (even though Eminem's own rise was pretty fast.) I liked the way you were left guessing 'so what now?' for Rabbit.People who expected more plot, more side-stories and a 'bigger' ending have been living on a diet comprising of too much Hollywood shmultz.

"Almost an 'M/M' biopic, the rap scene in Detroit.","Marshal Mathers is the popular 'Eminem', which I will abbreviate M/Mbecause it is easier. Against the odds he became a successful white rapper amongst an almost all-black rapping backdrop in Detroit. What is revealed in this movie, and it makes sense, just being able to make rhymes does not make one a good rapper. You also have to be very intelligent with a superior vocabulary. That is why he succeeded, not because of anything else. This movie was a revelation of sorts for me, because I have almost ZERO interest in rappers and rap recordings (I will not call them music, for they are not). What this movie did for me was open my eyes to an important cross-section of the rapper environment. It is a well-made semi-documentary on the rise of M/M. However, for content and entertainment value I give it a rather low IMDb rating. I was, however, impressed with the acting of M/M. Itwill be curious to see if he can handle a role that is not close to his own identity.Of interest was the recreation of 'freestyle' rap contests, one-on-one, where the participants, eyeball-to-eyeball, do impromptu raps aimed at the other's weaknesses. The winner goes forward in this staged elimination tournament, and is apparently the proving grounds for aspiring rappers. Like open mike night at comedy clubs. In the DVD extras M/M explains that the story parallels his life, but in fact the character is NOT him, which gave them the freedom to be creative. He hopes the message one gets from the movie is ""It's up to you, if you want to make something of yourself.""However, if a successful rapper doesn't nothing more with his fame than earn money, and not be a positive role model, then he has accomplished nothing.",,Anonymous,Music

Second, Brittany Murphy finally got to play someone who wasn't a ditz, or a complete mental case. Third, and I hope I'm not th only one who picked up on this, I like the writing mechanism they used of making every character around Eminem's appear as part of HIS psyche. Am I right? (eg. Brittany Murphy's character represents his optimism, his daughter represents his happiness, and his friend, Future, represents ambition.) All in all, a great movie to watch.

Purple Rain was EXCITING... sure there were the ""Prince's bad home life"" scenes, and ""Prince meets/gets/loses Appolonia"" scenes... but there was also a lot of on-stage action from Prince, Appolonia 6, and The Time that makes Purple Rain a classic.  8 Mile is just too slow for the most part.  No matter how great the last reel is, it doesn't make up for the lackluster majority of the film.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A good flick,"A gritty portrayal of life in the urban wasteland of Warren/Detroit Michigan.  I was not a fan of hip hop or Eminem (until now) but this film really moved me.  It's really a story about overcoming adversity and not giving up. The cinematography was excellent in capturing the desolation of Warren, MI, which truly is a bleephole if you've ever been there.  The characters were well defined and you couldn't help but root for B. Rabbit and especially his little sister. Kim B. played an excellent trailer trash mama, despite some people's opinions to the contrary. I'll go see it again. The lyrics to Em's song ""Lose yourself"" have new meaning after seeing this film.""You can do anything you set your mind to, man.""",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Greatest musical movie ever 🎬,"8 Mile was a terrific film with a powerful song (Lose Yourself). 8 mile was a flawless film that makes it difficult for me to dislike. Eminem gives out an outstanding performance, which surprised me when I watched it for the first time as a kid. He deserved the oscar and more. In the movie industry today, it's not uncommon to see a musical artist make his or her attempt at being a part of a film in some way or another. However, it's uncommon to see those films be worthwhile. With 8 Mile, however, we are treated to an emotional, uplifting, and well-acted story that follows a character that parallels Eminem, played by Marshall Mathers, and his everyday struggles in the slums of Detroit. The story here is one that is very familiar, and if you've ever watched a sports drama you've seen this in some form or another.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Impressive stuff,"Leave whatever you like or dislike about Eminem at the door. See this movie for whatever reasons. Believe me, you will be entertained by it's honesty and avoidance of cliche.  It is brutal, funny, and ultimately simplistic. But aren't the most memorable of stories that which use the fewest words, yet uses them with a grand purpose?  To entertain us, not to preach to us. That is the foundation of this film. Filled with likable and dispicable folks alike. Each one reminding us of someone we talked to just today, or grew up with yesterday. And each time you think a scene in this movie will take the high road, it fails to do. Instead we have glimpses of real life, sometimes fun, sometimes ugly. But always real, maybe a little to real.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Two hours of Hip-Hop promotion, salvaged by solid Eminem performance","My biggest problem perhaps is that I'm not a fan of Hip-Hop music and hence I do not enjoy the work of Eminem. Even so, I thought I'll give the movie a shot, even if I did not though tat Eminem could act. On this point however, I was surprised. Eminem does a solid performance of portraying the white guy in the black gangs of The Motor City. I must confess it's one of the better performances I've seen for a while, especially when it came from a performer that has music as a head act. The movie however is really about, nothing. Rabbit (Eminem) is trying to get a record contract as an rap artist. Other than that it's really just a bunch of friends roaming the streets of Detroit. I might've enjoyed the picture more had I been a fan of rap music. I gave this movie a 3, but I strongly suggest anyone to see it, because of the performance by Eminem, it shows that not all celeberties that try to make a career in motion pictures are totally out of context. Totally unknown cast besides Kim Bassinger's role as Stephanie.Generally, with total resistance from hip-hip fans, this is a promotion for hip-hop music as well as it plays a major role in Eminem's road to remembarance. Eminem started out as the kid that does anything, sings about anything and almost harrasses other people, including his mother. As time passes, he starts to soften up, because now he's famous. It all started with writing the song where he apologized to his mother, who was furious at this time. Now he's moved on to portray a soft and caring person in a motion picture. There's a reason why he doesn't portray a bad ghetto gangster in this movie. Even so, great performance!",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Drama History,"Well, I couldn't believe it.  Curtis Hanson made act a star and Kim Basinger who was at his last.  Excellent Performances!!!.  The story of a boy who wants to be someone crossing the 8 mile street which divides (in Detroit) the black and the white people.  They live in a house which is carried with a van (Eminem and Kim Basinger, son of the other), he has a job and wants to be a rapper.  He has black friends in Detroit, the city of automobiles.  He wants to have an identity.Really, Eminem performance was great. Very strong and real.  Kim Basinger gave us the performance of his life.  Merit of her and of course of the director. I loved the rest of the cast except for Brittany Murphy.The photography of Detroit is wonderful and the screenplay too.I would vote it for the Academy Awards.  It deserves a lot of awards.  And if you don't know what is the hip hop culture or you didn't give rap music a chance, now you should listen to the songs and lyrics.It is a high tensioned musical drama.  The life of this man an his mother is very difficult.  Very good controlled by Hanson.  Merit of him. It's worth seeing it without any hesitation. Excellent.  Give it a try.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A really good film,"Even if you are not a big fan of rap music, you should see this film because it has a lot of good qualities besides the music. Eminem is surprisingly good as Rabbit, and Kim Basinger makes one of her best acts if you ask me. There is a power in the rap that the director of the movie really seems to get visible.A quite depressing film and it feels also very realistic, but a lot of humour in Rabbits gang helps this film to give you a feeling of hope.Go on and see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
not just for rap fans,"This is a good movie! My kids saw it in the theaters years ago and recently talked me into sitting down with them and watching the DVD saying ""It's not just about rap, Mom!"" And they're right. This movie has a great message about staying true to your dreams. It has a lot of heart and quite a bit of humor. The story really sucked me in, the relationships generally rang true and Eminem CAN act, go figure! Kim Basinger was also wonderful as Rabbit's mother and Mekhi Phiffer is also gives a standout performance. The only jarring note for me was Britney Murphy but that's a minor quibble. I loved the message, and the ending. If you haven't seen it yet, do. It's definitely worth your time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Eminem made it so can we.,"A movie about a stuggling rapper living in Detriot. We take a glimpse of his daily life struggles and aspiration to make it in the rap industry someday.The storyline is very focused on the main guy B-rabbit. It takes a nice narrative of showing the character development of a white guy who is surrounded by both the good and bad company in the rap community. Luck is not on his side, so he finds himself in different situations causing him to lose temper and get in fights that has no winners. He finally gain the realization to take control and do things his own way. Our character doesn't have a lot of background story so, there isn't a whole lot to define his character althought his character becomes interesting as the story goes on and throws him in different situations that builds up the drama for the story. For what it is i think it is directed brilliantly show casing all the different properties revolving around the character which includes the music and the relationships.Eminem might not be most expressive actor but he's a damn good musician. Thats what he bring to the table and it's just a beauty to watch him sing and rhyme. His character couldn't have gotten a better actor a play it with this accuracy. It kind of work with how eminem do things his own way. It's Great and Original to the core. Other actors also bring a lot to the table. They all acted really well. They pretty much helps him build the story around him adding
both the comedy, conflict and drama to the story.Movie looks and feel amazing. It definitly make the rap scenes more intense and entertaining. It also rightfully showcase the isolation and struggle of an aspiring artist.8/10.Thank you for reading this :)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Confusing,"I'm a big fan of Eminem and his music, and this movie looked appealing in the fact I assumed it would be based more so on his life and experiences then it actually was. The story line lacked direction and focus, and it was basically just a bunch of rappers from the wrong side of the tracks, trying to make music, and get into fights. You see very little emotion from Em, a.k.a. ""Jimmy Smith"", and I thought his performance was a little weak in comparison to the persona he plays out in his music and videos. I guess I came in with expectations that differed from the movie. I knew it wasn't an actual bio-flick in a sense, that it was only LOOSELY based on Em's life, but I thought there'd be a lot more to it, like maybe his relationships, his daughter. In fact, I thought Lily was supposed to be Hailie at first......LOL. They never really tell you who she is, and I'm assuming a sibling (?) And who exactly is Alex? And Janean? The point is, a bio-flick would have been a lot more interesting because of the controversial nature of Marshall Mathers and his music, and this movie was only a glimpse into that life. So, case in point, it was a bit boring. It didn't show what became of his trials and efforts, and ended rather LOOSELY, if you can call that an ending. I know it left me thinking, ""WTF""? But, if you're into a lot of fighting, swearing, and some poorly written rap music, it's a good flick. If you're looking for something with substance, I'd recommend ""Walk the Line"". That's my opinion......we welcome yours......LOL.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Lose Yourself in the Moment,"8 Mile can be viewed two ways, a semi-autobiographical tale about Eminem, that seeks to make him more sympathetic, or as a general tale about growing in a rough neighbourhood and aspiring to be someone. The truth is it probably lies in the middle.The film has a great opening with Eminem's, Jimmy Smith Jr or Rabbit to his friends, psyching himself up to contest in the ultimate challenge for an aspiring MC, a rap battle. Curtis Hanson directs this scene in a way which picks up on the emotions running through Rabbit, as he chokes at his big moment. The close ups of his face show his fear. Hanson is an actors director, something he'd shown to masterly levels in LA Confidential, and something he displays here with all actors given a chance to display their potential. He also deserves credit for making Eminem, ditch the Shady look, and the ego, and become the average looking nobody type.The supporting cast do a great job, with Mekhi Phifer believable as Rabbit's best buddy Future and cool enough to pass as the MC who hosts the slams. Kim Basinger is suitably trashy as his trailer dwelling mother, who is sleeping with one of his former school comtemporaries. She creates enough pathos with her situation to have sympathy with her. Brittany Murphy generates enough sex appeal as Alex who seduces Rabbit, but is never dispisable despite the fact she appears to be sleeping her way to the top.Special mention to, for Rabbit's one white pal, Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones). He is involved in one moment that demonstrates that this group are just street punks, and not gangstas, when he injures himself with his Mom's gun.As for Eminem, he demonstrates that he has screen presence, always the focus even when he isn't doing anything. If we take the view that he's playing himself he does it well, but the fact is he seems to understand that you don't have to jump up and down screaming to give a good performance. Less is often more, and the shots of him in contemplation, as he travels to work on the bus are as good as his verbal assaults. Not that the final rap battles aren't extremely entertaining and exciting. Having seen so much CGI and explosions over the last year, it's nice to know as much adrenaline can be pumped with a bit of verbal. His final acappela assault, literally leaves his opponent speechless.The ending also works out well, as Hanson doesn't allow Rabbit to suddenly become a star, but keeps him grounded in reality, by sending him back to work his factory job. The film's about aspiring to be somebody, but wanting to do it your way, on your own terms.Is it Eminem the actor on screen or is it just Slim Shady. I don't think I know, but it's enthralling whatever.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Eminem Can Act,"8 mile is a stretch of urban decay in Detroit. The rapper Eminem grew up there in a predominantly black neighborhood, which makes for a great story. A white kid struggling to make a career in a place where he doesn't belong. Here, he is Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith, and he lives in a trailer with his mother, Stephanie(Kim Basinger), his sister, Lily, and mom's boyfriend, Greg; this is one screwed up family; not exactly the Waltons. A club nearby has rap contests, and on his first try, he chokes up and leaves the stage a failure. He works at a factory, doing as many hours as possible, to save enough money to buy a house. On his off time, he still works on his music in preparation for a tournament at the club against other rappers. It all leads to the inevitable showdown in which Rabbit must find the weak points of his opponent to his advantage. Eminem proves to have a natural charisma on screen, and he makes Eight Mile work as a believable biopic.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A-plus Performance,"Of course all of us who respect Eminem the hip-hop artist will automatically be happy with his film debut, but truthfully he went above and beyond what I expected.  His character of Jimmy surely must have paralleled his own life in some respect, adding to the fact that his fans will enjoy watching. Mekhi Phifer is obviously a rising star in Hollywood!  Phenomenal performances by not only him, but Kim Basinger as well.  Brittany Murphy was decent, but she fell victim to playing a rather boring character. Normally, dramas bore me.

Passion-Free,"A loosely fictionalized biography of Eminem is given the Hollywood treatment by noted director Curtis Hanson (`L.A. Confidential') with the rapper essentially playing himself. It's a very watchable movie, screenwriter Scott Silver's hip-hop variation on `Saturday Night Fever'; it's also not much of a stretch for all concerned (it's hard not to be convincing when you're essentially playing yourself) and not a whole lot of passion gets generated. Instead, much of the time is spent in self-admiration of its design and purpose, a tough-acting `exploration' of a `sub-culture'. Hanson insists on constantly using a handheld camera (the cinematographer is Rodrigo Prieto who also shot `Frida') but rather than provide immediacy, the typically glossy Universal Studio sheen makes this look only slightly different from an episode of `N.Y.P.D. Blue'. Eminem, far from the angry young man persona that's brought him notoriety, seems positively charitable, with the screenplay giving him a haloed aura, a poor, responsible (he loves his little sister), hardworking white waif desperate to make his way into a black culture that wants nothing more than to see him fail, trying to find love in the process (only to be misled by career-driven schemer Brittany Murphy, whose character is sorely underdeveloped); needless to say, as relaxed as he looks, he seems compromised. The supporting cast is filled with solid, professional actors who strip the film of the street credibility it's desperately trying to push across; particularly unconvincing is Kim Basinger, playing Eminem's white trash mom--cast in a purely sympathetic role, no matter how she tries (unfortunately, not very much), she radiates glamour. Other actors include Mekhi Phifer and Evan Jones (in the pathetic-follower role that Barry Miller got to play first in `Saturday Night Fever').",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Acting and A Great Movie,"A lot of recording artists try to take it one step farther by testing their acting skills in a motion picture.

I agree with him that anyone who has ever had a dream in their life needs to see this movie.

A newfound respect for rap,"I've never been a fan of rap music. I've never had any interest in it and its never been enjoyable to listen to for me. However, after watching 8 Mile I have developed a whole new respect for freestyle rap artists. I didn't use the more generic term ""rappers"" for a reason. I've developed a respect for the actual artists of the genre, the true poets and lyrical aficionados within the genre. Especially Eminiem, the lead in the film who plays Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith, an impoverished young guy living in Detroit, just trying to make it out alive. The movie tells his story about his desire to make it big and all of the other factors holding him back. He is constantly barraged with problems concerning his mom and her abusive boyfriend, his friends who get him in nothing but trouble, and surviving as a white guy in a society dominated by African Americans. His make it or break it story is so compelling and so moving that it almost makes me want to start listening to Eminem.At first it is hard to get into 8 Mile. On the outside so many of the characters in this film seem like a bunch of useless punks whose lives are going nowhere. From the first few minutes of the film we get the impression that we won't be able to connect with these somewhat pathetic characters. But as the movie progresses and grows more dramatic and more emotionally gripping we begin to see these characters as deep and complex humans whose stories are meaningful and who do serve a purpose in creating an all around excellent narrative. I never thought I could care so much about Eminem, but his portrayal of B-Rabbit makes me want to cheer for him all the way amidst his never ending hardships. There are a few characters who don't seem to grow throughout the movie and I had the same feelings about them at the end as I did in the beginning. But the important characters are the ones who I really grew to enjoy as I felt compelled to see and hear their story.But what really makes 8 Mile work is the overall atmosphere and the superb way in which the chaos and insanity of poverty stricken Detroit operates. The dirty and musky city streets against the dark and ragged cityscapes accentuate this film's bleak atmosphere perfectly. It helps that it was actually shot in Detroit, but Curtis Hanson, the film's director, does an excellent job of framing all of his shots to capture Detroit in the somber light he wanted it in, full of false hope and empty promises that only a true fighter can overcome.Credit also goes out to the screenwriter, Scott Silver, for doing such a fantastic job at capturing the fast moving, jumbled, cluttered dialect of the characters in the movie. The way they yell, argue, and talk over each other really gives the sense that these are real characters in real situations, thus making us more interested and more gripped by the emotional storyline. There is a cadence here dominated by slang and slickness, not to mention the actual raps which consist of some of the foulest yet hilariously entertaining put downs you'll ever hear. It's where the true poetry of rap comes in. 8 Mile really puts forth an effort to make rap seem like an art, rather than a joke and the results are excellent. This movie is an absolute triumph and shouldn't be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Just check it out,"Although the film is briefly based on his life, I thought Marshall Mathers did an excellent job of acting, considering it was his first feature film. The idea of an Oscar nomination is not an overstatement, based on what I saw from the rapper.  I felt he was believable as Jimmy Smith, Jr., and not Eminem.  Kim Basingner and Mekhi Phyfer do excellent acting jobs as well. Britney Murphy looks hot and that adds to the charisma of the film.  The drama with a little bit of comedy is the perfect combination for the Academy Awards.  The end Battle Raps by Jimmy Smith, Jr. versus the Freeworld rappers is and unforgettable scene that will forever go down in history. Congrats to Eminem on a great acting debut and we'll see him at the Oscars this year, if not for acting, he will definately be accepting the award for Best Song from a Motion Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not bad for a first-timer,"I had heard so many times already that Eminem had done a great job in this film which is loosely based on his life, so I wasn't entirely surprised that his performance was very good.  The story itself is fairly formulaic, but Hanson directs it with sufficient style that somewhat enhances a very basic plot.  There were several `throwaway' characters, and a pretty derivative conclusion but it definitely is worth a viewing even if you don't appreciate rap, because despite being a central plot point, there is actually not a lot of performance involved.  I'm certainly not hating myself for having finally watched it.--Shelly",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining Film but could have been Better.,"I thought this film was very entertaining.The script could have been better, especially to Brittany Murphy's character Alex, I mean I understand she did what she had to do to get out of her situation, but I wish there been some dialogue between her character and Em's character Jimmy, I like that scene between them when they set the house on fire, but they never build anything on that, there were no dialogue between them about where she came from or what her dreams are,I thought her character was the right person for Jimmy to talk to about getting out of Detroit, they try to make up for that by making her go to his work and convince him to go to the battle, but they don't build anything on that, they should basically made her his girlfriend and get rid of the Jeanne character atleast in my opionon. But what saves the film is director Curtis Hanson and Eminem, he won't win oscar and I don't know if he will do another film but the promise is there if he wants it. Thats why I give it B+ could have been A if script was better.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Lose Yourself...,"My friends and I rented this movie the other day for two reasons. The first one is that we all like Eminem very much and have listened to all his songs (except for the new album, Relapse) at least 20 times. My favorite is ''Like Toy Soldiers'' in which Eminem describes conflicts with other rappers and with the recording industry ''Murder Inc.'', but I also like the song ''Superman'' in which he talks about one-night stands with girls. The second reason was that, judging by Eminem's rapping style, it would have something to do with street gangs and all. Well, if this can rejoice you, it does have it's gang themes, but there is hardly any violence, because it is a drama. It talks about B. Rabbit (his real name is Jimmy), which is interpreted by Eminem, who did an awesome job in this movie. I really mean it! He was very good and deserved an Oscar. By the way, 8 Mile won an Oscar for the song ''Lose Yourself'' which was written for this movie and that song is very good. It's probably my favorite after Superman and Like Toy Soldiers. Anyways, Rabbit wants to become a Rap artist, and what follows in the movie is his road to respect as a white rapper living in a black neighborhood. Fight duels, rap battles and everything else is a rendez-vous in this movie, but what steals the show is the awesome job the actors did on 8 Mile.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
British view,"For those of you who haven't heard about this movie, it's the acting debut (ignoring Da Hip Hop Witch Project and The Wash) of Marshal Mathers III. This is not another film with a singer wanting to play at acting, this is Eminem demonstrating that the last three years of switching between Slim Shady, Eminem and Marshal have taught him how to play at being someone else. And that is the last I intend on referring to Eminem (as he is credited) and his other career, not referring to him as an actor demeans him and this movie.Not due out for a couple of months in this country, I will try not to spoil too much of the story for you.  I will however, try to save you from a little of the hype - and there's going to be a lot of hype.  This film is not a semi-autobiographical `Life of Eminem,' it has a couple of similarities and that's it.  Set in Detroit in 1995, 8 Mile tells the story of Bunny Rabbit (Eminem), a white, working class rapper and his struggle against gangs, racism and his own insecurities.  8 Mile focuses on Rabbit's attempts to get a record deal or at least some respect for his skills as a rapper.  At the start of the film we see Rabbit `battling' on stage at a rap venue, the only problem being that there are no words coming out of his mouth.  Despite the directors (Curtis Hanson) pedigree, this is still an American movie and we can all see where the narrative is going.  What Hanson does manage to do is guide us through the journey to its inevitable climax without us ever being too concerned with the fact that we know where we are going.The supporting characters are well played by a mix of actors and rappers. Mekhi Phifer is probably the pick of the pack as Future, Rabbit's best friend, who hosts the battles and pushes Rabbit when he needs pushing, even at the risk of their friendship.  Basinger as Rabbit's alcoholic trailer park mother is cast strangely.  Her performance is perfect, but perhaps the make-up department could do with a few tips.  If a poor single mother of two was living in a trailer park desperate for money to avoid eviction and she looked like Kim Basinger, she would be straight to Playboy.  Basinger needed making-down, not up.  Brittany Murphy, apart from looking eternally drugged to the eyeballs, was sorely underused, serving mainly as a shag piece for Rabbit just after he has defended a gay guy (the audience obviously needed reminding that Rabbit was open minded but heterosexual).  The other performances are fitting, no one steeling the show and everybody contributing to the plot.  We can only assume that Hanson directed them all well, as he has certainly directed the rest of the movie well.  Locations are honest (especially as the whole movie was shot in Detroit) and the visually are realistic, at times seeming almost like a documentary.  The final showdown battle feels like a climax to Faking It.8 Mile is a portrayal of the individual following their dream and doing what they need to do to achieve it.  The entire meaning of the film is captured by Eminem himself in the theme tune to the film:  `Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity / To seize everything you ever wantedOne moment / Would you capture it or just let it slip?'  The movie is uplifting in an unusual way.  It would not be giving away the ending to say that it doesn't end exactly the way you expect, although you can't help but feel a little pleased for Hollywood for having made a film that satisfies the audience yet doesn't stick to all the rules.Talks of Eminem being Oscars bound are probably a little premature.  There is no doubt that he has what it takes to be an Oscar winner, but it seems unlikely that this will be the performance that will garner him the little golden genital free man.  The film itself probably won't win too much by way of serious silverware, other than maybe for the soundtrack (which is itself integral to the film, in the most part).  In terms of major drawbacks from enjoying 8 Mile there are only a couple.  The same reason that most people will want to go an see it, Eminem, will be the main reason that lots won't. Those that aren't staunch Eminem haters should give this a chance, as he succeeds where so many singers fail, he convinces you that he is the character, you stop seeing him as Eminem very early on.  The other problem may well be the language barrier.  Large sections of the movie are rapped, not like a hip hop musical, but because the scene dictates this.  The battles, where much of the character creation takes place, for example, requires a keen ear to catch every word, but you will be rewarded for your concentration with some insults of quite unbelievable grace.This is a convincing debut from about the most famous man in the entertainment world and a good film that might suffer due to its inevitable hype.  Worth seeing as soon as you get the chance, in the hope of avoiding the media attention 8 Mile will get.  It is in parts amusing, tragic and painful, and will leave feeling hopeful although not completely euphoric as many an American fell good movie can do.  This is intelligent entertainment, something the film world is often found lacking.Mark:  8.5/10 Who to go with:  Anyone, but not a first date.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
somewhat of a dissappointment,"What can I say?  the hype machine pushing this movie obviously went overboard and it ended up letting me down.  I admit im not much of an Eminem fan but I have respect for what he's doing in music.  As a actor, ya he held his own.  Nothing great, nothing horrible.  The real stand out in the movie was Mekhi Pheifer.  He's a scene stealer for sure.  Brittany Murphy's character was flat and boring,  Kim Basinger didn't make me feel like how i thought i should feel for her and the story was just slow.  I was 65 minutes into it and still waiting for something interesting to happen, but alas, it never really did.  Even the ""Big Showdown"" at the end was a let down.  IMO Eminem should have left this story in his past.  4 maybe 5 stars is all i give this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
This is so real!,"This movie is so real. The film showed exactly how the streets of Detroit look. Being that i was born and raised in Detroit, i know exactly ho things are. I was proud of the director (Curtis Hanson) for actually going 2 Detroit 2 shoot the film. He could went 2 LA and called it a day, but that would have taken all of the realistic values. He stuck 2 scene and showed the rest of the world what Detroit is like. People down Detroit all the time. It's really not that bad. But Eminem did an excellent job playing Jimmy. You find a lot of men in Detroit that has the same back ground as his character. Eminem told a similar story of his own. He's a white male from Detroit that always dreamed of becoming a rapper. This movie was nothing but non-stop drama and that's what I loved about it mainly. It had it's humor, it had it's fun, it has all of the qualities of a good film. I suggest that anyone who hasn't it 2 either rent it or purchase it, u won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I am a fan of Eminem as well but even considering that when i walked into the theater to check this out, i walked in with an open non biased mind.

I expected a much different style movie but what you have here is a stripped down in your face raw performance by Eminem and crew.  See the movie if you are a fan of the Rocky genre.

I don't understand,"I will never understand why such a talented director, Curtis Hanson, would make such a boring, cliche, unoriginal, uninspired movie. Eminem winning an oscar? Hollywood needs to pulls it's head from it's own ass and see where the true talent is.I know all you ""hardcore"" white suburban kids can relate to this, God knows why considering you know NOTHING about oppression and hatred except that which he bring upon yourself, but if you're going to write a review don't call a movie ""tight"". THat's not even the meaning behind that word. Ebonics is not a real language.That said, this movie stunk. Not one bit of originality behind it. How many times can they make a damn movie about someone trying to make it and being the odds? I know most of the people who thought this and Eminem can't count that high, but this didn't even give us a little plot twist.I do have to say the rap battles at the end were well done, but its not worth sitting through to get there. Eminem is a good actor? Please. he had one expression and one way of delivering every line in the movie. NO ONE IS THAT MONOTONE is real life. and it's just like his music. He's a whinny little poor-me brat, just like most of the spoiled white kids out there who's parents but them his albums. Granted he came from nothing but enough. We get that you had it bad, HAD, and your mother was mean to you and your dad left, and people put you down. Well, now your rich and you complain about that? Get a life man, millions of people would love to be in your position. Why don't you do something intelligent like putting a positive message in your music, Stan was good, but that's it. And producing 50 Cent? Don't get me started on him. That is DUMB MUSIC for DUMB PEOPLE.But don't worry all you new to puberty spolied suburban white kids, I used to be like you when I was your age, not as rude or dumb, but you'll grow up one day.Bottom line...movie was OVER RATED and poorly paced.

The Best Movie Ever Made...,"To begin, this movie means a lot to me. I haven't seen another movie like this. One single word: "" PHENOMENON "". I think this movie didn't deserve only a single Oscar, but all of them !!! In the first place, I like it so much because it's only the truth: The life of Eminem (no lies and sh*t). So I don't believe it should be treated like other movies, but. You can see that yourself, I mean it was the movie that had the most controversies in 2003. So, even if it was the first time for Em to be on a movie, he played it like an Ace. U know ? Besides the fact that there are a lot of known actors on it, the movie was great. Plus, this is the movie that I saw the most times. You gotta believe me: I saw it like... 50 times... ('till now) - I still watch it. And really... To be honest with y'all, I never get bored... EVER... 4 Real. I mean that. Who would've think that Em will be so successful in his movie career too, huh ? I don't know about you, but I certainly did... It's really amazing what can you do, by making a cocktail with the music and the drama, right ? I like it so damn much, that I hope for a come back... Who knows ? I heard some rumors...

"Slow-moving, but effective","8 Mile (2002) D: Curtis Hanson. Eminem, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Phifer, Eugene Byrd, Omar Benson Miller, Taryn Manning.

Eminem's screen debut is a success, with the Grammy rapper delivering a terrific performance.

Meh,"This movie started out pretty good but dithered at the end. Its not too hard to rip off Flashdance and Purple Rain , but I guess it's no different then Eminem's music which rips off 2pac and Cage. I didn't like the music in it except for the few 2pac songs (heh) and eminem said bitch more times then a Too $hort record. I am hoping that there is no more movies with Mathers in them , for he cannot act. If you want a good movie about coming up in the rap industry I say go and watch ""Welcome To Death Row"" because at least that movie is real , this one is just precieved as real because the fan base of it is just that stupid.

Through the eyes of a non-Eminem fan...,"Coming home from a long day at work, I planned on retiring to my room to relax and partake in my favorite past time ritual: watching B-movies. Tonight's feature presentation? Spiders 2 starringwell, staring no one that's important, but that's not the point. As one could deduce from the title, the film revolves around giant arachnids constructed from plaster and other molding materials whose sole purpose on earth is to terrorize young nineteen year old couples about to consummate their premarital love. Sound interesting? Moving along, as I stepped through the door to my house, there lie on the dining room table, a rented copy of `8 Mile'. Going upstairs only to find my brother, the renter of this movie, asleep in his bed, I decided not to let his money go to waste on a movie that no one was going to watch. And so began my trip down 8 Mile roadBefore I can talk about this movie, two things must be said. Number one, I'm not an Eminem fan. I don't like rap music, not because I'm your average white suburbanite, but because it truly does not appeal to what I like to hear in my music. As for Eminem himself, I think the man is somewhat of a genius; he knows exactly what to say, he knows exactly who to offend, and he definitely knows who is going to take a stand against him (which is what he plans on). This Detroit rapper isn't just a troubled youth from the streets, he's much more; he's got brains. And although being an Eminem fan has nothing to do with being able to enjoy a movie, it does when the context of said movie revolves around Eminem, which leads me to the second thing that needs to be addressed: the basis of this film. We have to make clear that this film really revolves around Eminem's life; it's a semi-biographical piece. The fact is, put Eminem in any feature film as the main character at this point in time and it's going to succeed. However, put Eminem into a feature film discussing his taboo life which is covered by everyone from household kids to senators in Washington, and you've got yourself a blockbuster.Now that that's out of the way, finally, we arrive at the movie itself. After almost two hours straight consisting of a ritualistic, movie-watching silence and no in-between pausing, the verdict has arrived. Eminem is guilty of an excellent job of debut acting and this movie, which serves as his partner in crime, is found to be truly worth the near two hours that it takes to watch. From start to finish, this film creates such interest in its struggling characters, whether their on the screen for one minute or one hour, that the pace becomes unrelenting regardless of the scene moving at a fast or slow pace. Credit must also be given to the set designer and lighting technician who both created an atmosphere, which could take any six-figure CEO watching this film out of their mansion and into a trailer park. The combination of freestyle rapping set in with the night sky scenery and police sirens in the distance create this ambient affect, which you truly don't get in many well-crafted dramas such as this one. All together, for those who are on the ladder about whether or not to partake in the viewing experience of `8 Mile', I have this to say: take it from a heavy metal listening, horror movie watching, white, middle class suburban college student, this movie will have you mesmerized regardless of social status and leave you feeling inspired to pursue your own dreams of excellence.And I suppose that's where the problem with this movie begins, with the pursuit of excellence. Or better yet, Eminem's excellence. Those of us who finished the film thinking that we could stand up to our enemies, burn the bridges we built with our parents, and fight anyone in our way, need to take a look at the big picture. Sure, it's broadcast on national television all the time, stories about how people go from nothing to something and make a life for themselves; Jewel lived in a car, Eminem lived in a trailer park, but the reality is none of us are going to win rap battles, pave a path to Dr. Dre's record label, and get a movie based on our lives. My point is, the inspiration one gets out of this movie, while at first is a nice warm feeling, quickly fades as one realizes that it's impossible to live the life that Eminem has and even more impossible to rise to his level of stardom. It's a dream that honestly, maybe only one or two of us will get to live. It's with that said, that the inspiring feeling one gets out of this picture is false, because none of us will follow Eminem's footsteps.Otherwise, there's the usual gripes with lots a films: some bad dialogue, some lousy acting, one scene with unnecessary sex talk from Kim Basinger that had absolutely no place in the film and felt very out of context. It was probably added to stress the fact that Em's mom was not a very sophisticated woman, but it ended up delivering the message with poor taste and really just got me to laugh, which also could have been why it was used. On a side note, `Cheddar' of Eminem's posse was also a lazy addition and unpleasant idea. Used mainly to emphasize Em's unique style, this token white character adds a sitcom feel to the drama of the story. Every time he says some dorky `white person' line, I anticipated canned laughter to kick in directly after.But the biggest problem this movie has is Brittany Murphy's character, Alex. While everyone else in the film is obviously not pleased about his or her situation, be it in the rap world revolving around Detroit, or even Detroit itself, Alex comes along and 8 Mile goes from compelling drama to ghetto `Almost Famous' (That's the best way I can think to describe it, you know, `Almost Famous' with Kate Hudson and Patrick Fugit?) Brittany Murphy plays a dirty Detroit vixen who perfectly mimics Almost Famous' Penny Lane played by Kate Hudson, except this time instead of having Ms. Penny Lane inspire an up and coming journalist with her connections to the rock and roll world, this knock off Penny Lane inspires a rapper by, well, unconventional means. Alex is an unrealistic, unwelcome, and out of place part of this film. She acts like no one in the rest of the group and sticks out like a sore thumb. This is the only part of the film I had major issue with.Overall, I'm giving `8 Mile' an eight out of ten. I really enjoyed the movie much more than I though I would and have found myself retracting the negative comments I made about it without even viewing it first. Anyone looking for a movie to watch on a night where you have nothing to do can pick up this film and really get into it without getting bored. The pacing is fast, the rap battles are intriguing, and character development proceeds at rapid paces and never lets go. Even if you're not an Eminem fan, if you liked the proceeding descriptions of what this movie has to offer, I'd recommend you at least rent it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Eminem goes to new highs...without the doobie!,"For all those Eminem haters out there...take that! After pulling off a very strong performance in his movie ""8-Mile"", Marshall ""Eminem"" Mathers took home the most honerable award in the entertainment industry today...Oscar! Granted it wasn't for his role in Curtis Hanson's (an Oscar winner!) movie about the mean streets of Detroit (where Eminem, in fact, was raised). The rapper won for his original song, ""Lose Yourself"". Being from Detroit myself, I know what the mean streets are like. This movie pulled it off very nicely! As far as Eminem's Oscar, I just have one thing to say...""You better lose yourself in the music, the moment you want it you better never let it go.

Please understand that I am not really a fan of Eminem and would ask anyone who is wondering about this film to forget that you have ever heard of him.

I would say that this film ranks in the top 5 films of last year and would recommend it to just about anyone.Contrary to what you might think, this film is NOT filled with Eminems rap music and is more centered around a young rapper Jimmy `B Rabbit' trying to work his way out of poverty and do something useful with his life by getting some studio time to produce a rap demo tape.

Not knowing much of anything positive about Eminem, I thought it best to view it before taking her.  The R rating was also a tip..... I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  Not to the extent that the critics seem to be, but surprised nonetheless.  As many have already mentioned, the plot was somewhat limited, but the movie in general was good. It took a little getting used to the singsong of the rap as I don't typically listen to that kind of music, but it was entertaining and even humorous once I adapted. The sex scene, although unprotected(like any Hollywood sex scene is) was intense.  It was a bit nerve wracking, though, contemplating the possibility of them getting caught.

An experience one should not miss.,"The word for Eminem's performance is intense.The film, rather slow in action is nonetheless an eye-opener for those of us that know near to nothing about that music, that sort of life and an exceptional artist that one might love or hate but hardly ever not care about.  If it is indeed not autobiographical than well, you could have fooled me. However one might go to see this movie thinking he will find out facts but what you come out with is a degree of understanding. In the end it does not really matter how much of it is true to life.We went and found out that it is not a coincidence that Eminem is so grand - he really does have the ability to make people listen - 'tell them something about me they don't already know'.Well, he has managed to prove the point that there are some rare artists that have something to say even AFTER they have been stripped naked.It is an experience one should not miss.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The psyche of a star.,"Eminem could have taken an easy road.  He could have costarred in the latest Steven Seagal flick, or done a cameo for the Farrelly Brothers' next movie. He could have cashed in on anything he wanted to with his first movie, but he chose something a little more challenging than that.'8 Mile', named for the road that is the northern border between Detroit and the suburbs, is loosely autobiographical, shaped around the events of an up-and-coming rapper named Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. (Eminem).  Rabbit has to balance working for a living at Detroit Stamping with his dreams of a rap career and an escape from the trailer park he calls home with his mother (Kim Basinger) and little sister Lilly.  At night, he cruises the city in his beat-up car with his friends, the 313 crew (named for Detroit's area code).  One of the 313 is Future (Mekhi Phifer), who organizes rap 'battles' downtown, where young MC's square off against each other with stylized insults and rhymes - winner gets all the respect.The film starts with Rabbit psyching himself up for one of these battles, showing none of the anger and cockiness that the real-life Eminem is so known for.  Rabbit is unsure of himself, knowing he has talent but intimidated by the forceful personalities that surround him and not quite ready to burst out of his shell and let the world know who he is.  Even standing on stage, mic in hand and silent, hearing the boos and calls of 'Choke!', you can see that Eminem the actor has something here, a sense of character that isn't just him playing himself.  It's an intensity and a force of personality that is waiting for an outlet and he keeps it smoldering throughout the movie.Director Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) keeps the film flowing as sidebars and challenges arise that twist Rabbit in the wind.  His mother's boyfriend is a complete waste and not much older than he is.  Money is always an issue.  An opportunity for free studio time arises, but with strings attached.  A muse of sorts (Brittany Murphy, elegantly trashy here) wanders into his life at just the right time.  And finally, another rap battle against his rivals, in the same place he choked before.  By the time he takes the mic again, the audience has seen his long, hard climb to this point.  Opportunity is there, all he has to do is seize it.And seize it he does - the final rap battle brings the house down. Eminem finally lets loose with the skills we all know he has into a series of cathartic rhymes, taking on all comers. The last rap, where he takes all the bad things people have said about him and uses them to build himself back up, is pure genius and pure adrenaline.  By the time all is said and done, Rabbit walks off into the distance on his own - with all the confidence he'll ever need.Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver make some good choices here. Eminem's real-life controversial attitudes towards gays and violence is muted with Rabbit to the point where he befriends and sticks up for a gay coworker. The final scenes aren't the big payoffs - the record deals, the demos, the sold-out concerts - but instead are personal victories.  Phifer and Basinger do creditable jobs of building up and supporting Eminem's inexperience as an actor and help carry the film through.It's a worthy debut, and a movie to take seriously. '8 Mile' is gritty, honest, and rewarding.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Lose Yourself,"8 Mile is a 2002 drama that follows a young up and coming Detroit rapper as he struggles with life on and off the stage.Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring controversial rap star Eminem, 8 Mile is one of those movies that might not necessarily be everyone's cup of tea, but I think is a very good film. It has a great premise that is interesting and creative with several very intriguing characters that really pull you into the story. Although he's not known for acting Eminem did a phenomenal job and delivers a fantastic performance as B Rabbit. It's filled with a lot of entertaining moments, a terrific cast, and a climactic rap battle ending of epic proportions.It's too bad Eminem didn't do more acting because he has charisma and it's hard not to like him in this film.

I would like you to know that the guy who wrote this movie has a great imagination and should be awarded. Also note that this movie was the biggest opening day for a rated R movie ever.

Not the Real Slim Shady,"After the classic ""Slim Shady"" and ""Marshall Mathers"" LPs, Eminem hit the Hollywood show biz button with ""The Eminem Show"" (album) and ""8 Mile"" (film). The film is tailor made for the White Rapper. Eminem (as Jimmy ""B Rabbit"" Smith) blows a ""Rap Battle"", hangs with his Detroit 'hoodies, and nails slutty Brittany Murphy (as Alex). Eminem wants to be a Big Rap Star. He lives with trailer park trashy mother Kim Basinger (as Stephanie) and lil' blonde sista Chloe Greenfield (as Lily). Ms. Basinger gets to say the line, ""Greg won't go down on me."" Word way up...Curiously, Eminem does not sport his familiar (at the time) short, bleached do; instead, he wears a knit hat over more natural brown locks. Eminem doesn't contribute any rent money, but he works hard. He is careful to avoid drugs, unlike boozy mother Basinger. Who knew Detroit's ""8 Mile"" was so drug free? The soundtrack highlights are ""Lose Yourself"" and a fun rap-up of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Sweet Home Alabama"", which comes off better here than on ""youtube"". Still, Eminem's pre-Hollywood studio work is much more highly recommended than this semi-autobiographical movie sanitization.*** 8 Mile (2002) Curtis Hanson ~ Eminem, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Laugh-Out-Loud Bad,"This movie is so bad you're actually laughing throughout. By the end, the whole thing's spiraled into such a huge cliché about ""how tough things are on the streets"" that you're watching just to see what other silly line is going to come out of the actors' mouths. It should become a cult favorite the way ""Showgirls"" has. The dialog is utterly ridiculous, none of the actors deliver performances that are anywhere near believable and Kim Basinger as Eminem's Mom??? How the heck did that get by the studio? Eminem is just plain awful in this role (if anyone ever gets hold of Conan O'Brien's spoof of it, they should post it on You Tube). I'm not convinced he's a bad actor because I think the blame on this one goes to director Curtis Hanson and writer Scott Silver who should know better. But we're supposed to believe that Eminem is some hard-ass white rapper from the tough streets of Detroit. The sad part is Eminem IS from the same area this film is about yet he's so unconvincing that you wonder if he even grew up there. Brittany Murphy turns out to be the worst of them all, however, turning in a performance on par with Sanjaya's singing on ""American Idol"" -- you cringe every time she has to say something. This role must have been an attractive one for her and probably helped her career but if I was her I'd mention it as little as possible in conversation because it shows the ugly side to her acting.

"The story of 8 Mile centers around the life struggles and aspiring rapping career of a young, poor, white male named Jimmy Smith aka Rabbit.","Rabbit is played by Martial Mathers, who is better known as the controversial rapper, Eminem. Kim Bassinger co-stars in the film as Rabbit's emotionally unstable mother, Stephanie. Brittany Murphy also co-stars as Rabbit's new girlfriend, Alex.Rabbit grew-up in an unstable home on the wrong side of Detroit, Michigan with his alcoholic mother, where he still lives with his younger sister and his mother's young boyfriend whom Rabbit seriously does not get along with. Throughout the film there is the common, cliché feud of the opposing neighborhood crew that Rabbit and his friends feud with. In addition to these struggles, Rabbit deals with old girlfriend troubles and the start of the new relationship with Alex. Rabbit feels that his rapping skills are his only hope to escape the poverty, and hardships he is surrounded by. Rabbit makes various efforts to market his rap skills and prove him being white does not affect his musical ability, but he struggles to be accepted and respected by his local rap community. Do to this, and various other life problems, Rabbit begins to doubt himself.The theme of this movie is if you want something in life to not let anyone, even your own your own self doubt, stop you from achieving your dreams. Despite various betrayals by those he trusted, family troubles and being violently jumped by his rivals, Rabbit must stay strong and not let these problems break him down and ruin his shot at his rap dream. This film, and its theme, are similar to popular films such as the movie Get Rich or Die Trying and Hustle n Flow. Both of these films are about young, poor men from the projects who fight to pursue their dream of becoming well-known and well-respected rappers.The lighting and color of 8 Mile are dark, gray and gloomy which helps the viewer feel the dreary, sad emotions of Rabbit, and helps the viewer feel the sense of being stuck in the projects of Detroit, Michigan. The strong language and rap music used in this film are necessary to help the viewer understand, and to properly illustrate, the life style of Rabbit, and also to help the viewer understand his struggles and aspirations.Unlike many films where musicians try to cross-over into the acting, Eminem was very believable portraying Rabbit. 8 Mile, and the story of Rabbit's pursuit to become a respected white rapper, does a great job of demonstrating that one's self-doubt can be their worst enemy, and a person should trust in themselves, and fight for what they want.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Cool cool..,"8 Mile came out today and of course i went and saw it. It was a great movie. It proved Eminem could hold his own in the world of Movies. The plot was put together really well. Even if for some reason u do not like Eminem, which i wouldnt understand cuz hes awesome, u would have to admit he did it like a pro in this movie. Even though of course Brittany Murphy was a gross in this movie, u couldve guessed that since she is trashy. I really liked to see Eminems soft side, it was great. I did cry at one of the scenes. Yea well i just wanted 2 say what a great movie 8 Mile is! GO SEE IT!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
8 Mile: 5/10,"Basically, Eminem's acting `showcase' 8 Mile is one thing: unremarkable. Acting is unremarkable, direction, location, music, plot, all basic and nothing to write home about. About the only thing that could be said about this movie is the amount of language that was used (although it's nowhere near as much as South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut), and that's not something to brag about. The characters were all basic, no or barely any development to them, and they were just general people in Detroit.The plot is nothing new, just basically a `day in the life of' movie. We follow Jimmy Smith, Jr. (Eminem). Could screenwriter Scott Silver think of a cleverer name? His nickname is Bunny Rabbit, aka Rabbit, aka B-Rabbit, and he's a struggling rapper who has to move in with his mom Stephanie (Kim Basinger) and little sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield), while being the only white rapper out there, being that this is supposed to be semi-autobiographical. He is `discriminated' against, but he works his way uplove these deep plots in movies today!Well, what's there to talk about? I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, because there WERE none. I would have liked some development to all of the characters, since most of them were just thrown in there. Also, since everyone looked exactly the same, it was hard to tell everyone apart (well, obviously). We find out bits and pieces of Jimmy, Future (Mekhi Phifer), and Alex (Brittany Murphy), who pops up in various places. She must have used tons of hair gel to get her hair to stick out to make her look in poverty. LOOK in poverty, which isn't as good as Murphy actually acting like she was poor.Eminem's acting was like this movie was: either love-it-or-hate-it. As in the movie, I didn't love it nor hate it. He's not that great of an actor-he shouldn't quit his day job-but he's not like Charlize Theron. Basinger, after winning Best Supporting Actress in another Curtis Hanson movie (L.A. Confidential), thought she could be worthy of another one, and she tried, by God she tried, but I'm sorry, you just didn't cut it. Phifer was okay, while Murphy was stiffer than her hair was during the movie.Something that made this movie hard to believe is that it was `based' on Eminem's life. I can NOT believe this. This is not where Eminem had to live, it just seems so wrong. Also, I couldn't make sense out of that everyone was using the f- and n- word every second and had nowhere to go but still used 50-cent words. Basically, after you see 8 Mile, you won't learn anything new, your life won't be changed, you'll just have used up two hours of your life.My rating: 5/10Rated R for strong language, sexuality, some violence and drug use.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The best movie of the year!,"This is without a doubt the best movie of the year.  That's not to say that Eminem will be receiving Best Actor nominations at the glitzy award shows, but this movie has the potential to be a record breaking film.  It can't be denied that the young rap star has captivated the pulse of this generation, and like so few before him, has been able to transcend both racial and socal barriers.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Very interesting,"Eminem's debut performance was very strong and gritty. He won an Oscar for his song ""Lose Yourself"" and is one of the great talents of his generation.This movie realistically portrays the physical decay of urban areas such as Detroit that accompanies the rapid expansion of suburban areas. The rap battles central to the plot of the film are very interesting from an anthropological point of view. I first saw 8 Mile on 22 March, 2003, during the first week of America's illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq. What struck me strongly was that the characters in the film generally used words as weapons, instead of violence. Although impoverished, they are far more civilized than the current leaders of their country. We can only hope that more wise people like Eminem assume leadership roles around the world, in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
I may not like Eminem...,"Okay, I would like to state first off that I do not like Eminem or his lyrics or rapping. I am a 15 year old who is saying this. However, 8 Mile was on tv one day, so I decided to see what this ""great movie"" all my friends were talking about was all about. I sat down and I watched it, unbiasedly. This is an amazing movie, it truly is. Either Eminem is a wonderful father who really cares for children, or he is a better actor than anyone gives him credit for. His scenes with ""Lily"" touched my heart deeply. From this day on, I will view Eminem as a different person.Nora",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The final battles definetely, but also the movie gives a good view on how rough life is when you're living in the trailerpark and every day is really just another day of trying to get by..

eminem doesnt disappoint!,"Critics were uncertain of the film, since the lead was a rapper that gets into everyone's faces about anything just to rap about them on the cd's. some artists really stink up the movies with their leading roles, (britney spears, mariah carey) and some succeed (cher, j. lo, madonna) with the success the films get.  eminem fits with the winners who can tranform to both roles, singer and actor.  playing a guy ""rabbit"" who appears to go through the similar steps that eminem went through to achieve his rappingcareer.  rabbit and some friends go through the SHADY streets of detroit, trying to get rabbit to sell some of his raps.  and while doing all this, he trys to keep his little sister from harm after living with his mom in the trailer park.  the mom is a shaky character, played well by kim basinger, who after bless the child was not a good actor to me.  this role erased that image for her, and made the slate clean.  the same goes to brittany murphy, who seems to switch from good movies to bad movies.  the ending is the coolest and really captures the raw talent of the rapper, who does possess the skills.  i wouldnt be surprised if eminem does another flick like this, he really is good at it.  and besides that, the song that is on at the end of the credits was a hit for a long, long time on the charts.  the song was nominated for a oscar for the best song of the year. that's better than j. lo's thing when she had a movie and a hit song out.  but j. lo's song wasnt nominated for an oscar.. but anyways, the movie was a great success for the rapper and he can put that in his resimay, besides designer and rapper and artist.  what cant he do?  way to go!

A very good film with INCREDIBLE acting,"Many people refused to accept the fact that Eminem could possibly act. That refusal now looks silly and ridiculous after seeing 8 Mile.  While the movie is a typical Rocky-esque little guy trying to go big inspirational film, it is done with style and is very entertaining.  The two big things about this film are the actors and the director. Eminem (Slim Shady(Marshall Mathers III)) is absolutly astonishing in this film.  You want him to suceed.  You feel the pain of his failure.  You applaud his victories, and you love him, a thing many would not think possible of the white rapper.  As well, Kim Basinger's role as Rabbit's (Eminem's character's name) mother is amazing.  She has such poise and such ability.  Although she has a smaller role, it is felt during the film, and she keeps an amazing presence on screen. Curtis Hanson deserves props all over the place.  This movie would not have been as well done or successful if it wasn't for him.  The confidence in the film-making, the definitive style, the absolute honesty of the film is brought out by him.

"Move along, there's nothing to see here","Eminem's acting debut wasn't that bad... for a rapper. The role was perfect for him anyway, he didn't have to extend himself. He played a poor guy trying to get by on a blue collar job and doing rapping on the side. I think that is his actual life story. Not too hard to play yourself.The story didn't intrigue me at all. None of the characters were compelling nor were the issues the main character had to face. This movie had to be for Eminem fans.

explanation of the importance of rabbit's ex-girl,"ok, many of you feel eminem's ex-girl does not play an important role, and you are right, she doesn't play a important role as an actress. However, she shows the otherside of Rabbit's moral. Rabbit is portrayed as a hardcore rapper who is not afraid of anything. The otherside, brought out by his ex-girl, shows his softside that he cares about other people. He left her his car after hearing that she is pregnant, which shows that he is really a soft person inside. Also it seems that his ex-girl did not understand why he left her his car, especially the fact that she belives he is one of those hardcore gangstas. His ex-girl played an important non-cinamatic role, which is to show the side of rabbit that is the real him.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

lyrics have the power,"8 Mile is a movie based largely on an early life of Eminem in the suburb of Detroit. The movie does not show how Eminem became world-famous rapper. It shows that he was a talented white guy who loved rap which is primarily demesne of black guys. The film pictures very well how hard it is to make a breakthrough in music business. You have to be really gifted and likable and differ from others. Eminem shows exactly that. And there's no wonder what he has achieved for today.Eminem has a flair to do well. His rapping is exceptional. But he also proves he can act. He portraits basically himself though, so it's not that hard as landing on the moon. But nevertheless, he gives a good performance. He can talk, not only rap.Of course, what I most liked in this film, is music. Soundtrack is awesome. And I really enjoyed all the gigs in the movie. The lyrics were occasionally so money. As a big fan of Eminem and his music, I fully enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Quite Entertaining,"When I first heard about the movie 8 Mile I was kind of ""iffy"" on going to see it. I love Eminem as a rapper. I think he's very talented and has done a lot to the rap industry. But when I heard he was going to make a movie I wasn't sure he was going to pull it off. But I was greatly mistaken. I thought it was a fantastic movie and Eminem acted very well. Mekhi Phifer was my favorite in the movie because he played that character perfectly. I'm not a big fan of Brittany Murphy but I thought she played her character pretty well. I thought the rap battles were cool and I thought the Original Song ""Lose Yourself"" was a perfect fitting in this movie. I highly recommend this movie to people who are Eminem fans and that like good dramas.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A successful ""Musical"" but quirky to say the least","I am way ""behind the wave"" of posting my viewpoint on such an influential movie; I live in Michigan and must agree that such a ""true life"" filmed project needed to have been filmed on location to establish its veracity and mood.  So as to establish its time frame, the director/screenwriter furthermore mention that it is set in the late 1990's.  As a film released at the height of Eminem's (Marshall Mathers') musical influence in the area of rap/hip-hop, it does a great job of revealing how this artist's version of ""rap"" is born out of the working poor of the American Midwest.  A musical set in an urban ghetto is rather far from the typical Hollywood feature and it does go off in some quite odd directions.  I was relieved that the young child was not molested by a rapist in a run-down house and only slightly befuddled how the burning of an abandoned slum house was viewed as not having any substantial side-effects (e.g. catching other nearby housing on fire or injuring any of the young men who spray the incendiary materials around).   Certain of the conventional plot devices that could have been utilized are discretely undermined; for example, the disfigurement of being in a fight just before the film finale musical ""number"" is referred to by the hero in his disabling rap to Papa Doc.  A quite comparable film, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, treats Tony's injuries before the final dance sequence as just being casually not worth noticing.  The director has negotiated a quirky film that's really not spliced together video sequences and instead significantly tries to bring some of the despair of America's desperate poor to the attention of the entire youth subculture.  I rate it as an 8 kind of in acknowledgment of its calling itself after the landmark Detroit ""dividing line.""",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Interesting...,"I rented this movie, knowing very little and expecting to see an auto-biographical portrayal of Eminem's life.  Turns out I was wrong, but that did not make the movie any less interesting.Eminem did a fine job, for his first starring role.  In fact, I may be interested enough to see a sequel, providing that the quality portrayed in this film is maintained.One character, however, criticized by many was Brittany Murphy's character, Alex.  When I first saw her, I wondered how much she charges by the hour, if you catch my drift.  Sure she looked hot, but she seemed to be out of Rabbit's league.One thing I asked myself throughout the movie was:  being in the mid-90's, where are the Vanilla Ice jokes?  Rabbit was certainly a prime candidate, at least in the first half of the movie.Normally, I am not one who watches dramas, but I found that I had enjoyed the movie and may add it to my collection.  I gave it an 8 out of 10, solely based upon entertainment value.Now to compare this one to the other extreme, I eventually plan to see Jamie Kennedy in ""Malibu's Most Wanted.""",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Poorly done and A total waste of time,"In my estimation this movie is far from anything you can call ""a Well done Movie"". Its lack of substancialism and acting, clearly shows this ""muscician"" has to stay away from any set available. The movie has no rhythm at all. they are a lot of worthless takes, putting in evidence a lack of script. AT no point we see a sign of continuity. The expression is far from being good. If the movie appeal at one pint to show us the crude reality of the ghetto it failed big time. Thre are no clear deep moments, which bound to the core of their carachters. The music is poorly executed, and at sometimes it actually doesn't fit with the continuity of the film and makes it slower from what it actually is. There are better movies who express the relations between a dysfunctional family that this paid advertisement for a mediocre rapper. I still cant believe this movie got 6 points in this site... wow this totally show a lack of knowledge among all... I can't believe it actually has a higher rating than classic films. Prety ironic- FInally, we see Eminem's sister, screaming like a malfunction robot at every thing this kid that wrong... what a waste of salary, they should have left that girl inside a daycare, and off the set. It doesn't express or teach any message at all. But hey, they have to get a disturbed little girl for a good drama...

Classic,"8 Mile, directed by Curtis Hanson, is loosely inspired by Eminem's life, but it is not an autobiography. The film tells the universal story of a young man fighting to achieve his dreams despite the obstacles.Eminem, who plays the lead role of Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith, delivers a convincing performance. Even though he isn't an actor by trade, he perfectly embodies a young man trying to escape his circumstances through rap. The other actors, such as Kim Basinger, who plays his mother, and Mekhi Phifer, his best friend, make the film even more believable.What also stands out is the atmosphere. The audience is immersed in the poor neighborhoods of 1990s America, with their harsh realities and raw energy. Hip-hop culture is authentically portrayed, and the iconic final rap battle scene is unforgettable. It's both an intense moment and a powerful victory for the main character.In the end, 8 Mile isn't just a film about rap or Eminem. It's a story about perseverance, talent, and believing in oneself. A classic that remains inspiring even years after its release.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Stunning and wonderful,"I just saw it on DVD.  To me it feels like Saturday Night Fever for our generation, you know?  I mean you have a dreamer whose life is in a horrible place, his back is up against the wall and his opportunities are so limited. It was a fantastic performance by Eminem.  He's a good actor and if anything I worry they'll only let him do hip hop films and ruin him like Elvis.  The end credit track is searing and inspiring.  He holds the camera extremely well and I think he could be a huge film star if they don't make him remake Blue Hawaii with hip hop.  The only criticism is that I thought the location of the burning house right basically on a playground was forced and unnatural.  Other than that, perfect and I give it a ten.  Man, talk about a guy able to hold his own too.  Anyway, I know many dislike him, but I think he is particularly great in this.  Bassinger is pitch perfect as the nightmare mom who lost her faith in lottery dreaming and a lack of education.  A pitiful character, but a great performance.  J",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Excellent,"I think this movie 8 mile is great and Eminem should make more movies like this i know that he did this story as his past life but he can also make some more up or do another version of the film.

I think Eminem should carry on with his progress, because i think he is great and I'm a big fan of his. So keep up the good work Eminem. I like the way that Eminem has actually set out his past life and plotted it into a film because he finds this is an easy way to show people what he has been through. Eminem just started off as an ordinary rapper with not a lot of money but now he is a famous rapper and singer and all my mates like him and have loads of his albums and his 8 mile video. I hope i could be like eminem one day because hes wicked but he has a more stronger past than me and more of a story to tell. Eminem has many fans and maybe even more to come as the small children grow up. Whoever 8 mile is proper good and is a respected video.

A fine warmth,"8 mile pleased me very much and others it didn't. I'll go with the negavites first. The acting wasn't all great. Eminem did okay, but sometimes he just didn't clear his words out and he always got mad all the time. The rest of the actors were okay to but needed just a little bit more of teaching in acting school. Some parts were boring also. I mean it just got boring sometimes. Eminem was always through troubles and it just got boring that he got mad all the time at the world. It's like, okay now your a rap hero. Hard Life!! My positives were is that the movie was very exciting and funny. It kept you at the edge of your seat in a lot of areas, which I liked. The funny parts are like when Eminem rapped at the end to that one guy and was making fun of him. That and when the white guy in the ghetto shot himself accidentally. Oh my god that was hilarious. There were many very good scenes actually. I mean it was very realistic of all the happenings growing up in Detroit and it was just very stimualting as it grew. I think living in that neighborhood of trailers with one white guy and black kids around is very tough actually. I can see through Eminem's eyes how tough it was. Very realistic, indeed. Overall a very suspenseful film with great rapping from the greatest rapper of all time. If you want to see this movie, I highly recommend you watching this. I mean you can't miss the film or know what it's about. It's pretty easy if the movie comes from Eminem. Good movie and this what I call a movie, ""a fine warmth.""

Beautiful movie,I kind of like one or two of Eminem's songs but I was not what you would call a fan of his. Until 8-Mile came out my opinion of him was that he was a talented but somewhat white trashy performer with a lot of bitterness trapped inside. When I saw 8-Mile for the first time I was stunned. The movie carries an almost overwhelmingly positive and inspirational message and the acting is top notch.

Inspirational and well-crafted.,"The story focuses on a struggling quiet young rapper who is beaten embarrassingly in a rap battle early in the movie after he ""chokes"" when it's his turn to deliver the counter rap to his opponent. What makes this movie is the last 15 minutes with how the film is directed, the dialogue/rap lines (most of which I'm sure we're improvised), and how B Rabbit beats his foes. The rest of the movie is kind of slow and gets sidetracked but still, the 3rd act is so flawless that I can't help but give the movie all it's praise for that and it's worth something. Plus as a native to Detroit it holds a special place in my film collection. Who knew Eminem could do so good in a movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing,"8 Mile is Eminem's acting debut,and it's nothing short of phenomenal.It follows the story of Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith (Eminem) a young rapper living in the 313 district of 8 Mile road, after dumping his girlfriend after she says she's pregnant, he moves into his mum's trailer park home. It is basically a struggle day to day for Rabbit as he tries to survive in Detroit.I won't say any more except for you NEED to see this movie. Eminem does a phenomenal job playing Jimmy and the supporting cast is great too. The cinematography and directing is a gritty master-work. Also,the Blu-Ray transfer looks great and I would highly recommend getting this on Blu if you can.10/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Eminem does it again!!!,"This guy is a genius..... His music is the most original amongst today's rappers.... His songs are great... And then at his first shot in Hollywood he turns out to be an amazing actor too!!! Unlike Britney Spears of course, who had a terrible debut as an actor in ""Crossroads"". Some people might say that this movie was easy for M&M to act in because it was just the depiction of his own life.... Come on guys, atleast the movie than most of today's nonsensical movies like (Jackass, Kangaroo Jack, I Spy... etc. etc) The music in the movie is riveting and so is Eminem's acting. Kim Basinger is perfect as M&M's mom, but I think she is a little too beautiful to be a bum's mom... Oh well, without further adieu, go watch this movie if you haven't. I promise you, you won't waste your time. Have fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
As the mom of a rap music fan,"I`m a 45-year-old mother with a son who is heavily into rap. Therefore I was pretty familiar with Eminem`s music. At first I thought is was just raunchy noise with explicit lyrics. Then I really listened to what the artist was saying and found myself pondering the lyrics. When I heard that Eminem was going to star in a movie, I was a little skeptical yet intrigued. When I started reading the reviews of this movie, I was no longer skeptical and found myself actually wanting to see this movie. All I can say is I`m glad I saw it and on the big screen too. Marshall Mathers` performance was as riveting as the reviewers said it was. I was hanging on every word of his rap songs by the end. I must also say that Mekhi Phifer was also excellent. My final comment? Fine performances and even finer music.My son will be blown away by this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Definitive hip-hop/inspirational movie!,"This is the definitive inspirational movie of all time. The cinematography is great, there is a grainy, gloomy type of setting which signifies Rabbit's sorrow and anger for not being able to blow up and make it out of Detroit and 8 Mile road. The film (for those who haven't seen it and should), is about a young artist named Jimmy Smith Jr. (Em) who is very angry and frustrated with life. He raps in battles at a local nightclub, they don't rap for money in the streets of Detroit, they win the battles, they get the RESPECT, which is far more important to them. The film follows a very eventful week of ups and downs in Rabbit's life. He works a dead-end job at a steel mill called Detroit Stamping. His mother is a slut who is dating one of Rabbit's old high school classmates, she is about to get removed from her trailer for overdue rent with Rabbit's little sister, Lily. She is also constantly giving him crap about his rap career and his life decisions. He is forced to live with his mom after getting kicked out of his apartment by his girlfriend who says she's pregnant and is not, she also takes his car in the break-up. He finds a girl named Alex who he likes and she encourages him in his rap career, she ends up cheating on him with a so-called friend of his. He and his friends are in kahuts with another local rap gang-The Free World. Rabbit's group is from the 313 another local rap gang. His friend Future is the host of the battles at the club and encourages Rabbit because he sees his true potential. And in the end Rabbit finally makes it and wins the battles, gets the respect and goes home standing a little taller. This movie is the Rocky of inspirational films. It is raw, real and absolutely amazing. Eminem's performance is extraordinary for a first time actor, a performance not seen in a debut since Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. You should definitely see this film, it is a touching story underneath the gritty drama. Eminem does such a great job at playing a relatable character that you will find yourself laughing with his disses, feeling sorry for his losses, and rooting for him every step of the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Won't Fail To Satisfy,"With lousy attempts of the present day pop music idols rushing for the first time directors to put them on the big screen as a leading role, it's quite clear that the   history of singers-turned actors hasn't been a pretty sight. Although once in a blue moon they may just get it right, with a good director and reasonable cast all hope is not lost. 8 mile hit's the screen with rap artist Eminem in his acting debut teaming up alongside `L.A. Confidential' director Curtis Hanson. The story focuses on Jimmy Smith, an angry guy who is dealing with the realities of   life as everything comes tumbling down with him. His only gateway to sanity is his personal communication through rap music, which this film is obviously filled with. What makes this films stand out from so many others is that the music was a simple communication tool between the characters and the audience.The semi-raw cinematography certainly added more drama to the picture without the actual film giving off the impression of it being anything else but a drama piece of cinematic filmmaking. The film itself was quite explicit and certainly took you to the back-streets of Detroit With a shocking yet thoroughly entertaining scenarios of street rapping, gang fights, and the harsh realities we all face from time to time. This is without a doubt one of the most entertaining drama's of the year that will succeed in delivering enjoyment to all, regardless if rap isn't your taste of music. 8 mile is real piece of work to sit down too, with its sharp directing, interesting plot and satisfying performance's from the whole cast including first timer Eminem. This film clearly succeeds where all the other `pop-idols trying to make is as actors' tried so hard to accomplish.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Average pop movie,"Completely average, B-type quality flick. Simplistic plot, cliche characters, poor direction. It's not as cheesy as Glitters or A Walk To Remember or Crossroads, but it's still a pop movie utilizing a famous star and aiming at teens/young adult market. Replace Eminem with some other actor and this movie is completely forgettable. Please don't insult the Academy Award by talking about Eminem might getting nominated, this is no cinematic work, just a cheap way to make some bucks.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
An excellent entry into the musical biopic canon...,"This movie came out in 2002 (which cannot be over two decades ago!?) and I never watched it and (still) don't really know Eminem's music very well. We've been doing musical biopics for our matinee Sunday summer series and this one just appeared in our Netflix library. I enjoyed it so much more than I was expecting, and it's much better than many musical biopics we've seen recently. I didn't know much about him, other than a hilarious Kathy Griffin bit (""Allegedly"") about being around Eminem and the way he talked. He's actually a pretty good actor and while I love hip-hop and classic R&B, rap usually isn't my thing yet I'm always impressed at the rhythms and rhymes of rap artists. You've probably seen this if you're a fan, but if not, I'd definitely recommend giving it a look.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Want a great movie? It's right here,"What can i say All the details of the movie are amazing, of course, Eminem's presence only gives the movie 5 extra stars.

In addition, this movie can be a motivation and a new beginning for all people who are afraid to do something big or think they can't do it, the movie inspires the audience with the sentence ""want is to be able"".

Movie Makes The Cut,"No matter where we live, no matter who we are, we're all bound by borders... some real, some imagined. Many of us are content to live within these borders. Others are forced to. But some of us need to break out, burst through, even if what lies on the other side is both frightening and unknown. 8 Mile is a story about these boundaries that define our lives, and a young man's (Eminem) struggle to find the strength and courage to transcend them. I know a good movie when i see one and this one is just one of the very few in Hollywood these days. My personal opinion is that the movie isn't just telling us the life of Eminem but the hardships of near poverty and the struggle to survive in the slums of Detroit. 8 Mile 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
An engrossing movie with a refreshing naturalism,"No, I don't know exactly how realistic this movie was, or if it's likely a white guy would be tolerated as much as ""Rabbit"" was in the Detroit venues he frequented in the film.  However, the movie had a naturalistic sense about it that did remind me of ""Wonder Boys.""And Eminem can act!  Who would have thought it?  I thought he out-acted Kim Basinger in fact.  There are lovely naturalistic touches to this film: Eminem making up a rap to the tune of ""Sweet Home Alabama""; images of the depopulated and gritty streets of Detroit (who among us isn't fascinated by Detroit-- which has lost over 1 million residents since 1950-- and at the same time ashamed that the city doesn't get more assistance from our government and private charities in this supposedly prosperous nation); and the light banter between Rabbit and his friends.  No, naturalism and realism aren't exactly the same.  So I can't vouch for its authenticity, but no one associated with the film has maintained that it's an autobiography of Eminem's life.It's not the best film of the year and there are parts of it I would have cut out (the scene in the radio station, for one, which added nothing to the plot-- in fact I would have taken most of that woman's scenes out and replaced them with more about Rabbit's ex-girlfriend, whose brief scene showed her to be a capable actress who probably would have proved to be a more interesting character), but the fact remains that it does hold together and provides a refreshing naturalistic counterpoint to most of the stilted Hollywood films of today.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Solid Acting And Authentic Rap-Battles,Wow. This is a change. A hugely honest and refreshing movie about rap-battles and the ghetto of Detroit and how hard it is growing-up in the Big D and trying to become a successful man.It's honest. It's got an excellent narrative. It's got some killer rap-battles. The score is good hip-hop from the era and it's played-out with emotion and real grit. It's got the streets and the industrial aspect of Detroit. Also the rappers can really act properly. It's legit!It's a really well-made and constructive film. I'm really glad that Eminem kept this so damn real. It was almost a reflection of his own life yet is extremely fictional and is also very much different. You know the famous musician from the Big D that grew-up in a trailer park? The very one and only Jimmy Osterberg aka IGGY POP.Great stuff. 8/10.,8.0,Anonymous,Music

Crossroads it is NOT,"Of course I knew who eminem was before seeing this movie, who doesn't? And yes, I heard the talk that this movie was simply another crossroads, a way for the movie studio to make money by putting out a picture featuring a top music star.  The only difference?  This movie is based loosely on Eminem's life, while crossroads...well, any movie with Britney Spears as a valedictorian can't start good or get any better.   Anyways, this movie really suprised me to the fact that it's better than I expected.  Eminem is actually a pretty decent actor, and a person who might not have known anything about his life before this movie might gain some insight into the person behind the music, something people rarely try to understand before judging him.   Other than that, go see this movie and decide for yourself.  If you don't like it, at least have a good reason.  Too many people already discredit Eminem just because of who he is and what he says, they don't look through the act to the person.  After all, look how he treats his daughter, he's a heck of a lot better than most of the deadbeats out there today.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Completely Overrated,"Before I saw this movie, I had great expectations made from good comments from some of my friends. Oh so wrong! Eminem's acting was mediocre; he was just playing himself. I would like to see another film with him in it not on this subject, before I would give him a full review of his acting. I had seen this kind of plot before, poor guy goes so far and gets rich & famous. They could've used some different actors in this movie, i.e. Basinger could've tried harder.

Brilliant Movie,"8 mile is a great movie. It depicted Detroit's rap scene with an honesty and brutality that only the great Curtis Hanson can do. The movie is not a feel-good movie. And it also doesn't try to be anything other than what it is. It shows the hunger of the people of Detroit for a better life...but without the pushy drama that other films insist on putting on screen to comform with mainstream appeal. As for the actors, the infamous ""Eminem"" can definitely act. Amazing how he could actually be expressive and keep his mouth shut (not his usual style in his music) in this movie! Moreover, Kim Basinger portrayed her roles with her usual brilliance. Mekhi Phieffer and Brittany Murphy were convincing in their respective supporting roles as well. 10/10 for 8 mile!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Points of View on 8 MILE,"I saw him in concert.  I even bought his new CD this past summer.  But the movie kind of fell short of winning me over.  Some of it felt more like a PR campaign than a movie.To combat Eminem's rep of being a bad role model for kids, the movie shows him concerned for what his little sister sees.  For the flack he got over making homosexual remarks, the movie shows him using his rapping skills to defend a gay co-worker.  But, to keep his street cred, he then fires a paintball gun at a parked police cruiser to show he's still a young buck with edge.As far as his relationship with his buddies, that was kind of odd how he never really seemed to respect them.  It's as if they were just people he rode with on the bus - and he never got too close because he planned to get off at the next stop.  Even after he insulted them, they still treated him like some kind of superstar instead of smacking him across the mouth and flying without him for a while.But the oddest part of the movie was Brittany Murphy's character.  She's a wonderful actress.  But, the motive for her character thinking he's so great based on the little she observed of him was a stretch.They really could have had fun with her character by making her a puppet who was being used by the threatening posse to entice B-Rabbit to do a deal with them.  That way, it shows two ways to get what you want: To want the dream so bad that you'd sell yourself and do anything... or to go your own way and keep your integrity.  That could have been a good story point.Even after B-Rabbit finds his new lover having sex with his supposed friend, there was a fist fight between the males but never a frank discussion between man and woman about what happened, why it happened, and what this meant.In a further blow to his manhood, had his mother not been totally lucky and won bingo, he, his mom, and his little sister would have been evicted from their trailer. I guess the bingo solution was easier (and better for Em's fans) than showing B-Rabbit having no money to keep them from getting evicted.But what the hell.  It was fun anyway.  :}",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Hip hop Rocky,"Eminem is the best rapper alive, if not of all time. This opinion may make people see me as biased towards this film. If it helps, I thought 'The Wash' was garbage.This movie is well made and gives the rapper a great showcase. This isn't your average 'rapper wants to be a movie-star but can't act' movie. This rapper can act and he is surrounded with a great supporting cast to tell a story based somewhat on his own life.This movie will appeal to more than just hip hop fans because of it's story, but if you are a hip hop fan, you're in for a real treat.

It turns out musicians besides Bjork can make art films.,"Curtis Hanson and Eminem have one thing in common: they are creative in America at a time when creativity has succumbed, like everything else, to laziness. Instead of Glitter or Crossroads or any number of crapcrapcrappy films out there made by musicians who think they can act. And the comparison can be made to Dancer in the Dark, if only for the squalor that the protagonists in each movie must endure, combined with the violence necessary for each of them and the dream--that dream of music--that is there for both of them, at least in their fantastic visions of their futures.And all of this without a grandiose conclusion to the story. Eminem's Rabbit walks away from the movie with no BIG CONTRACT, no GIRLFRIEND, no RELATIONSHIP with his mother; in fact, he goes back to work at the factory. There's something to be admired in a story that doesn't have to bang us over the head with what it's trying to say. And the emotion rings true in Hanson's 8 Mile simply because he lets the actors act and the drama flows naturally.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Well-crafted and engaging,"I'm an Eminem fan and have enjoyed his music going back to his first major label CD, The Slim Shady LP. I read a lot of advance press for this movie when it was first coming out that stated that it was very good, and that even those who were not Eminem fans might enjoy the movie for its engaging pace or for its powerful depiction of realistic urban life or etc. I was still somewhat skeptical about seeing this, because I worried about Eminem's acting ability. Plus I thought he might be releasing it simply to promote his career in hip-hop. I found myself enjoying the movie on multiple levels. I mentioned that I'm a fan of hip-hop and specifically of Eminem. Thus, I was able to enjoy the rap battles and casual freestyling done by Eminem and his 8 Mile crew. I also found it to be refreshing in its realistic depiction of the experiences of ""B-Rabbit"". We see him living miserably with his sleazeball mother and his young sister in a trailer, and we see him working thankless factory jobs for low pay and with little job security. The movie takes the time to show us the mundane aspects of Rabbit's daily life, rather than inflating him to superhuman status merely because of his aspirations to leave the trailer park life behind or because of his skill at rapping. One thing that honestly came as a complete shock was the inclusion of a gay co-worker at the factory at which Rabbit works. I wonder whether they included this character in order to soften the public image of Eminem, who had previously made homophobic remarks in his songs and implied a sense of homophobia in his public statements. This character is depicted as being a nice guy, who covers Rabbit's shift, and he does not exist as the butt of any homophobic jokes (at least as far as I observed). The ending is unique, I won't give it away, but let's say that it doesn't take a textbook approach and I enjoyed it for its bold choice to be different from Hollywood format. The depiction of the 8 Mile neighborhood seemed realistic enough, although I've never actually been to Detroit so I suppose I am not familiar enough to say for sure. The supporting actors give decent performances, and their characters are written well enough to allow them room to really act. I had worried that this movie might become simply a close-up on the main character and might therefore force other characters to deal with poorly developed backstories. But that wasn't the case. Most supporting characters had well thought out parts. Although B-Rabbit's mother did seem a bit hazily written, just generally sleazy and revolting but not quite specific enough to convince me that this was a viable character. I would recommend this movie to Eminem fans (although I'm sure most have already seen it by now) and also to anyone who has an interest in the way life is lived by 20something people in the tougher sections of American cities. It's not a glorified world of gunplay, but guns are a part of their lives, and few of them have found happiness in their work or personal lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

From its glory days of the turn of the century to its decaying city neighborhoods of the present. ""8 MILE"" shows a realistic look into hip-hop/rap scene of the inner city - Detroit.The relationships of Eminem, Britney Murphy, and Kim Bassinger seem to interact smoothly.

The only interesting thing, for me, it is that the ""fight"", this time is a ""rap""-competion, the opponent has to chease one about the other, improvising the song lyrics in a 45 second contest.

It's nice to see a side of rap that few actually see,"8 Mile is a retelling of the classic theme of an underdog overcoming the obstacles attempting to hold them back from achieving a specific goal. In this case, Eminem plays Jimmy 'B Rabbit' Smith whose goals are set to make something of himself in the hip-hop world.The story takes place in Detroit and is focused around the 8 Mile border which separates the industrial part of the city from the suburbs, in effect separating blacks and whites. This is difficult for Eminem's character as his chances for finding success, much less making a name for himself, in the hip-hop scene is greatly effected by him living on the other side of 8 Mile. Though, due to his growing talent, he can't be ignored and once he finds his voice, he can't be stopped. Really, I think the most important aspect of this film is the realization of how important rap is as a creative outlet and how opening yourself without fear in that or any creative medium can defy even the boundaries of prejudice.As we know, Eminem became infamous for his controversial lyrics, however he also made it by being a good musician and writing his nonetheless controversial lyrics well. This is an important aspect in the film because throughout it, Eminem's character competes in ""battle raps"" where rappers throw ad-libbed insults at each other for 45 seconds to a house beat. Here is where the obvious Rocky comparison can be made pertaining to the ""big fight"" in the end where the outcome of the event is crucial. However, the ""big fight"" in Eminem's case is a final battle rap and it is an inspiring example of the pen being mightier than the sword. Also, while watching these, you can't help but appreciate the literary knowledge that goes into some of these performances. It's nice to see a side of rap that few actually see, which is how much poetry and soul actually get put into many of these songs, aside from guns-girls-gangsta lyrics that we're all used to hearing.Also in the movie, Eminem's character goes through many hardships within his personal life. His mother, played by Kim Basinger, is a drunk, drug-addicted, woman who's sleeping with an annoying redneck that Eminem's character went to high school with. On top of that, he's dealing with his own relationship troubles and the threats from the rival rap gang the ""New World"". So, with everything slowly spiraling down in front of his eyes, he becomes self-conscious and afraid. However, through his music he's able to open himself up and clear his mind and thus rejuvenate his inner strength.Also worthy of mention are the actual film making techniques this movie used. For example, to elevate the feelings of despair and claustrophobia, many scenes are at night or in dark clubs with characters in mainly black clothing. The color blue is also used a lot to elevate those feelings. Also, the camera work is fast-paced, yet sharp, giving off a feeling of anxiety and dangerousness. This accompanies the roles outside of Eminem's because there's a certain mysteriousness surrounding everyone that makes the viewer not want to trust their intentions.Unfortunately, the fact that the outcome is somewhat predictable because it is, in fact, loosely based around Eminem's real life. However, this can be forgiven because the part that's intriguing is how he gets there. Overall, this movie is bound to, at very least, tickle the literary senses of those who can find it in obscure places and to (hopefully) open the viewer's mind to the beautiful side of a culture that has gained an ugly reputation.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Thats the way it is,"In a time where hip-hop is a way of life and a form of expression of all,Rabbit(Eminem) learns that you can not become king of the world if you are not even prince of your trailer park.Hanson shows us how its done in this amazing film that borderlines on documentary.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Not my first time viewing...,"(This review is based off of a repeat viewing, and not a first-time view) It's easy to write off 8 Mile. After all, it stars Eminem, an it was virtually ignored by the Oscars. It did win the Best Original Song award. So that's something. Rappers as actors, easy to disregard. Eminem changes that idea, and turns in a rather groundbreaking performance playing herself. He really dominates every scene that he's in. He never looks lost, and really feels invested in his character and performance. He's definitely one of the better rapper/actors we've seen.His supporting cast is really good too. Kim Basinger, especially, turns in one of her best performances as his crazy mother. Her desperation is obvious in every frame. Brittany Murphy is great as Eminem's love interest, and Michael Shannon works well in a small role as a sleazy guy.Since I'm reviewing this film on my third or fourth viewing, eleven years after it first came out, this is kind of a skewed review. But I've loved the film every time I've seen it. That has to stand for something.If you haven't seen the film in a while, go back and explore it. Really watch Eminem, and you'll see his potential. Or, watch it again to appreciate what the late Brittany Murphy had to offer. She had so much going for her, I wish we had been able to see her career all the way to her old age.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Eminem!,"Ok... here's the deal.... if you're an Eminem fan and you haven't seen this movie, watch it.  If you're not an Eminem fan and you haven't seen this movie, watch it.  He was great, he was in every scene and he did total justice to his role.  The story's not all that bad either... a guy who just doesn't let go of any opportunity he might get to make a better life for himself and gain the respect of people around him, most of whom are of a different race.  Quite meaningful and well written.  9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"8 Mile: A Raw, Real, and Rhythmic Journey","""8 Mile"" really surprised me-it's not just a movie about rap battles, but a gritty dive into struggle, ambition, and identity. Eminem absolutely nails it as B-Rabbit, a guy battling his own insecurities as much as he's battling the crowd at those underground rap battles. I mean, that final showdown? Pure goosebumps. The way he flips the script and owns his flaws-chef's kiss. 🎤I loved how raw and unpolished the film felt-it didn't sugarcoat anything. The scenes in Rabbit's home, especially with his mum, Stephanie (Kim Basinger), were so messy and real. You can't help but cringe at her poor choices and feel for Rabbit as he tries to keep it all together. And let's not forget his adorable little sister, Lily, who adds a softer, more vulnerable layer to the chaos. She's like this tiny flicker of hope in his life.Now, I'll admit, I wasn't a fan of the romance subplot with Alex (Brittany Murphy). It felt undercooked, like it was just there to tick a box rather than add much to the story. That said, Murphy brought a certain spark to her scenes, even if I didn't fully buy into their chemistry.The music, though-wow. It's like the soundtrack is a character itself, weaving through the narrative and adding so much weight to Rabbit's journey. ""Lose Yourself"" still hits hard to this day. The atmosphere of the rap battles is electric, with tension so thick you can feel it through the screen.One thing that stood out was how the film captured Detroit's grit. The setting wasn't just a backdrop-it was alive, almost suffocating at times, adding to the pressure Rabbit faced. And his crew? They're flawed and frustrating, but they make Rabbit's world feel authentic.""8 Mile"" isn't perfect, but that's part of its charm. It's rough around the edges, just like its protagonist. If you're into stories about resilience and finding your voice (literally and figuratively), this one's worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Far Better Than I Knew,"I was not only surprised but overwhelmed by the quality of this movie, since I was really expecting a self-aggrandizing pity party explaining Eminem's provenance.I was so wrong.This movie is rich, dark, moody, enlightening, intense and very well done. I am probably one of the last people to see it, but if you haven't yet, grab it on DVD.I really am amazed at Curtis Hanson. He does this to me every time. Same thing happened when I finally saw LA Confidential, which really does justice to Ellroy's gorgeously gritty book, and blew me away by far exceeding my expectations.Another gem in 8 Mile is Eminem. Jeez! Who knew???? What the.....???? Somehow he manages to inspire in me all the respect I never wanted to have for him. I used to think he was an opportunistic jackhole who was riding the break he got for all it was worth. But in this movie I see an artist not only gifted but sensitive and responsive to the times. My God! Believe me, no one is more surprised than me... This movie is very very good.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Better Than I Expected,"After finally seeing this movie, I understand what the hype is about. Judging crossover performances as a whole, I believe Eminem certainly presents a more compelling screen presence than Prince did back in the eighties. The story is realistic, and well-told. Even if you're not a rap fan, as I am not, the movie has more to do with the lives of people whose story is rarely told without histrionics and distortion. My only real complaint is that Eminem's sense of humor, which for me is the only thing that sets him apart, should have been more in evidence. Let's hope he gets another chance to showcase that side of himself.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Realistic in good ways and bad,"When I think of 8 mile I think of the word ""Realistic."" I wouldn't say ""Good"" nor ""Bad"" but realistic.To start, the characters are very realistic, layered, and each one of them behaves in ways you'd expect people in their situations to be like. This is a heavy foundation of the film as you enjoy seeing these characters on screen and how they react to new situations. Also the direction was surprisingly well done. I went in expecting this film to be carried by it's star actor but the direction, especially the atmosphere of the city at night, was very authentic.However, the story is not the greatest. Don't get me wrong, the idea is great and I suppose all boys have at least dreamt about being a rapper, but the film fails to support it's realism in the story. Things happen in this film to inconvenience or convenience the main character, and don't happen naturally. Sometimes there is hinting that these things will happen but that is the most you are given. This makes the films three act structure really forced. Another problem I had was that the film sort of forced you to agree with its opinion. Staying spoiler free, the characters do things, or make some rhymes, and the film sort of says ""Yeah that's right, this is cool, and this is right!"" without leaving you the space to make your own mind. Final problem, for a film about music, there is quite a lack of music and original songs. There was only one original song, which was ""Lose Yourself."" It did deserve to win the Oscar as it matched everything in the film and, by itself, is a good song.Overall, I would recommend this film to watch as an example of what a totally realistic film looks like, for better or worse.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

8 mile,I'm a huge fan of Eminem. I love that 8 Mile is a classic hip hop/ Drama flim. That was based on eminem's life. The song Lose Yourself is one of the greatest songs that eminem made. This film is a thought-provoking. The story didn't fail to impres and the cast has a great performance.the movie was realstic and mesmorizing getting audience attention. The movie is tight . I give it an A for best flim of All time,10.0,Anonymous,Music
