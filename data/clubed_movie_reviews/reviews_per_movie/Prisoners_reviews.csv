One of the most chilling thriller movies I have ever seen.,"""Prisoners"" is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. This movie had me love and hate Hugh Jackman's character which was so complex to the point of making me question my moral standards because I found myself empathizing with his character. On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal did a marvelous job on playing the frustrated cop: complete with all the intensity of his eyes and his intuition. While Gyllenhaal had more screentime as the lead, Jackman's performance really stood out for me.This film doesn't use jumpscares (often precluded by suspenseful music to build-up the tension and are often abused in this genre) in order to thrill the audience, but rather, moments of silence and stillness. Its calm and cold vibe stirs up the kind of anxiety it wants its audience to feel, and naturally, the audience would want to get rid of that uneasiness by knowing what's going on, thus, cleverly forcing them to watch the entire film which runs about 2 hrs and 33 mins.The director, Denis Villeneuve, incorporates his ""less is more"" style of using soundtracks in this movie (just like what he did with Blade Runner 2049) to emphasize the scenes, especially with the ending (heavens know how much I liked that ending). It's not rocket suspense but the simplicity of it makes your mind wander to other possibilities which I think is often a good indication of a brilliant film since it's open for other interpetations.However, one thing that won't make me rate this a perfect 9 or 8 is the fact that I'm not entirely convinced on the motivation of the antagonists for doing the things they did. It felt a bit rushed (for the lack of a better word) and while it makes sense, it doesn't leave me satisfied",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
More than just one meaning,"If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller","Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.It simply raises the question: When your kid's life is at stake, how far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us, blurring the lines between good and bad people.For a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense, Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief, empathy, guilt...throughout the film.The film's atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of time.However, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and believable.Highly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented casts.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A brilliant masterpiece of atmosphere and suspense,"This was one intense movie-going experience. Throughout the entire running time of the movie, the suspense never lets up.The director masterfully weaves the haunting atmosphere, and I was at the edge of my seat. The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The acting was wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul Dano's). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as the rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking cinematography.All those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Wonderful Mystery That Keeps You Guessing Till the End,"Prisoners (2013)**** (out of 4)Incredibly well-made and intense mystery about two little girls who go missing and the detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) put on the case to find them. When the original suspect (Paul Dano) is let go, one of the girl's father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take justice in his own hands. I really had high hopes going into PRISONERS and my expectations for a great film were met but I must admit that it wasn't anywhere near the type of great film I expected. A lot of thrillers these days are limited on talk and emotions and instead we just get one big, staged action scene after another. That's certainly not the case here because the film takes its time (153-minutes) telling its story and there are so many quiet moments where we just see the characters losing their grip and emotions as they try to make sense of not knowing where these two girls are. What really pushes the film over the edge are the terrific performances with Jackson leading the way in what's the best performance I've seen from him. This isn't your ""loving"" father in the traditional sense. Instead he's someone quite scary from the first time we see him and we see how much worse he gets as the picture goes along. While on one hand you sympathize with his situation, on the other hand you really can't support what he's doing and often wonderful about his own involvement in things. Jackman really comes off like a man full of emotion and rage and he just doesn't know how to properly let it out. The anger he shows throughout the film is something so raw that you really do feel as if you're watching a man who has a daughter missing. Gyllenhaal also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played the detective role. I really loved the various obstacles that his character gets put through and especially the own weakness and at times stuck-up approach. The supporting cast includes wonderful performances by Dano, Melissa Leo, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. The screenplay isn't going to give you a lot of easy answers and there are many times where you hate the lead characters and can't find anything in them to root for. I thought it was quite brave that the film was willing to take so many chances and it asks the viewer to ask themselves many questions about how they would react to what's going on. I can't say I agreed with all the choices but it's great that a film actually makes you think as that's something quite rare these days. PRISONERS isn't exactly an ""enjoyable"" film as it has you feeling dirty throughout the running time but if you stick with it the thing is certainly very rewarding.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
'Prisoners' is a tightly wound thriller featuring career bests from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal...,"There is a sensitivity that Director Denis Villenueve and writer Aaron Guzikowski inhabit in bringing their newest film ""Prisoners"" from Warner Bros. to the screen. Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.The synopsis is fully in the trailer. When two young girls go missing, one belonging to Keller and Grace (Jackman and Bello), the other to Franklin and Nancy (Howard and Davis), a hot-shot detective (Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and relentlessly tries to find the clues that could lead to the whereabouts of the missing. When a mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Dano) is found near the scene of the disappearance with no hard evidence, Keller takes matters into his own hands.I have to say that I've never been this hypnotized with the works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman, who is fresh of his inaugural nomination for Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"" has capitalized in a massive way. Approaching his character with the ferocity that made him a star in the ""X-Men"" franchises, he hammers his way into every scene, keeping the audience guessing about their own moral complexities. He tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done.When it comes to Jake Gyllenhaal, many, and probably for the right reasons, gravitate towards his work in Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" as his shining moment in film history. I believe he's gone deeper in works like ""Jarhead"" and ""Zodiac"" but those were just the surface of what he can do as an actor. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. He also orchestrates character beats and ticks that's reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's towering work in ""The Master"" last year.What is very refreshing in the film is it offers a great reminder of how brilliant an actor Terence Howard is. The Oscar-nominated actor seemed to fall by the wayside following his nomination for ""Hustle and Flow"" in 2006, coincidentally the same year Gyllenhaal snagged his first, and now has realized his capabilities when he chooses more dynamic and passionate characters. In a film that centers around his involvement, Paul Dano doesn't have too much to offer but is completely adequate in form.The film however is not entirely perfect. Aaron Guzikowski's depth screenplay offers a great mystery story, full of twists and turns, all the bit a tad predictable, but that's not where he falters so much. His construction of the female counterparts, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Melissa Leo, are not as crisply or smoothly put together as I'd like them to be. They each have one ""scene"" that gives us their character's motivation and the look into their cinematic psyche however, some are thrown in quite lazily and manages to halt the story in spots.The film's technical merits all rise to the abilities of its cast. Roger Deakins, the most overdue Cinematographer in the business, captures stunning portraits of conversations, weather, and scenes that continue to prove his brilliance in the film world. The film's score is masterfully placed by Jóhann Jóhannsson while Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film to an impeccable pace.At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. I feel there's a shorter cut of the film that would surely be a Best Picture nominee for this year's Academy Awards if it existed. The film could still garner that support with what they have now, but I think there are aspects of the film members won't be able to get around. A high level of violence and torture scenes infused with a longer run time could keep people at a distance. One thing that can't be denied is the towering works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. The two have offered plenty of memorable performances in their filmography, but their work in ""Prisoners"" is cut and clear their best they've offered.""Prisoners"" is a magnificent achievement for the film year. Thorough, enigmatic, and purely amazing. A must-see for the movie lovers.The film opens in theaters this Friday, September 20.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity,"Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her.A spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn't feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There's one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters' actions and the characters themselves, and there's the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can't possibly (always) be the ""goody-two-shoes"" heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie's events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk.And holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles.Speaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you've left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that's transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year's Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding.Furthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and ""fun,"" such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that I'll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let's hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Bleak,cold, sensational","Prisoners are quite possibly one of the greatest mystery/thrillers to hit our screens in decades which this film nearing its 10th anniversary next year its in my eyes an instant classic up there with films like seven, pulp fiction and silence of the lambs which are all three of my favourite crime thriller type films of all time.What this film does so well at is creating such a bleak and quite a gloomy environment around the characters using beautiful cinematography and weather and the overall mood of our characters, I suppose it's extremely realistic in the angle of capturing stages of grief and rage abd desperation that's what this film portrays for me.Id says this is Hugh Jackman best ever role in his entire career yes that includes Wolverine, the way jackman captures tbis man's grief and anger mixed with fear was just out of this world which him going down this reckless and dangerous path to get his daughter home was just outstanding, and the things he does in the progress which just made my stomach turn and that, not just the violence and torture he took part in it was his emotional display which is completely shown in the 'hammer' scene which is maybe one of my favourite scenes ever put to a modern film.The supporting and main cast was as good as jackman with jake Gyllenhaal as detective loki trying all in his power to uncover this sick mystery.With some explosive and borderline chilling scenes.What makes this film As stellar as it is, is the element of not knowing what twist or turns we are gonna see and with the perfect twist at the end of the film which tied the film together beautifully, then not forgetting to mention the most aggravating ending I have seen and that's a positive.Prisoners are cold, depressing, and ugly which makes it the perfect mystery-thriller which adds everything you could seek from a film of this magnitude because it uses its two hours and a half-run time perfectly!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Loki the detective,"I knew so little about this film before I watched it, I really thought at first it would be a Prison movie! The title is a metaphor.Prisoners has shades of Mystic River. It starts during the holidays in a small working town community where two young girls disappear believed to be abducted or worse.A suspect is found and later released by the police. One of the parent abducts and systematically tortures him.Meanwhile the detective assigned to the case methodically works the case and realises that this case may have links to the past.The film is long, harrowing in places and builds a lot of tension but it keeps you glued to the screen, that is no mean feat.It may have flaws with some convenient coincidences as well as some red herrings to keep you off track.Hugh Jackman is the father who takes the law into his own hands, aided by a more reluctant Terrence Howard who is the father of the other child that has been abducted.Jackman is the religious, hard working every-man whose raw anger threatens to tip him over the edge.Jake Gyllenhaal stands out with his tattoos as the methodical Detective Loki, he is more smarter than he looks.Roger Deakins moody cinematography adds a lot of atmosphere to this film which is very well acted by its ensemble cast.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Hugh Jackman's finest role?,"Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative. This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Jackman Shines in Villeneuve Classic,"Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce.Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover's each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear.Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover's suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard's Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child.The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children.Denis Villeneuve's last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.www.killerreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Jackman shines in dark thriller,"Prisoners movie reviewPrisoners is a Mystery/Thriller film starring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, and Paul Dano. Prisoners is a film about two families who both of their daughters get kidnapped and both of the families with the help of the police, investigate and look for their daughters. This is a very dark, grim, and at times is a hard film to sit through. That being said, I have created a PainOmeter scale out of five (five being the worst) to inform you guys if you simply cannot take very violent and painful scenes. This will be addressed along will the film's final score. I loved this film! Hugh Jackman plays Anna's father and is the protagonist of the film. You can see how Jackman really loses his rag and does a great job as Keller Dover. There is one scene that involves Jackman doing something that I won't spoil but you will notice it and go WOW! The story is also very thought provoking and will keep you on the edge of your seat because of the direction and character building involved with this movie. Also Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones, is this weird adult with the IQ of a ten year old and is the main suspect of the investigation. I thought he nailed just the right tone of the character and was hard to ""look at"" at times. My favorite part of the film was surprisingly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the detective looking for the missing girls. Gyllenhaal still plays the role of a cop very well after all of that training for End Of Watch. Another great part of the film is that it manages to never take a rest on character building and story development. I hate when films give you time to take a break then start all over again and this film really avoids that entirely. I really have no problems with the film except for the runtime. Even though this was a great movie I just couldn't go for a perfect grade of an A+. I will give Prisoners an A solid.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Excelent Film.,"This film knows perfectly how to keep the tension in the viewer, since it keeps you interested throughout the film in what will happen next. In addition, it composes a somewhat slow rhythm but full of intense emotions that makes you empathize and understand the characters present. In this movie you can also appreciate the performances of the actors so involved in the character they play, since the emotions they convey with their actions are very realistic and dramatic at the same time, which makes you feel the anguish or sadness they feel. As the film progresses, it leaves you clues about the culprit of the main event, and although the outcome of the plot surprises you, the point of the film is not exactly that, what the film seeks is precision in the writing of the complete story, which makes the whole film a great cinematic demonstration of pure suspense. And although the ending may be a bit unfinished with what will happen next, that is the essence of the film, to have an ending that, as the title itself says, keeps you intrigued/suspicious, allowing the viewer to make a voluntary interpretation of the events to come.I definitely recommend this movie for all the good lovers of crime, drama and mistery movie genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Spellbinding,"Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis.

Long in length and high in suspense and tension,"That 'Prisoners' is directed by Denis Villeneuve, has cinematography by Roger Deakins and a music score from Johann Johannsson promised a big deal, having seen 'Sicario' and being blown away by its brilliance, especially in these areas. As did having a cast of talented actors such as Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo.'Prisoners' almost lives up to the acclaimed hype with most of the film being absolutely exceptional, but doesn't quite make it. Its only major stumbling block is that it spirals out of control towards the end, the tension does slip, there are big lapses in credibility and characters' actions and morality issues become implausible and much less believable. Having been so impressed with the rest of the film, this was a real pity. Maybe it is a little overlong too.On the other hand, Roger Deakins shows again why he is one of the best contemporary cinematographers in the business with cinematography that's stunning and darkly gritty, also bringing out the visceral horror. The production values in general are impeccably audacious and deeply haunting and the editing is suitably stylish.Johannsson's music score is suitably ominous and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation.Villeneuve's directing has a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge that is perfect for the story.While the script is not quite as taut as that for 'Sicario', it does provoke thought and its unsettled nature hits hard. The story is not perfect, but a vast majority of it is nail-biting in tension, frightening in its suspense and very much edge of your seat. It is very violent and is not for the faint hearted because it is so vivid and the turn of events are unpredictable and devastating. It's deliberate in pacing but never dull, despite slacking towards the end.Characters are interesting, especially Jackman's increasingly unpredictable Keller Dover. You don't condone what he's done and his actions are extreme and one can sort of understand why he resorts to such drastic measures.Jackman is at his most hard-hitting, a shocking atypical performance that is among his best. Gyllenhaal is firm and understated, Dano is at his most unnerving and at times affecting and Terrence Howard gives one of the best performances he's ever given (showing that with the right material, like here, that he can be good).Davis and Leo, as to be expected, are outstanding, as is a poignant Maria Bello.In summary, 'Prisoners' may be long in length yet high in suspense and tension. It had all the makings of an exceptional film, and actually was for most of its running time, but that the ending disappoints as much it does it goes down to being a very good one. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
good intense,"Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is searching for a child serial killer, and catches Alex Jones (Paul Dano) in an old RV. Meanwhile, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) lose their daughters during a gathering. Loki has to let Jones loose, but Dover is not letting him go.Paul Dano always does a great creep. Jake Gyllenhaal does a capable cop, but I think he overacts sometimes. The interrogation room scene comes out of nowhere. I think that was a mistake. The big acting comes from Hugh Jackman. He's the key to this movie. It's possibly his best performance. He is intense without being melodramatic. What Keller Dover does in the movie is absolutely fascinating, and morally dangerous. I do wish the film go full out on that route. The film does let him escape morally a little too easily.Director Denis Villeneuve is a skilled Quebec filmmaker. He has fashioned a tight intense thriller. However, it resolves too neatly. It's a dirty dark movie. I'd prefer an ugly dark ending. Although I'm not going deduct any points for that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"a brilliantly tense and gripping story, terrifyingly and impeccably told","Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Terrence Howard were incredible in this ensemble cast film. Viola Davis and Maria Bello were very raw and convincing as the wives but it was Jackman and Gyllenhaal that stole the show. A gripping a visceral tale about two girls being abducted and their parents and the Detective who is investigating the disappearance's experiences. It's a rather twisted psychological drama, cleverly written and powerfully performed. Set in (fairly) small-town America with poignant crises of faith adding a shadow and depth to the tragedy. Clues along the way were subtle and the unwinding plot was natural and not contrived. It was an intelligent film.Tense and edge of the seat all the way through, made darker by the weather, and simple non-SFX almost old fashioned filming. It had a vintage seventies feel, despite being set in modern times. It made the viewer question morality, choices and how far you would go to protect your own. Jackman's descent into desperation was relatable and understandable. His scenes with the Paul Dano were terrifyingly good.Dark but essential cinema viewing. Brave performances by all actors and great direction and screenplay. You may feel shredded as the credits roll. Possibly 9/10, not sure yet.

Dark and morally murky even if it doesn't have the courage of its convictions,"In the space of a few days both the male stars of this film were so heavily into promoting it that they both appeared on the Daily Show on different nights. This suggested that the film must be struggling either because of quality or because it is a hard sell – and it certainly seemed that the latter was most likely to be the reason for the sales push. The plot sees two young girls go missing on thanksgiving in a small rural town; a suspect is found and while the police try to figure it all out, the emotional impact on the two families starts to take its toll.This is a hard sell, even before we get to the meat of the story everything has a downbeat tone – even Thanksgiving seems a subdued affair with the grey skies and rain. From here it gets darker as the children go missing, the investigation starts and morality is testing in the actions of the characters. On this level it mostly works pretty well – mostly. The realistic tone to everything draws you into the story and it keeps you there as things start to get murky both in terms of the investigation but also the actions of the characters. This offered a much more interesting film than just a straight police procedural and for a lot of the time it does have real impact to it, but gradually it shies away from it – having its cake and eating it at the same time. This leaves the mystery which is also not as satisfyingly as I would have liked; it was solid enough but with the cast and the dark, adult tone to the film, I was hoping that the narrative would be brave enough to match it in many ways. It did a decent job, but it really did feel like it walked it back too much in too many ways. In terms of length it does run long and would have been better if the mystery hadn't included so many different branches within it.The cast justify the tone and everyone is excellent – to the point where I wished the material hadn't seemed to lose it in the final third. Whether this is a shot at Oscars I don't know but everyone is as strong as the castlist would suggest. Gyllenhaal has a straightforward character but makes a good presence from it; he has an intensity and presence that works for him and the film. Jackman does a great job with a changeable character – bravely ploughing into his actions with determination and as a result it is a shame for his performance that the film doesn't hold together as well as it should for the final third. Support is generally very strong as you would expect from Bello, Howard, Davis, Leo, Dano and others.Overall Prisoners is an engagingly dark and murky crime thriller. The mystery is flawed but still good, while the morality questions are well presented if not fully followed through. A shame for the strong performances that the film doesn't totally hold it together and deliver, but it is still worth watching for what it does well.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Over rated,"It has some essential ingredients for a good movie, such as some good performance by Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis, and a good cinematography, but awful script and bad directing. The movie is full packed with stupid gaping holes in the plot, which cannot be digested. The character of the detective is shallow despite the acceptable performance of Gyllenhaal. There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is, but in my opinion failed big time. Also,the film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along.Overall, it's disappointing, and I felt I was the prisoner for two and a half hour.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Best Thriller of The Last Decade,"This was the film that solidified Denis Villeneuve as a modern master of cinema. I will never forget when I first watched Prisoners. I was unequivocally enthralled and invested by the direction, cinematography (from the GOAT Roger Deakins), acting and layered writing. Hugh Jackman delivers not only his best performance, but one of the best of all time. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of his best as well. Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, David Datsmalchian, the list goes on. This film was cruelly disrespected by The Oscars in every aspect. The film is titled Prisoners not just because of the abduction of two children, but because many of the characters are trapped within the confines of their individual psychology's. Therefore, they are prisoners to their own internal maze's. If your trying to get into cinema, add Prisoners to the the top of your watchlist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"""The Depths of Desperation""","""Prisoners,"" directed by Denis Villeneuve, is a gripping psychological thriller that delves into the dark recesses of human desperation and morality. The film opens with a seemingly straightforward premise: the kidnapping of two young girls, which rapidly evolves into a tense narrative that explores the lengths a parent will go to in search of their child.Hugh Jackman delivers a powerful performance as Keller Dover, a father whose world crumbles when his daughter and her friend go missing. Jackman's portrayal captures a profound mix of anguish, fury, and moral ambiguity, leading the audience on a journey through his escalating desperation. Jake Gyllenhaal, as Detective Loki, provides a compelling counterpoint to Dover's character, embodying a quiet yet intense pursuit of justice. The dynamics between these two characters drive much of the film's tension, as their methods of dealing with the crisis diverge dramatically.Visually, ""Prisoners"" is hauntingly beautiful, with Roger Deakins' cinematography creating an ominous atmosphere that perfectly complements the story's themes. The film's pacing is deliberate, pulling viewers into a thick cloud of suspense that feels palpable throughout. Villeneuve expertly ramps up the tension, forcing audiences to grapple with their own moral judgments in a desperate situation.The film invites viewers to contemplate difficult questions regarding justice, vengeance, and the blurry line between right and wrong. As the narrative unfolds, not everything is as it seems, and the revelations keep you on the edge of your seat, engaging your mind long after the credits roll.""Prisoners"" is a thought-provoking thriller that skillfully combines emotional depth with tense storytelling. It's a haunting exploration of what one might be willing to sacrifice in the name of love and desperation, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Depressing but a masterpiece thriller,"This is a masterpiece thriller with good acting both from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. It's a good kidnapped story, however I must say that I'm quite depressed after watched this movie. Perhaps,it's too emotional and gripping. Around 20 minutes before the movie finished,I can guess the kidnapper and here you can expect a twist and clever ending. I am impressed with Hugh's acting since I only saw him as an action hero like in X-Men or Wolverine.I do hope to see him in more drama movies. If you want a simple thriller movie, then be brace because it can be too emotional for you.I also love Melissa Leo's and Paul Dano's acting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Impressive Acting,"The acting in this movie was incredible. Most characters in this movie had convincing acting. The story was simple but well delivered. It suffers a little bit by the end. By the final act, the possibilities in my head were running so wild that I was not sure what to expect anymore. There was one key plot which I did not quiet follow or connect to the rest of clues presented. There a couple powerful emotional moments in the movie which had me hook to the screen. There was only soundtrack only a few key moments to indicate some sort of importance happening on screen. Overall, it was a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Suspense from beginning to end,"If movies were rated according to the heartbeats per minute they caused, this one would get a top score. My heart started beating after the first fifteen minutes and kept on until the very end. That's how much suspense there is in this film. The film is very long (153 minutes), but never bores or slows down. In fact, I enjoyed every new plot twist because it would make the suspense last longer.If you like intelligent thrillers, you shouldn't miss this one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The story is quite complicated, but during the film it turns out every piece of the puzzle fits perfectly. In fact, some elements I only figured out after returning home.The start of the movie is very strong. Two happy families, visiting each other for Thanksgiving, enjoy a nice evening until they realize that the two young daughters are missing. Both couples react differently. After the police releases the only suspect because they can't find anything against him, one of the fathers decides to take matters into his own hands. His despair makes his sense of what's right and wrong disappear.Apart from the very good script, other strong points are the cinematography, showing cold, rainy forests in shades of grey, and the acting. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the lone, tough detective Loki, who is determined to solve the case against all odds. He works alone, doesn't have a family and never smiles. Even after the case is solved and he is visited in hospital by one of the mothers, he doesn't show any emotion at all.The film contains some graphic violence, and also has some rather creepy moments. This is not a nice, easy, polished film. It has some rough edges and a dark intensity. That's why I liked it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Imprisoned by hope,"You know from the first Roger Deakins-framed shot of this child abduction drama that you're watching quality. The craft is exquisite – and the thematic and emotional content is equal to it. This is a sophisticated film that consumes material outside the staple multiplex diet: frustration, ambivalence, forgiveness, grief, rage. Prisoners has its contrivances, and a few dubious character actions, but always at the service of telling a gripping story, and asking some challenging questions.The film opens with the Dover clan, headed by Keller (Hugh Jackman), visiting the Birch family for Thanksgiving dinner. Contentment and complacency abounds. The two youngest kids go outside and don't come back. The dawning horror of the parents, and the rapid escalation in panic, is horribly and heartbreakingly played out. Keller is convinced that the child-minded neighbour Alex (Paul Dano) is the culprit. So when lonesome Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal, practically reprising his role from Zodiac, except now with new End of Watch tattoos) can find no evidence, Keller takes matters – and Alex – into his own bloody hands.The rain. It hasn't poured so much in a detective thriller since Se7en – and the mood is similarly doom-drenched. There are elements of Silence of the Lambs as well, although Prisoners is a film of subtler autumn shades. It's not as stark and austere as Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but it strikes the same eerie mood, and likewise moves at a pleasingly slow pace.The performances are excellent. Gyllenhaal's wide eyes seem here to have had their naivety washed out by horror; Loki blinks hard like he's photographing all he sees. As for Keller, we first see him stalking prey. He's a predatory animal, an aggressive protector, and grief will translate into ferociousness. Jackman, a most likable screen presence, must work extra hard to fight off our sympathy. Then there are the wives. Maria Bello's Grace appears passive, but this is simply a reflection of her pragmatic husband's inability to connect with her emotionally. Nancy Birch (Viola Davis, typically intense) stays at her husband's side, gradually becoming dominant, fuelled by the agony of loss and the even worse agony of hope.There are some truly memorable moments in Prisoners. The scene in which Loki discovers child-sized boxes in the house of a suspect is pure Hitchcock brilliance. Later, his bloody-eyed race through busy traffic is probably the most thrilling car chase of the year – the stakes could not be higher. And the scene involving Keller, a bathroom, and a claw hammer is harrowing on multiple levels: the drama is in the intention.Prisoners is distressing without being repulsive; moving without being sentimental; thrilling without being exploitative. This is the standard to which all mainstream drama should aspire.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A great film fulfilled with intensity from start to finish,"This film deserves the praise it is earning and here's why. Firstly you have a very solid cast. Each character play out their roles with solid performances, solid enough to become emotionally attached and sharing some part of the pain they are feeling. The films tempo is also nicely applied, applied correctly so that throughout each scene, you become interested and curious as to what may happen. Much of the storytelling is done in a stripped back style, a muck more basic ground of storytelling but an elegance that makes it so fulfilling and worth much more than that. If ever you've played the game The Last of Us, then you''ll understand what I am trying to explain. Overall I highly praise this film for being such a great watch, but also the feelings I was given whilst watching this movie, such as; suspense, intimidation and the thoughts of each scene I still have after reaching the conclusion of this film. If ever you gain an opportunity to watch this film, I highly recommend you go and see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
great performance  in a very disturbing movie,"This is probably one of Hugh Jackman's best roles yet. However,in the real world wouldn't the FBI be involved from the beginning as they do in all kidnap cases? And, how could there be only one detective on the case? usually they always work in pairs and the detectives and the CSI's would have torn the suspects home and property apart from the beginning and ultimately found the car/well/ pit .The girls mother (Hugh Jackmans' wife) also made a marvelous recovery as soon as her daughter was found but her husband went missing.A great story but a little far fetched in the real world of law enforcement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Suspense Never Stops!,"Hugh Jackman is Keller Dover, a Christian father of two who enjoys hunting with his son. Dover and his family attend a Thanksgiving dinner over at their friend's house, Franklin and Nancy Birch, played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis. It is there that both family's six year old girls, Anna and Joy, go missing. Jake Gyllenhaal, as Detective Loki, is assigned to the case but is unable to put Dover at ease. This creates a conflict between the confident detective and the frantic father. It's not long before Alex Jones, played by Paul Dano, is arrested under suspicion for the girls disappearance but due to a lack of evidence, he is released. As Detective Loki continues on with the investigation, Dover, in desperation and out of fear for his daughter's life, decides to take matters into his own hands.Everyone involved in this production, including actress Maria Bello as Dover's wife, Grace, are at the top of their game. Hugh Jackman has never been better, surpassing his performance in The Fountain. Jake Gyllenhaal is no longer seen as Donnie Darko here. Detective Loki proves to be not only his most powerful performance but also the best character he has ever played. In fact, Detective Loki might be the best on-screen detective we've seen in well over a decade. All the amazing performances aside, everything about Prisoners is perfectly executed. Cinematography by the best director of photography working today, Roger Deakins. The haunting music, provided by the masterful Icelandic composer, Jóhann Jóhannsson, is used to maximum effect. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve has brought Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay to life without cutting any corners or wasting any expense.Prisoners is a painful character study within the most thrilling mystery put to the big screen since Hitchcock defined the genre. Villeneuve has perfectly balanced the ambiguity and ambition of a modern art-film with an entertaining Hollywood thriller. Even with a running time over two and a half hours, the suspense never stops. In fact, it will continue to linger long after the credits finish rolling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tense,"Prisoners features a pitch perfect cast with Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano, among others. Mostly every performance in the film was great but I loved especially Hugh Jackman, Gyllenhaal, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Jackman as the father of the missing girl is really believable and he delivers a performance that is truly Oscar worthy. My favorite scene with Jackman is when he meets Gyllenhaal for the first time in his house, you can really tell he is committed to the character but pretty much every scene he's in is great. Gyllenhaal as the detective investigating the case is great and he just continues to prove to me why he's one of my favorite actors. He's so versatile and can play a very wide range of roles. Melissa Leo plays the aunt of Paul Dano who plays a very troubled young man who is treated as a suspect in the film. Both of them are great and Paul Dano delivers a pretty odd and kind of disturbing performance.Prisoners is the kind of movie you think is going a certain way and it mostly does but it shakes it and twists it along the way enough to keep you guessing. From the opening shot you feel the tension of the film that endures until the movie is over. This is mostly thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the smart direction of Villeneuve. He knows exactly where to put the camera in exactly what situation, especially given the talent he had on this production. So prisoners is pretty much an excellent movie, the tone of the movie is defined very early, there is a clear structure and everything is executed beautifully. Everything that happened advanced the plot or developed the characters. It reminded me of a David Fincher film. This is a very different film than Enemy, which was also directed by Villeneuve but they're both amazing films and this is definitely worth a watch.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Two young girls go missing in a small, rural US town. The parents (Hugh Jackman & Maria Bello and Terrence Howard & Viola Davis) are distraught, but Jackman's desperation with key suspect Paul Dano (and his mum Melissa Leo) goes too far (or does it?) while frustrated cop Jake Gyllenhaal follows various leads.

The world as prison,"This seemed at first like it would prejudge sin and redemption, pitting a father's virulent worldview of a fallen world that you have to prepare against and be ready to kill to protect loved ones against a senseless evil that seems to justify it. So I was surprised to find more.It's anchored, on one end in the thriller with clear mechanics that goes back to Fritz Lang, the modern intuitions about space on the other. Jackman and the other actors inhabit the first, Deakins finds his room in the second. In one mode evil is concrete, in the other elusive. Seven was in the first, Zodiac more in the second, the film traverses both. Here we start with the disappearance of two girls and gradually acquire a story. Two men are struggling to, father and cop, one goes on faith the other reason. One and then a second culprit appear, somehow connected.The whole idea, eerily effective, is that we build loci of observation, that we have enough observation at any time only to justify a faith about what we convince ourselves to be true, either of the boys being guilty, so in being yanked from one to the other and back that faith is shaken and shakes our grounds of truth and humanity. Innocents suffer as a result. Meanwhile evil is something so banal and in plain sight, the more horrifying suggestion, also seen in the location of the makeshift prison(s).The thriller worked for me more than most in recent memory, but the most striking moments were in the second mode, the visual and elusive. As the girl's memory comes to her in the hospital bed, we have three or four shots that communicate that whole range, each of them expertly timed, each blurry in some way. And the manic driving to save the girl in time, here we have her soul between worlds, his rush to redemption, visually transcendent in the night traffic of this world.Overall it paints a tormented picture; evil, originally a shattered faith as we find, exists out there, we come close to knowing, the father, the cop, the kid who sketches mazes, but something eludes us in the way things are made, which can be as simple as the father not being able to make himself believed about what he heard in the parking lot, and as complicated as what he heard not being what he thinks.So I'm not in line with the glum worldview, I am somewhat with the latter, the difficulties of faith and clarity, tied to watching.It's a Christian vision to be sure, the world as prison, faith inescapably woven with sin. Interestingly, that pessimism emerges in the Christian mind as you move away from the early days and the ""father's"" coming is delayed. I followed the other day a link to an article about Christian leaders professing the religious significance of Aronofosky's upcoming Noah, how it makes the old story vibrantly relevant for a modern audience. I'd like to see them confront this, which really demands confrontation.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Americanism Through Foreign Eyes,"Writing about James Fennimore Cooper, D.H. Lawrence said, ""the essential American soul is hard, stoic, isolate and a killer. It has never yet melted."" Prisoners is a Canadian director's meditation on this passage.Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans opened with Hawkeye shooting a deer and then praying over the dead animal. Prisoners opens with Keller Dover (Jackman) saying the Lord's Prayer as his teenaged son sights in and shoots the deer that will be Thanksgiving dinner. The parallel is no accident. Dover thinks of himself as the Deerslayer. He's a self-employed, self-reliant workman with a basement full of canned goods and ammunition stored against the breakdown of society, which he expects at any time. He's a survivalist and a handloader. He lives in a nondescript former industrial town somewhere in the part of Pennsylvania that James Carville described as Alabama. His suburban house is the smallest in the neighborhood, with the siding stained dark brown, looking like a log cabin. His only vehicle is the pickup truck from his contracting business. He seems to have come down in the world from his late father, whom he revered, and he's just barely keeping up with the mortgage. Though not a political word is spoken, he's prime Tea Party material. His belief in himself and his disdain for institutions are going to be tested to the extreme when his five year old daughter and her neighborhood playmate disappear, victims of an apparent abduction, on Thanksgiving afternoon.This is a foreigner's take on the United States. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is a French-Canadian whose last movie, 2010s Incindies, was a perceptive look at the Lebanon civil war of the 70s and 80s. Villeneuve is looking at a society whose individualism, distrust of authority, and general availability of firearms are very different from Canada, and he does not take those things for granted in the same way an American director would. Prisoners makes an interesting companion to this summer's Still Mine, a Canadian story about an old fashioned self-employed individualist who falls foul of local authority in rural New Brunswick. I've long thought that the Canadians are King George's dutiful children while Americans are his rebellious ones, and the two pictures set off the contrast nicely. This is an anthropological look by a Canadian at what a very American man like Keller Dover might do when his child is kidnapped.Villeneuve uses one of the more annoying tropes in American movies to humanize Dover – the Validating Black Guy. Cousin to the Magic Negro, who puts the white protagonist in touch with deeper values, the VBG's function is simpler – to show that this white man, regardless of his other faults, is actually all right because he likes black people and they like him. Dover's neighbor, friend and one-time high school buddy Franklin Birch (Howard) and wife Nancy (Davis) are cast as black because otherwise Keller Dover would come across as a complete redneck.But the essence of the Birches is class, not race. They live in a nicer house and are much more securely in the middle class than the Dovers. Nancy's a veterinarian and Franklin looks like he has some kind of office job. Their function is to react as decent, normal middle class folks would when their daughter is abducted and when Dover goes off the rails looking for the kidnapper. The parallel with our reactions to 9/11 is pretty obvious, but that's not where the movie ultimately goes.The spousal relations break pretty clearly along class and historical lines. Nancy and Franklin Birch are a contemporary married couple of the upper middle class. They pull each other through. He confides in her, she's probably the stronger of the pair, and her moral judgments are the last word between them. The Dovers are almost 19th century. Grace Dover (an under-used Maria Bello) is passive; a pure housewife who looks to Keller as her protector and hero. She breaks completely under the strain, spending all of her time in bed under sedation. Her husband is content to have it so, keeping his activities secret and warning his son not to let his mother know what is going on.Dover's opposite number and antagonist is Detective Loki, the star of this small town police force, and apparently the only detective on the case. (I find this improbable. For a crime like the abduction of two five year old girls, a one horse police department would get overwhelming support from State Police detectives). Loki is zealous, smart, though not as smart as he thinks, and willing to fall back on shouting and violence when nothing else seems to work. He's cracked every case he ever worked on, and he expects to crack this one. He's also got the official mindset that regards Keller Dover's insistent involvement as a clear nuisance if not something worse. But he's got far more energy and drive than his police chief, a mediocre man who has learned to rationalize mediocrity with philosophical resignation.The plot is full of trap doors and red herrings, and you have to pay very close attention to the dialog to pick up what you need to know. Even if you do, I think that one key element is left unexplained. You will be completely involved in what comes next for two and one-half hours, and there will be a lot to chew on when it's over. Definitely worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Gripping till the end,"Prisoners is a terrific film. I found everything to be outstanding. The acting, direction, cinematography and writing were all so well done.Prisoners gives us an insight on how far someone would go to save their child. It also shows us how a tragedy like child abduction can affect the people involved. This film captures all these moments in such a realistic manner which is what makes the film all the more interesting.The screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski is truly brilliant. Guzikowski clearly understood the genre and added some great twists, turns and situations to keep the viewer gripped till the end. Denis Villeneuve's direction is perfect. Villeneuve understands which type of shots to use where, adding to the intensity of the movie.The performances all around were amazing. Hugh Jackman gives one of his best whilst Jake Gyllenhaal knocks it out of the park. Both add many layers and depth to their characters through their emotions, complimenting the script by maintaining the realistic approach it was going for. In no way did I feel their characters were unconvincing. They kept it fully grounded to match the tone of the film. Everyone else also played their roles perfectly. Even the children seemed real to me by some of the actions they do in the film.The final hero of the film is Roger Deakins who deserves every amount of praise for the cinematography. The movie looks stunning by his choices of colour and weather which enhances the drama and conversations taking place.Honestly, Prisoners is one of the best mystery thrillers made.

On the other hand, I found the casting of Paul Dano and David Dastmalchian a bit too on the nose. They fit their roles well, but it felt almost too obvious.

Winner: Worst Police Work on Film,"Spoilers ahead. Not that it matters.Oh my, what a waste of top talent and resources. This could have been a taut, effective, thoughtful little thriller, but the ridiculous plot holes and logical inconsistencies doom it (along with its unnecessary length). The Hugh Jackman character is such a glaring box-checking conceit that it diminishes any complexity I'm pretty sure we're MEANT to appreciate about him. Religious? Check. Hard-working common man? Check. Struggling in these dire economic times? Check. Adorable, loving family? Check. Tragic family event in past that molded his character? Check. Ironic plot development? Check. (The doomsday prepper gets burned; but wait, that whistle did come in handy, as we knew it would.) OK, let's stop there. I'm not saying the plight of the parents was not moving. Who is not moved by children in jeopardy, parents in misery? It's difficult to not see plots like this in terms of the basest exploitation. But it takes a sure and subtle hand to make it work, and that was obviously missing here. Many have compared it to Mystic River, which is apt, though that was a far finer film, and more believable as a police procedural. I imagine the screenwriter and director wanted us to take a hard look at what might happen when a good man goes bad for all the right reasons, but the lengths he goes to in torturing the Paul Dano character just don't make sense. Yes, maybe that's the point: Keller is beyond ""sense."" OK, but when the two other parents acquiesce to the torture (albeit somewhat reluctantly, but still), I wanted to throw something at the screen.While I'm still on ""character,"" Jake Gyllenhaal's detective is an absolute cipher. Maybe this was a decision NOT to give him a backstory of any kind because that would be lame. Fine. But in place of that we get a bad haircut, shirt-buttoned-all-the-way-but-no-tie look, some twitchy blinking, and not much else. I was rooting for him mostly because he wasn't actively torturing anyone.Other complaints:*One detective seems to be assigned to this very explosive case. Other than combing the fields for bodies, no one else seems involved in the ""investigation."" OK, this was probably a decision so the focus would be on Loki (his name,really?) and not on some partner chitchat, and at a 2 hr., 33 min. runtime, I should shut up about it, but it so goes against any police reality, that I couldn't forgive it.*Gyllenhaal makes a decision pretty early that the Paul Dano character is innocent, and so he is released - without surveillance and without police protection, even though Jackman's character has already attacked him. Yes, I know, some perfunctory BS scene with Gyllenhaal's superior was included to explain why there was no surveillance, but that also was stupid. He was their only real suspect. And a search of his aunt's property didn't reveal . . . drugs, syringes, handguns, sedated girls? Nobody looked into the history of this little ""farmily""? The aunt is taken at her word about everything. Oh wait . . . she had to be, or Hugh Jackman could not have kidnapped Paul Dano and we wouldn't have a movie.*The priest has a dead body in the basement. Obviously, he takes his vow about confessions more seriously than the commandment about murder. Oh, and that dead body turns out to be . . . Well, you know if you saw it.*The abandoned apartment where Dano is held is never searched (convenient new suspect emerges at critical juncture, too busy to send someone else over there to do a thorough search).*Red herring to end all red herrings: deranged young man with mazes, snakes, pig blood, buried mannequins, stolen children's clothing.*Just in general: too much crazy in too limited a geographical space (see Priest, Snake Boy, Crazy Aunt).*One child escapes . . . while heavily sedated? Crazy aunt nonetheless stays put, does not kill remaining child immediately. Why she was keeping them alive in the first place is not convincingly explained.*ONE person deciding that a dead child means warring with God and creating ""demons"" by abducting and killing other people's children is a just response to personal tragedy is far-fetched (not impossible, certainly), but TWO! Good times. Of course, the Man suffers a crisis of conscience apparently and confesses to the wrong priest. The Woman (female of the species and all that) has to keep muddling along, killing when she gets a chance. Times are tough (the recession applies to child abduction too).*The maze symbol is both too obvious (morally) and too opaque. Dead guy in basement wearing one, crazy crime re-enactor draws them, imprisoned Dano whispers it? Connection unclear.I wish I had that whistle at the end, so someone would have come and saved me from this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Phenomenal,"Prisoners is a cold and visceral experience, and it draws your attention towards every important detail more and more as the story progresses... leaving you out of breath and shocked by the end. The bone-chilling suspense which intensifies by the minute, is handled masterfully... knowing exactly when and when not to show certain things. The performances were incredibly powerful and emotionally rich, and every character had a motive for what drove them to resolve the pain and grief they were going through... caused by a terrifying situation. Hugh Jackman plays one of the fathers whose child was kidnapped in broad daylight, Jake Gyllenhaal plays the detective, and when the two characters interact/clash... it is very unnerving and highly intense. As the film progresses, the sense of dread that the characters are feeling is projected on the audience in the most subtle of ways... you feel the uncertainty, pain, and confusion that the characters have to bare in order to continue solving the crime. Prisoners presented sophisticated cinematography, a riveting screenplay, flawless storytelling, and authentic character development while also being a thrilling, engaging, and somber crime film... which balances every aspect of filmmaking with ease and professionalism. This movie was a journey into the lives of these characters... whose lives were devastated in the blink of an eye, leaving them and the audience hopeless and unsure. The final act was jaw-dropping and went to such an extent to accomplish cinematic perfection, leading to a powerful/twisted/mind-boggling final shot... chilling me to the bone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Jackman and Gyllenhaal shines in Villeneuve's captivating thriller,"Prisoners is a thriller movie directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Hugh Jackman, Jack Gyllenhaal, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano.After seeing the movie I am convinced that this is probably one of the finest performance by Jackman and Gyllenhaal.The movie starts on a normal pitch and i thought that this is another ordinary abduction movie but was mistaken as soon as the movie progresses. The movie is intense and captivating and will keep you on the edge of your seat.The screenplay is crisp and direction is incredible. The cinematography was great and needs special mention.

I'm surprised Roger Deakin didn't win for the amazing cinematography at least he did years later for Blade Runner 2049 from the same director too which is cool!

Emotionally Raw,"Prisoners is the kind of movie that has little to no action, but is more of a watch to see details and listen closely dialogue. It starts out joyful and happy, almost immediately it is filmed (and acted) so that it is incredibly realistic and relatable. Things change drastically when the two little girls just vanish into thin air. Now, I won't give away spoilers because I don't want to ruin this movie for anybody but let me tell you this, it is incredibly wrong and at times a little slow but it holds true to the realism of these kind of events. You bite your nails wondering where the children are and you begin to doubt if Hugh Jackman is doing the right thing by abducting (and torturing) a boy who he thinks took the girls. Each parent is shown as they spiral downward from fear, anger and loss. Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance as Detective Loki, his bad ass attitude slowly chipping away into desperation. The movie may not be the best out there but emotionally, it makes you question how far you would go to find the person you love and just how hard will you cling to the belief that you are right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Could easily fit into 90 minutes,"I usually agree with IMDb's ratings but unfortunately not this time, This movie was mediocre at best and really nothing we haven't seen before, A lot of Clichés and suspense tricks we've already seen in other movies of this type, I could not really relate to the characters and felt that the dialogs were corny and that I have already seen them on other movies. I could have given it a 7 but it was way way way too long, Could have easily fit into 90 minutes instead of 153 !!! To tell the truth I fast forwarded at least 30 minutes of the movie because I just got bored. The acting and plot were believable for the first hour but after that it got too much for me to even care, This is really NOT the masterpiece everybody here are talking about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
That's how a movie is done.,"Denis Villeneuve is no doubt one of the very few directors that has a vision and a complete look at the story before he directs it. He brought the picture so intelligently with a lot of references and small details. Like any other big director he gave clues to and used it in important scenes. The movie has that way of storytelling that depends on lot's of camera angles and telling style that makes you in complete vision of it's details. The music of the movie was good but didn't give the scenes the intense or strengthen it. The acting was excellent by Hugh Jackman who performed the character of the father so well and was a very challenging role that he succeeded in it and by Jake Gyllenhaal who gave a solid performance as the police cop and the rest did a great job. The movie's problem is that it focused more on showing the suffering of the family and especially the father and on the cup trying to understand what's wrong with him doing some silly actions especially when he went to ask Alex in his home as If he would tell him!. The characters of his friend wasn't good and didn't add to the movie neither did his wife. The ending was acceptable though it not very good one but for the last scene of course with the hint of the small detail of his daughter. Overall, very violent , heart moving and has a lot of mystery in it. Don't miss a chance watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
worth watching!,"This is a really good example of its genre and is a rewarding watch. The performances really make this film, especially Maria Bello and Terrence Howard in their supporting roles. It's two and a half hours long, but doesn't feel like it's dragging on. It's not especially smart but there's enough suspense and grim mystery to keep your attention. I thought it picked up nicely during the vigil scene and kept my attention from then on. I liked Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Loki, and thought the eye tick and neck tattoo underscored the dysfunctional motif. There were a few clues along the way that make sense once the film reaches it's conclusion, which I guess is fun if you like figuring things out. It's a good movie and the actors did a good job, but it's not one I would watch again soon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Such a captivating movie experience,"Prisoners directed by Denis Villeneuve is a crime thriller surrounding two families' search for their abducted daughters. First and foremost the cinematography by Roger Deakins is flawless. It perfectly sets the tone for the film. Particularly the shots which utilise the weather to create stunning effects with lighting and shadows. This is a a long film. The runtime is around 2hrs and 30mins. Although the pacing is perfect. As soon as the film begins, each scene builds and builds with more intensity. Prisoners kept me 100% hooked with intense suspense throughout the entire investigation. Furthermore, the performances are all incredible. Hugh Jackman's character contains such powerful emotion, and he delivers it perfectly. Paul Dano also does such a great job with a highly difficult performance. Each actor disappeared in their roles. Particularly Jake Gyllenhaal. The way in which he progressed and grew emotionally, made him so compelling. The score by Johann Johannsson creates feelings of melancholy, sorrow and intensity, during times of horror. Denis' direction accompanied by the incredible screenplay has created such a captivating movie experience. I highly recommend seeing this film. It is one of my favourites of all time, so therefore I give Prisoners a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Breathtaking,"This movie comes back to the old thriller classics that we've known during our childhood.It pictures the worst nightmare for a loving father : the disappearing of his daughter, if you're a father or a mother, this film will particularly move you.Hugh Jackman is however a bit disappointing, as the character suits him perfectly, but he tends to be a bit off for some reason. It doesn't take away anything from this suspense masterpiece though.Jake Gyllenhaal on the other hand is irreproachable and we regret that he doesn't have more screentime.The film's atmosphere is cold and dark, which suits the well-written script, it's not very complex but works seamlessly and will have you holding your breath until the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Forgive Us Our Trespasses,"Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are absolutely powerful in Director Denis Villeneuve's dark and mesmerizing ""Prisoners"". ""Prisoners"" has the look and resonance of Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"". This haunting morality play is one of best movies of the year. Jackman gives perhaps his best and most unexpected performance. Jackman's sheer ferocity in the tipping point of human conscience is amazing to behold. His bold vulnerability clutches our very soul. This is equally surprising given his signature as the Wolverine. I literally cringed as he threatens terrified Paul Dano as Alex with a steel hammer. In stark contrast there is a quiet scene as tears stream down his cheek as he stares at police photos.Gyllenhaal as Jackman's antagonist foil is an undeniable force. Much like Kevin Bacon in ""Mystic River"" Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki struggles between duty and the visceral justice. Villeneuve and Writer Guzikowski curiously never spell out Loki's physical glitches neither the gang banger tattoos. Have to admire them for respecting audience intelligence. Gyllenhaal's immersion is breathtaking whether he is comforting Viola Davis's Nancy about her missing daughter or smashing the head of suspect on a table. His screen partnership with Jackman is awesome, we witness amazing actors at the zenith of their prowess. Villeneuve is brilliant in restraining and balancing such intense performances without sacrificing purpose.We first hear Jackman's voice as Keller Dover reciting The Lord's Prayer on a deer hunting trip with his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette, who is going to surprise many). Keller is a struggling carpenter, and closet survivalist. He is a family man and man of faith. Aaron Guzikowski's story's deceptive power lies in the normalcy of a Pennsylvania suburb. He foreshadows the tragic forfeit as the ends overcome the means. Roger Deakins's (""True Grit"") cinematography is a profound character onto itself bestowing pristine clarity in this conflict of dark and gray.The Dovers' spend Thanksgiving with Frank and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). The terrifying realization sets in that their youngest daughters Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) are missing. After frantic search in the rain, Police are called. A creepy suspect Alex Jones (brilliantly unnerving Paul Dano) emerges as the possible kidnapper. Alex also has the mind of a 10 year old.Alex is released without any solid evidence. However, Keller is convinced from an admission by Alex, that he knows where his daughter Anna is. He takes matters into his own, and imprisons Alex and tortures him until he tells him what he wants. Howard's Franklin is mortified by Keller's actions. Keller says, ""Someone had to make him talk, or they're going to die!"" Viola Davis as Nancy is rock solid in shocking advocacy. Mario Bello as Keller's wife Grace is sympathetic grace as a mother suffering the unthinkable. Melissa Leo is amazing as Holly Jones, Alex's Aunt and guardian. Her ordinary persona belies tragedy.All is not what seems. Keller and Loki have the same purpose in divergent paths, and make costly sacrifices. Villeneuve reminds that sometimes the world is ugly, and in resolution our souls are in the balance. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are awesome. The cast is amazing. ""Prisoner"" is not a pleasant movie to watch--not at all. ""Prisoners"" has profound power.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Pray for the best, prepare for the worst...","Thank god the prayer came true,This movie truly captures how devastating having your children abducted can be. It portrays the atmosphere perfectly, the desperation and despair.Jake Gyllenhaal performs as well, if not better than he did in Zodiac. Hugh Jackman gives one of the best performances of his career, an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion.I have always thought Hugh Jackman didn't know how to play anything well except for Wolverine. However this movie in combination with Les Mesirables has changed my mind.This movie is definitely one of the best of 2013. It stands up there with Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River as one of the best movies about child kidnapping there is to date. It grips you throughout with an atmosphere of suspense and mystery. Showing how the kidnapping effects the families and the detective associated with the case. A definite must watch for anyone who appreciates an excellent thriller or drama film.A 9/10 for me and it earns a spot on my favorite thrillers list.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
truly a great thriller; gut-wrenching movie,"Prisoners is a thriller which achieves a rare level of intensity and resonance thanks to the director's ability to invest the story with authenticity, emotion and originality. Compared with, say, 'The Silence of the Lambs' this slow-paced (a compliment, as the usual hyperactive pacing of Hollywood is almost a sickness) bleak mainstream film is hands down a better movie, making Demme's seem trivial, in hindsight. What I loved about Prisoners is the way that it was all about the story and the characters; the visual style was invisible and never imposed itself on the viewer. It was wonderfully directed in a manner that recalled classics by Nicolas Ray(They Live By Night), William Wyler(Desperate Hours), Billy Wilder(Double Indemnity) or John Ford (The Searchers). You could just walk into this terrifying film and feel the emotions portrayed flawlessly by the cast. The best example being perhaps Maria Bello who is my choice for best supporting actress this year with special mention going to Gyllenhaal whose idiosyncratic performance is at the heart of this film; his effortless charisma and skill place him among the very best, he is also a natural audience favorite capable of earning a very high level of empathy for his work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Creepy, well crafted and acted, solid drama","Interesting movie, full of dread and plays with the question of who the prisoners really are. Everyone is pretty good in this. Wolverine bares some claws but really doesn't channel Wolverine, we get to see some more range. Terence Howard was underutilized in a key and understated role that was very well done I thought. The main detective character was the most charismatic but the other characters seemed more real.There are other similar movies that deal with different elements of this one, such as The Vanishing and The Orphan, neither of which I want to see again though they were very well done. As a parent the idea of a child being abducted with no trace is of course very disturbing and the film makers obviously play that up a bit. Lots of crying and various people coping or failing to cope in various ways.The scenery is bleak, rainy Midwest or Canada, we get a sense of the cold and grime in these middle class people. The overwhelming flavor of this movie outside of the main plot is the essence of abuse and mental illness. We get lots of doses of that.As far as this type of genre goes, this one is more hopeful than many, there is little to no gore (one dead body that's been dead for awhile). The movie doesn't work in sharp pokes but one long slow dread buildup and it's pretty good at that.There is lots of character study here but over all I'd say it's more plot driven than character driven. The ending which I won't spoil seems to make some people think there is ambiguity but I didn't see it that way, seemed pretty clear what was going on at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Strong characters and deep, twisted emotions","I was amazed by this movie. Characters are powerful and emotional. My favourite is Gylenghall because I never saw him in such a way - nervous but calm, devoted to his job. Of course it seems that he doesn't have any personal life, and I think it is a little minus. Like I didn't believe some of Hugh Jackman character's actions at the end of the movie. Tha'ts why I give it 9 stars. The strongest part of the movie, why I will remember it - it's story. So twisted, puzzled and provoking emotions (anger, pity, sadness...). Although this movie falls into simple category of ""dissapeared children movies"", it is one of the best! The story ant acting makes it so.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Holy hell,"Where do I begin with this one.Since Enemy, Denis Villnuve has proven time and time again that any film with his name attached is a film worth seeing. Sharp dialogue, slow but engaging pace, and beautiful cinematography courtesy of longtime collaborator Roger Deacons all mix to form excellent and unique moviegoing experiences from every single one of his movies. Prisoners is no exception. 
While I may have had the misfortune of having to watch this movie over the course of two nights, this movie was still one of the most engaging and haunting films I've seen.Everyone involved with this movie brought fourth their A-game, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman, both of whom delivered phenomenal and when needed, explosive performances. The supporting cast does an excellent job as well, especially Viola Davis and Paul Dano. 
The acting is not the only noteworthy part of Prisoners, as Deacon's unique style of camerawork lends itself masterfully to the bleak and hopeless tone, and keeps viewers engaged and attentive towards subtle details in every scene.

One Of The Most Viscerally Intense Films Ever Made,"After viewing ""Prisoners"" opening night in the theater, I turned to my companions during the closing credits and said ""I feel like I've just been through a ten round prize fight"". It had been a long time since I'd seen a movie that battered my emotions quite as much as this one. Seven years later, upon a recent re-watch, my emotions are about the same. This is about as viscerally intense of a film as one will ever watch.For a very basic overview, ""Prisoners"" opens on a typical Thanksgiving day in what just might be your (the viewers') neighborhood. Instead of the normal revelry and family cheer, however, the daughters of Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) are kidnapped. When detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds a very strange suspect (Paul Dano), it jump-starts the case in a terrifying direction that goes further into the realm of gritty reality than most films will show.I consider ""Prisoners"" to be one of the best films I've ever seen (I don't even want to put a genre to it, as that would be such a disservice to its breadth) because it is so perfect on both the plot and character levels.Plot-wise, it is a simple kidnapping story (one that has been utilized numerous times in cinema), yet director Dennis Villeneuve pushes its boundaries to the very max. Just when you think you have the film pinned down, it manages to surprise you and go in another direction. Yet, everything makes logical sense and feels ""real"" at the same time.That being said, the kidnapping plot itself (while brilliant) is not even the primary focus of the film. Instead, it is the characters reactions to the events, making viewers ponder how we would react in similar situations. The main focus here is on Dover and Loki, but each character adds a very specifically nuanced emotion to the overall mix. The result is drama the likes of which is rarely seen (and sustained for nearly two and a half hours) on the big screen.Themes-wise, comparisons can be drawn to the ethics of torture (especially prevalent in a post-Iraq War world) and almost a Dirty Harry-esque turn of one man taking justice into his own hands when ""the system"" seems to be failing him.Overall, ""Prisoners"" is a film that will stay with you long after each viewing. It's characters are so perfect and its themes so precise in their exploration that it's almost a little spooky how genuinely it can connect with reality. In terms of films that portray a stark, as-close-to-reality scenario as possible, this has to be at or near the top of that list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Thriller that will well and truly keep you thrilled,"Narrative that follows the 'whodunnit' approach often relies on the climactic twist. Herein lies the craftsmanship of the filmmaker to keep you on the edge even if there is nothing but a simple conversation is going on the screen. You can feel the Hitchcockian bomb is there somewhere. David Fincher showed us how to hold the suspense throughout the film in his early works. Dennis Villeneuve here pretty much did a similarly splendid job.Two families see their worlds go upside down, when their two very young daughters go missing, presumably abducted. When the adept detective has to let the primary suspect go, due to lack of evidences, the father of one child takes it to himself to find the daughters. Sounds familiar? Yes, the premise is quite similar to that of a Mystic River or a Zodiac.But, the defining feature of this film would be that, every now and then it justifies its title and asks you question about who the real prisoner is. For it is us who put ourselves in the most impregnable prisons. As we see the father, Keller (Hugh Jackman) shredding his values one by one; the obsession, the pain are felt by the audience.Like mentioned earlier, it is one thing to build a premise that promises suspense; and, I am going a bit Jerry Seinfeld way here, it is a different thing altogether to 'hold' the suspense throughout the film. Credit goes to Aaron Guzikowski for the always-engaging and compelling script. Villeneuve hardly mismatches the pace of the story or loses the grip in the screenplay. Some might disagree, but I think the plot is divided in two sub-plots. One that follows the premise where the detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, relentlessly pursues the kidnapper. The other is where Keller is the protagonist; that always makes us wonder how far people can go for the love of family.When you get a cast like the one this film has, you get the chance to explore various ranges of emotion and actually get to build characters, which is not very regular in typical thriller films. The support cast was stellar with the likes of Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davies, the astonishingly refrained Melissa Leo and Paul Dano, who not surprisingly revels in his almost-silent, reserved character. Each one of them showing their acting prowess in turns. But, it is the leads that will sweep off your feet with their performances. Both Jackman and Gyllenhaal give knock-out performances as theirs were the more layered characters in the film.The final punch of the film comes from Johann Johannsson's haunting compositions and Roger Deakins' masterful work. Just sets up the grim mood of the film. Deakins' craftsmanship's best moment would be at the end, where he creates magic on screen with the city lights.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The movie raises an answers a lot of questions... Not All!,"*For everybody that disliked the movie: Watch the movie again, and closely, you probably won't, but seriously, say every plot hole I read about in the negative reviews, are explained in the movie. And NO the movie doesn't automatically stir you in the right direction. It shows things that look important, but aren't. The police mainly looks at unimportant stuff and it makes it so frustrating!To start: normally a movie explains the story, this movie doesn't, the camera is 'just' an eye, watching a story developing in front of it. In combination with the brilliant acting, a master class Stanislavski, it gets a tremendous realistic feel. Just this will bother you later on in the movie, because maybe you don't like what you see. It places you in amoral situations, but the movie doesn't judge what you see (the camera is just an eye, watching). The movie plays with the audience, so if you are the average movie watcher and you like movies straight forward, maybe this isn't the one for you.It doesn't want to explain everything, and I believe that's good. PLZ!!! Stop with the movies that go and explain minor plots, like we don't have any brain that understand and figure out. Start with: USE YOUR IMAGINATION! (sorry). There are some movies that do a very good job in leaving the audience with a 'what the f?'example: Inception. Does the whirl fall???? they don't show, so maybe instead of talking about the little twitch it made in the end, the movie suggests that you have to search somewhere else. CGI everywhere just to keep your eyes from seeing that small detail that explains EVERYTHING, just for the close watcher. LOVELY.This movie overloads you with false clues, raises so many questions, that you miss the important details. And if you follow closely, you'll figure it out before the big: SO THAT'S THE ONE!8.6, so a 9 starsPs. the movie breaks many cliché's. While (real)life is filled with cliché's. So how people say that this movies (with it's scary realistic vibe) was filled with the same old, I can't understand. If it wasn't it would be a more fantastic movie, which wouldn't make it much better, definitely not as realistic.

Denis Villeneuve masterfully weaves a haunting atmosphere and it had me on the edge of my seat the entire run time. It creates a complex puzzle of a plot that is just impressive to behold. It unravels slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity.

This film is a rare, gut- wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece that will be one of the most underrated of all time.

A family's worst nightmare brought very much to life,"This suspenseful chilling tale is two and half hours long, yet doesn't drag a bit.It's Thanksgiving day and the working class Dover family is walking to the house of their neighbors and friends, the more prosperous Birches, to have dinner together. Their oldest kids are about the same age, and so after dinner the teens go downstairs to the den to watch football. The two girls, who are pretty young, about seven, are off playing. The adults are in the living room talking when it is realized that they haven't seen the girls for awhile. They seem to have disappeared and are nowhere to be found.The police are called. The search is on, but the only solid clue the families can give is that there had been a broken-down RV parked in front of a nearby home that the girls had been playing near, and now it's gone. The RV is discovered in the parking lot of a convenience store. When the police approach, the driver tries to escape but just panic drives into a tree. The guy, Alex Jones (Paul Dano) has the intellect of about a ten-year-old though he seems to be about 30. Talking to him is like talking to a wall. He says nothing important, supposedly because of his very low IQ. He's given a lie detector test, but it is useless since you need to be able to understand the questions for the results to be meaningful. Crime scene analysis finds nothing in the RV that can be traced to the missing girls - prints, hair, DNA - nothing. But why did he run?In the meantime, the two families cope with their loss. In the Dover family, the parents fall apart. The mother just takes to her bed and the pills she was given to make her sleep, but her husband, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), is just sure that Alex Jones is the kidnapper. When the police let him go for lack of evidence, Dover kidnaps him, puts him in an old, abandoned building he knows about and proceeds to try and beat a confession out of him. He gets nothing. He starts out just repeatedly hitting him with his fist, but in the end he has actually constructed a torture chamber of sorts in the bathroom, and yet the guy says nothing.So you have two main stories going on here - One is Jackman's Keller Dover turning into a monster as bad as anybody who could have taken his daughter. The other story is a police procedural with detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) running down the few clues he has trying to solve the mystery.I watched this because Gyllenhaal was in it, and he was terrific, but it was Jackman who delivered a career defining performance. Meanwhile, Dano plays a creepy, sniveling man-child brilliantly. I was getting frustrated with his character from my living room couch. Villeneuve's direction is a wonder, with his camera work bringing a moody, human story to life. An already incredible movie is made even better by Jóhann Jóhannsson's masterful score.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

What I was expecting to see was a film that would keep me at the edge of my seat, which it literally did, a film that would have me guessing all the way through, which I tried really hard not to do but did anyway, and finally a film that -as a friend had told me- would have a predictable ""twist"", which it sort of did. This is a very good action/thriller/drama kind of film that really manages to capture you from the very beginning and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout. It's not that we have not seen stuff like this before; kidnapping movies tend to be ubiquitous, but there is something about this one that stands out. Jackman gives an outstanding performance, easily said about the rest of the cast as well. I highly recommend this film for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A great collaboration between Marvel and DC,"Wolverine's, War Machine and Amanda Waller's daughters go missing. Mysterio, a cop, who goes by the name of Loki, helps investigate the disappearance of the missing girls. This leads him to the Riddler, a suspect who was last seen near the residence of the missing girls.Tension rises with each passing day, with no real leads or sign of the missing girls. Things heat up even more when Polkadot Man emerges.A movie where the intensity of Wolverine, the connections of War Machine, Amanda Waller's cunning, Mysterio's illusions, The Riddler's madness and Polkadot Man's quirks are not the answers for everything.Overall, a good crime thriller that grips you from the start.

What if ...,"I will watch anything with Denis Villeneuve's name on it. Sometimes there is greatness, sometimes not quite, always there is intellectual provocation and gorgeous visuals. I was deeply moved by and involved with this film, but was left thinking what if ... What if instead of a too long film, it had been made into a slightly longer miniseries, say six hours broken into episodes each with their own arc. I think it might have been more successful. This dragged in parts because the mini arcs within the larger story narrative were too compressed. So, could have been better.

The 2 mothers are ciphers, with no characters, letting the Men do the work! Come on this is 2013! Great cop who's solved every case- yeh, right!- who misses every clue.

Love = Wrath,"Real rating: 7.8/10 Those who love dearly are destined to be victims of wrath, a true yet cynical thought. A decently paced thriller for its length struggles with the weird morals of its characters, or lack thereof in 80% of the cast, as well as their inability to see that they are all prisoners to their own ideals, beliefs, desires and wants. They are inhumane creatures being portrayed as humane and no better example of this is the wife character thanking god for one of the most heinous atrocities an average human could conduct. The acting, while a touch over the top in scenes, is stellar, the cinematography is excellent and the directing superb, the writing is actually the let down, though it feels like it shouldn't be and most will be able to gloss over this as we the viewer tend to accept weaker writing so long as our emotional strings are being played eloquently.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Best thriller.,"Sat tense throughout the entire movie. Had not moves my eyes off-screen for the entirety for the film. Starts with a dark setting. Acting is superior. Once the children are kidnapped, you're constantly wondering who did it, and how. The viewer is constantly choosing a side. The torture scenes are really intense. You feel bad for the guy. The scene where Hugh grabs the hammer is the summon of the suspense. I had not expected the plot twist. Considering the genre of thrillers, this is by far the best one.

Moody. Dark. Atmospheric.,"""Prisoners"" is the kind of mystery/drama that stays with you long after you've left the auditorium. Denis Villeneuve's choice to emphasize and build tension by long takes gives the film an engrossing feel, and also helps the actors to really sink in and disappear into the characters. Supported by Roger Deakins' masterful cinematography and Jóhann Jóhannsson's haunting score, the film develops a bleak world which will keep you captivated for days.P.S.

Plot and screenplay comparable to legendary 'Silence of the Lambs',"Jackman and Gyllenhaal give career best performances in this tantalizing suspense thriller. The story, the plot, the screenplay, the acting, the direction, the set everything is perfect and is comparable only to the legendary 'Silence of the lambs'. I generally do not dare to compare any movie to the later but i am just compelled to mention this here. For a movie to be this good everything has to come together. If the story does not pack the punch than no matter how many dollars the producer spends on the movie it can't become legendary. Prisoners is an excellent story which is fully complemented by the acting performances of Jackman, Gyllenhaal and every other cast member. Paul Dano (little miss sunshine) who plays the character Alex is worth a special mention here. He plays a disturbed kid in this movie and is essential to the maintenance of suspense and he does it seamlessly. I urge you to watch this movie in the theaters. It makes sense to encourage and appreciate brilliance which today is so rare in the movie business.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Thriller cinema done right !,"Denis Villeneuve yet again delivers a well crafted piece of art , not only is the story captivating , but it's full of symbolism , psychology and everything that in my mind makes a film great and communicates a strong message to the audience .
I've known Villeneuve through his Sci-Fi works ( Arrival - Blade Runner 2049 ) and decided to give this movie a chance , I have to say I was in for a lovely surprise , the guy made a Fincher-esque psychological movie without losing his signature .
Tension is so dominant in the movie it's almost a character , the nature of the characters being morally different ( which can be observed through their reactions , behaviors and acts ) makes for a very suspenseful experience which is amplified thanks to the actors' performances ( espiecially Hugh Jackman who was very intense in some scenes ) .
The movie deals brilliantly with moral dilemmas and other philosophical concepts such as egoism , altruism , nihilism , the good and bad spectrum or whether these two exist at all , the movie also had its share of religious symbolism and imagery to portray mainly the effect faith has in people ( or lack thereof ) and the consequences of these faith based acts .
All in all , this movie is a must for any fan of cinema and thrillers , and Villeneuve is becoming more and more of an S-list director",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Great cinematography, underwhelming story","Denis Villeneuve delivers a movie with perfect cinematography: the direction and mise-en-scène are top-notch especially with regards to the work done on lighting, the shots are almost of surgical precision and perfectly underline the narration.Speaking about the content now, the story is relatively captivating, as is the atmosphere, and carried by an excellent Jackman Gyllenhaal duo. But the movie loses too much time trying to develop a plot and characters that ultimately are quite shallow.A lot of scenes are very conventional and don't help broaden the perspective, and you even sense some hesitation on the writing at the end especially regarding the false leads which are not properly integrated and seem to serve no purpose whatsoever.As the movie progresses and the outcome unfolds, you begin to realise the banality of the story, its lack of impact and depth on every level.It is therefore a nice package but that sounds a bit empty, you don't end up overwhelmed after watching Prisoners, far from it, it's actually more of a certain disappointment that emerges considering there was better to do with these elements.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Tense and brutal with twists that drag you deeper in this unforgiving neo noir thriller,"Ok lets get the praise for the acting here out of the way first. Its an all star cast with all star performances. Without a doubt. Jackman as dark and mean as he's ever been, Gyllenhaal & Dano turning in solid support roles as well. Directed by the incredible Denis Villeneuve who's responsible for churning out some of the most must see movies I have enjoyed in the past 7 years this one is really a winner.So the main plot of this cerebral story centers around the disappearance of two little girls. The daughter's of Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howards' characters respectively. Every parents worst nightmare really. Its the lengths that these two men are willing to go to find their missing daughters that really drives this story. Along the way unexpected things happen and you just get dragged deeper and deeper into the mystery. The clues are laid out quite well though. Like Zodiac (another fantastic Gyllenhaal movie) its well plotted and paced and keeps you guessing until the end. Certainly the agony and suffering of worrying about missing children is well portrayed here as if it were unfolding in real life.Its really a no nonsense type of movie, no laughs, no smiles. Always find these tough to watch but compelling as it gets. A great entry in the canon of the one of the best directors in Hollywood today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Grim Fairy Tale,"The best way to see ""Prisoners"" is to go in cold, not knowing anything, and be surprised and excited by every new twist and turn. I knew very little and had moderate expectations, so that when the early event – every parent's worst nightmare, the kidnapping of children – occurs I was seized by dread and anxiety which didn't let up until the final moment in the film. I see too many movies that don't really engage me, so it was thrilling to watch a movie that so completely held me in thrall.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the cop assigned to the case. He's intuitive and methodical and has a history of solving all his cases. It doesn't help, though, that the father (played by Hugh Jackman) of one of the little kidnapped girls, impatient with the cop's M.O., decides to take matters into his own hands. He's a good man who does something unspeakably bad, and what he ends up doing morally rips him apart. This turns the movie from being merely a police procedural into something altogether different, and makes it really interesting. There are monsters in the movie – and in the world – and they're not the big bad wolf living off in the woods, somewhere. Sometimes they live among us, in nice tidy little houses down the street – or maybe they lurk inside us.I was afraid that the story was going to be too convoluted and that there were going to be gaps in logic (it's a testament to how involved I was in the movie that, for awhile, I was on edge about this) but these were tidied up to my satisfaction. One critic I read thought the movie was way too long, but I wasn't bored for an instant. ""Prisoners"" is exactly as long as it needs to be. I liked director Denis Villeneuve's careful and methodical pacing, slow and suggestive fades and preoccupation with mood (all of which, for me, increased the suspense). There were moments when this movie messed with my head.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I just would have done things differently to make the mystery a bit more intellectually challenging.Lots of people are focusing on Hugh Jackman'a performance and, whilst I agree it was brilliant and one of his best, I was totally taken by the character that Jake Gyllenhaal created.

I admit as a lawyer I am biased against these kind of movies where suspects are tortured beaten senseless and arrested with zero probable cause. That Jackman would make this movie after his magnificent performance in Lez Miz could only have been for the money. His role is a one-dimensional idiot without intelligence who gets it wrong from the beginning. Jake G has the worst role as stupid numbskull cop who hasn't a clue as to what is going on. I didn't give a fig about the parents, or their kids. There was zero background on what kin of parents and kids they were. This was not even a bad TV movie, it was a waste of time. Its length is inexcusable, its plot beyond idiotic and its actors were like very bad run of the mill nobodies. They all should be ashamed of themselves--the writer, director actors and everyone else.

MY REVIEW: Puzzling Desperation,"Prisoners. It's a slick dark crime investigation thriller raising few questions on moral ambiguity. The theme is based on kidnapping of two small children in a small town where police fails to make much progress and a parent takes matters into his own hands. Like Ben Affleck's smashing debut Gone Baby Gone, the movie's journey is about putting the pieces of clues together and in parallel questioning how much evil you can become to counter the evil? Lead actors Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhall give their best and supporting actors provide nice support. Movie takes the conventional route of a crime drama but it's the unsettling intensity in atmosphere through grey background and chilling performances that keep you puzzled in a good way from start to finish. Like other classic crime thrillers, it asks you to provide your full attention and makes you discuss it more and more long after the movie has ended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The director gives us the free choice to pick up our character side, which evolves with the complexity of the situations.

I just love his work and would give him not one but a couple of Oscars, but not for this one, it's not so impressive.

Shodding plotting dressed up as art.(Spoilers),"SPOILERSThey threw the movie away in the third act!A very competently-made, suspenseful piece, albeit with some of the whiff of anxiety-exploitation around child abduction that, say, The Pledge has, but impressively and seriously put together. A lot of the revelations are guessable, but it'll keep you watching. Yet - in the end - you may wish you'd spent your time watching something else. Because it doesn't pay off.There are many holes, but one key howler.For me, the film makers threw it all away with one piece of ""let's go down to that spooky graveyard"" plotting.With a jigsaw puzzle this intricate, everything has to be plausible or it all feels like a confection.And when Hugh Jackman runs off - alone, actively avoiding the police and preventing them from accompanying him - to confront the abductor, after learning a key piece of information in the hospital, all credibility goes out the window.HJ's character (Dover) simply has no reason to eschew the police's help once he learns that he has already been at the place where the children are being held. (Which narrows the options right down).The discovery of one of the missing girls changes everything. And acting on evidence gleaned from her is not something the police would resist.A bunch of talented actors and film makers let all their efforts go to waste due to this failure of plotting and motivation. It takes you right out of the movie.Of course, the whistle contrivance eventually makes it feel as if maybe this action doesn't seal Dover's fate (though the ending's ambiguity is a bit of a cop out). But - crucially - this piece of implausible action means that by the end we've kind of bailed.As for the aftertaste, the more you think about it, the more the 'plausible offscreen action' on which this kind of plot and edit relies, is inadequate.If you watch the flashback, which shows the first captive escaping, carefully you'll see that nasty Melissa Leo is held back by a hooded figure, which is how the little girl gets away. We see beige-hooded-coat-guy grab her from behind as she pursues the little girl, and then cut to the girl running and running.Now, there's only one beige hoodie guy in the film - it's creepy Bob Taylor, who by the time we see the flashback, has killed himself in police custody.So: why? Why did he kill himself? And/or why did he help little Joy Birch escape?If he meant for her to escape, why not just tell the cops and be a hero?And if he feels guilty enough to kill himself (why?), what was his motivation to save the girl?None of this is made even remotely clear.We could speculate that it's because he's a loon due to long exposure to LSD (if we think he's another abductee of Melissa Leo's character and her late husband - and this is suggested by the snakes he had; Leo's character says her husband kept snakes). Or maybe he feels guilty that he only managed to help one girl flee.But at this point in the story all he has to give is factual account of what happened and he'd be OK.Likewise, why does Alex withhold the information?Presumably we're supposed to presume that Holly Jones (Leo) had some intense brainwashy psychological hold over both boys. But that's a lot of presuming.So, the plot holes got in the way here. And, as is often the case, the film-makers papered over the cracks with some ambiguity and vagueness which the less discerning will take for artful and intentional ambiguity which makes the film soooo much more interesting.But it's not. It's just shoddy plotting dressed up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A thriller for dumb people,"What a disappointment. I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve, I love abduction films, I like the cast... but this movie was just boring. At one point you'll be about 20 minutes ahead of the supposedly genius detective--who doesn't seem to do much detecting whatsoever.The biggest sin of the film is that you don't care about anyone in the film. You don't care who the ""bad"" person is, you don't care if the kids are alive or dead, you don't care about anything and you have a LOT of time to not care about it -- more than two and a half hours!Seriously, at ninety minutes this story MIGHT have been captivating. At 150+ it's mind blowingly dull. None of the characters have any basement--none of them have more than a sentence or two worth of backstory to inform their present, the women characters are absolutely wasted. Poor Maria Bello can never catch a break--her character lies in bed the whole movie. Terrible waste.Viola Davis is the best of the cast--she almost always is, but even she doesn't get much room to do anything.The film also goes for numerous cheap shots, blatantly obvious red herrings with no purpose but to manipulate the audience.What a waste of pretty much everyone involved.

"Prisoners is a well-acted, disturbing crime-thriller that will make you think about letting your kids wander off alone.","Prisoners is a well-acted, disturbing crime-thriller that will make you think about letting your kids wander off alone. When two little girls are kidnapped, Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is set out to put together the pieces of the puzzle. He has Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano) in custody, a boy who owns an RV the girls were playing on, but let's him go because he has an IQ of a ten year old and he can find no evidence against him.

It's a dark film that holds onto you and never lets you go. The entire time, I was thinking of my nieces and nephews and I must say, a film has never gotten to me as much as this one did. It was almost like I was in the film, living on what these people were going through, and I must say I was terrified to tears.The film had a lot of twist and turns. I suggest you don't read any spoilers, as the film is perfect without knowing what happens. Although, this is the type of film where people will probably want to check out spoilers, to know the fate of the young girls, I strongly suggest you don't.Hugh Jackman, who showed off his vocals and acting skills in Les Miserables, gives us one of the most sinister good guys characters you'll ever see. He's a very talented actor, and I feel an Oscar nomination coming his way. Who really surprised me in this film was Jake Gyllenhaal, who played Detective Loki. His character was very sympathetic to the case and I feel Jake Gyllenhaal deserves kudos for his work. He's grown into an amazing actor. I enjoyed him immensely in End Of Watch.Prisoners is one of those films you talk about after walking out of the theatre. The film is very twisted and suspenseful and I feel it's runtime was perfect for the film. Keep in mind, the film is very dark. The events that happen in this film can happen in real life, which I hated about the film, but that would be the point of the film. The film can relate to people with children in their lives and you'll just want to go home after the film and hold them. Will I ever see Prisoners again?

Lost In the Maze,"The sleepy town of Conyers, Pennsylvania is transformed into a cold, bleak world submerged in misery in Denis Villeneuve's dark crime thriller ""Prisoners,"" released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 17th. The film entrenches viewers in a maze of hazy moral boundaries and pushes the limits of desperation in its characters, made up by an all-star line-up of accomplished actors. Rife with obscure religious symbolism and cryptic reoccurring motifs, the tangled mystery of Prisoners gives enough substance to satisfy but leaves enough unanswered questions to tantalize, reaching a Goldilocks-like equilibrium for a whodunit film.Hugh Jackman plays the rugged God-fearing survivalist Keller Dover, who is thrust to the brink of despair when his daughter and her best friend disappear on Thanksgiving Day, despite his obsessive precautions and preparations for the worst. Dover's helpless desperation drives him to kidnap and brutally torture the main suspect in the case who was released, the unnervingly enigmatic Alex Jones (Paul Dano). Jake Ghyllenhaal plays the suave and poised Detective Loki heading the case, whose analytical investigation is the counterpart to Dover's vigilante revenge, resulting in explosive scenes on screen when the two alpha males face off, like ""the cowboy versus the sheriff,"" according to Villeneuve.Unlike Liam Neeson's over-the-top ass-kicking in Taken, Jackman's portrayal as the unstable grieving father is believable and heartbreaking: his rampant violent rages convey a bottomless sadness just under the surface threatening to consume him, and one scene in particular one-on-one with Ghyllenhaal shows the actor's immense ability to bare a character's soul with utter conviction. The grisly torture scenes prove cringe-worthy, but Jackman is stellar at toeing the line between keeping viewers' confidence or losing it altogether with his frightening, ugly, yet all-too-human performance. Whether Dover is a monster or a martyr is left up to the viewers.Detective Loki's character doesn't achieve the same depths as Dover or even Jones: little character development and back-story in the script leaves Loki hanging as a blank slate, but Ghyllenhaal compensates with spot-on character tics and a reassuring composure on screen. His character's stylish wardrobe, sleek hairstyle, and mysterious zodiac-like tattoos make him a more visually stimulating figure than the no-nonsense Dover, adding another dimension to the character, if only aesthetically.Supporting actors Terrence Howard and Viola Davis anchor the film as the Birchs, the neighbors whose daughter also goes missing. Their refusal to condone Dover's actions help keep the film grounded as realistic, and Howard's performance as the broken father paralyzed by grief is a welcome contrast to the crusading Dover. The viewpoints of the older siblings in the story however, along with Dover's wife, are sidelined in favor of pushing the plot forward with Dover's grappling with morality and Loki's determined search for answers. Melissa Leo and Paul Dano are highly memorable in their supporting roles as Holly and Alex Jones: the two are adept at keeping their characters in the neutral zone of suspicion, a difficult place to remain for long in a mystery film.Composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's brooding score exemplifies the film's weariness and growing tension, keeping the pressure simmering throughout and only surging in release for the film's climax with the song ""Through Falling Snow."" Cinematographer Roger Deakins beautifully composes every frame, and doesn't shy away from peering through opaque filters of rain-soaked windows and shadows in the noir tradition. He often uses an expressionistic icy color temperature laced with deep blacks to manifest the characters' isolation and dread.As his first Hollywood (and English-language) film, Villeneuve has earned his place among the Hollywood elite with the star-studded thriller Prisoners. While the film may be too hard to digest for some, fleshing out every parent's nightmare for a nerve-wracking two and a half hours, it is an overall worthwhile captivating experience, with moving performances and a compelling mystery. This is one maze you'll love to get lost in.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A riveting slow burner,"The Dovers a religious family meet up for thanksgiving lunch over at the Birches, their friendly neighbor. Both families have two children, a teen and a kid. By evening the two kids go missing. A creepy looking young man who had his RV parked outside is the main suspect. Detective Loki(Gyllenhaal), an efficient investigator with cent percent solve rate is assigned to the case. However there is nothing that ties the suspect to the missing girls...or is there? Did Dover(Jackman) pick up something the police couldn't? Could this father with anger issues be right after all? Morality is put to test when strong suspicions become motive for vigilante investigation. Soon Winter approaches and the case is tuning cold with dead-end leads.Thriller lovers rejoice, the dry spell for suspense masterpieces ends with prisoners. With stellar performances from the entire cast topped off with a compelling portrayal of Keller Dover by Hugh Jackman, Prisoners is 150 minutes well spent.Make no mistake this is NOT a fast paced thriller with action sequences and multiple twists. Prisoners is a slow burner that tightens the tension steadily and by climax the pressure hits the roof. The aha moment when Dover puts all the pieces in place and the consequences that follow is simply a stroke of genius from writer Aaron Guzikowski.A good suspenseful plot can be occasionally seen in an episode of a procedural TV show. Terrific acting from an ensemble cast is usually a part of an award bait drama and then rarely comes the amalgamation of both resulting in an ""Argo"" or a ""Silence of the lambs"". Prisoners definitely belongs among these classics and hopefully will be duly awarded not only for the performances but for the direction and writing that transforms a decent story into a terrific movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Great at building suspense and story. Don't expect to be satisfied however,"The middle of the film is as suspenseful a film as I've watched and the mystery is also one that does not always go to type. And neither is the development or progression of the story. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki, who has apparently completed every case, and is a apparently a fine detective but however in this one he is frustratingly mortal on the track of the missing girls, so one of the parents Keller Dover (played very well by High Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands.Although the music, storyline and setting are dark and excellent a couple of things drag this film down. There is a lack of satisfaction and resolution, with many of the key moments actually not being shown (thanks random Redditor). So if you're watching this film don't expect EVERYTHING to be nicely tied up.A couple of other issues are the Police Captain is a stereotypical a hole who's horrible at their job. The cops actually are ridiculously incompetent thought this whole film. Also Melissa Leo playing the Aunt Holly has had a bad makeup job and doesn't look real.Besides that not a bad film to watch, but it's not one I'll watch again and not one I would have been sad to miss.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Fantastic... but not for everyone,"I was genuinely shaken by this movie. I'm usually a firm believer that the best way to watch a movie is to sit down and finish it in one hit. But an hour into this movie I was forced to get up and do something else for a bit to let things settle.The performances in this film are so flippin' good that it feels almost too real. Hugh Jackman is literally scary as a father willing to do whatever it takes to get his daughter back, and Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the detective just trying to do his job. Melissa Leo performed in this movie like her life depends on it, and Maria Bello is all too convincing as the mother who turns to substances to calm her depressions.And with these performances, I will admit that the story felt so real, it was hard to watch...But boy was it worth it! The ending might have shaken me to the core, but I was genuinely touched by the genuine depiction of love that the film portrays Drover to have for his daughter is inspiring. Whilst he might not always make the right decision, the film serves as a pertinent warning for doing the wrong things for the right reasons. The twist at the end is masterfully executed, brought about by the masterful pacing and the only thing I would have liked to see was a little more closure on some of the minor characters. Apart from that though, everything about this movie screamed perfection.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone purely because of how brutal it is, but I can genuinely say that it is one of the greatest films I've seen in a long... long time...",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Well made,"In a small Pennsylvania town, the lives of two neighbouring families are turned to chaos due to abduction.Director Denis Villeneuve does a fine job in maintaining tension throughout this film. He keeps the mood dark and bleak which is appropriate considering the material. In the impressive cast, Hugh Jackman is a standout as a very intense and troubled man in a very difficult situation.The best part of the story is one involving a shocking act by crime victims. It causes the audience to question the morality of the act and genuinely see both sides of the issue.The conclusion is fascinating but occasionally confusing with holes in the story. Thankfully, the Wikipedia summary fills in the gaps that were hard to understand. The fact that two characters acted like one-man rescue teams without considering asking for help also seemed over the top. This was especially true in a scene involving a speedy car ride.Despite the flaws, this was a gripping film whose effect is not easily forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Nerve Racking till the bitter end.,"This was a really good movie that I had little to no expectations going into the film which actually made for a better viewing. I think the trailer didn't really do this film justice in terms of how good it actually was. The cop played his role expertly well, he had that sense of a tense nature and one that would go all out to get what he wanted to get. I love the start of the movie and the taking as well as how it was hinted at. They did that so well and built it to such a great degree. The use of the rain when they went out to try and find them also really heightened the situation. The whole tale did drag on quite a long way, but I cannot say I was bored at any point. Yes, there were some loose ends which I didn't quite get as the movie went on in terms off several things that didn't really add much substance to the plot and a few things that in my opinion were a bit confusing, nonetheless, the role of the sub plots and the smaller characters was once more done well and each of them really fitted the type of play they were in. The ending to the movie really opens up the chance on more of this but to be honest, I don't see where they can go.

This film has stuck with me for a while now--it has a presence about it that crawls underneath your skin. It deals with very adult themes and can, at times, be tough to view, but it is an important film that allows us to witness how some individuals handle adversity and frustration. Many of the critic reviews acknowledge the work by Jackman, but it is the work by Gyllenhaal that really wowed me.

"A good crime story, just not Mystic River.","""Be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best."" Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman)So you think someone can replicate the sinister Silence of the Lambs and the melodramatic Mystic River; well no one can because they are grand thrillers, fraught with suspense and depravity and peppered with audience desire for revenge.Prisoners is not pop-culturally as memorable as those chestnuts, but it is thrilling and complex like the crimes themselves. There's macabre fun if you don't demand all the holes be filled. Relax and see a good if not great crime story.Revenge in thrillers, from Death Wish to Zero Dark Thirty, ignites American audiences, perhaps from the uncertainty that they can handle all the bad guys around the world. Whatever, Prisoners gives nothing new except sterling performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (both should have Oscar nominations) and noirish cinematography from the grandmaster, Roger Deakins.Conyers, Pennsylvania's, Keller Dover and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) search for their abducted daughters, while police detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) does the footwork necessary to find them while the fathers vilify him for going too slowly. In that tension rests the film's best thematic gravity: How far will you go to find the abductor of your child? Writer Aaron Guzikowski's literary ambitions about theme are on the side of heavy handed (the symbology of the opening hunting scene and Loki's constantly blinking eyes—not seeing clearly, anyone?— are overripe).However, the dialogue is crisp and the scene shifts are expertly timed to keep us from asking too many logistical questions.The plot twists are not as bad as some might think, and the moral ambiguity where the ends justify the means is as much about the limitations of the judicial system as it is about unadorned vengeance: The audience is torn as they consider the morality of the fathers' actions. Who's to judge? Not I.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Loki personal life,"I am curious what the IMDb community thinks about Loki, and his past/personal life. First of all, you have to love the name Loki, as in low-key; which he is kind of the antithesis of. Maybe he is not as outwardly animated as Jackman's character, but you can see tons of rage. Anyway back my my real point/question...First of all, he never drinks. We never see him take a sip of alcohol. When the police chief offers him the whiskey at the end, he immediately dismisses it. Could this be nothing, sure. Could it be something, perhaps. Cops are notorious for being drinkers, as even a little reference from shutter island will support:Teddy Daniels: Soda on ice please, thanks.Dr. Jeremiah Naehring:Oh, you don't indulge in alcohol I'm surprised. Isn't it common for men in your profession to imbibe?Also, the reason why this stands out to me so much is because there is also one scene where I believe Jackman's wife asks the detective if he has kids. He never answers the question. He defers to some generic line like ""we will find your girl"" but thats not before hesitating for a second. Maybe I'm thinking too much into this; but the hesitation and look on his face struck me. Is there a connection to his hesitation to this question about him having kids, his refusal to drink alcohol, and the reason why he solves child disappearances for a living? Who am I to say. But these are things that struck me and things I think about.My $0.02",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Prisoners(2013),"Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners is a haunting and impeccably crafted thriller that explores the depths of human desperation, morality, and the consequences of our darkest impulses. From its gripping storyline to its outstanding performances, this film is a masterpiece in every sense.Set against the backdrop of a suburban American town, Prisoners opens with the abduction of two young girls. The story follows Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a father who, in the wake of his daughter's disappearance, becomes consumed by a desperate need for justice. He takes matters into his own hands when he becomes convinced that the police, led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), are not doing enough. As Keller's determination grows, so does the film's tension, pushing both the characters and the audience to uncomfortable moral extremes.What makes Prisoners so exceptional is its ability to explore complex themes with sensitivity and nuance. The film never sensationalizes its premise. Instead, it builds a creeping sense of dread, asking questions about the limits of parental love, the cost of revenge, and the morality of vigilante justice. Villeneuve expertly manipulates the pace, blending moments of unbearable suspense with quiet, introspective scenes that give the film an emotional weight rarely seen in thrillers.The performances are nothing short of extraordinary. Hugh Jackman delivers one of his career-best performances as Keller Dover, capturing the inner turmoil of a father willing to go to any lengths to save his daughter. His portrayal of a man on the edge of sanity is raw, intense, and profoundly affecting. Jake Gyllenhaal, as Detective Loki, provides the perfect counterbalance, embodying a character whose calm, methodical nature contrasts sharply with Keller's spiraling emotional state. The two share an electric dynamic, with Gyllenhaal's quiet determination bringing depth to the investigative side of the story.The supporting cast is equally impressive. Viola Davis, Maria Bello, and Terrence Howard provide excellent performances as the families affected by the abductions, each portraying a different facet of grief and helplessness. Meanwhile, Paul Dano, in a heartbreaking role as the prime suspect, delivers a quietly disturbing performance that lingers long after the film ends.Visually, Prisoners is stunning. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, one of the greatest in the industry, creates a bleak, atmospheric environment that mirrors the characters' internal turmoil. The film's muted color palette and long, lingering shots build an eerie tension that reflects the unsettling nature of the story. Every frame feels meticulously crafted, contributing to the film's sense of inevitability.The script, written by Aaron Guzikowski, is smart and complex, weaving together multiple threads that keep the audience guessing until the very end. The film's pacing is deliberately slow, allowing the tension to build organically rather than relying on cheap thrills or jump scares. It's a film that doesn't shy away from uncomfortable truths, and it isn't afraid to leave certain questions unanswered, making it all the more thought-provoking.At its core, Prisoners is a meditation on the lengths to which people will go when pushed to the brink. It's a film that doesn't offer easy answers, leaving the audience to wrestle with its moral complexities long after the credits roll. It is, without a doubt, one of the most powerful and unsettling thrillers of the 21st century.With its brilliant direction, impeccable performances, and intense atmosphere, Prisoners is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's a film that pulls you into its world, and once you're in, it doesn't let go. For its emotional depth, its relentless tension, and its ability to provoke profound reflection, I give Prisoners a perfect 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Music is by Jóhann Jóhannsson and cinematography by Roger Deakins.When Keller Dover's (Jackman) daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands...At first glance of the plot synopis, one could be forgiven for thinking this is yet another revenge thriller filled out by police procedural side-bars. How pleasant to find that Prisoners has more to offer than a simple who is the criminal? And just how far will a vengeful father go to satiate his grief?.Prisoners is such an apt title because all the main players here are trapped by either mental fragility or victims of their innocence, guilt or chaotic impulses. It's a multi stranded character piece that poses many questions, while of course it has a big mystery element. The narrative features a whole host of clues that might be something, or not, unanswered questions dangle throughout until the finale reveals thge edgy secrets.It's safe to say that the themes at work here are dark and upsetting, with the core abduction thread siddling up against horredous back stories, torture and religious mania. Gruzikowski's screenplay is quality, mesmerising even, there's no lazy filler or extranous sequences, even as the jigsaw pieces are put together in the last quarter, you may find yourself wondering how you missed something so simple?.This was Villeneuve's first English language picture, and it's not hard to see why he was highly touted as one of the next big director beings - his output that followed subsequently bears this out. His control of mood and pacing is superb, his garnering of high quality perfs from his cast (notably Jackman and Gyllenhaal) is impressive, and his teaming with the great Deakins is a match made in photographic heaven.This is adult film making, a thriller designed to illicit emotional responses from the audience.

There's a very realistic approach to it's unhurried plot, and how it quickly unfolds in the helplessness of the two dads, friends whose little girls have been snatched, supposedly by a faceless guy, couple, loitering around the area in an suspicious RV, in the cold frosty air. This is one of many films built around the child napping scenario, the disturbing type ones, that have run more common thing in the last couple of years (Taken, The Flock) this one never more effective, though these aren't teenagers, they're kids. Prisoners works, not just because of the A level performances, some so bloody convincing, but the realistic standpoint of the characters in how they deal with the situations. We so much feel helplessness with the driven father Jackson, who resorts to kidnapping and torturing a mum, childlike suspect, you want him so much to talk, where at one point, you realize it's gonna be like getting blood out of a stone, the girl's fates, waning, or may'be already determined. Jackson does get bloody here, mind you, while his mate, not an advocate, is reversely the opposite. ""Christ, your little girl's been snatched man"", but the reverse contrast in these two characters works. At one point, as Jackman's ""Where's my daughter"", reaches a shouting pinnacle, this just reminds us of what a great dramatic actor he is. But Gylenhall, is just fantastic, as the driven cop, carving another notch under his acting belt. He brings some truly unnerving moments to his character, that you don't when he'll pop his top next. There are some sick themes to the film too, (the snakes in those containers) in a film that touches on a disturbing subject. Playing out to nearly two and a half hours, Prisoners is a rewarding experience to the movie goer, though on the other hand, you may have to allow the effect and memory of this movie to dissipate days after the view. Just cautioning some here.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Over Done Script, Great Performances","Prisoners, being argued as one of the best movie of the year, left me disappointed. The backbone, the script of the film is highly manufactured. It's very apparent that the writers decide to maze up a simple idea into something astounding. However, the plan backfired, and in hindsight we might as well think that the film would have been better off as a simple family under stress episode.Gyllenhall, Jackman, Bello all pack in great performances, trying to carry the inconsistent story line and loop holed play, but that would not be enough. Gyllenhall, continuing from End of Watch, plays the clichéd part of the super smart Detective, (who has solved every case he's been on....duh), and throws in some great improvisation, which makes the part more likable. Jackman as the troubled father is near perfect, in perhaps one of his finest performance.As is typical of any Hollywood thriller, there are quite a few psychos on the prowl, some over the top scenarios and of course unreal backgrounds that pop out of nowhere.Watch it to enjoy a great acting fest, but not for a great thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Glum, overlong, and goes off the rails before the end","Two small girls, the daughters of two families, are abducted while playing outside.

The detective on the case continues to pursue leads, but one of the fathers takes matters into his own hands, seizes the suspect, and tries to extract the location of the girls from him. But maybe he doesn't have the right person...There are good things about Prisoners, starting with the performances of Hugh Jackman (father Keller Dover), Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), and Paul Dano (suspect Alex Jones). The situation is a good one, the moral issues are interesting, some suspense is generated, and the cinematography and production design is very good at conveying a cold, dark world where cold, dark things happen.There are some not-so-good things about it too. At 153 minutes it is overlong by at least half an hour. The final third goes seriously off the rails story-wise. The moral issues are never really addressed.

Prisoners of fears,"While watching this film, you will imagine the parents who desperately struggle to protect their children from the evil of the outside. And you will see how the children vanished right before their eyes. The worst fears are let out and the families are facing cruel reality: someone took their babies and hided them. None knows ""why"": why children, why they're not telling where, why to kidnap anybody at all? Maybe it's because of their sickness, maybe because of money, or there is no particular reason, who can tell? Aren't they're prisoners of their own sick mind, desperately wanting to catch an innocence, a freedom, a symbol of it? And the parents are in pain, in enormous fear, like in a black hole, doing everything: possible and impossible, imaginable and unseen and unheard, only to find them.

Without a doubt best movie from 2013,To me Prisoners was the best movie I saw in 2013. And to give you an example I watch about two movies per day. I just watched it a second time and even though I remembered everything from the first time I saw it I still love it. The first time I saw it was of course the best because during the entire movie you are kept in suspense and you try to figure out who is the bad guy and what really happened. It has been a long time that a movie didn't get my full attention from he first second til the last second. To me Prisoners is underrated and has his spot among classics like Seven and Silence Of The Lambs. The acting is outstanding in Prisoners. You can feel the desperation dripping of Hugh Jackman. The detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal is also a delight to watch. In fact the whole cast did an outstanding job. I don't know many of my friends that heard or saw Prisnores while everybody knows the other classics I mentioned so I could only vividly recommend you watch Prisoners. During the entire movie there is a dark gloomy ambiance that works really well. If you like mysteries and suspense you will love this one.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

This is a good movie in my opinion.,"The Good: 1. Acting, i should say that this is one of the best performances for both leading actors. Hugh Jackman was incredible. 2. Plot and characterization, well i can expected that by seeing the director's name. One of the best crime-thriller ever made, keep you sucked into the plot. 3. Cinematography, genius Deakins success to build the tense of the film only by his work. Film atmosphere was really good. The Bad: Overlong and the original score not pretty good to lived up the film. I mean, Johann was a really good composer, especially his work in Sicario and Arrival, but it's not work here.

Stretches a bit long and gets a little predictable but features fine performances,"Prisoners is like that one friend or comedian you know who's know who tells overly elaborate stories or jokes that you have to applaud for the effort if nothing else. Intentions seem to be in the right place, delivery is going smoothly, there's a handful of ups and downs that aren't terribly cliché but you swear you've heard one or two before, and when all is said and done you nod in approval and open the door knowing they'll be back soon in another form with another tale.Comparisons to strange friends aside, Prisoners does its best to keep a child abduction story above Lifetime Movie levels. What does this is the acting of the two leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman, and the violence both on display and implied. Jackman convincingly continues down a rabbit hole of anger and frustration as a distressed father, and Gyllenhaal almost follows suite as the detective assigned to the case. Both elevate the material a bit, but neither can save it from the excessive runtime of 2 1/2 hours and a handful of mystery/suspense clichés. If it weren't for the cast and the caliber of acting the film wouldn't have made the splash it did when it was released.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A Thriller in the true meaning of the word,"I usually choose to rate 10/10 when I can't think of anything I myself would have done otherwise or if there weren't any issues apparent to me during viewing. This is one of those movies. Though in hindsight there might be things that pop up, having seen the movie yesterday for the first time I really can't think of anything that could have improved the experience for me.This movie is excellently written, paced and acted. The camera work fits story being told with a couple of fun shots, like Loki in the basement. I rarely praise the writing of a movie, but this is truly excellently put together for a thrilling experience.The movie gives away just enough information for you to be able to guess every next twist, yet not so much to let you figure out the whole picture. It makes for a somewhat cathartic viewing when you feel smart for figuring out the next plot beat a bit sooner than the characters, yet being just as lost as they are in the grand scheme of things. I believe that this was done intentionally and it works. The movie takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions.Speaking of emotions, the acting is really excellent. Hugh Jackman really sells the despair of a parent pushed to the limits making the movie all the more disturbing if you have kids of your own. Would I call watching the movie a good time? No, not really. It is a thrilling time, it is memorable and certainly worth your time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

More than just a Thriller.,"What makes Prisoners so special, is that it is more than just one of the most tense thrillers ever seen, classified into the ranks of thriller-titans, like ""Seven"": It raises questions, builds up labyrinths and puzzles, twists the plot countless times and leaves space to interpret.

Rounded by a genius-like actresses performance of Hugh Jackman, Paul Dano and especially Jake Gyllenhaal playing the detective Loki. How would I have reacted in cases like this? What means this?

A fathers race against time and his own morals...,"Normally I am not particularly fond of these type of movies, as they tend to be fairly much alike. And yeah, ""Prisoners"" do have a lot in common with many others in this particular missing people genre, but still it is an enjoyable movie that is entertaining.What makes the movie enjoyable was the amazing performances and great actors and actresses in the movie. Especially Hugh Jackman, I must admit that this is without a doubt his best performance in a movie so far that I have seen. He really gets to show so many aspects of his talent in this movie, proving that he is much more than just an action actor.The storyline in ""Prisoners"" is captivating and interesting, and director Denis Villeneuve manages to keep the audience at the edge of their seats all throughout the entire movie. This is indeed a very emotional roller-coaster, because the characters are so realistic and you quickly bond with them and get to be in their situation. And of course, the amazing portrayal of the characters by the actors and actresses really helped this along quite nicely.There were a couple of plot twists here and there, enough to keep the storyline interesting and pushing the movie in a new direction once in a while. However, the ending to the movie was a bit, well, let's just say that it could have been better.Despite being a rather long movie, then the time passes quickly because the movie is interesting and nicely paced. So the 153 minutes come and go quite fast.""Prisoners"" is overall an enjoyable and watchable movie.

Prisoners review,"In this Denis Viellenueve movie, we see Hugh Jackman playing a man in crisis to which his children has been kidnapped. Throughout the film, to get to know the character of Detective Loki (brilliantly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal) who helps Jackman find the kidnapper and send him to prison. The film shows you the events that happened on Hugh Jackman trying to find his children's kidnappers, and torture them to the holt until they give him the information that he wants. The film is very tense and gritty throughout, and the whole cast does brilliantly throughout the entirety of the film.This is the film that got me to notice Gyllenhaals power in Acting and dedication to his roles, it made me become a real fan of his work, and inspired me to watch him in 'Nightcrawler, Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, and recently Southpaw) Gyllenhaal is a marvellous Actor with a lot to offer on screen, and his Co-Starr (Hugh Jackman) does perfectly as the devastated father in this movie. You can't help think of Jackman and think (Wolverine) from X-Men. But this film proves that he is capable of being a lot more than a hard headed mutant when it comes to Acting. This film is extremely enjoyable throughout, and definitely sticks with you after watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Never Totally Convincing,"Overrated, this has Big-Name Stars and a Newcomer Director (made a splash with some Indie Film with an Oscar Nomination), and a Great Cinematographer. It is a Longish Crime-Investigation Thriller set in the Rurals of Pennsylvania where Two Children go Missing.There are more Passed Over Plot Points Dangling than strung up Bucks at a Hunting Cabin on Opening Day. Things come and Things go at Regular Intervals as the Movie Plays Out, and it is all to make it seem like this is an Intelligent, Disturbing, Pedophiliac Picture about an already Borderline Disturbed Dad to Snap and take Revenge.But a whole lot of it seems Forced and Throws in a Greatly Amount of Backwoods, Small Town, Religious Fervor and Soul Searching, but Never is Totally Convincing on any of it. Our ""Hero"", the Dad who Snaps is a Survivalist and it may be an Indication that this Contractor has a Few Screws Loose because in His Basement there are Stacks and Stacks of Crisco.Assuming the Product didn't Underwrite some of the Movie there can be No Other Explanation for this Bizarre Behavior. Water, Batteries, Can Goods, and lots of Crisco. Prayer and a whole lot of Lard will Help one Survive the Apocalypse.That is the kind of Ill-Fitting Logic that abounds in this Not Awful Movie and if Lengthy Stories that go Everywhere and Nowhere, that Lead to an Ending with more Holes than a Back Road Sign and a Pennsylvania Highway, then Go for it.

A decent (if absurd) mystery that is gorgeously shot and competently told,"""Prisoners"" is a methodically paced mystery about two families desperately searching for their daughters who disappear on Thanksgiving Day. Many people (my wife included) will stay away from this film based on its premise alone, finding the misery too realistic. This is unfortunate because director Denis Villeneuve, writer Aaron Guzikowski and the cast of Hollywood heavyweights have created an engaging story that is really more focused on the mystery of the girls' disappearance than on the misery of it. Now, the script can be pretty heavy handed and far-fetched at times, but there is much more to praise. There are plenty of unexpected maze-like turns, some great sound editing, and ""Prisoners"" may hold the distinction as being the most beautiful film of the year. However, the movie's main draw for many people will be the cast, which is filled with powerhouse performances. While some of the actors may be bordering on melodrama, the acting throughout is darkly stellar. Above them all is a quiet but powerful performance from Gyllenhaal as the detective given the unenviable task of solving the puzzle. This may be the first film of the year that feels to be reaching for an Oscar or two. And with some strong performances, beautiful cinematography, and a dark twisted mystery (which the Academy loves), I wouldn't be surprised to see it pop up again next February during the big ceremony. ""Prisoners"" definitely delivers as a decent, if at times absurd, mystery that is gorgeously shot and skillfully told.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

It's a bit depressing and not for sensitive souls. The actors are doing a great job and there's a dark atmosphere throughout the entire movie, mainly because of the great cinematography.When I watched it a second time and the story was no longer a surprise, I thought there was too much added thrill factor/action scenes.

Great performances help to free 'Prisoners' from its clichés,"There's really nothing particularly exceptional about the story or the script for 'Prisoners', but in the hands of a director who uses expertly applied minimalism and an extraordinarily talented cast, it becomes a compelling tale about love, faith and how quickly hard lines can become blurred in the face of tragedy.The final act undermines this somewhat with its tonally incongruent Hollywood twists and turns that seem like they were spliced in from a different film, but ultimately 'Prisoners' is still a gripping and gut-wrenching tale that will likely stay with you long after the credits roll.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Very Good: 8.5,"Prisoners is not a film that you leave saying ""that was a good time."" After a few minutes of tranquility, it becomes relentlessly bleak, quickly making the leap from a nice Thanksgiving dinner to detective work, torture, and suicide in a disturbingly deft fashion. Prisoners reminded me of the old David Fincher films, of the ilk of Fight Club and Se7en, with gradually unraveling plotlines told through cold and subdued cinematography. In a few ways, this is really just another thriller; a multitude of shots of people frantically hurrying about, and an antagonist's motivation that comes off as laughable. But there are plenty of movies that put tired cliches to good use, and Prisoners is one of them. In spite of all this, there is a handful of great performances at work, with Jackman in particular portraying a man barely holding on with chilling efficacy. It's not without its share of blemishes, and plays it a bit too safe in its depiction of the subject matter, but Prisoners is a dread-inducing, pure thriller with enough twists and turns to satisfy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Be Prepared ... or Seek Vengeance,"Greetings again from the darkness. This film is one of those goldmines for discussion and debate. Each successive scene begs the viewer to judge the actions of those involved, but even beyond that, the movie is screaming to be picked apart by those of us prone to do so. It's actually the best of both worlds for film lovers ... it challenges us on a personal and moral basis, and also as one who analyzes scripts, acting choices, and filmmaking techniques.Having seen the trailer, I was very much aware of the foundation of the film ... two young girls are kidnapped and, frustrated with the lack of progress by the police, one of the dads seeks his own form of justice. So I couldn't help but cringe with the obvious metaphor opening scene where Hugh Jackman's character (Keller Dover) experiences one of those life-bonding moments with his teenage son Ralph (played by Dylan Minnette). Once past that, the set-up is expertly handled ... two middle class families sharing friendship and Thanksgiving dinner. Keller and his wife Holly (Maria Bello) have two kids: Dylan and their young daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimokovich). Their neighborhood friends Franklin and Nancy are played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis, who have a teenage daughter Eliza (Zoe Borde) and young daughter Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Perfect families and perfect friends shattered by a horrific ordeal when the young girls go missing. The main suspect is a simplistic man-child who drives a ratty RV. Alex Jones is played by Paul Dano in the most uncompromising manner possible.Enter Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal). Loki is an odd bird who never lets a case go unsolved. His quirky personality and facial ticks and buttoned-up shirt provide us with enough backstory that we understand his dogged pursuit and need to work alone. As the story unfolds, we are overwhelmed with an abundance of terrific story lines. In fact, there are so many that we feel downright cheated at all the deadends and dropped-cold sub-plots.As a father, I certainly could relate to Keller's relentless, stop-at-nothing pursuit of the first and only lead. Exactly where would I draw the line for my own actions? I can't answer that other than to say that I totally understood his approach. That's not to say I condone such actions, only that I fully empathize. Holly's reaction to the ordeal is to curl up in bed with meds. That too is understandable. Loki's frustration with his own department and the false leads is also understandable. So while each character's actions make sense, the viewer's frustration is palpable, not just because of these things, but in the mis-use of such fine actors as Mr. Howard, Ms. Davis, and Ms. Leo. Jackman, Gyllenhaal and Dano dominate through much different methods, yet we viewers constantly find ourselves wanting to know more about the teenage kids, the priest played by Len Cariou, and of course, the Howard and Davis characters.The film's message is not vague. It's quite clear, even overly obvious. Keller is a survivalist ... the kind of guy who is prepared for any disaster. No matter how prepared one is, the loss of a child will test your morals, faith and inner-strength. What would you do? How far would you go? Is there a line you won't cross to protect your family? Those questions are much simpler until real life forces you to answer.One thing you will quickly notice is just how stunningly beautiful this film is. The credits provide the answer in Director of Cinematographer Roger Deakins, probably the best in the business. French-Canadian Director Denis Villenueve gave us the exceptional Incendies, and while this one has plenty to offer, I believe some fine-tuning with writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) could have elevated this one to Oscar worthy material. So take your friends and be prepared for post-movie discussion. Everyone will have their own thoughts and opinions. That doesn't make this a great movie, but it serves the purpose of getting us to question our faith and beliefs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Did the writers all quit?,"If I could give a rating of less than 1, I would.The best part of the movie was the trailers of coming releases.Had I left after the trailers, I would have been better off.After a good suspenseful start, this movie drags on and on with no clear connections between events.The characters are not really convincing in their roles, except for maybe Mr. Dover.Unless the story is deliberately trying to convey ineptness on the part of the characters, there are far too many missed connections between elements introduced early in the story.As Lisa Simpson says, ""it is just a bunch of stuff that happened.""A better crime drama can be seen on any syndicated police story.It is a major disappointment.

Prisoners is compelling enough when being ambiguous about the way things eventually turn out,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who watched this yesterday though he didn't mind seeing it again. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are quite compelling as a frustrated parent of a missing child and a police detective who tries to do everything right in finding this child, respectively. They both go after different suspects and it's quite interesting what the results are. Plenty of points-of-views of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it got me hooked for most of the narrative. One might be disappointed at the way things end but since the dialogue offers clues as to what could happen, one should still be partially informed enough as to the eventual conclusion. In summary, Prisoners could be good enough for anyone not minding everything not spelled out in a neat tidy package.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Powerful Story and Even More Powerful Performances,"I have to be honest, when this came out, I was not real excited. It kind of had those Hollywood bubblegum trappings. Boy was I wrong. This is a very dark and powerful story that examines the psyches of many different and diverse characters. Probably what stands out the most are the incredible performances by all of the actors here, but especially Hugh Jackman, who delivers an Academy worthy performance. Jackman's character is a walking contradiction, he cloaks himself in every kind of religious regalia he can, while at the same time showing absolutely no confidence in his fellow man. When adversity enters his life, he ends up abandoning all of his supposed beliefs in order to save his family. Paul Dano is also excellent as the mysterious Alex Jones, an eccentric person that Jackman's Dover character is sure has taken his daughter. Gylenhall plays the deliberate and deductive detective that like every other character in this movie, is dealing with some demons of his own. This story is tight and excellently directed, every scene is chalked full of relevant information that will revel the greater understanding later. And even after the story concludes, will leave you thinking for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An Excellent Psychological Thriller,"When two young girls go missing, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is called in to head the case of trying to find the children before it's too late. Before long, suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is arrested, but is released to due lack of evidence. However, the father of one of the kidnapped girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), is irate that Jones has been released, so as Dover becomes more & more frustrated to know the location of his daughter, desperation takes over as he starts to take things into his own hands.OK, firstly, Prisoners is not a fast-paced movie at all, and if you don't like the more intricate, slower-paced movies then you will not enjoy this. Films of this pace draw a fine line...films that are slower but have an excellent story that immerse you, and films that are slower and boring. Thankfully, Prisoners is one of the former. It's 2½ hours long, but in all honesty if it was any shorter it wouldn't have done the story any justice at all as it would have been rushed and so many story lines wouldn't have been answered.Everything about this movie is really well done, and the cast do a great job of making a great story better, with one of the stand-outs being Hugh Jackman who plays Keller Dover, an ordinary husband & father who becomes obsessed with getting his daughter back no matter what it takes.The film takes you on a route that has many different twists and turns and poses so many thought provoking questions, with the main one being how far would you go if it were your child? Prisoners is a great movie and you'd be doing well to find a better crime thriller to watch this year. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Harrowing Gripping Disturbing Excellent, in the vein of Se7en and the Lambs","An amazing descent into annihilated and compromised morality. Abounding with complex characters, and hidden plot levels.It takes the dare of repeatedly skipping forward briefly in time, making us catch up and fill in pieces, pieces that we do fill in. But the result is an acceleration of time that allows the makers to focus on the unfolding and deepening horror.It deeply explores how trauma redirects the moral compass. It's also a great murder mystery. A great detective story. It's rich and complex. Intensely emotional. In many ways almost as powerful as Silence of the Lambs, but more of an ensemble piece.

"A very good, emotionally wrenching film","While this was a very good, emotionally wrenching film, it was just not as good as it could have been. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of his best performances in a long time (I'm tempted to say since Brokeback Mountain, seriously), as his Detective Loki was the right amount of measured intensity and anguish. Conversely, Hugh Jackman's performance, while good, is just a little over the top. An emotionally powerful performance doesn't always involve screaming at the top of your lungs in every scene and unfortunately that's the lasting impression I had from him here.I also found the story suffered from a few too many plot holes in my opinion. Having said that, the director did a fantastic job of creating a dark, cold, dreadful atmosphere that permeated the film and really created a sense of despair. Overall, I would say this is worth seeing, especially for Gyllenhaal's underrated performance alone.Enjoyed my review?

Riveting,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this taut, this edge or your seat, and just a plain old riveting. First let's look at the actors Jackman gives a career performance, I've gotten so used to him as Wolverine I had almost forgotten this guy is an outstanding actor. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives a wonderful performance as the detective. A very small role for both actress' (Belo and Davis) but they both give nice performances when they are on screen.What I really loved about this movie was it didn't try and beat you over the head with the plot and turns, it assumed that the audience weren't a bunch of drooling idiots. It points you subtly in the right direction and lets you figure out the rest on your own. I will credit the director for this.The characters are so well written and well acted, each of them are three dimensional, and they will keep you guessing throughout the entire film as to who the bad guys and the good guys are.All I can say to you the potential viewer is get this movie, get a big thing of popcorn and extra large drink because you are NOT going to want miss a minute of this movie, in fact you really don't want to pause it either.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Nearly Perfect Suspense Movie,"Buckle up and hang on tight as this movie make you feel as if you are on the roller coaster of emotions along with the families--and the cop--in this movie.

Plot twists and turns keep you guessing as you become drawn to and/or repulsed by the characters in the movie, and how their lives and personalities evolve over the course of a week. Excellent performances by all.My only (slight) criticism is that I would have liked to see the older siblings' characters developed more deeply, but that does not take away from the film at all.DO NOT read anything with ""spoilers"" or discuss the movie with anyone unless you have ALL seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A great character-driven crime film.,"This was a gloomy crime film, directed by the Canadian Dennis Villeneuve (''Blade Runner 2049'', ''Arrival''), and is an experience not for the faint of heart, as it deals with every parent's nightmare: the abduction of their children. Hugh Jackman delivers a solid performance as the father of the family who is willing to cross any ethical boundary in order to find his kids and restore the serenity in his household. Jake Gyllenhaal is great as the persistent cop who swears to solve the case even if that means risking his own life. The chemistry between the angry and suspicious father and the police officer who asks him not to meddle with the case is the driving force moving the plot forward because ''Prisoners'' is more of a character-driven drama than an action thriller, which places the emphasis on the emotions of the devastated parents and the obsessiveness of the detective. The rest of the cast acts pretty decent and overall ''Prisoners'' should be on the top-10 of crime films for the last five years. Highly recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Daddy's Gone A-Hunting,"This film is highly recommended.Emotions always run high whenever a child is in peril. For years, the hostage drama has been a successful staple in the crime drama genre. Films dealing with child abduction have been a mixed lot, from the sublime (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone) to the good (Raising Arizona, The Changeling), from the mediocre (Ransom, Man on Fire) to the ridiculous (Taken, Labyrinth, Bunny Lake is Missing). Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners belongs in that upper echelon of superior dramas. The film begins as a standard emotional melodrama about the aftermath of a child kidnapping before veering into a gripping story of vengeance and vigilantism. This is a film where bigger issues come into play. It doesn't play safe by being just a well-meaning routine crime drama. Instead, the filmmakers would rather deal with the gut-wrenching consequences done by flawed individuals and the backlash caused by revenge and retaliation in the name of justice.Over Thanksgiving dinner, two children go missing. An investigation ensues, leading one detective to a possible suspect, a mentally challenged loner who was near the scene of the crime. But with little evidence to hold him and time running out, a father decides to intervene and takes matters into his own hands.Hugh Jackman plays that father, Keller Dover, a devout Christian, an everyman who loves and protects his family at any cost. Jackman has some dark and sadistic scenes to play and his emotional range as the conflicted dad is beyond riveting. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Loki, the lead detective on the case and the actor delivers a multi-layered performance as an obsessed investigator in search of answers. Maria Bello is Keller's distraught and supportive wife, Grace. Terence Howard and Viola Davis are the other couple who are swept into this crisis and all of three actors are at the top of their game. Playing the primary suspect is Paul Dano, whose expertise in creating creepy characters comes in quite handy, along with Melissa Leo as his quirky and loyal mother.Villeneuve's direction is lean and concise. He shows some disturbing graphic imagery to incite the necessary rationale to make the audience possibly justify the acts of violence throughout the film while debating ethical questions about the brutality: When do the ends justify the means? At what price does one trade their moral conscience for justice? How far can one desperate act go to surpass another? (Warning: This is not a film for the easily squeamish or overly sensitive film-goer.)From the start, Prisoners captures the moviegoer's attention and never lets go. It is a tension- filled mystery with some surprising twists amid the moral dilemmas. The film is thoroughly engrossing due to a literate and perspective script by Aaron Guzikowski which takes its time to build characters and flesh out its plot. Add to that, some terrific acting from an outstanding ensemble, Villeneuve's solid direction, and you have one of the best films of the year. (My only reservation is a deliberately ambiguous ending that tends to mar the film's overall impact.)Prisoners works on so many varied levels: as an intense crime thriller about child abduction, an emotional melodrama about a family in crisis, or as a dark parable about the violent world we live in. See Prisoners for any of those reasons, but by all means, make sure you see this film. GRADE: B+ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Dark and gripping movie,"As I use to turn into a child under a Christmas tree when it comes to a promising thriller, I surely couldn't wait for this one. It didn't disappoint. Within the first few minutes an atmosphere is unwrapped that sucks you into its cold and rainy heart, beating slowly but disturbingly intense. The presence of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't interrupt at any time as they manage to develop highly believable characters in a dark and depressing yet fascinating setting. You might think that the story maybe isn't redefining the wheel, but it's told in such a deep and awfully calm way that you won't find any reasons to question it at all. It's power lies in dealing with natural human fears, which we probably never will be truly able to withstand. I don't like reviews getting too much into detail, as to my mind nearly every trailer does, so summing it up I would highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes suspense best served subliminal, such as in Mystic River, I Saw the Devil or The Hunt.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Dark tones, suspenseful til the end","Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners is way better than it looks in the trailer. The trailer seems to give away all the secrets of the film upfront; it portrays the film as lacking depth, but in reality, it's just the trailer that misleads. There is much more to Prisoners than one may anticipate.The film stars Hugh Jackman (surprise, surprise) as Keller Dover. Jackman is having an over- exposure problem at this moment in his career. As the actor seems to appear in every other film released these days, this creates questions that shouldn't exist like, ""What is the Wolverine doing in this movie Prisoners?"" Nonetheless Jackman delivers a solid, if not dimensional performance. His energy keeps the movie constantly driving forward.The film opens with two working class families getting together to celebrate Thanksgiving. Festivities abound, but while the responsible adults of the film have their attentions focused elsewhere, their two little girls run outside to play, unchaperoned. By the time the girls' absence is noticed, it's too late. The girls are gone. They have been taken. The major conflict of the film then is how to get the girls back alive.This job falls on Detective Loki, (Jake Gyllenhaal) but when Loki fails to produce results quickly enough, Keller Dover decides to take the search for the girls, and for civil justice, into his own hands. Performance-wise, Gyllenhaal as Loki is the highlight of the film. He maintains a subtle, calm composure, which contrasts Keller's (Jackman's) constant flying-off-the-rails. Loki shows a certain vulnerability while still being able to pull off fast-pace action sequences in an authentic, believable way. He is very enjoyable to watch.The actual visual experience of Villeneuve's films is very important. His 2010 film Incendies made full use of wide and vast cinematography applied in exotic landscapes. This visual imagery captivated, but all the technique was there to serve the story, the plot developments, the characters. Incendies is a masterfully crafted tragedy and Villeneuve's commanding technique is evident too throughout Prisoners.Like Incendies the filters and tones that are applied to the film, as in the actual visual images on screen, are gloomy and sepia-toned. There's not a single sunny sky, a warm day, an orderly room. Sets are designed to feel dark and empty, the best scenes use sets that play with space, showing both the abundance of vacant space for some characters, while still emphasizing the feeling of enclosure felt by others. The use of light and dark, order and disorder, space, all things that cradle the actors performances, are created by Villeneuve, expertly.The suspense of the film continues all the way to the very end as Keller Dover's untamed compulsion to find the missing girls leads to a perfectly executed, nail biter of an ending.More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I was worried it was going to be wrecked with a stupid ending like most movies are but they even managed to do well there.

"Brilliant Performance on top of masterful film making, the best film of 2013 thus far","At first glance, this film will strike many people as a typical Hollywood revenge film resembling the likes of Death Wish and Payback. However, that is furthest from the truth. Prisoners packs one hell of a punch, giving the audience not only something very entertaining, but also something very human in the process. The film plays out more like Seven, Zodiac and Mystic River, allowing the audience inside the mind of Keller Dover, a man searching for his daughter while teetering on the brink of insanity. The story kicks off when the Dover and Birch families are celebrating Thanksgiving. What seems like a normative celebration quickly descends into a frantic search for two young girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal)arrives at the Dover house after the abduction and soon finds a suspect in Paul Dano's character. But as time passes without finding the girls, Dano is finally let go. Much to his dismay, Keller Dover takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps the suspect, subjecting him to brutal torturous methods as he searches for the truth in finding his daughter. What makes Prisoners so well crafted is the performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, both of whom are at the top of their game in this film. The chemistry between these two actors is impeccable, bringing a natural presence to the screen. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Melissa Leo, is superb. Viola David, Maria Bello and Paul Dano also give caliber performances, and keep the film entertaining just on their performances alone.The story keeps moving and moving and never slows up despite a two and a half hour running time. While that seems like a deterrent nowadays for most audiences, this film is good enough for anyone to sit through happily and be able to walk out of the theater satisfied with the final product. This is a heavy hitting movie that Hollywood very seldom makes. It is rooted in classic revenge films from the golden age of Hollywood while introducing new style and substance, making for a truly intriguing watch.If there's any film that you should see right now, trust me, it is most definitely Prisoners.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

An overrated hyped miserable movie! I felt like a movie theater prisoner,"Wow, I should have put a clothes pin on my nose before sitting down in the theater because the ""Prisoner"" just plain stank.And Hugh Jackman is supposed to be better in this than in ""Les Miserables?"" Good God. Lock up the screwballs who actually tell you this nonsense.Of course the story line is about two young girls taken while their parents whoop it up in the next room but in no way can this film come close to ""Taken."" The only one taken is the guy who spends an admission price to see this ""Prisoners"" bomb. And so with Jackman's daughter and Terence Howard's daughter kidnapped, Terrence keeps cool while Hugh go bonkers beating up everyone in sight. Screaming, effing everyone, banging heads, beating people to a pulp, locking people up in makeshift closets...I mean it's as if Hugh had lost big time at a roulette wheel in the Mirage.The superior acting belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal, the head detective assigned to the case. He's kept busy as all hell trying to keep a lid on Hugh's head about to explode and on the analyses of data that offer clues to the whereabouts of the young girls. He blinks and twitches during the film but I'm not sure if it's part of the act or fear of wild man Jackman beating him between takes.The movie is OVERLONG by at least 30-45 minutes. It drags unmercifully. The plot is complicated but I figured out right away that the popcorn was too salty. I'm a BIG Hugh Jackman fan.

"'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device.'","Director Denis Villeneuve shocked us with his masterful 'Incendies' and he does it again with this intensely suspenseful highly polished drama PRISONERS written by Aaron Guzikowski. Though the film is quite long (153 minutes) the tension is sustained making the viewer not so much an observer but a member of this funky little cold town where so much evil happens.The time is the present (the location shooting was Georgia but any small town across the country could well substitute), it is Thanksgiving and two close families are gathered in their neighborhood for the feast; the Dovers – father Keller (Hugh Jackman, mother Grace (Maria Bello), daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and the Birches – father Franklin (Terrence Howard), mother Nancy (Viola Davis), daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Joy and Anna disappear and panic strikes. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Keller Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. His methods involve capturing and torturing Alex with Franklin's help, but neither is sure of the outcome of their interrogation. Twists and turns occur involving a drunken sicko priest (Len Cariou) and the aunt/mother of Alex (Melissa Leo) – both leading to very surprising endings.The cast is as first rate as they come. Everyone is strong by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are brilliant. Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, and Maria Bello involve with their usual excellent acting abilities.

Jackman should definitely see at least an Oscar nomination come awards time (so should Gyllenhaal)!,"'PRISONERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal star in this crime thriller about a father obsessed with finding his kidnapped daughter. The film co-stars Terrence Howard, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, Viola Davis and Maria Bello. It was written by Aaron Guzikowski and directed by critically acclaimed (and award winning) Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. Mark Wahlberg (who was originally set to star in the film) produced it (he also starred in the 2012 Guzikowski penned crime thriller 'CONTRABAND'). The movie is about as intense and emotionally involving as crime dramas get and it's filled with stellar performances. It was just a tad too disturbing for me (at the time of the viewing) but worth it.Jackman stars as Keller Dover in the film. Keller is a religious family man with a wife, Grace (Bello), teenage son, Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and six-year-old daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). As the movie opens his family visits their neighbors, Franklin (Howard) and Nancy Birch (Davis) and their two daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons), for Thanksgiving dinner. The two six-year-old daughters run home to the Dover's house to retrieve Anna's security whistle and never return. Ralph and Eliza saw their younger siblings playing on an RV parked down the street earlier that afternoon and tell their parents this (they also noticed someone was inside it). The RV is no longer there when Keller and Franklin go looking for it. The police are alerted and Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is put on the case. They locate the RV but the kids aren't inside it and the man driving it, Alex (Dano), is mentally retarded with the IQ of a ten-year-old. Alex is arrested but later released (as Loki pursues other leads) but Keller is sure that Alex knows where his daughter is and will stop at nothing to get the information out of him.Gyllenhaal has been one of my favorite actors for several years (ever since films like 'DONNIE DARKO' in 2001 and 'MOONLIGHT MILE' in 2002). He gives one of his best performances to date here; as a cop almost as obsessed with saving the kids as Jackman's father character is. It's Jackman that gives the best performance of his career here though (I believe). He's so emotional and convincing that he should definitely see at least an Oscar nomination come awards time (so should Gyllenhaal though). The rest of the cast is all more than adequate as well but it's not just the acting that makes the movie work so well. The script is gut wrenchingly suspenseful and fast paced and the directing is equally as intense. The movie kicks into high gear once the kids are kidnapped and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's disturbing, heart breaking and very hard to watch (and I've seen a few too many of these types of films lately) but it's definitely worth it.

Brilliant emotional journey & outstanding performances,"This is got to be Huge Jackman best powerful performance to date as you from the trailer of this film he play the character of Keller Dover who's kid & friend kid gets taken, from there this film taken you on a trip dark intense & emotional journey as the family is put through hell during its darkest hour.Also from the trailers you know that his character is out for blood as their daughter's are missing, throughout the film you can really feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he try's deal with this situation & its this performance that really show Hugh Jackman brilliance as an actor because he bring the most believable performance ever playing this role. Also bring an outstanding performance Jake Gyllenhaal as he plays the Detective Loki who try his best to find the girls & track down who took them before its to late.The director Denis Villeneuve does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even though some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative, this film is not for the faint of heart as some scene of torture may be disturbing for some viewer but this is a worth watching film that will shock you & bring you to tears in emotional moments as its a pretty shocking film.This may not be a film for everyone which also depend on your taste of film's but this is for me one of Hugh Jackman best performance to date & a film you must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Solid thriller with an engaging moral dilemma.,"As with many foreign language directors who impress the world with a film from their native land, they then move on to work in Hollywood. Success is no guarantee but it's at least a mainstream opportunity. I haven't seen Denis Villeneuve's Incendies just yet, though it's definitely on my list, but it must have been really good to grant him not only one film but two, with this years Prisoners and next years Enemy, both starring Jake Gyllenhaal. On that note, Zodiac comparisons are the first to come to mind. Not only is it a dreary world, reliably shot by Roger Deakins, but they share similar pace and structure in its very procedural method of plot delivery. Unfortunately, and again similarly, the pace is too slow. Everything it does could have been squeezed into two hours rather than two and a half. The problem is down to the editing. Its rhythm is constantly the same, feeling like it's always building and never paying off. Scenes cut away far too early and it then it jumps along the plot. Sure, I'm sure the consequences are implied, but there's the desperate need to see them. It's frustrating and impossible to feel immersed.Otherwise, I still like the plot and Hugh Jackman in particular is absolutely terrific. He's one of the most passionate actors around today and I wish he would get more high class material. Paul Dano is thoroughly great in a complex role and Viola Davis' big scene is heartbreaking. However, it's Gyllenhaal who lets the film down. Perhaps it's in the writing, but he fails to bring a human character to the table. His Detective Loki is a poor attempt at developing a three- dimensional character. He's full of contradictions. The cop who goes by his heart, by the book, by his gut. Best cop, worst cop. People person, loner. Usually contradictions bring out true character, but his lack of characterisation and conviction results in a terribly inconsistent performance. It's a shame, especially as he's getting a lot of acclaim, but I'm certainly less excited for Enemy now. He's not the only bad one of the bunch as Melissa Leo is having too much fun to be convincing. Prisoners is still a good film with a compelling moral dilemma behind it in how far a person will go for justice, that aspect is emotionally engaging. But its muddied waters doesn't help that come through.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A masterful thriller that is both tense and unnerving, one of the best of 2013","One of the best pieces of dramatic cinema I've seen in a long time, Prisoners is a film that will live on long after the credits roll.The term 'masterpiece' is thrown around with films too liberally, and yet, I use it so rarely that I can't recall the last time I used the word masterpiece to describe a film I watched. Prisoners is a masterpiece.After a jovial holiday feast among neighbors and friends, two families must face certain heartbreak when the two youngest daughters from each home mysteriously go missing. Keller Dover and Franklin Birch, the fathers of each girl, know the fate for missing children and the importance of time in these cases. Frustrated by stagnant police work burdened by red tape and multiple leads, they take matters into their own hands, especially Keller Dover as he grapples with crossing every moralistic line for the sake of his family and child.Prisoners is a dark film, both of subject matter and tone, so much so that I nearly did not watch the film and that would have been a grave misfortune. The mystery of Prisoners is vastly superior to its peers, leaving hints and evidence for the film to come with such sleight of hand that it is only apparent with a second viewing. For a mystery it manages to find the perfect balance of dark and brooding, complementary to the tone of the film, but is completely visually watchable.The passion and connection of these characters is complex, vital to engaging the audience and making them hope, fear, and feel with the characters. Especially notable is Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Paul Dano who bring depth to potentially one-dimensional characters and emit a humanity that can be found in traces in all of us.While the cast is raw, emotional and magical , the assemblage of talent would be for naught had it not been for the director Denis Villeneuve, writer Aaron Guzikowski and cinematographer Roger Deakins. The work of these three men so seamlessly blends into this fine film that it is difficult to discern where one's efforts ends and the others begins.Prisoners is a master stroke and bold statement for the future drama films that incorporate true crime and mystery.Please check out our website for full reviews of recent releases.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Outstanding!,"I did expect much, but this topped all of my expectations regarding this movie!It's made like an old-school thriller you know from the late 80th to early 2000 - only a very few special effect but a great, complex and logic story.I love the way this movie is made. Not just that the camera is always very well placed, but the dialogs, the actions taken and the personalities of the characters are very realistic.Even if the plot is an of the more ""common"" ones, the making of the movie gives it something almost unique. The suspense is lasting till the last minute and often you have for yourself to think about moral decisions and a character that you liked in the beginning may become unfriendly to you as the movies goes on.One of the best part of the movie is the very last scene - it's so well done that I had to give it a 10/10 rating, even if I have to admit that I enjoyed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a liiiitle bit much more.Thanks for that great movie that proves that they are still good directors out there making good movies and not things like X MEN number 10000000.GREAT WORK!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Well worth seeing,"I went to see a movie last weekend—""Prisoners."" It was a good product. At 153 minutes it seemed a little long. But I didn't fall asleep. On a scale of one to one hundred, I would score it an 85. That is a pretty good number from me, so I must have liked it. It is much easier for me to point out what I didn't like, than what I did.  I think Hugh Jackman did a good job, but his character (Keller Dover) was a little over the top. I'm not sure how that happened, but I suspect the director, Denis Villeneuve, might have been responsible. Subtract five points.  Unfortunately the film followed the same slothful path as do so many lesser movies— blame conservative Christianity. Subtract five points for laziness and cowardice.  We are led to believe that the character Franklin Birch (played by Terrence Howard) would not be held accountable for the kidnapping and repeated beatings (which led to his death) of character Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano). The charge is felony murder, and he would be prosecuted. Subtract three points.  My popcorn had too much butter. Subtract one point. Everything else about the move was great. I left the theater with a good feeling. I would recommend that ""Prisoners"" and Sean Penn's ""The Pledge"" (Jack Nicolson, Benicio Del Toro, Patricia Clarkson and Beau Daniels) be bundled. The similarities are striking. I gave ""The Pledge"" a strong ninety-nine when I saw it in 2001. Both films are on my top 100 list of contemporary movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A sombre and slow, but excellent piece of work","Some films create a brilliant sense of atmosphere. 'Prisoners' is one of those films. From the moment it opens, we are greeted with an ice cold atmosphere that continues until the end, reflecting the chilly weather that pervades through the suburban Pennsylvania setting. Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography really helps in crafting this atmosphere, as like the film, it moves at a slow and often languorous pace, occasionally honing in on things that don't necessarily move the plot forward, but add to the mood. Coupled with the superb score by Jóhann Jóhannsson, a feeling of dread is created from the beginning, lingering over ever frame right up until the credits roll.This dark and chilly atmosphere suits the plot of 'Prisoners' perfectly. During a Thanksgiving gathering involving two families, each one's youngest daughter mysteriously vanishes, nowhere to seen, leaving fathers Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and God-fearing, American survivalist Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) deeply concerned over the fate of their kids. Loner Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes on the case and soon arrests Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a guy ""with the IQ of 10 year- old"", but struggles to find any evidence against him. However, it's not long before a furious Keller takes matters into his own hands.Jackman has always been a good actor, despite sometimes being considered to be just a 'movie star', and with this film he gives what is very possibly his best performance to date. He's a magnetic force whenever on screen and is perfectly credible as a devastated father. Another person who is entirely credible in their role is Gyllenhaal. It may be as a result of starring in David Ayer's excellent 'End of Watch', but Gyllenhaal is terrific as Detective Loki, offering a great contrast to the fiery Jackman. He even goes so far as adding an actor's tick, as Loki frequently blinks, signalling his stress and anxiety. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are rounded off by a good supporting cast of Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Paul Dano at his creepiest.At 153 minutes, you could argue that 'Prisoners' is overlong, but its length was one of the best things about it for me, as I became absorbed in the drama. This is a slow film with slow passages; it definitely takes its time getting places, but with such a great sense of atmosphere, length is hardly an issue. This is more than simply a 'kidnap movie' as director Denis Villeneuve attempts to make a serious point about kidnapping, questioning the value of information obtained under duress and the idea of doing things with the right intentions even if it's against the law. Similarly, the characters exist in an area of gray morality, as evidenced by the fact that I sympathized with Keller and Alex. Sure, it's not perfect – the end twist feels somewhat generic, consequently jarring with the non-generic approach to the rest of the film. Nonetheless, this is a grimly-atmospheric, well-acted and excellently structured piece of work that has something intelligent to say to say about its subject matter.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Immersive, emotional and tense, a Thriller as it should be","Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have teamed with relatively unknown director Denis Villeneuve to bring one of the greatest Thrillers of 2013. ""Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst,"" is a line Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) lives his life by. But when the unimaginable happens, and his daughter and her friend are kidnapped, Keller takes matters into his own hands when the police seem unable to act.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) has solved every case he's ever been assigned. He and Keller are after the same goal, to see the girls home alive, but their methods differ; one of composure, one of desperation.Now, onto discussing the brilliance of this film. For me, it really comes down to three factors: the story, the acting, and the fantastic moments of tension. Essentially, these are the elements that every film of the Thriller genre will strive to perfect, and Prisoners hits the nail on the head for all three.Boasting a run time of over two and half hours, Prisoners has a lot of story to tell. Long films aren't always a good thing, when you stretch a film to that length of time it typically starts to stagger at some point. But with Prisoners, it worked. It wasn't slow, but neither did it feel rushed, the Director told the story he wanted to tell in what felt like its entirety. The story also managed to remain intriguing without throwing twists and turns and revelations into the script every few minutes, and this is partly due to the fantastic characters and their relationships with one another.However, it doesn't matter how great a script is, especially in the Thriller genre, if you haven't got the actors to deliver the material. Jake Gyllenhaal is an immensely versatile actor, and he fits into the role of Detective Loki beautifully. Even for such a recognisable face, I didn't see Mr Gyllenhaal on screen in front of me, I only saw Detective Loki, doing everything in his power to find the missing girls. Hugh Jackman, in addition, performed genuine Academy Award winning acting for this performance. When Keller filled with sorrow, I had a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. When Keller filled with fury, my fists and jaw clenched. When Keller collapsed in grief, I slumped in my chair. To call his performance gripping would be a mammoth understatement.Finally, the tension. A trademark of the genre, if you can make your audience's hearts pound in their chests at the right moment, you're on your way to a winning product. Prisoner's has an excellent amount of tension, and by that I don't mean a wealth of it. A balance has to be struck to keep the audience gripped, but to make them really appreciate the tension when it comes by not over-doing it. Prisoners did it so well, I was literally sat on the edge of my seat in one of the closing scenes, and had my heart pounding on a number of occasions. I will be shocked of this film does not attain the prestige it deserves. If you are a fan of the Thriller genre, I really cannot recommend this film enough. Make sure to take your partner or your friends with you, because you're going to want to discuss this masterpiece at length when the credits start to roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the best thrillers of recent memory,"Prisoners tells the story of a family broken by the kidnapping of their small daughter along with one of her friends. Unsatisfied with the police actions in the case, the father tries to take matters into his own hands.This is a very tense movie. We follow Keller Dover as he desperately tries to find the truth about what happened to his daughter. Right in the beginning we get a feel that this is a man that does what he needs and doesn't like depending on others, even the government.On the other side, we have Det. Loki, a cop with his own personal problems that is assigned to this case. We see he is actually trying to get things done. I guess it felt nice seeing an investigator that is actually human for a change, and not a Super Deduction Machine. I love Sherlock Holmes as much as the next guy, but sometimes is nice to see a regular one, specially since this is an overused trope. Not that he is stupid or anything, he just feels more real in the way he follows clues and draws his conclusions.Hugh Jackman is in full shape, showing the evolution of his characters desperation as he sees, powerless, his family falling apart. When he decides to act in a certain way, we may not agree with it, or even think he may be making a mistake, but we never doubt his motivations, and his choices feel authentic. Jake Gyllenhaal also does a great job as the detective trying to find the truth, and so we get a nice back and forth between these two characters, as in who should we trust, who should we root for?All of this is sewed together by a great story. Mystery permeates the movie and the developments are made in a way that make you never completely sure about what the truth really is. Thus, even if this movie has a slow pace, with beautiful and calm cinematography, not packed with explosions, you still feel at the edge of your seat.The script here is flawless both as a suspense and a crime story. When you get to the end you feel it in your guts. This is not a movie you will soon forget.A great experience. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Grim, gripping, great performances.  Not a masterpiece.","Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay for 'Prisoners' was near the top of the list of best unmade for quite some time; at one point Hugh Jackman was attached to the project, but dropped out for reasons that remain unclear, though scheduling conflict may not be quite as pertinent as a lack of artistic cohesion with the original director. As serendipity would have it, the much later arrival of Denis Villeneuve as director, to his first English language feature, drew a mega cast of great talent, both in front of and behind the camera, including Jackman again. This is presumably based on the acknowledgement of his previous Award-nominated work. With Villeneuve on board, the screenplay seemed destined to become so much more than your average abduction thriller; to a great extent this fact is both the strength, and arguably the weakness of the final product.The straightforward setup is of two quite different but friendly families whose daughters go missing after Thanksgiving dinner. When the detective assigned to the case apprehends a suspect and finds no evidence of any crime with which to charge him, he has no choice but to release him. The subsequent act of the film follows the predictable route of a father taking the law into his own hands, and raises important questions about the morality and effectiveness of torture, the dangers of all actions and judgements, right or wrong, being governed by instinct and not logic, and the most obvious: What would you do, and where would YOU draw the line? The final act reaches a little too hard for a ""Gotcha!"" finale, which may disappoint those who did not want to see it become a more generic thriller, but it does not undermine the movie too badly.'Prisoners' is beautifully shot by the man responsible for some of the best looking films you can name, Roger Deakins. Much as with the late Conrad L. Hall, you can sense that every shot took forever to setup, but the result always justifies that time. With a constantly gritty, doom-laden tone, one really cannot help but keep thinking of David Fincher; with the inclusion of Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki, it is near impossible not to recall 'Zodiac'. There has been much made of Hugh Jackman's powerhouse performance as the angry Keller Dover, and there is no doubt his intensity is spot-on, but for me, Gyllenhaal actually quietly steals the show with a perfectly-pitched performance as a dog-tired, stressed detective who can feel his grip on the case gradually slipping; I don't think he has been better.The film is paced with a deliberately painful slowness; its moments of tension and excitement are highlighted as quite so intense by virtue of their brevity. This is a story of depth, with a lot to digest and discuss on every level. The thoughtful watcher will, upon reflection, come to realise nothing in the film is irrelevant; as Detective Loki himself says, ""Everything matters."" The twists and turns in the final act build on the idea at the heart of the film, with the title growing increasingly relevant; this encourages deeper thought than your more average thriller. Something rather fascinating about the direction is that from quite early, a lot of the audience will already know HOW the film will end; it is HOW it gets there which might take most by surprise!'Prisoners' isn't a movie you enjoy so much as admire; incredibly artful, it is more a film of ideas and thinking points. It may be possible to pick little holes in the procedural elements, but it remains a challenging piece that will probably benefit from repeat viewing. Due to the fact everything ties up well, it is not as hole-riddled as a casual viewer may think, although that is not to say that, as it heads into more generic ""Fincher"" territory, it does not become a little too convoluted for its own good; certainly there is little doubt the film is at its strongest as the tense, slow examination of a controversial topic. Despite the contrivances, the fact that it is, at times, more heavy-handed than it need be, and that Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo are given frustratingly little to do, 'Prisoners' nevertheless remains a piece of work which demands attention and respect for the film making.It would certainly be unjust to say this isn't one of the films of the year, and I definitely sense an Oscar for the cinematography here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the years best with Oscar worthy performances,"For his English language debut French/Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (maker of the under-seen and highly recommended Incendies) has crafted a dread laden, beautifully made thriller that shows his now Hollywood counterparts a thing or to about how to create a white knuckle believable tale of crime, loss, love and how far parental instincts will go to protect those they love. Without a doubt Prisoners is one of this year's most fully formed, well-acted and involving movies.The tale Prisoners tells is one that deserves to be kept to a pre-knowledge minimal, all that needs to be known is Jackman's Keller will stop at nothing to find his missing daughter going as far to kidnap the man he believes knows about her whereabouts in the form of the ever great and creepy Paul Dano as mentally handicapped Alex. This particular action is counteracted with Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, a man who has never not solved a case and runs into increasingly scary and mysterious possibilities of what may have happened to the girls and who may have done it. The story written by Aaron Guzikowski is a tight and taut example of how to play out an investigation procedural movie and by the films end you feel well and truly like you yourself have endured as much as the characters themselves.Prisoners would not be half the story it is on final presentation without the absolutely top tier Oscar worthy work of its main players, with particular praise going to both Jackman and Gyllenhaal who perhaps arguably give career best turns here. Never before on screen has Jackman seemed so dangerous and volatile (yes even more so than his famed mutant) and Gyllenhaal aces his role as Loki, a loner with clear OCD mannerisms but a detective you would want working on your case. Other aspects that make Prisoners such a pleasure is Villeneuve's stout direction, Johaan Johannsson's hauntingly constructed and well used score and I was wondering why the film was just so darn beautiful when it shouldn't of been then I read during the credits cinematography great Roger Deakins was at the helm therefore giving Prisoners an aesthetic that is again one of the year's best.With so many films this year disappointing and missing the mark ever so slightly it's a breath of fresh air to witness a film as complete as Prisoners is. While not an enjoyable experience perse due to its unquestionable bleak tone and subject matter it is a must see movie event and (in my opinion the following is high praise indeed) – the best movie of its type since Zodiac, a film it mirrors in many ways and a film in which it can sit proudly equal to.4 and a half red whistles out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I'm a Prisoner to This Movie,"When two family's daughters go missing on a Thanksgiving party and with the help of the police search to find them. Starring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard and Viola Davis Prisoners is a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat.Prisoners really shows why good cinematography can be the difference in a movie hitting or missing and this is a testament to Roger Deakin's skill behind the camera. Which even though we sit through two and half hours the audience rarely feels bored and is always begging for more clues to eventually solve the case. This is also one of those films where there is no villain throughout we see everyone become the bad guy, become the helpless maniac that will stop at nothing to get whatever they want. Throughout you will uncover what really a prisoner means. If you thought Wolverine wasn't angry and ruthless enough in the X-Men films that should be all dispelled as you see the struggle of Jackman (Keller Dover) as he desperately searches to find his daughter.The only thing I would've wanted to see more was of the other characters and how they dealt with the loss of the two children but otherwise the audience couldn't stop but feel challenged by the story displayed. Prisoners is not for the faint hearted though as your morals will seriously be challenged and you may feel guilty inside.

Just shy of brilliant.,"You may think this film is your typical Tinseltown thriller - thanks to its impressive A-list cast - but don't be fooled; this is a dark, unrelenting tale that cares more about posing moral questions within its murky world than it does about providing narrative twists and turns. Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay delivers grim by the barrel-load, but also intelligence and maturity, whilst Denis Villeneuve's direction is haunting and suggestive without being manipulative or overwrought. Hugh Jackman is front and centre as Keller Dover, the distraught father who will do anything to find his abducted daughter, and he's given credible support by Maria Bello, Terrence Howard and Voila Davis, although it's Jake Gyllenhaal as the loner cop in charge of the disturbing case who is the standout. So far so good, yet there's one major drawback that stops this gritty affair being brilliant: its length. At two and a half hours long, a large chunk of its power is lost with a bloated middle act that should've had 30 minutes shaved off in the editing suite.

"White-hot tension, incredible directing, flawless performances, Prisoners is incredible","Prisoners stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and a lot of other amazingly talented actors, it is directed by Dennis Villeneuve and it's an incredible nail-biting thriller, and probably one of the best film of 2013. Too bad it didn't get recognized as much as it deserved.The film starts at a Thanksgiving dinner between friends Keller Dover(spectacularly portrayed by Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard, great job as well) and their respective families. They each have 2 children, the youngest of which are mysteriously kidnapped when they go play outside. Both families call the authorities of course and desperately search for their children, Keller's older son mentions an RV who was parked in the street the first time the kids went to play. The police find the man, who is Alex Jones(Paul Dano), a person with the mentality of a 10-year-old. He is interrogated by Detective Loki (brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant) who begins to think he had nothing to do with the abduction. Keller on the other hand is sure that Alex knows where the kids are, and decides to take matters in his own hands, and ends up doing lots of illegal, horrible and cruel things.The acting in the movie is perfect, no one in the entire movie portrays their character badly, they were really all amazing, with extra extra props to Hugh Jackman, who gives a phenomenal performance, the best I've ever seen from him, he starts off as a good man, but when his daughter is kidnapped he just loses it and descends into darkness so to speak. An ironic thing in the movie (it's on purpose of course) is that he is a very religious man, and when the credits roll he has committed so many sins it's mind-blowing that a guy could go so far, even with the good reason behind his actions. There are some scenes that Jackman just flips his s***, and it's so damn realistic! Oscar worthy is an understatement. Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible in the movie as well, I mean this guy is always brilliant, come on, he also feels so real in the movie, you feel his frustration due to not being able to find the kids, he is pretty much what I expect a real detective to be like and he's the only moral character in the movie. The supporting cast is also great, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, especially Paul Dano, he was incredible.The story is very smart, it's pretty much a puzzle, you don't know what is the truth, you can only speculate using what you were given, it deals with heavy subjects though, so it is not for the faint of heart at all. The director managed to create a incredible dread- filled atmosphere, using the heavy rain and the icy winter, it all contributes to creating the sinister mood of the film, top-notch directing and cinematography. The suspense just keeps piling up until the finale, which is one of the best endings I've seen.The film's question is ""how far are you willing to go in order to save your child?"", and that's what Dover is doing, and holy nuts does he go far. He does have a good reason, it's true of course, but he ends up doing things that are too unjustifiable, even with the events that drove him to do them. And that makes for a great picture.Prisoners is a very intense film, I found it pretty hard to watch, especially in the heavy scenes, if you're easily shaken, don't watch this film, it's incredible, but it's the kind of film that's despite being great, you don't want to watch again, I mean I was cringing a bit with clenched fists while I watched it, on the edge of my seat of course. It is very intriguing and smart, if you can stomach it, I recommend this movie for sure, it is flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?Canadian director Denis Villeneuve had been making films for years, but probably achieved his biggest success with ""Incendies"" (2010), getting recognized by the Academy for a foreign film. This was his followup, a much more commercial venture, and probably even more widely seen. Somehow, despite the great performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Jackman, the only nomination it got was for Roger Deakins' cinematography (which is a given -- as of 2015, he has had 12 nominations).Christopher Orr wrote, ""Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore."" He does raise a good point, however, about the thin line. The violence is intense, and understandably earned the film an NC-17. But is it justified to show this level of violence in order to explain the characters? Perhaps.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""Prisoners"" will captivate any parent and thrill any audience.","This may sound obvious or trite, but it truly is a parent's worst nightmare: Your child just disappears, suddenly and without a trace. That's the scenario in the crime drama/thriller ""Prisoners"" (R, 2:33).When the young daughters of two neighbors go out to play after their families share Thanksgiving dinner together and then no one can find the girls, the panic is immediate and gut-wrenching. The helplessness of these two sets of parents (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch) is compounded when the police release a person of interest named Alex Jones (played brilliantly by Paul Dano) for lack of evidence. Despite the fact that Alex has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, Keller is convinced that Alex knows something. He takes matters into his own hands and goes much farther than even the most devoted of parents could imagine. Keller is willing to do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to extract the information he needs to find these two little girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is doing what he can to solve the case, and even seems willing to go a little outside the law to do it, but keeps coming up empty.The tension gradually but steadily builds as these parents know that time is running out for their missing children. Clues in the case are scant and hints as to where this story is going are there on the screen, but seem too trivial to matter – until they do. The plot twists and ultimate reveals are shocking, but the film's real power is in the questions it forces us to ask – and keep asking after the film is over. The script is smart enough to provide us sufficient closure to justify the emotional investment we've made in this story, but still leaves it open-ended enough to give us something to think about after the credits roll. The unusually long run time may make you feel like a prisoner, but the complex, well-directed and very well-acted story (mostly) justifies the film's length.

Astonishingly awful,"I figured out the most of the plot after the first 45 minutes of this painfully slow moving painfully wannabe suspense movie. 'Prisoners' is self-indulgent mind-numbing fare. It parodies the film noire genre without intending it.The audience is treated as a fool, and the director apparently gets away with it--if the praise showered on this con-job of a movie on IMDb is a reliable indicator. Hugh Jackman out of the Wolverine character is what the audience wanted to see in this film, and he tries hard but he totally wasted in this 2-1/2 overstretched and subdued melodrama.Watching Andy Warhol's slow motion movies at a further half speed would be more entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Bleak Cases,"The title of the film, ""Prisoners"", is the first mystery you will need to figure out. It's puzzling because it is technically not set in a prison nor the main characters are actually prisoners. The best thing to presume is it's a metaphorical term that might refer to the characters' imprisonment to the bleakness of their situation. The film has an intriguing idea for a verisimilitude, but the only thing that breaks that conceit is the twist in the end. However, it's still quite the experience for being a brilliantly made and terribly gripping crime drama.The investigation is scattered with MacGuffins all over the place, assuming that the film asks the audience to think hard through the mystery as well, but the real idea of the story is how a kidnapping situation may also affect to the lives of the people related to the victims, especially to the one who are desperately worried about them. How this crime can change their humanity, like the father who forces himself to commit bad things just to get them back. The whole message is obvious, but it's no denying how fascinating to study these people by their actions. One is an ugly revenge, while the other is a deliberated case that gives a lot of pressure to the detective. It's extremely gripping, but when it hits to the revelation, it somehow loses a bit of the plot's credibility. It might be for consequential reasons, but it would have been more interesting if it was less conventional.It's pretty wise to include the parts when the characters are allowed to take time to breathe, if only those parts were a little less broad in their expressions of being mad, but they get quite effective. The performances are amazing enough. Hugh Jackman might be overdoing some of the father's rage, but his greatest feat overpowers the performance. Jake Gyllenhaal, I'm saying this once again, steals the show. His acting career is recently getting better and better. Here, Detective Loki is a character that you should be rooting for throughout the film, and Gyllenhaal justifies it. The direction is artful and weighs every scene of drama, action, and suspense. While the cinematography sharply displays how bleak these lives are.Despite some of its misstep, Prisoners is an outstanding cinema; it's magnificent in direction, fantastic in acting, stunning in cinematography, and best at pacing. Of course, it never forgets to depict how a terrible crime could cause other people. Not only the victims and the suspects are in trouble here. The result of this can be love ones raging in terror, ugly vigilantism, hard time for the law, and more consequences. This is a strong subject that deserves a lot of complexity. It still includes some exasperation near the end, but aside the conclusion, Prisoners is wholly satisfying anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I didn't spoil anything so you can enjoy Prisoners without any big clues about scenario. Why 9 stars instead of 10? I can't tell, that'd be a spoiler. Also I liked the tension I had watching this movie. It wasn't very strong, but strong enough to keep watching the movie.

2013 Finally Gets it Right!,"Prisoners features and handles the greatest ensemble cast of 2013 (so far.) Hugh Jackman gives what might be his greatest performance, and Jake Gyllenhaal turns in the best performance of the film, playing the films most important and interesting character. Prisoners is thought-provoking and really makes people question their moral boundaries. How far would you go realistically? But what drove Prisoners home, was its honesty. It refused to go the easy route also known as Hollywood. The first half is a slow and steady build-up that adds the realism of the situation. The second half is mystery heavy and unbelievably interesting. A film has not been this involving in a long time, especially with the mystery genre. Denis Villeneuve completely breaks- out and is for sure a director to keep an eye on. Also the most beautiful cinematography of the year. (Gravity had great cinematography, but with Earth as a background a lot, it is almost unfair) It is my favorite cinematography because Roger Deakins was able to use such simple and plain locations and used them perfectly, composing impeccable imagery. Prisoners also highly deserves a best original screenplay nomination as well as other things. The score set the tone and was darkly fascinating.

one can not safely navigate a clear encounter with horror,"the film is sinister cold due to the film noir quality, winter and snow. Prisoners skillfully mixes suspense thriller and human drama, and beautifully exploits its characters, played by talented actors capable of extending and enhancing the dark atmosphere set by the pictures and narrative; darkness that invades the screen to embody a looming, terrifying evil. The film takes its time to develop the characters and display different but equally intense counterpoints. There are times when the plot seems too complex and one fears that the complication are resolved simplistically, as with many suspense films, but the excellent screenplay manages to solve with intelligence and intrigue. it's a contemplatively paced descent into hell, suggesting that one can not safely navigate a clear encounter with horror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An intense thriller that will keep you guessing.,"Prisoners is the rare mainstream rated R mystery film that we hardly get from Hollywood anymore. It features an All-Star cast led by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Prisoners is an intense thriller that keeps the viewer guessing and never feels contrived.Prisoners is directed by relative newcomer Denis Villeneuve who handles the star-studded cast and the heavy subject matter like a director who has a lengthy filmography of well-crafted films. The film is well paced and expertly structured. Although Prisoners is two and a half hours long, it never seems to lag. Villeneuve elevates the story and characters so it doesn't feel like an episode of one of the many ""whodunnit"" TV shows that pollute our airwaves.Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a blue collar survivalist who has been preparing his entire life for the worst. When his daughter is kidnapped, it's something he could never have prepared for and he doesn't know how to deal with it. Feeling like he's let his family down and that the police aren't doing enough to find his daughter, Keller takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps the recently released suspect who he is certain knows more about what happened to his daughter and her friend who was also kidnapped.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki, a passionate investigator who has solved every case he's ever worked on. Detective Loki's past is never explained, but he sports neck and hand tattoos hinting that he might have had a turbulent past. Loki also has a nervous twitch of the eyes that gets worse as the film progresses and the pressure begins to mount.It's understandable considering Detective Loki has to deal with an indifferent police captain, a grieving father who has gone rogue and a mysterious case that seems to get weirder with each clue.The rest of the cast is rounded out by Maria Bello, who plays Dover's wife. She's not given a whole lot to do here and spends much of the film in a state of sedation. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis play friends of the Dover's whose daughter was also kidnapped. They play the moral conscience to Keller as he starts going to extremes to get information about the whereabouts of the lost girls.Paul Dano, who is making a career of playing creepy crazy characters, plays Alex Jones, a mentally handicapped loner that is suspected of kidnapping the young girls. He plays the character with perfect balance. One second you want to bash his head in and the next you feel bad for him and can't help but feel he's being wrongly accused.Prisoners deals with the theme of religion very heavily. Characters are seen saying the Our Father and crucifixes can be seen dangling from rear view mirrors or hanging on walls. There are also themes of vengeance, resolution, justice.The other part of the film that stands out is the cinematography by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins who has been nominated for 10 Oscars for films such as Skyfall, Shawshank Redemption, True Grit, Doubt, No Country for Old Men and A Beautiful Mind just to name a few. Deakins cloaks the film in a blanket of gloom. Every scene seems to be cloudy and rainy. Every frame is saturated with looming despair.After a summer of caped crusaders, furious cars, Brad Pitt hating zombies, giant robots and really lonely rangers, Prisoners is perfect for anybody looking for a serious film experience. Prisoners delivers an intense thriller that includes great performances from some of the better actors working today. Including a career best performance for Jackman with a possible Oscar nomination on the horizon. For me, Prisoners is up there with recent mystery films like Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone and Zodiac.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I would not mind if this movie lasted 5 hours (about a double as it does), revealing more details, but the director decided to leave the viewer some dots to connect. Everything else in this movie is just right. There are people in Hollywood who can still make almost perfect movies out of a very good (although rather simple) story, while not spending hundreds of millions for sfx and stuff. Leaves you with much to think about. And a delightful good movie lover experience. Go for this one. Youl'll thank me later for encouraging you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Riveting, but misdirection of clues is the  reason","The daughters of the Dovers and the Birches go missing after a Thanksgiving Day Dinner. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) fears the police have to release Alex (Paul Dano) for lack of evidence but something Alex said to Keller leads Keller to believe Alex knows about the abduction and may have had a hand in it. He is livid. The Police are not convinced. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) vows to find the girls.Loki? That name reminds me of the Norse God, Loki. Why use that name in here; and while we are at it the name Keller Dover doesn't exactly roll off the lips. Okay, it's out of my system.This is a good movie and it's 2 ½ hours long. Why so long? You will discover why when you are finished with the movie and you look back and then understand that many of the clues were a misdirection and had nothing to do with solving the case. Of course, there are good clues too, but you will decide which ones were good or bad after you walk away from this. I cannot tell you which ones were entirely used to confuse the audience. That would be telling. But, in the meantime, you are riveted to your seat because you also are trying to figure out who kidnapped the girls and where they are either dead or alive.There is some torture in here when Keller Dover kidnaps Alex because Keller is convinced Alex knows all. Keller Dover is driven and this comes out easily by Jackman as he is good at this. Detective Loki - that name again – (thought it was out of your system) goes about his business in a methodical/logical way tracking down clues as they arise. We keep waiting for that look Gyllenhaal gives when he puts a puzzle together. You know that look: his eyes widen really wide. We wait, and wait, and wait.The supporting cast of Viola Davis as Nancy Birch, Terrance Howard as Franklin Berch, Maria Bello as Grace Dover do credible jobs. Of course, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give outstanding performances. That's to be expected. Kudos.A shout-out must go to the make-up person who worked on Paul Dano as Alex showing the results of torture. Really scary. We cringed and felt the pain just looking at him. Good job.Again, this is still a good movie and you are ready to give it an ""A"" rating until you realize you were also kidnapped and held prisoner for 2 ½ hours all because of a magician's - now a director's - trick of misdirection.

Prisoners - one of the best of 2013,"Prisoners' was a definite surprise hit. I have always enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal's performances (Donnie Darko, The Source Code), and always respected his ability to act, alongside Hugh Jackman's excellent performance as a father who will do anything to bring back his child. I walked into 'Prisoners' with no expectations; in fact I barely knew what the movie was about. I read somewhere it was a 'Taken' clone, but that is a huge disservice to the direction, screen writing and most importantly the cinematography shown in the film. The film was so incredibly moody, falling into a similar category as 'Se7en' and 'Silence of the Lambs'. One or two scenes overstayed their welcome by a minute or so, and Jackman may be overacting to some, but I think he hit the nail on the head. Gyllenhaal also portrayed an incredibly weary and tired police officer, who becomes increasingly suspicious and twitchy as the film progresses. His performance carried the film, in my opinion. The basements were dusty and the X-Files-esque flashlights pierced the fog, while the snowy environment gave the film a cold, clinical feel. Roger Deakins has never deserved a reward for his cinematography more, and is one of my biggest inspirations in the field. The film is beautiful, while retaining a dark, sinister feel. Unfortunately, Gravity broke so many boundaries in the cinematographic field, and will likely receive more credit for 2013s cinematography. A shame, Deakins has shown his skill multiple times without any reward (outside of fame and money, obviously) in the academy and such, especially after 'Skyfall' in 2012. Outside of this, the film displays an excellent dissection of morality on a fundamental basis, and it left me thinking for a long time afterwards. The film is so pleasing to watch but oh so chilling and dark. I recommend this film to anyone, but not the faint of heart, it does get messy.Excerpt from 2013 - a year in review: www.perksandpeeves.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The best suspense/thriller film I've watched in years.,"Prisoners is a movie about a father's desperate search for his daughter, after she gets kidnapped by an unknown threat. Keller Dover(Hugh Jackman) & his family go to his friend Franklin Birch's(Terrence Howard) house for Thanksgiving dinner. After a while, Dover & Birch's daughters, Anna(Erin Gerasimovich) & Joy(Kyla Drew Simmons) go outside to play. However, they never return. Dover assumes they're kidnapped & his son, Ralph(Dylan Minnette), tells him that there was an RV parked outside the house. The owner of this RV, Alex Jones(Paul Dano), is the primary suspect. A police officer named, Detective Loki(Jake Gyllenhaal), is given the job of finding & rescuing the girls. Thinking that the police will not get the job done, Keller Dover takes matters into his own hands & takes extreme steps to find the two girls.By the time this movie ended, I was speechless. Wow! What a movie! The suspense keeps the viewer engaged till the very last scene of the film. Throughout the film, I was on the edge of my seat, cause you really have no idea as to what's going to happen next. This movie is a roller-coaster ride of emotions, thrills & suspense. The violence may make some people squeamish but, most of it is suggested & it's not that graphic. The highlight of the film is the suspense. The script has been written so beautifully that, the viewer is left with questions even after the credits start rolling. The second highlight of the film is the performances. Hugh Jackman has given the best performance of his career as Keller Dover. Jackman's acting ability improves with each film. Jackman shows various emotions like, anger, fear, grief & repentance effortlessly. Jake Gyllenhaal is equally good as Detective Loki. His portrayal of Detective Loki is subtle & brilliant. Even though the detective may seem emotionally challenged, you can see that the pressure of the case is getting to him & this has been done by Gyllenhaal superbly. Viola Davis is great as Nancy Birch. Maria Bello is effective as Grace Dover. Terrence Howard is impressive as Franklin Birch. Melissa Leo is spectacular as Holly Jones. Last but not the least, Paul Dano is outstanding as Alex Jones. Dano does wonders with the small role that he is given. Dylan Minnette, Erin Gerasimovich & Kyla Drew Simmons are impressive as the kids, Ralph Dover, Anna Dover & Joy Birch. The supporting characters are adequate as well. Prisoners is a must watch.

Go see it! Go see it! Superb thriller.,"If you liked ""Mystic River"" or ""Gone Baby Gone"", GO SEE THIS FILM! It was one of the most intense, suspenseful, moving, frightening films I've ever seen (and I'm a 53 year old film buff.) ""Prisoners"" is not a horror story; not a murder-mystery; but a sort of ""kidnapped"" thriller genre. It's exquisitely told without modern-day-film tricks like shaky cameras; without an actor saying ""the F word"" in every other sentence; without a dub-step sound track; and without gratuitous frights or even unnecessary action or car chases. It's a story of a horrible kidnapping and those who are affected. It's told with such compassion and believability. The characters make excruciating choices --choices that make you shake your head in stunned wonder. And the cast! Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano! How much acting chops can one get on a movie set? And the screenplay is superb. I was on the EDGE OF MY SEAT for the entire film. I am simply blown away by this film --blown away. It's a 10 out of 10.Go see it on the big screen so you'll know why it's nominated for many awards in a few months.Congratulations to all involved in the making of ""Prisoners"" for a fine, classic film that will haunt your audience and make us very thoughtful for quite a while.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Chained Reaction,"To what extent can a man go to protect his loved ones? Is violence justified only because it will help bring them back from hand of the evil?'Prisoners' which released in India two weeks later than America is a must watch had anyone missed the chills and atmospherics of thriller classics such as 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac'. Its the story of a desperate father taking matters into his own hands after his daughter and her friend go missing and the police discharges the prime suspect in the case.Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film provides an introspection on our moral grounds at times when evil lurks around. Touching the themes of torture and violence, it is an engaging (at the same time - disturbing) drama. The contorted twist towards the end turns it into a thrilling mystery leaving us puzzled as looking for answers.Supported by a brilliant caste, the pace of the screenplay gets an uplift by their natural stance and the brilliance of their performance delivery. Hugh Jackman as the father and Jake Gyllenhaal as the frustrated lead investigator prove to be the perfect choice for the roles. Paul Dano as Alex Jones - the prime suspect plays his character so profoundly that we will hate and pity him at the same time. Stark photography by 10 times Oscar nominee Roger Deakins provides the atmospherics and the chills that completely draws us into the drama set in cold and bleak streets.With 'Rush' released the week before and 'Prisoners' matching up, maybe the Oscar season has already started.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Hugh Jackman is reborn in this suspense-riddled thriller.,"Prisoners, 2013.One of my pet hates is when people see or hear one bad review about a movie and automatically write it off without a second thought. It's amazing how ""Sheep-like"" we've all become in recent years. Most likely due to social media, where one person will post a status rubbishing a movie.Hugh Jackman (Keller Dover) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki) star in this epic drama/thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve. Set in Pennsylvania, Dover runs a small carpentry business and maintains a deeply religious life. The plot begins when 2 young girls are abducted from the family's Thanksgiving dinner, one of whom is Dover's girl. Gyllenhaal plays the hard-working local detective with the ""never say die"" attitude, full of late nights, no sleep, plenty of coffee and provides the ""won't stop until the case is solved"" feel, etc.I feel sorry for Hugh Jackman sometimes, mainly due to the fact that he cops criticism of his more theatre driven roles. If there was going to be a break-away film that separated Hugh from ""that guy with the beard in X-Men"" and ""The boy from OZ"", this was it. It's evident in the way that he acts in this new thriller that he had something to prove to the world as an actor. You could tell he was making up for not receiving roles like this in the past. Every actor will always say: ""I don't care what people think"", but we all know deep down that we all care to some degree. It's who we are.Like most thrillers, the story-line was very slow, drowning (although in a good way) and puzzling. Constantly making you think about different scenarios and suspects. Decent movie-goers would probably work this plot out in due time. The suspense grows throughout the film, accentuated with low light levels which bring on that sense of anticipation and depth. The overall dull/gloomy appearance of the film is a credit to its own storyline. Reminding us as viewers the dimness of the whole situation and how hard it would be to be in Dover's situation. Jackman gives a portrayal of what I think any parent would do to ensure their child returns home safely. The passion, anger and overall stress steams out of Dover in many scenes where his temper is taken to new levels of hate.I thought Paul Dano (Alex Jones) played an enormous role in the success of this film. His quirky features fit his role perfectly and at times he scared the crap out of me without any dialect at all. Given the intellectual capability of a 10 year old, Alex feels the full wrath of Dover's agony, and at times, madness. Gyllenhaal also makes his mark in a role which has been played out a thousand times previously. He turns a simple script into a meaningful progression of the calm and collective. He acts as Dover's rock and plays the detective part with ease, winning him the Best Supporting Actor award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Awards.The main reason I watched this film was due to my eagerness to view Jackman's transformation from his previous typical roles. He did not fail expectations and proved his worth. You are left contemplating and thinking until the final moment of the film and even after the credits have started rolling up the screen. Prisoners is a suspense- riddled thriller from start to finish and a must see for 2013.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Entertaining suspense,"A bit long. But intriguing. I just have so many unanswered questions though, that I wish somebody could answer for me. The main one being ""why""? If you see the film, you will know the reason I am asking that...too many loose ends... Jackman and Gyllenhall are good in this..as are Viola Davis, Terrance Howard, and Melissa Leo..though their roles are very small. At 2 /2 hours is does however keep you interested. The first few scenes are contrived..but then it ropes you in. The cinematography is gritty and grainy, and not a film for kids. It is pretty brutal in places but not gratuitous. This is a film worth seeing, with the tension of the film ""Ransom"" If you like movies that keep you guessing and wondering what happens next this is for you. The director seems to really know where to put the camera to make you feel like you are there. Gyllenhall gives a troubled performance worthy to see. Jackman at times seems wooden, and tries very hard to go to places to make you feel for him. Viola Davis is always good, and the few moments she has you feel for her as well. This film is worth going to and not waiting for the video to be released.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Best Movie of 2013?,"I watched this film with very low expectations: the trailer looked good enough but i was questioning whether it was worth spending over two hours of my time on, and i am so glad i did watch it in the end.The synopsis of this movie is in full in the trailer, but if you are still unsure from the trailer and reading other reviews, the main story is basically the investigation of the disappearance of two young girls from two different, but very close, families.This film is exactly what i have been looking for and i didn't even know it. This film has everything, it has tension and suspense, but also has action and is full of emotion.What makes this film so good is that i have never seen anything like it. It wasn't predictable at all, but it also wasn't so unpredictable that story line just became hard to follow and unrealistic. This film could have easily been based on a true story, which is why it was so engaging.The acting in this film was phenomenal, especially Hugh Jackman's performance, to the point where at times i forgot that this was just a film. Jake Gyllenhaal who adopted the role of the head detective was also fantastic, as was Paul Dano who portrayed the main suspect. There were only (roughly) 8 main characters; the four parents, the two children who disappeared, the detective, and the main suspect (Alex Jones) but not at any point did I feel there was a lack of detail and continuity. In fact, my only criticism would be that we barely saw the two mothers in the film in comparison to some other characters, but thats just me being picky.I would highly recommend this movie to anybody i know, unless you are not a fan of violence/gore/blood etc as it is fairly prominent throughout. This film is definitely worse watching, and as it is out on DVD tomorrow, i suggest you snatch a copy if you get the chance.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Easily my favourite film of 2013,"This film is my favourite film of 2013 simply because every single shot is perfect, as well as this the dialogue is tense and dramatic and the acting is brilliant. Before you watch this film you should know that it isn't an easy watch, it is probably the most realistic depiction of an abduction ever and at two and a half hours long it is not an easy watch, don't be expecting too sail through it like you might when watching the wolf of wall street, it is worth watching and savouring every second of. The characters are developed brilliantly and you feel a strong amount of empathy for pretty much all of the characters and have sympathy for the situation they are in. The film also has a very unapologetic tone, there is one aspect of the film which may even verge on disturbing but this only adds to the plot and character development. Have I mentioned already about how beautiful this film is, it feels like you are watching the work of someone who sat developing the set for each scene for days on end, the film also includes a one minute sequence which is one of the most beautiful set pieces ever, easily up there with the cola cabana steady cam in Goodfellas and the steady cam behind the trike in The Shining. To conclude I would easily rate this film 10/10, it is perfect in pretty much every way, Prisoners is incredible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
More than expected.,"I went to the cinema with absolutely no expectations about this movie and luckily, I found it to be quite entertaining.

"Uncompromising and powerful in its portrayal of moral ambiguity, Prisoner is an outstanding psychological thriller that dares to leave an impact","Children being abducted is every parent's worst nightmare. Facing such an unfavorable circumstance can be quite frightening, if not devastating. What kind of testament of a father seeking for justice against the evil doer who kidnaps his child can French-Candian director Denis Villenueve bring to this powerful whiplash of a psychological thriller? Prisoners is a movie that grabs the heart and dares not the let go while challenges viewers with moral complexities and one of the powerful jabs at ""what would you do"" circumstances. Uncompromising and packed with a brutal punch of suspense of psychological weight that is nearly impossible to resist, the film plays no game when testing the audiences' expectations and wringing out psychological elements to dare to think hard long after the end credits roll. One thing is sure, and that is Denis Villenueve shares no room for comfort or easy answers for the characters or the situation surrounding them. And that is only part of what makes this piece shine. Set during the Thanksgiving holidays, the film focuses on Keller Dover (played by Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (played by Mario Bello) who invite their friends Franklin (played by Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (played by Viola Davis) over for dinner. The families two young daughters Anna and Joy, both six-years-old, go outside to play. Before they know, the girls are nowhere to be found. Upon contacting the police, the families get help from Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) to search for them. Who the man ends up finding is Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano), a mentally impaired man who owns a RV the girls were climbing, and takes him into custody. Due to the lack of evidence from his mental disability, the police believe him to be innocent and let him go. Keller, however, is not buying it and decides to take matters into his own hands.This film pulls absolutely no punches when exhibiting Keller Dover's descent into vigilantism, and the moral ambiguity that almost immediately consumes him set a powerful, albeit unnerving groundwork for the testament of what extreme measures he is willing to take to get his beloved daughter back. With his eyes pinned on the only known suspect Alex Jones, Keller makes the questionable decision to take him to an abandoned house, tied him up, and tortures him in sporadic sequences that are horrifyingly realistic and difficult to watch. The psychological core rests in the questionable nature of his character to the point where you question whether we should be rooting for him or not. Even his friend Franklin is left uncomfortable by his actions. While it is not too hard to sympathize for a man who's dear flesh and blood has been taken from him, especially when the possibilities of the child's survival declines for each day he or she is not found, it is also hard to stand by his morally dubious actions. But Denis Villenueve knows how to keep things engaging at a solid cerebral level while narrowly confining away from the borders of grim exploitation. And that's including his visual method of storytelling in which is greatly assisted by cinematographer Roger Deakins who captures the simmering heat of the atmosphere with his nifty camera work. As for Hugh Jackman, his performance is definitely a home-run for an emotionally devastated thirsty for justice. Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is another great asset as well, pinning sheer humanity to a role that requires significant grit. Paul Dano, on the other hand, takes on a slightly easier role that requires very little dialogue for a character with a significantly low IQ, and his performance deserves a thumbs up.Prisoners is not always an easy watch, but that does take away from how powerful and uncompromising it is. It is an outstanding achievement by Denis Villenueve that deserves your attention, though perhaps not for those who are unwilling to take a journey through the dark pits of child abduction and vigilantism. Nonetheless, it is an engrossing experience that packs a punch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Compelling with Great Performances,"This was a really good movie. Very gripping. All of the performances are excellent and it will engage you from the start to the finish. From the beginning everything is very downplayed. Very real. I'm trying to recall if there were any weak performances - but there weren't. The camera work and direction are first class. There is one shot in which the camera just focuses on a tree which was exceptional. Yeah, just a tree. But it conveys great mood and atmosphere. The ending will leave you satisfied. This is certainly not your typical Hollywood fare - thus the high scores on IMDb. Both the dad and the detective are outstanding.

Prisoners or how to feel a real desperation,"What such an impressive and emotional movie. Everything in the film is completely outstanding. We can start with the casting of actors in which the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is marvelous and finishing with an extraordinary Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, father of one of the kidnapped girls. I feel that I'm in debt with this character because it is one of the best acting I've ever seen on the big screen. His desperation for finding his daughter is so real that you will feel the tension during the whole film. According to what I've read Hugh Jackman even spent several nights without sleeping in order to make that impression during the shooting of the film. On the other hand, the plot cannot be more interesting and intriguing so you will see yourself trying to figure out who is the responsible of the disappearance of the little girls. Despite kidnapping of kids in Hollywood movies are pretty common, the production and direction of Prisoners is completely different. I don't usually give points easily on this website but I will do an exception with this one because I ended up totally impressed and open-mouthed. I gave nine points without any kind of hesitation. I'm looking forward to watching the next part of Prisoners because the ending of the film lead to believe that there will be a second part. I strongly recommend you to watch it.

"Excellent, Under-appreciated Film Scores Big Points","If one needed proof that the Oscars too often ignore excellent films and terrific performances, this is it. A cautionary tale of the road rage-age we live in, this story about parents' worst nightmare of having their children suddenly disappear has its feet firmly rooted in reality while taking some breathtaking twists and turns, never melodramatic. Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski know their beans when it comes to understanding what make our well-meaning but sometimes very sick society tick. The cast is deep and talented. Hugh Jackman's frantic father adds yet another dimension to the seemingly endless capabilities of this actor. Maria Bello, Viola Davis and Terence Howard as the other parents involved in the developing tragedy are contained, believable and never anything but excellent. Jake Gyllenhaal's typically realistic, understated turn as the skeptical cop is perfect counterpoint.

Intense drama-thriller with powerhouse performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaall,"This is a 2 and a half hour movie that takes the viewer on an intense viewing experience. Jackman shines in his role of a father who has had his daughter abducted. Gyllenhaall plays a more subdued hotshot detective, and also delivers a very strong performance. It would have been nice to find out more about his character since he doesn't fit the typical mould of a detective with the neck tattoos and tattoos on his fingers. However, that would have detracted the focus of the movie. The constantly rainy and overcast weather also gave it a very depressing atmosphere that worked well with the nature of the plot. Melissa Leo and Paul Dano both impressed in their supporting roles. The use of some camera shots was very memorable with the way the framing. The framing of Paul Dano's character's eye in the shower stands out in terms of framing. The only thing that prevents me from giving this movie a higher score was the script was not as powerful as the directing and acting. In retrospect, I can recall shots and scenes that stand out but not any specific lines.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Captivating, dark, dramatic and visually poetic, 'Prisoners' is a consummate thriller","A two-headed thriller, ""Prisoners"" is one part conventional kidnapping mystery and one part psychological drama. While the mystery of who abducted two little girls haunts the entirety of the 153-minute runtime and will keep audiences glued for every minute, the film also serves as a portrait of a desperate parent willing to cross any line to get his daughter back.Those who crave the classic dark and gritty ""whodunit"" and also enjoy some dramatic heft and effective gravitas will find ""Prisoners"" an enormous gift. Exhibiting consummate filmmaking and storytelling from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, this is a true thriller that doesn't try and pull too many tricks.Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and their two kids are celebrating the Thanksgiving holiday at their neighbors' — the Birches (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) — house. At the end of the evening, the families realizes their two little girls are missing and the lonely Police Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets on the case. Police apprehend the practically mute Alex Jones (Paul Dano) but let him go when they can't get him to talk and don't have any evidence to bring charges. Unsatisfied, Keller, certain Jones is hiding something, abducts him and tries to get him to talk before it's too late.Writer Aaron Guzikowski, who previously adapted ""Contraband"" from its Icelandic predecessor, delivers a straightforward script with numerous complications. The story will get under your skin while leaving enough nuggets in the mystery to keep you captivated. Unfortunately, all the twists and discoveries might generate some difference in opinion. Nothing is done, spelled out or tied up neatly and clearly — Guzikowski cares more about symbolism and themes than satisfying answers.Villeneuve appears to be a perfect pairing with this script, as he enjoys the symbolism and setting the tone early and often. ""Prisoners"" has a downright creepy vibe that will keep viewers constantly paranoid. Every shot is a portrait, with due credit to veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins. The film's stunning imagery automatically sets it apart from run-of-the-mill thrillers.Jackman's performance is the only one of note in ""Prisoners"" despite the excellent ensemble. The roles filled by Howard, Davis, Dano, Bello and Melissa Leo as Alex's aunt could've been done by anyone. A good case could be made for Gyllenhaal too, but his character is straightforward — a detective whose primary concern is to solve the damn case to shake off his own expectations and those of others.The aspect of ""Prisoners"" that should garner the most praise is the way it incorporates strong character elements in with the main mystery narrative. Just as crucial to the story is the way Keller, a God-fearing man whose life philosophy is ""pray for the best, prepare for the worst,"" begins to unravel mentally and morally after the disappearance of his child. He proves to be far from the protagonist when all is said and done and the resolution of his individual story becomes of equal importance to the resolution of the greater mystery.""Prisoners"" only begins to crumble a bit when it comes to sorting out the truth from the distractions and driving home the central themes. Religious imagery and ideas dominate the beginning of the movie and get peppered in throughout, but there's a lack of follow through. The notion of the unsolvable maze, which comes into play at one point, also seems relevant to the story, but is never explained. The movie wants you to think about its ideas rather than its outcomes, which is a fair request, but the outcomes better be straightforward enough to discern and in many cases they aren't.Dark, cold and troubling, ""Prisoners"" is a brooding thriller with both substantial dramatic and mystery elements. Villeneuve is a talent to keep an eye on in the future as with Guzikowski, despite the flaws in the wrap-up of the film.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The acting by all major characters was great particularly Hugh Jackman showing fear and rage at the same time. It's been a while since I seen a film like this.The writers of this film definitely succeeded in creating a story that is cryptic and compelling.

I didn't even understand why and how things occurred or were connected which created a lot of discussion afterwards. My partner and I shared our thoughts of what we understood; it took both of us to make sense of it all. Good writing and that correct application of it certain shows when it takes two educated people to understand everything.This film also made me think about justice and what I would do: is the law always correct?

What a waste of time and brains,"My friends raved and raved about this movie so I was very excited to see and probably had too high expectations?I. HATED. This.

Yes it was enjoyable to try and guess whodunnit but I am so angry about the ending that it ruined the rest of it for me.Obviously I won't spoil it for anyone but be warned IT CUTS OFF! You sit through all of that, they don't show outcomes of a few characters, and you're waiting for your happy ending closure and then BAM! Credits. I can't believe I wasted that much time when I could have knocked at least 2 other movies off my list that night. Nothing, I repeat NOTHING makes me angrier than a movie with no closure. It's designed so that you can assume what happens but screw that, if I have to sit there and go through all that stuff just to leave it up to my imagination what happens in the end it's automatically failed.My other pet peeve is that Jake Gyllenhaal was a terrible cop. Not that his acting was bad, but his character itself was retarded. He was ALWAYS alone, never followed protocol, never let anyone know where he was and that is just bad writing.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I've seen worse.If you are like me and need closure and answers, DO NOT waste your time on this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A bleak, slow-burn of a thriller that manages to become one of the most affecting films of recent years.","'Prisoners (2013)' is a dark and, at times, disturbing slow-burn of a thriller that somehow manages to keep you on the edge of your seat with its bleak domestic ominousness and outbursts of futile yet explosive violence. That violence is representative of the volatile frustration of a fairly hopeless situation, one that can only bring out the very worst in even the very best of people; the characters are all simply scrambling to retain some semblance of control in the struggle for the survival of all that they hold dear. It's a picture which could seem somewhat inconsequential due to the slightly tangential nature of its plot, but the very human characters (all portrayed excellently, especially by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal who both turn in truly Oscar-worthy work) and thematically rich narrative manage to marry together all of the differing elements into a work which somehow feels entirely cohesive and incredibly powerful despite its long running time. It's one of the most affecting and emotional films of recent years, an accolade compounded by its brilliantly restrained direction and profoundly realistic screenplay.

"'Prisoners' takes none in a disturbing and utterly compelling story of masculine ordeal, religious conviction and exigent moral dilemmas in the face of child abduction.","The two main protagonists – played by Jake Gylenhaal and Hugh Jackman – are two men who see it as a moral imperative, as men, to protect others. 'Prisoners' confidently examines the consequences of their failure to do so when two young girls are abducted; and they are subsequently faced against an adversary they don't quite know how to handle.The screenplay pits a masculine sense of duty to protect one's child against religious, societal and moral forbearance. Then we watch the consequences of this fascinating clash. When blue collar patriot, religious man; and failing carpenter Keller Dover – played by Hugh Jackman – has his daughter abducted, this all American alpha father channels his inner Wolverine rage and decides to take the law into his own hands. In an attempt to find his abducted daughter, and her abducted friend, he sets out on a crusade to terrorize information from Paul Dano's mentally challenged character; whom he firmly believes is responsible for the kidnapping.Even though you got the sense that Jackman goes Oscar hunting, the real stand out is Jake Gyllenhaal; in an incredibly understated but subtlety complex performance as Detective Loki; the officer in charge of the case to find the missing girls. This is familiar ground for Gylenhaal, after the likes of 'Zodiac', and 'End of Watch', but he finds new depths and makes this character completely independent from any film has appeared in before. He is by far the most compelling character. Like the way Detective Loki pays attention to the details when trying to solve the mystery, we to, as an audience, have to pay attention to the details. Notice the recurring blinking of his eyes, or the moments of brutality he enforces. There are also brief glimpses of tattoos; that all add depth and mystery to a character with a past only ever curiously alluded to.We are treated to the simple but effective direction of Clint Eastwood and the chilling thrills and revelations of David Fincher. Canadian Denis Villeneuve – in his American debut – is a director prepared to use a tripod, and rely on the simple grace of the close-up and all the drama it brings. Roger Deakins gives the film a burdening sense of dread through his atmospherically beautiful cinematography; that lends itself fittingly to a dark story about the loss of innocence. He is truly one of the best DP's working today.The snow and ice of North America is used an awful lot as a backdrop for murder mystery thrillers; but it is a genre trope I embrace. It never fails to highlight the ice cold brutality of the story. Almost as if there were some correlation between our unrelenting natural world, and the killers/abductors that dwell in it.And 'Prisoners' is as cold as it gets. This is a dark and violent story. If that puts you off, it should be known that the violence never feels pointless, or exploitative, and it is handled in good taste to perfectly serve the story. A well played reveal of the physical abuse that a victim of torture receives is now ingrained in my mind.'Zodiac', 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', 'Mystic River' and the recent 'The Frozen Ground' are all similar genre films; and 'Prisoners' is up there with the best of them. It's slow burning; playing for over 150 minutes. But only by taking its time, are we allowed to immerse ourselves and get invested in the investigation and characters. It's not a perfect movie by any means; but a great one? sure. It's one of the best mystery thrillers I can remember seeing over the last few years.You might get lost in this maze of a movie; but you have to play detective to keep up. Deduce all you want, but this was a mystery I could not solve; and the grand revelation I really did not see coming. I can appreciate a movie that manages to successfully manipulate me into thinking that the answer is in that chest, when in fact it was another.

Two suspenseful approaches to one dark crime,"It's Thanksgiving in Pennsylvania and the sky is grey, the air is cold and the ground is frozen.

The daughters are 6-year-old girls, ready to get into a harmless adventure, and the teenagers are teenagers. But the girls go missing, and the hunt goes on to find them and figure out what happened.The families have no luck and soon enough the police are there to help. The lead investigator is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the one father, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), already has his suspicions that he's not going to be useful at all. I think now is as good as time as any to declare that Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki is one of the most fascinating detectives to watch, and arguably one of the best performances of a detective ever. I want him on every case.Keller disagrees because he already has his prime suspect and any decent detective would torture him until he revealed the location of the missing girls. Unfortunately the prime suspect, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), is mentally disabled and likely incapable of committing such a serious crime.""Prisoners"" is a good movie because it takes two different approaches to try to get to the same result. Keller takes matters into his own hands to track down the killer and the missing girls. And Detective Loki actively tries to solve the case. Loki is really on his own with Keller against his every move and boss which won't budge on formalities. Keller, on the other hand, shouldn't be alone with a wife who needs his support, a teenage son left to deal with a tragedy on his own, and a similarly suffering best friend. He turns from all of them but the latter to take care of the case on his own.The farther that our two active participants get in opposite directions, the more that needs to be solved.

"""He's not a person anymore. No, he stopped being a person when he took our daughters.""","On the surface, Prisoners is an engaging mystery with some all-out brilliant performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal alike. However, in its center, Prisoners is hardly just another dark thriller, but rather a exposition on the lengths people are willing to go, and the people they are because of it. I had been holding off on watching this one for a while now, not because I thought it would be bad or too long, in fact I nearly thought the opposite. I am a big fan of Villeneuve's and have been for a while now, and when I first heard of Prisoners and saw the trailer, I knew it was going to be something really special- and my expectations were correct. First off, the cinematography in this film is outstanding, not relying on beautiful fixtures, but just grounded and realistic angles that truly propel the film to a more integrated feel. However, this is hardly the best thing about the movie, despite the Oscars thinking so. The fact that neither Jackman nor Gyllenhaal received even a nomination for this film is a crime. I like Matthew McConaughey as much as the next guy, and I thought Dicaprio was fantastic in Wall Street (in fact he should have won), but Jackman and Gyllenhaal put just as much effort (if not more) into their performances and it is really dumbfounding to me how they got so little credit. Villeneuve's directing style may be criticized as dark and depressing for some, but I feel it was just the right amount for the situation at hand, and yet never too much where the film felt it was overbearing to watch. The score is excellent, its endlessly entertaining, and I was able to keep myself engaged throughout its entire nearly 3 hour runtime. In the end, Prisoners is an excellent must see thriller with excellent performances and excellent direction throughout (not to mention writing), don't miss this one.

"Twists, Turns, And Mazes","Two little girls are kidnapped. An RV is seen nearby. Police begin to investigate, but this is not a simple case. The characters all feel extremely well established and real, such as Gyllenhaals' characters tattoos and eye twitching or Hugh Jackmans' characters religious tendencies and preparation for some kind of disastrous event. The movie is 2 and a half hours long, and I would say it benefits from it. It allows the plot to unfold at a good pace. It never feels rushed. This film will always have you guessing who is behind the kidnappings and how the film will play out, which is a good trait for a thriller/mystery movie. It also wraps the story up fairly well.

When his daughter is mysteriously kidnapped, he takes matter into his own hands by kidnapping a suspect whom the police release because of lack of evidence.Seasoned actor Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective David Loki who is assigned this case. Loki has a reputation for solving difficult cases and he takes this one as a particular challenge.Both actors give a thoroughly professional performance.

The scary thing is that the person that glides into madness dominates the one that stays with his senses,"At the beginning of ""Prisoners"" two little children from two families celebrating Thanksgiving together disappear. The rest of the film is a hunt for a maniac, not unlike for example ""Seven"" (1995, David Fincher).What makes this hunt special is that it is not only executed by a detective (Detective Loki played by jake Gyllenhaal) but also by the father of one of the children (Keller Dover played by Hugh Jackman) who becomes a maniac himself in the proces.In the opening scene we see Keller Dover hunting with his teenange son, this time not for a maniac but for a deere. This opening scene characterizes Keller Dover very well and so lays the foudation for the rest of the movie. Keller Dover is a religious man (we hear prayers in the background) that strongly beliefs in self-sustainability. He does not trust the government very much, but he does rely on his own basement full of survival equipment (all of a sudden all that stands between you and being dead is you).In the rest of the film this belief in self support and the distrust of the government evolves into Keller taking the law in his own hands. This moral decay is symbolized by the difference between the tidy house in which Keller lives with his family and the dilapidated house of his late parents in which he takes the law in his own hands. The father of the other missing child remains sensible, but is not capable of adjusting Keller. It is the other way round, and this may be the most scaring observation of the movie.The rest of the film is also permeated with religious symbolism. I just mention snakes symbolising satan. Noteworthy is also that the detective is named after the Nordic god LokiTo be honest the plot of ""Prisoners"" is not very original. The strength of the film lies (as already said) in the interaction (and the balance of power) between the father that glides into madness and the father that stays with his senses. Also very good is the cinematography of Roger Deakins. Thanksgiving is celebrated in october (Canada) or november (USA), so wintry landscapes dominate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Yet another Villeneuve gem.,"The unique directorial approach this man has deserves a medal. Hugh Jackman gave one amazing and almost perfect performance along side Jake Gyllenhaal. You almost forget you're watching actors which might be one of the greatest compliments of them all. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen and you won't even pause for a bathroom break. Can't recommend enough, mystery thriller at its best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Thrillingly good,"This film is though, suspenseful, raw and unbelievably real. It creeps up on you, slowly, like the speed of the film, it also moves slowly almost to calm you down and keep you relaxed yet very aware of what is going on and look closely at the events unfolding before you. The film is almost two and a half hour long, but in my mind it never seemed that way, it didn't get boring or trivial, it kept the suspense all the way through.If you have kids (I do), this is kind of the worst thing that could happen, what would you do, how would you react. The people in the film is just as different as you and me, they react differently, they get frustrated, they lunch out and to sum it up they do what they think is the right thing to do at the time, they do what they feel they have to do to get back what is taken from them.This is powerful acting, very believable and real, the characters and how they react, the way they go up and down, high on emotions, fueled by rage and frustrations. The choices they make and the solutions they choose individually affects the dynamic of their bonds, both family and friendship bonds a tried and tried hard. On the way the whole mood of the film and characters change, both by frustrations, lack of sleep, the lack of ability to go something about their situation. It is staggering and adds to the suspense and dark setting the film uncovers.I will not reveal anything about the movie itself, but if you have the stomach for abduction, skewed morals, the harsh facts of life and a very raw setting, if you can handle that (it is just a movie), then this is the film for you. It will keep you close to the edge of your seat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Cracker,"This is a superbly executed detective film. There is a powerful mystery that drives the film from beginning to end. It gets very creepy and tense at times. There are some unforgettable scenes.Although the subject matter is grim, it's not actually on the whole any more disturbing or gruesome than what you see in the trailer, so I would recommend this film to anyone.There's no real weaknesses in the production or the script. At well over 2 hours, it's a testament to the skill of the filmmakers that the audience stays engrossed in the story. Another interesting feature of this film is that it simultaneously gives enough answers/resolution to satisfy the audience, but leaves plenty of ambiguous details which are fun to discuss afterwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A powerful and enthralling experience,"This is the kind of film I love. A dark mystery/thriller with compelling characters and twists. It seemed these films were abundant in the 90s, but hard to come across today. 'Prisoners' is one of the best thrillers I've seen in recent times. The story is absorbing right from the get go. It locks the audience in and never lets them go for the next 150 minutes.It undoubtedly helps when your two stars are in exceptional form, both delivering some of the best performances of their careers. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting career has really come to life in the last four years or so. Here, he gives a performance perfectly suited to the film. He never drops a scene and plays off every actor he's on screen with perfectly. Topping that though is Hugh Jackman. The man showed his unbelievable acting chops back in 2006 with his performance in 'The Prestige'. Here though he quite possibly tops that. He brings life to an incredibly complex and conflicted character. If a lesser actor had taken on this role the entire film could have fallen completely flat and had no power whatsoever. He can't have been far off an Oscar nomination.When a two and a half hour film flies by and you can't believe it is over already, you know it is high in quality. Not only that, but there are many discussion points that are fascinating to talk about and debate after the film is over. I love nothing more than a debate about a film topic where no one is ever ""right"" because there is no official answer, yet people make great points that make you entirely reconsider your original opinion. This is one of those films that lends itself to that. I was initially a little put off by the length of the run time, but I implore you not to be. It's very close to being a modern masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Spellbinding tension allows plot holes to be overlooked,"My nails were stubs at the end of this film. Sitting in my seat as the credits rolled and the adrenaline coursed through my veins I took a minute to marvel at the sheer power of escapism when executed properly. Not since David Fincher's 'Seven' has a director been able to elevate tension from the get go and hold it so consistently for the duration of the film. As other reviewers have mentioned, the film is not without a few inconsistencies and coincidences in plot. However, the spellbinding effect Villeneuve masterfully weaves over the audience manages to push that all aside until the post-film reflection commences.Character-wise Hugh Jackman puts in a gripping performance as Keller Dover; an ostensibly freelance carpenter whose daughter is one of the initial kidnapping victims. A hot-headed character from the get-go, we experience his anguish, moral degradation and desperation as he searches for his daughter. I thought that Jake Gyllenhal's performance was spot-on in the role of a clever small town detective trying to live up to his flawless record. His actions were plausible and never seemed overdone. The high point of the film for me was Paul Dano, who continues to showcase his versatile acting talents in the role of a deeply disturbed and mentally handicapped young man suspected of the central kidnappings on which the film is based.This is the sole Denis Villeneuve film I've watched to date but it has certainly piqued my interest in his other works. In addition to the standard thriller camera angles, we were treated to some rather exceptional camera work that played a large part in maintaining the suspenseful atmosphere of the film. Shots such as Paul Dano's single illuminated eye showed insight into the workings of the human imagination and how fear is evoked.Unfortunately not every aspect of the film is perfect. As I walked out of the theater and my pulse returned to normal I began noticing certain inconsistencies and implausibilities that appear throughout the film which may or may not (depending on the viewer) detract from the overall experience. As this ground has been covered in numerous other reviews I won't delve into details but the bottom line is that the degree in which these flaws affect your movie experience will vary somewhat depending on your mindset and approach to the film.All in all Prisoners certainly provided an exhilarating experience at the cinema that completely warrants the price of admission. Despite some minor plot mishaps and loose ends we are presented with a thoroughly enjoyable kidnapping thriller that, as the girl in the row behind me exclaimed upon exiting the theater, may take a few years off your life if you aren't careful.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

One of the year's wonder,"I witnessed many surprises this year and 'Prisoners' is one of those made me stun. With the big names in it, the movie revolves around a mysterious incident that puts two families into the sorrow. The deeply moving characters and its emotions are the movie's plus point and of course the great performance by the great actors as well. It is refreshing to see Hugh Jackman in a role the father to a missing child.A similar kinda movie to 'The Lovely Bones' where two young girls are go missing and their parent's never ending search for them begins. With a single clue they begin to dig every detail to bring back their children along with the help of a young cop. As expected character diversion had an important hand in mystify and confuse the viewers without falling for anything to conclude their prediction before it reveal itself.Fine photography. It was pleasant to see cool frames where there's no sun glare but always cloudy, shadow and dark atmosphere something like the movie 'The Awakening'. It brought real close to us the real grief of a family that we can almost feel it. Good or bad ending, the way it ends is all matters. In this story they give us an opportunity to take it either way as you want. One thing I was not convinced is the motivation for the abduction. The reason seemed to me a silly but in reality everything can be possible and sometimes it won't need reasons at all. Finally, it is a must not miss movie from the 2013 film calender.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

One of the most exciting thrillers of the last years,"Prisoners is a very good film. Firstly, the history-telling is great. The characters development served absolutely fine in the film. In fact, It's much more a story-film than a character-film(if that makes sense...). I mean, it's 150 minutes runt-time just flew by, because the story was incredibly instigating, and there was always something 'important' happening. The atmosphere of the film is dark, gritty; exactly what the film needed. And yes, shockingly violent.Second, the acting. Everyone was good but Jake Gyllenhall was definitely the one who stole the scene. He made a real freaky detective, and his gestures and mannerisms made for the 'Loki' character were priceless. Also liked, in a lesser extent, Hugh Jackman. His character is the most layered though.I also really liked one of the key components of this film that was the cinematography. Cold, dark with a 'modern' touch, all the artistic method used by the great Roger Deakins. The editing was also well-done, as we see in the final moments in the film.I wished I could've felt more the sounds of the ambient though. Everything was beautifully well made, well crafted, lacking a good job in the music/sound department. The score was way generic.Anyway...Prisoners is a very well crafted and an exciting thriller, undeniable one of the best released recently. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Prepare for the tension!!!,"""Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst.""Prisoners is a dark thriller that will have you at the edge of your seat during almost the entirety of the film. It was a very intense experience. It is hard not to compare this film to Mystic River or Gone Baby Gone because those two movies set the landmark for modern thrillers dealing with abduction. Prisoners almost lives up to the standards that those two films set. Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve, follows up his Oscar nominated film, Incendies, with this intense thriller that manages to capture the audiences attention once again. Incendies was one of my favorite films of 2011, and despite Prisoners not living up to the perfection that film achieved, I still thought this film was highly entertaining and satisfying. There were a few minor plot points that didn't work for me, but that didn't take anything away from this great film. It is a more mainstream film, but it manages to follow a similar approach as Fincher reminding us of Se7en or Zodiac thanks to its dark and haunting atmosphere. I am a huge fan of this genre and really had a fun time trying to solve the mystery through the small clues that Villeneuve masterfully presented in the story. Prisoners was without a doubt one of the most gripping and intense experiences I had all year. Unfortunately it is a little too intense and at times I felt the film could have used some moments to release such tension. Anyways Prisoners is a highly recommended film and a must-see.Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a family man who is always prepared for the worst. He is a survivalist with a basement full of provisions and is teaching his older son, Ralph (Dylan Minnette), how to hunt. He's married to Grace (Maria Bello) and they have a daughter named Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). One afternoon, Keller's worst nightmare comes true while they are hanging out with their friendly neighbors the Birches. Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) have two kids about the same age as Ralph and Grace, Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). While the two families are having a lovely time together, Joy and Anna decide to go back to Anna's house, but when the Dover's come back home they are horrified to discover that the kids never made it back. Ralph remembers that they were playing next to a strange RV that was parked up front which is now gone. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is appointed as the lead investigator in the case and the first thing he does is locate the RV. The driver is a disturbed young man named Alex Jones (Paul Dano) who has the IQ of a 10 year old and with no evidence to incriminate him Detective Loki has to let him free. His Aunt (Melissa Leo) comes to pick him up and explains how naive and innocent he is. As hours pass, Keller begins to get more desperate and convinced that Alex was involved he decides to take matters into his own hands. From here on the tension begins to escalate as they try to solve the mystery.Prisoners succeeds as a neo-noir thriller building up a lot of tension with a very dark atmosphere which is perfectly captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins. It adds to the mysterious mood of the story which on its own is already pretty intense. The screenplay, written be Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband), is very well written with a very interesting premise and some great twists. My only complaint with this film has to do with the lack of a strong female character. With such a strong cast, I thought that Maria Bello or Viola Davis could have been given a stronger role, but the film focuses mostly on Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. They both give very strong and convincing performances, and Gyllenhaal has surprised me over the last three years with very good films (Source Code, End of Watch, and now this one). I guess he has been choosing his roles very wisely lately because his next film also looks interesting (Enemy which is also directed by Denis Villeneuve). Paul Dano also gave a strong performance as his character's motivations were very hard to decipher. The strong cast and the interesting story make this a very entertaining film despite some minor flaws involving character motivations. It is one of the best recent thrillers coming out of Hollywood and I doubt you will be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A Tour de Force,"Denis Villeneuve's ""Prisoners"" is a tour de force. The film is languid, every moment exuding suspense enough to make you forget to breathe. And this is no journey for the mouth-breathers or the impatient, for it is to be savored slowly, and it demands utter surrender and rapt attention.The film lacks any superfluous elements and centers around a few pivotal characters. Hugh Jackman is masterful in his role, Jake Gyllenhall does enough to be convincing and the rest of the cast do their bit admirably. The film is shot beautifully with the camera always roving a' la Robert Altman and some shots are really worthy of a Terrence Mallick comparison.""Prisoners"" is ultimately neither about the plot or the persons. It is a solemn recognition of the easily corruptible human nature which goes to great lengths to justify its means with its ends. An absolute dark horse of a film, and a rewarding experience for the patient viewer. 8/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Great director's English-language debut spoiled by too-clever-by-half  (and then some) screenplay,"When I read that French Canadian art-house phenom Denis Villeneuve was directing an English-language thriller about a distraught father searching for his missing child, it seemed like the perfect project for him. His prizewinning ""Incendies"" is a brilliant film that deals with the most basic human emotions in a powerful and affecting way. This one, unfortunately, is not. ""Prisoners"" is a long movie with an increasingly complex storyline, but there's not much characterizing going on—we learn that the distraught father (Hugh Jackman) is a gun-toting, prayer-mumbling, Star-Spangled-Banner-in-the-shower-singing hothead and that his adversary, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), is an all-about-the-job guy who eats Thanksgiving dinner alone in a Chinese restaurant. That's about it.The suspense implicit in the basic setup—two little girls go missing from a quiet suburban street; vigilante dad runs amok—starts to wear off with about an hour to go. Then screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski heads off on an ingenious but time-wasting tangent, seemingly dragging in some leftover occultist bushwa from ""True Detective,"" and the whole movie pretty much goes to hell in a basket full of snakes I assume the filmmakers wanted to leave us thinking about the larger implications—is torture justified to save a child's life? Maybe even, do gun-toting, prayer-mumbling, patriotic family values necessarily end up at Guantánamo or Abu Ghraib?Instead I was left wondering whether the last few puzzle pieces would have be to hammered into place. Talking of which—be aware that there are a couple of very violent scenes; my wife bailed after Jackman's character threatens to tune up a suspect with a clawhammer. Fine performances, great cinematography.

Jackman in fine form.,"If you haven't been a Jackman fan before, I think this is the one to change that. Terence Howard and Jake Gyllenhaal also bring some stunning performances to the film. After seeing the trailer for this I thought this is a sure winner. They could have done a little more with the 'wife' characters but the men do hold it down. This one has you from start to finish forcing you to examine your own views and the lengths that you would go to placed in that situation. The entire movie has no sunshine. It's cold, wet and miserable. I think that's just to give the characters a little more texture though. Go see it if you want an edge of your seat thriller on a Sunday afternoon. Avoid it if you're not a fan of heavy, emotional movies that make you want hot chocolate and a puppy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Disturbing do not mean bad,"I do not agree with bad reviews for this movie.I think that there is certain confusion for people, between "" I do not like this movie "" and "" I do not like what this movie tells "".When a story, in a movie, disturbs us, if it lowers us the look or obliges us to look away from the screen because we do not support what we see, it does not mean that the movie is bad. If that we see puts back us at home with a bad sensation in the stomach because of the cruelty, of the hardness of what we contemplated, it does not mean that the movie is exaggerated. Unfortunately, reality often overtakes fiction.All this can even mean that the movie is very good. It can mean that the acting is superb.We cannot judge a movie by our limitations, our prejudices or our way of conceiving life. We go to see a movie to escape us of our own life, remove our spirit of our everyday life, or know what happens around us, even if it can be surprising and disturbing.Give a chance to this movie, watch it, because it is one of the best of 2013.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Masterclass in Everything,"Prisoners (2013) - [10/10]What a beautiful film. Prisoners (2013) is one of the greatest thriller/mystery films ever made - at least that I've seen - and it is great for many reasons. One of the reasons is the writing. Every story piece is so intricate, so complex - exactly like a maze. Aaron Guzikowski did such an amazing job, taking a familiar concept (child abduction) and taking all the stigmas, stereotypes, etc. surrounding this topic and flipping them on their heads. He wrote with such realism, crafting such tense, empathetic, and surreal moments. I found myself sympathizing with each character; caring about each and everyone of them deeply. I cried with the characters. I felt their anger. I felt everything. The audience was a part of the story. Every random piece of ""arbitrary"" story truly wasn't random. Simplistic resolutions and small little details mattered in this film. As the film progressed, I thought I had the story figured out - I thought I did - but I was so wrong. With each scene and sequence there were so many twists and surprises; each a turn inside of the maze that is Prisoners (2013). Denis Villeneuve is going to go down as one of the greats. His direction allowed this complex story to be told in a very unique way. I haven't seen much of his work, aside form Arrival (2016), but because of this film I have deep respect for him. Each scene was extremely tense, and it started from the very beginning of the film. Immediately you knew something was wrong even though nothing was explicitly stated. There's so many techniques to learn from Villeneuve's knowledge on building tension, mood, tone, and atmosphere. It felt like I was holding my breath from the opening words that appeared on screen, Prisoners, and wasn't allowed a second to breathe until the abrupt cut to black and the closing credits. (The ending is perfect by. It is probably one of my favorite endings ever.) There is so much symbolism in this film. From snakes, to mazes, to being a prisoner. A prisoner of someone else's, a prisoner in jail, or becoming a prisoner of one's own creation. I cannot wait to analyze more of this film and truly understand Prisoners (2013). Now onto the performances. What can I say about these actors. Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello, Terrance Howard - everyone was so real. Gyllenhaal and Jackman give their best performances I have ever seen. They became their characters. You could sympathize with Jackman's character, Keller Dover, and understand everything he was going through and at the same time you as if became Gyllenhaal's partner - the audience was the lone-wolf Detective Loki's partner throughout the inverstigation. Gyllenhaal is a spectacular actor and this is my favorite performance by him. Each small detail about his character, from his tattoos, to his mason ring, or to the simple looks he gives - is perfect from the moment he is introduced in the story. The chemistry that is created when Gyllenhaal and Jackman are together is unnerving. Jackman's rage and emotion contrast Gyllenhaal's independence and seriousness. Jackman gave the best performance I have seen from him as well. All of these characters are people that could really exist. They're extremely realistic and it works. Another standout is Paul Dano and David Dastmalchian. I can't say much about their characters because it would spoil some of the film, but they are haunting. Paul Dano is a really underrated actor and he shines in this. You can see everything about his character just from his eyes. His eyes tell you so much about himself and the story. I cannot stress this enough - his eyes. To be able to do that takes so much skill and dedication. Paul Dano really commits in this film and is the perfect person to be in between Gyllenhaal and Jackman. Dastmalchian utilizes similar skills that Dano uses. I really can't speak about his performance too much, but it is equal to the caliber of the other actors. One last actor I'll talk about is Melissa Leo. She frightened me so much in this film. I'd compare her performance to Anthony Perkins in Psycho (1960). Once again, I really can't say much about her either, but her eeriness is enough to make you want to look away from the screen. The casting in this film was perfect. Not a single actor doesn't put in their all for the film. Jackman and Gyllenhaal really operated at another level. To truly understand what I'm talking about you need to see Prisoners (2013). Roger A. Deakins. What a legend. Every film he captures is beautiful and Prisoners (2013) is no different. Every scene was art. Every scene had some sort of symbolic subtext. He is able to capture emotion in the small things. From pill bottles, to trees, to candles. So beautiful. A lot of the sequences happen in really dark colored settings and to be able to capture beauty in that is crazy. In one scene in particular, we see rain turn to snow and the way he chose to film it is beautiful. I can't figure out another way to describe it other than beautiful. I think this may be my favorite film he's been Director of Photography on. How he didn't win best cinematography at the 84th Academy Awards amazes me. (I really have a lot more to say about this film - but I'll shorten it down.) The editing was to the point and really satisfying. The sound design was layered and actually very quiet. This film is a slow burn and utilizes silence differently than most films, so when loud moments happen they are meaningful. The score by Jóhan Jóhannsson captures what Prisoners (2013) is. I really love it, so I was very sad to find out he passed away in 2018. I think he could have became one of the greatest composers in film history, much of that greatness seen with his work on this film. Each chord oozes emotion onscreen. The lighting is beautiful. For the most part they relied on natural light - which I prefer in film, and it works. A lot of the scenes are in darkness so when we see light, it adds a lot of meaning and value to the film - it has a purpose. Prisoners (2013) was snubbed on so many levels. I believe it is a masterpiece, but it hasn't been recognized as such. It is criminally underrated. The writing is so effective. The characters are so complex yet so relatable. The symbolism throughout is breathtaking. The direction is masterful. The performances, equally masterful. Most importantly of all, to understand Prisoners (2013) completely it would require a second or third watch. In my opinion that is a sign of the greatness in a film. To watch it multiple times and still take away new ideas from it means the film is a masterpiece. It is a masterclass in suspense, atmosphere, cinematography, acting, symbolism, editing, everything. It is heartbreaking, horrific, and familiar - I loved it. Once you start watching this film, Villeneuve and Guzikowski will trap you in the maze that is Prisoners (2013) until the very end of the film when it all makes sense, and you know which path is the correct way to the exit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An Excellent & Suspenseful Thriller,"This is certainly the textbook definition of an edge of your seat movie. It's got a lot of suspense, and plot twists galore so that from the very beginning you're never really sure who is or isn't guilty, and the ultimate revelation of that caught me at least completely by surprise. As a result of that, this can also be a bit confusing at times, but it's never a movie that you lose interest in.The basic story revolves around the search for two young girls who have gone missing without a trace. The families are friends, and are fully involved in the search. There's a prime suspect, but no definite evidence against him. The movie is not just a story about the search for the girls. It's also a study of how far people are prepared to go when they're desperate.Hugh Jackman was excellent as Keller Dover - one of the desperate fathers, who takes his desperation to the extreme. Paul Dano also did well as the prime suspect - the mentally challenged Alex. Unlike others, I really wasn't that taken with Jake Gyllenhaal as the detective in charge of the case. For me, he really didn't seem to work in the role.Overall, though, this is an excellent and suspenseful thriller. (8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An Intricate Thriller of Emotional & Moral Complexities.,"From the director of Incendies & Polytechnique, Prisoners is a very tensely crafted cinematic maze of intense emotions & moral complexities which with the help of its clever plot, intricate script, strong religious themes, ensemble cast & stellar performances creates a darkly disturbing & grim atmosphere of uncertainty that looms over its story from start to finish.It tells the story of Keller Dover, who is a deeply religious man & believes in being prepared for the worst at all times. But one day when his daughter & her friend go missing and the police fails to make any breakthroughs for days, Keller takes matters into his own hands & sets out to find his daughter by targeting the prime suspect for information before it's too late.Denis Villeneuve's direction here carries the very riddles & moral complications of his previous works and these elements eventually end up playing a major role in shaping up the whole experience of this film. Roger Deakins' cinematography is another standout as the entire film has a dark & mysterious ambiance enveloping it & even the sequences filmed in minimum light are able to retain a crisp clarity.Coming to the performances, Prisoners has a pretty reliable cast but it's Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal who end up impressing the most. Jackman plays Keller Dover; the grief-stricken father of the missing girl, & delivers an emotionally charged performance. But he is constantly challenged by Gyllenhaal who delivers a knockout performance as Detective Loki; the officer spearheading this perplexing case.On an overall scale, Prisoners is a labyrinth of moral & ethical ambiguities represented through the degeneration of an immensely faithful & God-fearing person into a remorseless sinner, all exhibited in a darkly compelling manner, and it's also an interesting focus on the devastating change an event like the one depicted in this film can bring in any parent out there.

Good thriller,"Good thriller. Hugh Jackman plays one of the fathers whose child was kidnapped in broad daylight, Jake Gyllenhaal plays the detective, and when the two characters interact/clash... it is very unnerving and highly intense. As the film progresses, the sense of dread that the characters are feeling is projected on the audience in the most subtle of ways... you feel the uncertainty, pain, and confusion that the characters have to bare in order to continue solving the crime. Prisoners presented sophisticated cinematography, a riveting screenplay, flawless storytelling, and authentic character development while also being a thrilling, engaging, and somber crime film... which balances every aspect of filmmaking with ease and professionalism. This movie was a journey into the lives of these characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"He's not a person anymore.

Another Awful finish,"This movie had a strong character lineup with great acting all around.The plot was solid, typical good guy bad guy storyline.They gave away everything in the movie with little hints of what to expect, as if you were watching a Crime Television show.The ending, this is my biggest peeve. If you spend the time to make a good movie 2 1/2 hours long, FINISH IT.I would have rated this movie an 8 of 10 if it weren't for the terrible ending. This type of ending ruins so many movies.

But truly, after 10 minutes I was completely sucked into this story. So much in fact, that when the credits rolled I felt like a lost child. I found his performance (everyone's) to be so incredibly human. No one did as we would normally expect them to do. Like a sudden change of heart, or in their morals. They were just reacting and it was amazing.The editing is brilliant, flawless. Everything, just.. Wow!I've certainly found a new director to stalk.

One of the best in the genre,"Prisoners is a masterclass in dread. Using that extended run time to deliver a smart thriller that's tough to watch and always showing the answers rather than telling. It keeps you guessing for the ideal amount of time before eventually letting everything fall into place without letting up on the tension until the credits appear.Jake Gyllenhaal is the king of rage but here he is skillfully restrained for the majority. That anger is clearly there below the surface and he lets it simmer and saves the explosive moments for maximum impact. Hugh Jackman on the other hand, has a lot of anger that's constantly exploding in a way that doesn't derail anything.Director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins craft a gorgeously bleak film that's rich in moody atmosphere and tight framing. It only breaks away from that bleakness once, making that scene deliberately overwhelming. Jóhann Jóhannsson's score is employed sparingly, making the sadness it's imbued with all the more impactful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Good Film,"First of all, I would like to state that I don't want to give any detail about the story for the people who haven't watched it yet. So, my review will not be about the story of the film, but the bad comments about the film.I would like to tell something about the comments related with the runtime of the film. In some reviews it is told that the film is too long and that is one of the reasons that they don't like it. I really do my best to understand why people judge a film with its runtime, but I cant. Cinema is the art of telling a story on the white big screen. If you need long time to tell a story, then you do it in that way. The success of a film does not depend on the runtime, gentlemen. You may say that you didn't like the film, it is that easy, but the runtime itself can not be an excuse not to like a film unless you don't make a short film. (You know short films tell the story in the shortest time as much as possible, that is why they call them as short film, but ""Prisoners"" is not one of them)The reasons that I like ""Prisoners"":1. It didn't MAKE ME FEEL that IT WAS TOO LONG. It means it took my attention from the beginning to the end.2. Techincally, I like the art directing, especially color grading and the usage of cameras.3. The acting is not as bad as some say. I don't know if you expect an exaggerated acting or not, but the acting is AT LEAST AVAGARE, but not worse than it!4. For the questions like ""why did he do this, why did he do that? why did it happen like this?"": I would like to remind that in every story telling you can find or make up a problem if you want to. All right, I agree with the people who think that there are some missing or nonsense parts in the story, but keep in mind that it is a film and even the best films can have knowingly or unknowingly have such problems. (Some friends of mine told me that they didn't like the masterpiece ""Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon"" directed by Ang Lee as people in the film were flying while they were fighting and they thought that this was nonsense. What can I do except laughing?)On the other hand, would you like it more if all questions were answered and not kept as secret? It changes from person to person, but i would not like it personally...5. Some say that they didn't like the end though it was so clean (sometimes you don't need to see the end to know how it ends). Moreover, some film makers knowingly leave the end to the person himself, so, if you cant be sure how it ends, work your imagination and let the film end in the way you wish.6. Some say that it is the worst film they have seen in 2013. Shame on you! Please respect to the people who gave effort and spent money to bring it to the white big screen. It is not a masterpiece but not a bad film, either. Do you seriously think that it is the worst film of the year? If so, I have nothing to tell you except that I collect real bad films as they have a great value in film making, but I can say that this is not one of them.As a result, it took 8/10 from me.Best Regards.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Dark and cold thriller that nails the mark.,"Prisoners is the type of movie that is getting less and less recurrent in Hollywood and a must-see for anybody that enjoys a thriller that doesn't reach exaggerated proportions. Morally challenging and provoking, this is a story about how to handle a dire situation such as the disappearance of two young children. The two main characters provide us with very different scopes of this dilemma. On one hand Jackman's Dover is an emotional driven man who while acknowledging his wrong doings, doesn't restrain himself and goes past any boundaries to ensure his family's safety. On the other hand Gyllenhaal's Loki is a detective that not only shows determination to succeed in another case, but grows to be defined by it, as even he will boil under pressure. The performances are astonishing from these two men and you feel their tribulations throughout the film, whether it's Jackman's descent into near madness or Gyllenhaal's anxiety as he pursues every lead possible. Director Denie Villenueve provides us with a moody setting that not only attracts us to this shadowy story, but also connects with all aspects provided with his co-workers such as a fantastic cinematography work and a striking script that will fill with as much doubt as the characters in the movie. My only complaint is that I thought it ran a bit too long and a little sharper editing would have been fine with me, since not only would I rate it higher, but also would have had an even better experience. Having watched the film, I can only say that is deserving of its recognition (IMDB Top 250) and I hope I get to see more movies churned out like these.Rating 7/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
To recommend or not?,"Many raving reviews already written will cover a vast amount I'd say about this film.

The film darn well warrants that.The most remarkable thing I took from the film is that, irrespective of how dark, foreboding and evil they are, I can sympathise with every single character.

The storyline has many varying layers, but most of them are not resolved by the end of the movie, so it keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat even after the credits.

Nice use of subtle clues in the random bits of dialogue, written notes, and newspaper flashes.A number of sociological and religious themes can be delved from PRISONERS: How the families, police, perpetrators, and community-at-large are all made ""prisoners"" by this event; the dangers of preconceived notions about who, why, and how the crime was committed, etc. At the same time, it doesn't just bombard us with deep ulterior meanings, and those who prefer to watch it as a simple ""thriller"" may easily do so.

I notice a huge lack of intellectual criticism about this movie,"Sometimes I like watching low budget horrors or trashy comedies or feel good movies. but when do so, I know that I should not expect much, only some cheap fun, scare or two, and maybe not even that, but that's fine, because, I know what I was in for.

Instead I get over 2 hours of lame, slow drama that insults quality movie directing, story writing, because here motifs are predictable and not placed properly and narrative seems to be filled with plot holes, redundant characters and dead end situations.

A Powerful Tale that Blurs the Line Between Right/Wrong,"There was so much positive buzz when PRISONERS premiered on the festival circuit that I really expected it to have some presence at awards time. As the father of a little girl, I had a little extra bias settling in to watch this movie because the idea of a father in a desperate search for his missing daughter is a terrifying thought. PRISONERS did not disappoint on any front: the story, the acting, the tension. It's a movie that grips you at the beginning and doesn't let go until the end credits begin to roll. It's a dark little film that touches on the blurring of right and wrong and what is acceptable to save the life of someone you love. PRISONERS begins on Thanksgiving as the Dovers and the Birch family come together to celebrate. The youngest daughters of each family, Anna and Joy, go outside unattended and disappear without a trace. The only clue was a beaten old RV that had been seen driving around the neighborhood. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to locate the missing girls and the RV is traced to Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a man with the mental faculties of a ten-year-old child. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) believes Jones knows where his daughter is being kept and, when Loki and the police aren't working fast enough, he takes matters into his own hands. He grabs Jones and locks him away in an old abandoned family home and begins his own investigation. Every minute counts as Loki and Keller race to find the missing girls before it's too late.PRISONERS is a very deliberately paced film and, at two and a half hours, you'll be surprised that at no point does it feel its length. It's a potboiler of a movie, building tension slowly so that the moments of extreme action hit you that much harder. The movie is a bit more complex than just, ""How do we make a mentally-challenged, potentially dangerous man give us information?"" Loki's investigation and the story behind the girls' abductions (as well as countless other unfortunate children before them) is almost more interesting than Keller going off on his own for his vigilante approach. The movie has the occasional red herring to throw the detective (and the audience) off course but it's never done without reason. Every person involved in the story, from the pedophile priest to the creepy stranger lurking at the girls' candlelight vigil, has some connection to the story and the people behind the disappearances. Moments that appear trivial at first are later revealed to be vital information in piecing together the over-arching story. What I'm getting at is that the movie is pleasantly complex and keeps you engaged until the screen fades to black. You never really know what to expect and you start to question how far is too far. After everything's been revealed at the end, it still leaves you wondering if all of the pain inflicted in the pursuit of saving lives was justifiable. I love that there's no right answer. What seems right at the beginning and has you gritting your teeth and silently encouraging Keller later has you looking back and thinking just how much fear can blind a person to rationality.All of this comes together with help from some great cinematography from Roger Deakins and a powerful cast. The entire movie's got a dreary, overcast feel. It's set in the winter and, when it's not pouring rain, it's a bleak gray clouded sky giving this movie not a single bright moment. It's got a strong sense of atmosphere to compliment a painful story. The cast in PRISONERS is phenomenal. Hugh Jackman breaks away from playing the X-MEN's Wolverine for a bit to portray a character with more range than cynicism and rage. That's not to say Keller doesn't have his share of rage in the film, but he sprinkles in desperation, fear, and undying determination. From the beginning of the film, we are introduced to Keller as somewhat of a religious man with a sense of preparedness for any situation. He lectures his son about how you should be prepared in the event of any catastrophe in which the rules of society might break down. Unfortunately, the one event Keller never planned for was the one in which he finds himself now and he devolves into an entirely new animal over the course of the film. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to remind me that I don't give him enough credit as an actor. His character, Loki (not the God of Mischief sort), is a skilled investigator. He's hasn't been assigned to a missing persons case that he hasn't solved. The disappearance of Anna and Joy poses his first real struggle and it's only made worse by Keller's interference. He's just a man trying to do his job and save these girls but everyone seems to be working against him. We get Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Terrence Howard in supporting roles and Paul Dano as the mentally deficient Alex Jones. He's creepy and off-putting, but is he capable of something so horrible? The movie keeps you guessing and Dano's just great.There's not much more to say. I really enjoyed PRISONERS. I would've like to see it get more recognition but I suppose it's not surprising when you look at some of the other late year additions to the awards race. It's a great movie but doesn't compare to movies 12 YEARS A SLAVE or even American HUSTLE. It got lost in the shuffle but I hope it finds plenty of attention on home video from an audience to appreciate it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
How had I missed this Gem of a Movie,"I won't pretend to be a critic, in fact I don't listen to critics much. That's why I take the time to review here on IMDB when I come across something special. The acting was superior, and the story was about as close to perfect for this genre as it can get. And most, but not all of the public reviews are from the heart/gut - there are a few wannabe critics here, but reading through several reviews helps me decide if the movie is worth streaming/renting, or even going out for. This one is one of those shows. You walk away still half in movie reality and half in the real world - that is what a great picture can do.Great to see a mature Jake Gyllenhaal deliver a near flawless performance, along with the rest of the top notch cast. Hats off to the director as well, as he/she pulls of such a great job, walking that tightrope between realism and drama. Its one of those mystery/thrillers/dramas that feels so very real that it makes you heart beat that much faster, and you find your disbelief suspended and fall into the show.If you like this genera, or even just great acting and drama, you are doing yourself a favor by taking the time out to appreciate this fantastic film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Prisoners review,"At first glance, I would have pegged Prisoners as a dull, run-of-the-mill drama. It may take a few minutes to gain momentum, but once it does, this film becomes a rather bleak and gripping descent into a prison of desperation and despair.The overall tone, style, and pacing of the film strikes a perfect balance, much akin to films like Zodiac, Silence of the Lambs, or Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Prisoners is every bit as dark and moody as these films. It also handles the brutal violence with just the right level of skill and effectiveness; it rarely lingers on graphic details, but it is still hard-hitting. The experience overall is mesmerizing and emotionally taut.The story covers familiar ground, for there are plenty of films, books, and TV shows that focus on missing persons and kidnapped children. Prisoners excels at telling this simple story, however, because it emphasizes the emotional despair of the case, and it feels all the more real because of it. In spite of that, it maintains a perfect level of pathos, allowing the audience to connect to the characters and really feel for them (including both the parents of the victims, who go to any length to find their children, and the cops, who want to do their jobs but inevitably clash with the parents). The conflict shifts in some surprising directions, and it becomes apparent that the real prisoners of this story are not necessarily the kidnapped victims. After a number of twists and turns, it all leads to a starkly bittersweet ending.This film uses some simple, but highly effective, photography and editing. Lighting can be very dark and drab, lending the film a perfect look and style to accentuate the tone. Acting is what really propels this film above-and-beyond though, thanks to a surprisingly emotional and nuanced performance by Hugh Jackman, and an earnest portrayal from Jake Gyllenhaal. Everybody else pulls their weight really well. Writing is good. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is appropriate as well.Prisoners is a dark and bleak mystery thriller that mesmerizes and hits hard, on a level not too far off from Zodiac or Silence of the Lambs. If you enjoy these types of thrillers, then this film is a must-see.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Taken 3,"Filled with a barrage of visual symbolism and plenty of poetic justice (especially during the final shot) ""Prisoners"" would have undoubtedly made a better novel than movie. That said, it wasn't the surprisingly superb and layered Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) script that I had a problem with (well, there was one scene concerning a certain character walking his dog that was a little too absurd, but) it's the surprisingly average direction from Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) which had me proclaiming: ""If only this had been directed by the Cohen Brothers!""Synopsis: On an aggressively rainy night, six-year-old Anna Dover and her friend Joy go missing; presumably abducted. After this initial event, ""Prisoners"" forks off into two separate yet competing (and many times, interacting) story lines. In one, Jackman's character, Keller Dover (father of Anna) seeks vengeance on who he suspects to be the abductor, a mentally challenged man named Alex, who looks like the portrait of a child molester, and played by Paul Dano, in a role which seemed to be tailor-made for him (I don't know if that's a good or bad thing). The second storyline sees the tattooed Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) as the lead investigator on the case, attempting to find the missing girls before it's too late.The Acting: While I was more than a little disappointed that Dano's character was all but completely forgotten about during the second half of this movie, the star studded cast, which consists of Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, the aforementioned Jackman (who is just ""all right"" here. I mean, he has one scene where he goes all Wolverine on someone, but) and Dano all come through with decent to noteworthy performances. But the real star of the show is Gyllenhaal, who unquestionably has played some troubled and complex characters in his career and Detective Loki may be the most intriguing of them all. And it doesn't hurt that he gives an Oscar nomination worthy performance (oddly the only one in this movie).Final Thought: For 3/4th of this film, ""Prisoners"" is nothing less than a ""worth the price of admission"" thriller, entirely motivated by characters who are all interacting along the blurred lines of good and evil, in a story which basically depicts the age old outline of the Devil and God waging war over the souls of the innocent; in the same vein as 1995's ""Se7en"". However, the final 40 minutes is where ""Prisoners"" did lose me a little, as it meanders, taking twists and semi-confusing turns that may cause some viewers to check their watches rather than stay glued to their seats. That doesn't mean ""Prisoners"" isn't one worth checking out (just don't see it at AMC Mercado) as it is a film which will stay with you for hours after you've left the theater (in a good way) as it continuously begs the question: what lengths would you go to see that your child is safe?Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Well-constructed and highly suspenseful,"'Prisoners' is a real gem of a film, a thriller that is jam-packed with tension, suspense and unpredictability. The film is constructed in a way that keeps the viewer second-guessing throughout. It has twists and turns in abundance and it's near impossible to predict what's around the corner, let alone what happens at the end. This film has pretty much everything you could want from a thriller.Aside from the clever and suspenseful plot, the highlight for me is Hugh Jackman, who is as good in this film as I've ever seen him. His character, rather like the film, is unpredictable and difficult to read. He's also relatable and easy to sympathise with, despite some morally questionable actions.'Prisoners' has you hooked from very early on, and even with the unusually long running time for a thriller, it held my attention the whole time.

I was intrigued by this film right from the opening scene, it definitely had an atmosphere about it, and this was maintained throughout the movie. I'm not a director, and I doubt that any critic could accurately explain the sheer talent and creative processes that go on behind the scenes, to direct a movie like this, so I wouldn't even attempt try and describe the tools he used to manipulate the audience, but i found myself questioning and guessing the whole time, was a great ride.As I said, up there with one of the best suspense/thriller films I've ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
riveting thriller,"Prisoners is marked by very strong performances and many moral/religious complexities. The story brings basically many ethical and moral questions: what would you do to protect your family? Would you torture someone to detract information? Jackman juggles these moral queries in an emotionally gripping performance. In Keller you have the tortured father who could not protect his child. In Loki you have the guardian of a community who has sworn to protect and serve. It's not surprising to see such religiosity in a film of incredible and uncompromising darkness. Villeneuve makes everything work, with an experience stimulating on an emotional and spiritual level. Thrillers like this should be embraced. Prisoners proves compelling, thanks also to the subject matter that practically demands emotional investment from an audience: children in peril. The film's pace is an endurance test, an excessive 2 and a half hours runtime but everyone gets to share in the dread of the final revelations. Does the end justify the means? All in all it's rare to find a film that really works on all levels, but that's exactly what Denis Villeneuve's and his cast have constructed with Prisoners.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The only criticism is that one character goes a little overboard but this is a movie so its allowed a little slack especially when it adds to the tension..

Every parent's nightmare,"Director Denis Villeneuve sustains the tension for two-and-a-half nerve- racking hours. The music and the murky cinematography give this film a moody atmosphere that reminded me of THE GIFT (2000), the Southern Gothic melodrama starring Cate Blanchett and Keanu Reeves. All the cast of PRISONERS bring credibility to a storyline that has a few probability-stretching elements - a a slightly daft resolution - but the film belongs to Hugh Jackman: you feel all the pent-up rage of a man who will go to any lengths, cross any moral boundary, to try and bring his daughter home. With the Madeleine McCann abduction back in the news, PRISONERS has a special resonance for UK audiences, but this is the nightmare that every parent dreads waking up to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Intense Suspense and Thriller Where Every Moment Counts...,"What a movie? I really didn't expect it to be that good. I was not aware of great reviews of this movie before I picked it to watch this weekend. So my expectations were not that high to start with but before watching it I looked at IMDb and saw great ratings this movie has received. So my expectations rose and I was sort of carrying a real time rating meter in hand - trying to push myself to rate it while I was watching it and really I could not find any moment where I would have given it 7 out of 10...hence overall 8!Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have both played a great role especially Jackman. I can say this is his one of the best roles. His acting is commendable - as a helpless and tired dad but the one who is ready to do anything possible (or even impossible) to find his daughter and he did all he could while facing push back from all people around him. He broke the rules for good and kept trying. Overall, awesome acting by all. Kudos to the director Denis Villeneuve and his entire team.Very emotional and suspenseful movie which will keep your heart pounding all the time. You fight with hope and reality and in the end wish for everything to end well. To sum it all - A great movie worth watching...do watch and hope you enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Rather boring,"I had such big expectations for this movie. The trailer made it look very interesting. And, I love thrillers. I love Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello. In fact, all the actors did a very good job. However, this seemed to me no more than a Criminal Minds episode stretched to over two hours. The storyline was all over the place. The end result made sense, but took too long to get there, leaving trails never completely followed, or throwing things in that were never explained (like Jackman's not drinking for 9 1/2 years). And the end... well, unless they're doing a sequel, the end just left me thinking ""that's it?"". I'd prefer to watch Mystic River again than this.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Prisoners has terrific performances and a building sense of dread...,"'Prisoners' is about the abduction of two young girls, and follows the investigation through cop Jake Gyllenhaal and desperate father Hugh Jackman.This long mystery thriller never drags despite the runtime, and as the film develops its heartfelt story piece at a time, a nerve-jangling level of suspense and slow-building dread is administered, not to mention a few hard-to-watch scenes. The cast is the reason why you become so invested into the abduction plot, which never stalls for a second, and Hugh Jackman delivers a quite sensational, Oscar-worthy performance as the desperate father who'll go to extreme lengths to get his daughter back.Eventually it meets a satisfactory climax, making a few hair-raising twists and turns on its way to the final events, but not before making you feel simultaneously absorbed and disturbed for the 2.5 hour runtime. 'Prisoners' story will have you hooked from the beginning and stunned at the end, and its great ensemble cast create that bond for you as the viewer into the investment of their situation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Tense, Bleak, Hackneyed and Lazy","Tense, bleak, and nasty, this was a film in which I saw much to admire but ultimately found disappointing and even lazy when I saw it on its initial release. Denis Villeneuve went on to Sicario and other excellent films; revisiting this now, I hoped to see what I'd missed the first time, hoping it cohered more than I remembered and that I could be more in line with the prevailing good opinion of the film.Much of those things to admire remain, especially Roger Deakins's predictably brilliant cinematography. Shot by a lesser talent, it's probable that the film's atmosphere would be considerably less brooding and uncomfortable. My problem with the central criminal's motivation remains - without descending to spoilers, such situations send at least as many in the opposite direction as they do in the general direction that the villain has gone.Hugh Jackman's performance doesn't work (it's far from subtle); Gyllenhaal is better, but his tics seem a little corny. There's little to counteract the problem of Sicario, that the central female character is underwritten; here the wives are adjuncts and those who wait for their men to do what men will do. None of this makes the film less atmospheric or detracts from the artistry; it's just that for me it's not quite the film it wants to be or that Sicario and his other later films would turn out to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Unnecessarily long and drawn out,"I have never seen as many people walk out of a cinema as I did when I went to watch this - I would guess that a minimum of a third of the audience left!! It is ridiculously slow and about an hour too long. The drama is not drawn out at all and you just end up wishing that they'd get on with the storyline. Attempts to draw out the tension are basic and laughable, while the excellent cast are forced to use tortured facial expressions to give the film any semblance of feeling.Overall an incredibly disappointing experience. I was expecting to love this, I ended up wanting to follow everyone else out of the cinema. Ridiculously poor, given the promising subject and excellent cast.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Prisoners: A dark, disturbing, and twisted film","Prisoners is definitely by far one of the best crime thrillers of our generation. It is a very dark environment this film takes place in and the atmosphere is one that is cold and shocking. It attacks your core on a personal level by trying to put you in the characters' shoes, would you have done what Keller(Hugh Jackman) did to try and find his daughter, is one of the huge questions director Denis Villeneuve tries to emphasize on you and throughout you contemplate whether or not it was, which is what really got me on this film. The acting by the two leads is superb, by far my favorite Hugh Jackman role, and Jake Gyllenhaal plays the role like he has done it many times. I must say that the rest of the characters didn't really place their importance in this film besides Paul Dano, and I didn't want it to end the way it did.

So many prisoners,"This film tells the story of two pair of parents, whose respective daughters go missing together. They do whatever they have to go in order to find their daughters.

The ending is not something you could guess from the beginning, which makes the plot even more clever.

"Includes all the great qualities of a crime-thriller, but is dragged by too many irrationalities","After deeply religious father Jackman's daughter goes missing with a neighbor girl, he targets prime suspect Dano while detective Gyllenhaal pursues other leads. The film doesn't necessarily succeed at being epic, but it is terrifically well-paced for clocking-in at over a two-and-a-half hour runtime—director Villeneuve does an excellent job using fade-outs to skip passed the obvious melodrama. The story involves emotions and chills from all aspects of an unthinkable crime, including: the family members of the abducted children, the investigators and even those close to the suspect. Unfortunately, the movie is dragged by too many obvious detective blunders by Gyllenhaal's characters: 1) Whaaa? I can't discreetly park my car in the middle of the road in broad daylight? 2) Whaaa? I'm going to have all family members take a polygraph, but not consider looking into the fact that one of the fathers owns an abandoned building the girls may be at? 3) Whaaa? When I finally find out one of the fathers owns an abandoned building and I establish my new suspicions of him, I SHOULD call a search team? 4) Whaaa? I've been seeing a lot of mazes ever since I started investigating these girls' disappearances. There IS a connection?Another unfortunate downfall is the annoying and awkward light adjustments between interior and exterior scenes.The moral of a film should either raise questions, or provide answers or some sort of hope. This film just kind of confuses, as it doesn't really grasp hold of how suspects are sometimes guilty until proved innocent or how there are some ridiculous limitations the law has at preventing and/or solving crimes. Either: A) make a statement, or B) give the audience something to reflect on. This film seems to do neither.It would be nice to go into a crime-thriller with an open-mind and NOT have to suspend as much disbelief.

"Jackman and Gyllenhaal's Most Impressive Performances Yet,","Prisoners is a fantastic movie with a very well developed and well written plot that is beautifully filmed with an outstanding cast that deliver extremely inspired and dedicated performances. It is without a doubt, in my own opinion, the best acting I have ever seen from both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. I never expected this level of high quality acting from either of them. Jackman stands out especially, like his scenes with Paul Dano, simply intense, dramatic and it's all because of how dedicated Jackman was, the fact that he did not get an Oscar nomination for his performance upsets me, he was absolutely outstanding.The story is really unpredictable and will keep you wondering all the way through. Thr ending. which I will not spoil, is the kind I do not like when most films do it, but it suited this film. I thought it was a clever move that I actually really liked.Prisoners is an outstanding movie that should have been nominated for several Academy Awards, and I would recommend it to all moviegoers, especially fans of drama and thrillers.A dedicated father will do anything he can to find his missing daughter, while the police are only finding more leads to the kidnapping.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Overrated,"First of all this film attempts to do what other films like The Deep End of the Ocean or Ransom or even the latest one Hallie Berry's The Call did. It even has a Mystic River vibe to it for sure however all those films were better. For starters the good; great cast no doubt about that and thank god finally Hugh Jackman IS NOT WOLVERINE! When you see an actor play the same character so much they might as well be on a TV series so it was nice to see him do something else.You got Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Paul Dano who's come so far since the silent older bro. in Little Miss Sunshine. I will add though that Hugh's performance didn't come close to Sean Penn in Mystic River. However the only one i had a problem with was Jake Gyllenhal. This was not one of his better performances and i didn't too much like his character.He reminded me of Brad Pitt in Seven; too headstrong, impatient and not that great a detective. Definitely could've had more of a detective Stabler (L&O SVU) type character (someone with kids). As far as the story goes it was a hot mess. I mean half the time we're following the detective around-not nearly enough parents POV to get the right emotion and then half the crap didn't make any sense with that creepy dude who offed himself.I really didn't think those scenes were that relevant and then the motives of the actual abductor didn't make sense but that doesn't matter cause half the crazy crap people do in real life doesn't make sense.

My only real problem with this film is that I feel they made it slightly too confusing than it needed to be.

The cinematography is simply fantastic and the whole movie is brilliantly captured. The story line has more twists and turns than the rabbit hole Alice fell down, literally keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole time.If you are a fan of psychological thrillers and movies that keep you guessing this is undeniably your proverbial cup of tea.

Shoves you into a bottomless pit of despair and forces you to question your morals.,"speechless. That's how I'm rendered after watching Prisoners. Let me explain first that this film is the complete opposite of feel-good cinema, and I do not recommend it to everyone. You are placed at the epicenter of one of the more sickening stories in recent memory and are forced to question your morality, your ethics, and far you would go past them for you loved ones.Prisoners is unsettling, unnerving, squirm-inducing and twisty. Its script keeps you in a quantum state of uncertainty, with suspense that intensifies like the breath-squeezing embrace of a boa. The sobering cinematography and low-key directing add to this effect and make Prisoners brilliantly atmospheric. It's been a long time since I've felt so suffocated with intimidation.Prisoners gets 4.5 stars and not the magical 5. This is due to the lack of a proper score. The silence works well most of the time and in some scenes works perfectly. However, Prisoners is hard hitting and intense, and a more powerful score would have made the stronger scenes feel much more hair-raising. I know that sounds like nit-picking, but a 5 star movie needs to be damn perfect in every aspect.No matter. Prisoners is an all-consuming challenge that requires your strictest attention. The acting from its ensemble cast is stellar, particularly from Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko). Prisoners is a hard film to sit through, but has an addictive cocktail of ambiguity, suspense, and moral complexity.

This is a tough but rewarding film to sit through and the pacing is good- you will be transfixed throughout. The acting is superb and everyone from Terence Howard and Jake Gyllenhaal to Paul Dano and Melissa Holly shine, but the star act is Jackman who should have received more accolades for his turn as the distraught father in this movie.

"Slow paced, tacky decisions, poorly constructed, and unresearched,","This movie is slow paced and there are many slow long drawn out scenes. the movie would benefit if it moved faster and had different shots & angles and possibly even music in different scenes. personally i feel overall this movie was poorly constructed and would have been much better if worked on by a team of different professionals.this movie lacks some realism. this movies version of realistic scenes is....so holly-woodish and fake. i mean certain scenes seem to me as an avid-movie buff to be.....as real looking as a fake apple is to hold and touch. and the dialogue and decisions of the characters and their character-build are as sharp as a polished marble.some things i didn't like: i didn't like the African American actor who played one of the fathers in this movie. i don't like the way he looks, sounds, or that he couldn't play his instrument in the beginning, and i don't like his comments. i would have preferred him to be someone else with different dialogue, and directions.i don't like how the detective in this movie looks like a frickin ex-con prisoner. when i first saw him i thought he was the antagonist/bad-guy. the detective was made to look this way cause some fool in the production crew thought this was the hot-guy look teens go for and maybe her personal preference for men so she (or he?) made this character look this certain ex-con fashionable way. to me his look and the things he says and does is totally unprofessional. I didn't like how the detective talks to his boss (captain) with disrespect and disdain in his voice as if he is superior to him- the the captain hearing and witnessing this disrespect allowed it and seemed incompetent. this to me seems entirely unresearched and fabricated. in other words it's unrealistic. if a detective talks to his commanding officer in any agency in any town the way this fellow does in this movie he would be looking for a new job quick. yet im supposed to buy that this hipster cool detective can get away with this? why? and his captain is some loser behind a desk? is this a comedy? no. its just badly written because it's unrealistic.Anyway...the detective is supposed to be some genius of a guy who has solved all six of his cases and the actor who plays him does as good of a job as he can with poor dialogue and direction but unfortunately its not enough to save his poorly constructed decisions. what i mean is- this actor does what he is told to do- and he is told to do some dumb things by the director/writer. otherwise i have no problem with the way he looks or talks to his captain. what i mean is- he is SUPPOSED to be a genius detective but what he actually does and says in this movie opposes his role as a genius because there is nothing highly intelligent about discussing astrological signs in his opening scene, being disrespectful to his boss, and disregarding rules and doing things by the book. nothing he does is really special at all is what i mean.....he has this higher than thou attitude but what we see him do in the movie is new yorker-ish in the bad attitude sense and is common! so he is written and introduced by another character as being ""special"" but he does nothing special! His actions are rudimentary and unprofessional- that is why i say this movie is poorly constructed and poorly researched!This movie reminds me of some South Korean thriller movies but are not as fast paced and fun to watch as them. I recommend you watch The Chaser and I Saw the Devil if you liked this junky movie.The things I liked about this movie: The main characters Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have great acting skills and presence in this movie. they are likable fellows and i enjoy seeing them in this movie and have an affection for them because of other movies i have seen them in. they practically save this poorly structured and poorly written movie. without them this movie would appear on Lifetime channel as a TV movie as it is poorly made like one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Deep, absorbing thriller digging further than you might have expected it to","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningKeller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are plunged in to every parent's worst nightmare when their daughter goes missing, along with the daughter of their close friends Franklin (Terence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis.) The finger of suspicion ends up pointing at Alex (Paul Dano), a local impaired boy, but due to a lack of evidence, Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the detective in charge of the investigation, is forced to let him go, much to Keller's chagrin. He takes the law in to his own hands in a desperate bid to find out where his daughter is, but nothing is quite as it seems and the real reason behind the girl's disappearance may be deeper buried than they thought.Sometimes, a simple, straight-forward story can work on far more levels and have a lot more to it if there are some strong human dynamics behind the scenes of it, i.e. in this case the ultimate nightmare of any parent, the loss of a child. Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners sets itself on a much grander scale than your average staple thriller, driven as it is by a strong sense of dark, forbidding atmosphere and stark exploration of human emotions and dynamics. In short, it has a lot more going for it than your typical thriller of it's ilk, filling every second of it's two and a half hour running time with hidden depths that just keep on coming, even if at times it all just does feel a little over whelming.While it's cascading down this emotional roller coaster ride, it's careful never to forget or unduly expose the mystery element to the story, keeping up the suspense over the missing girls and who or even what could be behind their disappearance. For material of this length, strong performances are a no brainer, and indeed we have revelatory turns from lead stars Gyllenhaal, turning in maybe his most intense, driven performance yet as the detective under pressure from others that never lets up, driven mad by constant potential break-throughs that lead nowhere, but it's Jackman as the tormented parent who possibly makes the biggest impression, channeling his Wolverine anger into something that will gain him more appreciation with a different audience.In aiming that bit higher than your typical thriller fare, Prisoners may be a bit too much for some to take in, and occasionally it is a little pretentious and see-through in trying to be deep, but it is no less of an accomplished effort that succeeds in what it sets out to do. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

You shouldn't want to miss it.Also Paul Dano is at his best and I think Denis Villeneuve is one of the best taking out the best from his crew.

Thrilling but sombre,"I think you have to be in the right mood for this movie. It does have some rather protracted scenes and the various plot lines don't come together especially well.

On the other hand, if you are in the frame of mind for a whole bunch of creepy haunted house sequences and prepared to tolerate some rather nasty scenes, then you may well enjoy the way it develops. It's grey toned and slow but packs a real punch at times, with some edge of your seat moments. Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but a worthwhile investment of your time.

Disturbingly amazing,"Prisoners has story and performance that are great just by themselves, though, together they are what makes the film a true gem of cinema. The premise is legitimately terrifying in its presentation. The weight, severity, and tension of the film feel so real that, at times, it does what every film should do; make its fiction appear as reality to you.Though Jake Gyllenhaal is very good in this, I do feel that Hugh Jackman steals most, if not all, the attention with his performance. He's a really good in most of his other work, poor in some (more than likely bad story/bad direction), but it is in Prisoners he shows how much can come from his acting. I would equate it to the passion seen in his role as Jean Val Jean in Les Miserables. Perhaps that's what it is. He can be good with subtlety, however, it is in the passion of emotion that he does best. As Keller Dover he is nothing but passionate, yet, he is very real. He bursts out in anger in one scene, is told to calm, does so, and even apologizes for his outburst yet still persists with a degree of intensity that is clearly from being upset rather than just raw anger. There are many more scenes like this that succeed so well at removing you from just watching a movie and takes you on intimate experience of story telling that feels undeniably and hauntingly real. This is probably one of his best performances if not the principal one.Few could get away with doing a film like this and call it good. Fewer doing so in exemplary fashion. This is one of the fewer. It's honestly very good actors with a very good director showing you human character in a narrative that is by no means an easy one to tell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Near perfect thriller progressing on a very slipery ground,"I am stopping short of calling Prisoners a masterpiece because it actually does not feel very original, but hell, everything is masterly done in every department here.When you shoot a movie on this well-trodden topic there are hundreds of mistakes waiting to happen to eventually deliver something that rings wrong, is not tense enough, too sentimental or too gloomy and gruesome. Or simply something that just looks like a rehash.I agree the references are pretty obvious when you know your genre but the flow of narration does not leave you time to think about it, which is exactly the point about good references only making the basic elements of a new story. Aside from all the critics you can dismiss as the Icebox Logic moaners, I agree that at some point you may want the characters to connect the dots faster. But you see the characters squinting, blinking because they can never have a good sleep and they are grasping at straws so the direction perfectly impounds your train of thought to make it secondary to the characters' emotional distress and personal struggles.In the end this cannot be as strong a movie as The Vanishing (1988) although they aim to encapsulate this also, but it masterfully mixes different point of views without doing one too many and only just barely stretching the emergency timeline.In other words I don't feel like being finicky in retrospect when I am dealing with guys who absolutely know what they are doing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"However flawed, the superlative acting makes it worth-seeing...","The father of one of two abducted little girls kidnaps, imprisons and tortures a young man he believes was responsible; meanwhile, a detective on the case finds two additional suspects who may have had some involvement. Unpleasant but undeniably gripping effort with strong performances, though the locale--a rainy blue collar town (shot mostly in Georgia)--fails to come to life. Cars race around through different neighborhoods and we lose our bearings, which may be the fault of director Denis Villeneuve. There's also some awkward confusion over the initial suspect's arrest: he's held and then released, he's conveniently catatonic in the police station but mutters something odd to the angry father out in the parking lot, he can't pass a lie detector test without understanding the questions yet he has a driver's license. There's also some fudging by screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski, who would rather toss in trunks full of snakes and mazes on the walls then tell us how some crazy acting man managed to get two rambunctious little girls into his camper.

HK Auteur film review - Prisoners,"When Keller Dover's daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads. But just how far will he go to protect his family?Prisoners has the strongest ensemble cast of 2013 and everybody brings their A game. Keller Dover is Hugh Jackman's most raw and complex role yet, as Jackman plays Dover's wavering belief of the justice system and descending morality to a realistic precision. Things get murky as Dover takes matters in his own hands on an unconfirmed suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) and traps himself between being desperate, angry and helpless.Jake Gyllenhaal, sporting a neck tattoo and facial tics, creates the realistically compelling Detective Loki. The character is a fascinating inward look to how police detectives conduct their investigations, interrogate suspects and how the job centers on being emotionally removed from the crime itself. Loki is even darkly funny at times because he is so distanced from the crime and committed to procedures that normal things seem outlandish to him.Roger Deakins's cinematography brings layers of shades into the perpetually cloudy and otherwise flat-looking suburbia. The moody atmosphere embodies a sinister undertone; whether the location is a forest, a kitchen or a washroom, it feels like someone is lurking behind the corner. Mirroring its main characters, the cinematography impressively supports the story with a growing sense of insecurity.Denis Villeneuve directs ambitiously, as Prisoners juggles between being a character study of two families dealing with a kidnapping, a crime mystery plot and the theme of the institution versus the individual. Retrospectively, in total Alfred Hitchcock-coined ""refrigerator logic"" terms, the film does not entirely deliver on all three. Maria Bello, Viola Davis and Terrence Howard's characters do get sidetracked. The story thematically switches between whatever is the most interesting in the given moment, which in the moment is powerfully engaging.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""B"" level suspense thriller turned into melodrama that takes itself too seriously and drags on far too long","It seems Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale were allegedly considered for lead roles but all turned them down. After watching the film I do understand why. ""Prisoners"" is way too long movie (153 minutes) - almost like compiled TV mini-series - with lot of plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film. Movie isn't bringing much new to the tradition of crime thrillers and missing children horror stories too. The film's best quality is the atmosphere, while actors like Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo and Maria Bello are wasted, mainly due to thin characterization. An ineffective ending leaves you with the feeling of wasted time, too. In terms of a recommendation, it's a borderline call. On second viewing (year after) I realized that I forgot almost whole movie which means that, no matter how engrossing story is, its too familiar script makes you not to memorize it. I did like it of first viewing (Rating: 7) but on second (Rating: 6-) I did realized how much script holes, gimmick acting, underwhelming script it had. At the end, it is just an another cheap pulp detective story with A-list actors.Rating: 7-/6 (Just because of Jake Gyllenhaal too much blinking and sadistically Hugh Jackman too much raving)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

It's a must!,"'Prisoners' is a thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve which tells the story about the disappearance of Anna Dover, a six-years-old girl from Pennsylvania. Anna's father, a middle-aged man interpreted by Hugh Jackman, will do anything to find her. The cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki and Paul Dano as the first suspect of the case. The plot focuses on the conflict between a desperated father and a slow investigation by detective Loki, in Anna Dover's missing case. While the father believes Paul Dano is the kidnapper, the police can't prosecute him because they do not have enough evidence.The film is intriguing due to an original screenplay that makes you suspect about every character. The actors, especially Hugh Jackman, give moving and believable performances, and the directing is excellent as well as its photography. Don't miss it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Awesome movie, breathtaking till the end and awesome acting","I really loved this movie, it was thrilling until the very end. Didn't feel like 150 minutes at all and for the first time watching it pretty much messes with you because each time I thought I knew what was going on I realized that I knew nothing at all.I can really recommend watching this movie!! I loved the acting, it was really great! I was surprised how the main actors (Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal) played along and made each other look even greater. But Paul Dano really took me by surprise, mainly because I never heard of him neither have seen anything he acted in, but yet his acting in his role really impressed me, especially that he was so memorable next to such great actors!Also I'd like to add that I have watched this movie a few times already, but it was most impressive during the first watch of course ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Though a bit long....The film will hold your attention captive,"The first time I seen the preview for Prisoners I knew it would be something that I would really enjoy. To summarize, 2 families kids are abducted and the race to save them before they are found dead or never seen again. Hugh Jackman is the father who goes to extreme measures to find the missing kids. Jake Gyllenhaal is the detective in the film who does what he can to aid the search and find these kids.The acting in the film is really good especially Jackman and J. Gyllenhaal. It's a tense film from beginning to the end. The film is almost 2 hours and 30 minutes which is way past my attention span for a movie but for some odd reason I couldn't stop watching. This could have been a 10 star rating but my main issue was the ending. Not sure if other reviews mentioned it but I do feel they could've brought some closure to the situation as a whole. Besides that one of the best movies I have seen all year. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Full of itself but ...,".. decent show .Over serious. Way too drawn out but a very well crafted and acted out drama.8.2 is a ludicrous rating and anyone going in expecting a modern classic will be disappointed.If this film is on your list to watch , like it was mine for a few years then honestly I'd catch up on other 'classics' you have on the list because this certainly isn't one.Reminded me very much of Zodiac 2007 in which people absolutely ranted and raved about and I just watched wishing the boredom would end.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Exciting, suspenseful and riddling.","This movie really captured the fear of losing someone you really love. As a father, Hugh Jackman played it really well, showing how much his daughters means to him. Jake Gyllenhaal marked one of his good role in this movie. Throughout the movie, i was on the edge of my seat, never knowing what would happen next. It was good enough to keep me awake from start to the end, not only because of the intense, bloody and suspenseful scenes, but also because the movie made it really hard for the audience to predict the truth about the abduction of the kids. There are of course heartbreaks and shocks throughout this movie, I totally recommend this for parents and people that likes mystery and thriller movies. This movie is probably perfect for parents so they can watch their kids more carefully and know the consequences if they don't.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Interesting, but could have been better","An intricate plot keeps this drama interesting for a film that almost seems to be preying on every parent's worst fear, that their children will be abducted. It's tense, has several brutally tough moments, and it's tough to guess exactly where it's going. I liked the intensity of the performances as well as the filming location, which takes us to this small town, though I was surprised it was done in Georgia instead of Pennsylvania, where the story is set.My reservations were around the film feeling a little too Hollywood, if that makes any sense. The details in the setup invariably factoring in, the vigilante dad, the black neighbors present but subordinate, and the cop who repeatedly breaks the law in how he pursues the case leading up to the big, canned moments towards the end - it all feels a little produced. It was also hard for me to like the out of control behavior from the dad and cop (Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal) given all the things they do. That's of course one of the points, that anger and frustration can turn people into demons, but the film wants it both ways, with the cop being a hero and the father really being a good guy at heart, praying to God often, and just doing everything he can for his kids. It should have picked one side or the other, and probably should have been pared down as well. It's entertaining if you're looking for a wild ride and a good popcorn drama, but just kind of standard stuff, and could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Intense and gripping story with some high quality acting,"I was not expecting anything particularly impressive when I went to see this thriller. However, the dark and tormented nature of this movie and the characters within it had me attentive throughout the whole two and a half hours. The movie was very successful in building scenes of tension and keeping the story flowing. Hugh Jackman and Paul Dano's acting performances were perfect for this movie and I found myself feeling their emotions and their pain. The plot twists admittedly were slightly predictable and were not why I would rate this movie 10 stars.

The finest crime drama flick I have seen in as long as I can remember.,"What do you say after watching a movie like Prisoners? What words can describe the intense emotional crisis it instills in you? The moral dilemma it puts you in? The only thing one can blame this movie for is the psychological impact it will have on the viewer while and after watching it. Everything worked perfectly to bring 'Prisoners' to life.I'll start off by acknowledging the brilliance of director of photography Roger Deakins (A.S.C) on this film. Most people don't realize how crucial the cinematography of a film is and how it affects the story. Deakins created the quintessential atmosphere for a movie with such a story as Prisoners, blending it in with its (the movie) cause. The dark stormy weather, the snow cover, the wet roads, the calm ghostly neighborhood etc all these elements came together to enhance the constant feeling of dread you experience. Roger Deakins selected the right lenses and produced the right lighting necessary for the movie's gloomy appearance. I admire director Denis Villeneuve for understanding the importance of the visual aspect of Prisoners and fastidiously focusing a great deal on it. He and Roger worked together to create the atmosphere fit for a crime/drama/thriller, which is the kind you find in pictures like Shutter Island, The woman in Black, The Descent, Silent Hill etc. This should be a paradigm for flicks of these genres. If it had been set on a beautiful sunny day in a noisy neighborhood with Hispanic Chicano music resounding, this would have taken away the tension and Denis understood this clearly. Obviously Villeneuve is also greatly responsible for the visual merit of the movie. Prisoners does not rely on one aspect per se, it is a perfect collabo between those working in front of the camera and those behind it.The story. Obviously the story is the winner here. After Keller Gover (Hugh Jackman)'s daughter and her friend go missing, he realizes the police isn't helping much so he decides to act upon it himself. He does everything in his power to try to find his and Franklin's (Terrance Howard) daughter before they get in any real danger. As time passes and pressure builds, Keller finds himself in a difficult and depressive position in which he is forced to act violently in order to find out the truth about the disappearance of the two girls. His wife Grace (Maria Bello) falls into an emotional abyss and mental disconnection from reality as she copes with the tragic event. Keller is willing to do whatever it takes to save his missing girl, even if it involves acting like a maniac. The story is marvelously written by Aaron Guzikoswki whose work I'm definitely looking forward to seeing again. I particularly liked the way it unfolded on a steady pace, in synch with the protagonists' gradually degenerating psyche. The plot is not exactly perfect though, and I can't discuss the imperfections without spoiling it but what I can say is that there are a few plot holes here and there albeit generally harmless.The Acting. With a cast that is only too familiar with Oscar nominations and wins, it is hard not to get inadvertently involved with the characters they portray. Hugh Jackman (Academy & Golden Globe Awards for Les Misérables) gave probably the best performance of his career. The anger, confusion, sadness, depression, frustration..all brilliantly portrayed in such a perfect way that you're sure you would have done the same thing if put in his character's position. Often times we yell at people in the movies for doing the wrong or stupid thing and making dumb decisions but with Jackman, you relate to each word he says and decision he makes. I particularly liked the scene where Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) goes to Keller's house to tell him and his wife about the progress of the search for their daughter. Keller loses control and starts yelling angrily over this one, then apologizes for his aggressive behavior. Jackman nailed that part. But it's still nothing compared to what he delivers throughout the rest of the movie. This will surely remain a memorable performance, and I think I have a new favorite actor after Leonardo Dicaprio. Jake Gyllenhaal (BAFTA award & Academy award nomination for Brokeback Mountain) gave a remarkable performance as well playing the detective in the midst of this maddening case, caught between trying to find the missing girls and making sure the affected family doesn't cross borders and do something irresponsible. We manage to get under his skin and understand the fact that he chooses no sides, all he is doing and is keeping the law and making sure that things are done in accordance with it. Viola Davis (BAFTA, Academy and Golden Globe nomination for The Help) who plays Franklin's wife Nancy also as usual had an outstanding although brief screen presence. Terrence Howard (Academy Award nomination for Hustle & Flow) proved his true acting abilities and I'm sure he surprised many with his role as Franklin Birch. How painful it was to watch him portray his character. Of course not forgetting Maria Bello (Golden Globe award for The Cooler) who played Keller's devastated wife. All these and the rest of the unmentioned actors' performances were career-high, aside from Wayne Duval who plays dumb captain Richard O'Malley.This genuinely remains one of the few films to have affected me deep down, even though the feeling subsided a few hours later (that makes me sound like a fraud, I know ha ha). But this is not one of those sentimental movies that try too hard to get a tear out of the audience. The story is there, you just deal with your emotions. 8.1/10 is underrating to me, I give it a 9/10 and I swipe away 1 only because of the prodding belief that nothing is perfect. ""Prisoners"" is recommended for Everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Absolutely Amazing Film,"I loved this movie, it was an interesting story told very well, i didn't even notice the long run time and that's always a very good sign.

Gripping and bleak with powerful performances to keep you hooked until the whistle is finally blown.,"'Two wrongs don't make a right' is a common phrase but with Prisoners we may have found an argument against its meaning. It raises the question of what is right and wrong when you are fighting to save a life. This is shown through faith, torture and upbringing with each character's personality questioning these themes. What is right? Who is wrong? And is it right to do wrong?On Thanksgiving the Dover family enjoy dinner at their old friend's house, the Birches. The enjoyment levels are at an all time high, for the only time in the film, until the youngest daughter from each family disappears. The parents begin to search frantically as the cops find the chief suspect in the RV that was parked up the road. This suspect has an IQ of a ten year old and the police believe they should look elsewhere but Keller Dover thinks otherwise and instead chooses his own methods of getting truth from the suspect. Will they find the girls and who will first?Starring Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, Prisoners raises these intriguing issues by pitting the doting father against his daughter's potential kidnapper. As a parent you'd do anything to get those answers and in Dover's case this resorts to torture, imprisonment and fear. In opposition to that we have Jake Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, an officer who relies on hard police work. These two may be aiming for a shared goal but ultimately they are each other's antagonist as they hunt for truth in very different ways. As an audience member it is up to you to decide which one is right.Villeneuve's direction and Guzikowski's script squeeze the themes to tears by covering each angle and every scene in opposing morality questions. At times these are deep but at others they feel forced, such as a priest who has killed a child killer to prevent him from continuing. This is here to be bleak, depressing and full of moral issues and it doesn't let up from that. Its pace is slow, the music dreary, the cinematography grey and wet, all adding to the tone of Villeneuve's piece. The script at times may feel 'on-the-nose' but it does raise these questions through it. Is it right to kill in order to prevent a killer, even if you are a priest?Added to the bleak tone are exceptional performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal. Jackman portrays the grieving father with power and emotion leaving you unsure whether to route for him when he tortures the mentally confused suspect played by Paul Dano. At times his character is empathetic but at others he is frightening. This may become a problem if he was the hero to route for but instead during these scenes we promote Gyllenhaal's Loki to the forefront and it is his desperate search for the truth that we believe in. Gyllenhall also provides a wonderful performance as the Detective who suspects everyone until they are proved innocent. Both of these men can be seen as our protagonist but in reality neither of them are and instead the shared goal is what we route for. You may have a character you believe in but that all depends on which side of the fence you come down on.All in all Prisoners is a powerful movie, oozing in contemporary and moral issues. They are all prisoners in some way or another, even those fighting to put things right. At times the script laces these issues to the max, causing a few overly uncomfortable and expositional scenes but the gorgeous cinematography, towering performances and the cold atmosphere will have you leaving the theatre questioning what your move would be if you were ever in this position. This is not for the faint hearted and if you fancy a light popcorn entertainment film than Prisoners certainly isn't it.Rating: 4.5 / 5Directing: Villeneuve keeps the story's pace slow and adds more power from doing so.Acting: Strong performances from all involved with a star turn from Jackman.Script: A taut script that is let down slightly by nailing the themes too neatly.Cinematography: Deakins keeps it grey putting a shiver continually down the audience's spine.Score: Adds to the tone and engages you fully.Editing: Seamless. The slow pace remains constant and works.Overall: A thought provoking story that keeps you gripped throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

'Prisoners' Holds You Captive,"Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a working class family man with a loving wife (Maria Bello), teenage son, and six-year-old daughter. On Thanksgiving, while at their friends' (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) house, Dover's daughter Anna, and her friend, Joy, go out to play. They never come back. After a police search, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests a disturbed man, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), for the kidnapping. After Jones is released with no charges, Dover kidnaps him to get his own answers, using any means necessary before time runs out.Dover isn't a man yielding some unknown fighting skills that he whips out on bad guys to get answers throughout the course of the movie. This isn't that type of film. He's simply a broken, desperate father in search of his daughter. He doesn't sleep, or even really blink, while the circles under his eyes become just as dark as the narrative. ""Prisoners"" is both parts a gritty detective story and vigilante thriller, and it works on both levels. The performances here, especially Jackman and a chilling Dano, elevate this to one of the better ensembles of the year. The cinematography by Roger Deakins and Director Denis Villeneuve shows a quiet, isolated small-town (constantly drenched in rain since the girls' disappearance) that makes all the unveiling of secrets that much more unnerving.Perhaps ""Prisoners"" most valuable asset is the question it asks audiences: How far will you go for your family's protection? While Jackman's Dover will go to increasingly violent lengths to find his daughter, Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) represents the other side of the moral coin. Birch pleas to him to leave it to the police to investigate the disappearance of their daughters. Are you a better parent if you sit back and wait or take the law into your own hands? While audience members may root for Dover as he carries out his vigilante investigation, they may soon see the kind of toll it can take on a person to commit such violence.""Prisoners"" is an engrossing mystery that will stay with you days after viewing it. The film isn't built around a ""twist"" ending; half way through you may know where it is heading, but it doesn't take away from the excitement or tension of watching it all unfold. The moral issues raised in the film about family, religion, and the law, make this more than just an entertainment experience. Once the credits roll, it will make you look at yourself—especially if you have children—in a different light.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Prisoners (2013): A Film Review,"Pray for the best, prepare for the worst. This is the philosophy by which Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a carpenter living in Pennsylvania, lives by. He tells his teenaged son that the most important lesson his father taught him was to be ready for anything, but nothing could have prepared him for what is about to happen.Dover and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are happily married with a teenaged son and a young daughter. The film opens with them going to eat Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their two children of the same age as the Dover's kids. What starts out as a happy feast between the two families transforms into every parent's worst nightmare when the two young daughters ask if they can go to the Dovers' quickly. The children are allowed to leave, but they never return.Alex Jones (Paul Dano), who was driving an RV through the neighborhood around the same time the girls disappeared, is quickly apprehended and labeled the prime suspect. The problem is, Jones has the IQ of a ten-year-old, meaning there is no way he could successfully kidnap the girls and not leave a shred of evidence. So, he is released into the custody of his aunt (Melissa Leo) with orders to not leave the state. It doesn't come as a surprise that the parents, Keller in particular, are less than thrilled about this.Hugh Jackman has delivered some good performances in the past, most notably as the superhero Wolverine, but this is by far the best performance of his career. As the film progresses, Keller slowly becomes the kind of demon that a religious man like him would condemn. Although he is a man that the audience should feel remorse for, his actions throughout the film make you consider losing faith in him, but they also make you think long and hard about what you would do if you were in the same situation as him.At the opposite end of the spectrum is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the lead detective on the case with a perfect arrest record and a determined look in his eyes. Unlike Keller, Loki doesn't have a personal life to speak of. Instead of celebrating Thanksgiving with family and friends, we see him eating his dinner in a diner and having a conversation with his waitress over the signs of the Chinese Zodiac on his placemat.Throughout the film, Keller and Loki butt heads every time they share the screen. Keller is determined to find his daughter by any means necessary. Loki is just as determined, but police scrutiny and his sound methods are leading the case in a direction that Keller doesn't agree with and there is nothing Loki can say or do that will convince him otherwise.The performances in the film are all top notch. Jackman and Gyllenhaal both deliver the best performances of their careers, each worthy of award consideration. Bello, Howard, and Davis don't have as much screen time as you would expect considering they're the parents just as much as Keller is. Dano, who I never really have liked as an actor, gives a great performance, his character's clothing and just the general look on his face make him seem like a total creep. Leo also shines in a small, but pivotal role, and Wayne Duvall also does some fine work as the chief of police that is making Loki follow the evidence instead of his gut. The real stars here, however, are the people behind the camera. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) had not made an English language film prior to this, but his previous films have displayed his talents from behind the camera and they show again here. Screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) took a generic plot idea and turned it on its side with a script that keeps the audience guessing while incorporating some powerful religious-based overtones to the story. Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's score is electrifying. And the cinematography is some of the best from the great Roger Deakins, who has ten Academy Award nominations dating back to 1991, it's that good.As good a film as it is, Prisoners is not for everyone. Some of most pivotal scenes involve torture that might make you feel uneasy later on. The two-and-a-half hour running time and the slow pacing make the film drag on at certain points. With a little sharper editing, I think this film would have come out just as good, if not better, with a running time of about 20 minutes shorter, but the problem is that I can't think of any scene that would have been better of if left on the cutting room floor. That is my only issue with this movie, though. You will not forget Prisoners after you see it.FILM GRADE: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A truly thrilling, engrossing, & brutal watch.","""Prisoners,"" boasting a remarkable cast including Hugh Jackman, Viola Davis, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, and Paul Dano, is a superbly crafted, inherently bleak thriller by Denis Villeneuve with superlative performances. Hugh Jackman, as Keller Dover, steals the show and then some, demonstrating that there is no line he will not cross to get his child back. The morality dissipates in this thriller, which is equal parts gut-wrenching, depressing, chilling, and riveting. While kidnapping dramas and thrillers are not a novel concept, Villeneuve's assured hand and technical craftsmanship ensure that ""Prisoners"" becomes one of the best in the genre. It's greatly atmospheric, with a pervasive sense of unease throughout; even in its slow moments, the movie doesn't let you relax. Also, here, your heroes become anti-villains or downright villains, giving this thriller an added edge due to its moral ambiguity. Paul Dano is excellent as the suspect, and the scenes between his character and Jackman's are a brutal, engrossing watch.

"""Prisoners"" is free from errors! Great thriller!","I am not going to write too many sentences on ""Prisoners"", so therefore I will set you free with not too many ""punalties"" on my behalf. However, I do have to commend Director Denis Villenueve's brilliant thriller about a desperate father's actions after his daughter is missing. Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career as the Pennsylvania working-class father Keller Dover. On a Thanksgiving, Dover and his wife and two kids were celebrating the holiday at their best friends' home who are the Birches.; I guess those Sons of Birches could not just celebrate the holiday by themselves. Kidding! On that sad day, the Dovers' young daughter Anna and the Birches' young daughter Eve went missing; a mysterious RV parked in front of the Birches' home might have had something to do with it. When the driver of the RV named Alex Jones is arrested as a possible suspect, Keller goes all ""cray cray"" in order for the police not to release him even though there is not suffice evidence to book Jones. Jake Gyllenhaal co-stars as Detective Loki, who is not the real ""loco"" in the picture, but does get obsessed to solve the case and find the missing girls. Villenueve's direction was superb and some might argue that he was sadly missing in the list of Oscar- nominated film directors for 2013. Aaron Guzilowski's screenplay was pure, even though ""Prisoners"" sometimes got locked up with some clichés. It was great to see Jackman hide those big nails and singing voice, and transform himself into a character where he wore his emotions on his sleeve, and Hugh better believe that Jackman delivered the goods with his outstanding performance here. Gyllenhaal was also very good as Loki, as he continues his stellar acting career. Melissa Leo was stunning as the mysterious Aunt of Alex Jones; And speaking of Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones- Paul Dano delivered another effective cringe-worthy work as Alex Jones. Roger Deakins' cinematography of ""Prisoners"" was a scenic tour-de-force, even though I think that Deakins' ""arrested development"" of not getting the Oscars he deserves is a cinetragedy. OK, so I did write way too many pun-induced sentences for ""Prisoners"" after all; I guess that was a ""hard cell"" for you to believe I wouldn't. However, it is an easy sale for me to recommend the excellent ""Prisoners"". ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Best Film of all time,"When i first watched this i was stunned at how good it was. The brilliant acting, the intense plot, the emotional music, the dark cinematography and more importantly, the ending. It leaves you guessing. It's breathtaking.Denis Villenueve pulls off a masterpiece of a film. Most people won't like it due to the fact it takes 2h and 30 mins but I certainly have no problem with it.The entire cast, Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhall, Paul Dano, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Terrence Howard are all amazing. Emotional and powerhouse performances. Johann Johannsen's amazing score gives you chills and complements every single scene. Roger Deakins beautiful and dark cinematography makes for a gloomy setting. Denis Villenueve's direction of the film makes for a film that flows perfectly from scene 1.This is my favourite film of all time and nothing will beat it. It's an underrated masterpiece and you won't be disappointed!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Dense, Haunting, Realistic, And The Best Film of 2013.","""Prisoners"" is a film that floored me on my first viewing and enthralled me on my second. Like most films with a central mystery, Prisoners takes its concept and unravels it into a giant web of intrigue, trapping its viewer and engulfing them in its gloomy universe. However, upon my second viewing, I realized what a dense, symbolic and haunting film this really is. This is without a doubt the best film of 2013: no other drama released this year managed to tap into human fears and desires this well. Every performance is impeccable, namely from the two leading men, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman is the crushed, brokenhearted father, consumed by rage and agony in his desperate attempts to reunite his family. Early in the film, he tells his son to ""be ready. It doesn't matter if it's a hurricane, flood, anything."" Perhaps it is either cruel irony or his character Keller Dover not heeding his own advice, but the way he is forced off the deep end as his psyche crumbles is both draining and curious to watch. Gyllenhaal's character has the most complete development in the film. A man who begins as a straight-shooting detective with a spotless record is transformed by Gyllenhaal into a man tortured by the work he held so dear, a man frozen in fear by his first real challenge in the line of duty. Every supporting performance is airtight and contributes to the film's slow-burning and unbearably tense atmosphere. Every shot lingers on for a time that floats between comfortable and uncomfortable. The cinematography by Roger Deakins and direction by Denis Villenueve are beautiful and capture some incredible shots throughout the film's massive run time. This contrast between direction and editing is one of the many contrasts in Prisoners, most of which are revealed through the film's deep-rooted symbolism. The imagery of crosses and The Lord's Prayer contrast deeply with Jackman's torture of Paul Dano's character throughout the film. The use of mazes as both a symbol and a plot device is ingenious, as the maze is seen to represent a sort of prison, in which the viewer realizes every character is trapped in after seeing the degree to which all of them have been trapped in their vices. The density and intelligence contained in this filmmaking was unmatched throughout the year of 2013. Prisoners is an incredible film and a must-watch for any lover of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Buon Thriller con finale a sorpresa,"All in all a film to be recommended if you want to spend the evening watching a movie with the right ratio of Mystery / Action. The film leaves an uneasy feeling from the beginning observing an isolated and eerie landscape, a feeling that leaves space soon to a sense of the unknown that conveys to the viewer anxiety and curiosity until the end. Excellent interpretation of Hugh Jackman who exudes the pain of a father who sees his daughter disappear from a moment. Leaves something to be desired the character starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), which seems to keep a detached attitude and shallow for the whole course ot the interlacing and then, inexplicably, spurting determination and investigative spirit to the very last frames. The plot is Very nice overall, just some nonsense leaves the viewer some faded unresolved question mark at the end of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
unlimited tension,"wow, a lot of time without seeing a movie like that. I finished exhausted because of the two and a half hours of pure tension. Maybe the dramatic overload of a developing kidnapping is the great hook for sustain the tension and interest for so much time. However I think the performances, the unexpected, help. I think an interesting thing is the way the characters acquire and manage information. The dosage of information seems carefully designed. The detective, the captain, the reaction of Mr Dover, etc, are far from clichés. I've experienced how the characters were confused and desperate like me, and that was possible (I think) thanks to the way the movie deliver information. No geniuses unveiling facts, characters are like people, they have hits and misses, very realistic. I liked the movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Awesome Movie !!!,The best thriller ever !!! the best abduction movie ever !!! The best acting from Hugh Jackman !!!!! Best movie of 2013 as of yet !!!!

There were some scenes that got me on the tip of the chair!!! the camera action was outstanding! All in all you all need to see this movie!!! Jackman deserves Oscar for his amazing performance ... perfectly paced thriller ... none stop suspense and action ...

An excellent thriller with a solid human drama centre,"Two average suburban American families, meet up to celebrate Thanksgiving together, everything is normal, safe and secure.Both families take great care to ensure their younger daughters are accompanied between households. Whilst out, they briefly climb and play on an RV that is parked in the street, they come back inside the house.Later they decide to out again, same ritual but this time they do not come back, the older children did not accompany them, everything is not normal, nothing will ever be safe and secure again.The parents of ""Anna"", god fearing and practical survivalist ""Keller Dover"" (Hugh Jackman) and his wife ""Grace"" (Maria Bello), look in all the usual places. The respective parents of ""Kyla"", ""Franklin"" (Terrence Howard) and ""Nancy"" (Viola Davis) also come up short, the young girls have disappeared, the police are called.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) has seen it all before, he is sympathetic, diligent and above all, realistic. The Police get a lucky break, the RV is spotted locally and before long the driver is in custody.Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is everyone's idea of someone that could abduct young children, with Jeffrey Dahmer style glasses, strange ways, hushed voice and the mental age of a ten year old. Soon he is a prime suspect, but following questioning the police are obliged to let him go.The film centres around how far you would go, to find out what you need to know. If the information is important enough, what might you do to find your loved ones? To use the well known quote from Nietzsche, ""Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process, he does not become a monster"".When the children disappear, the initial casual concern escalates and is believably portrayed, making every parents nightmare real. The film asks some difficult questions, with no easy answers. Hugh Jackman plays a character we have not seen from him before. Whilst on occasion the acting is visible, perhaps due to how we normally perceive him. However, this is most definitely no Wolverine in civvies. All the central characters are good, notably Gyllenhaal and Jackman who are given the most to do.Davis and Bello as the grieving mothers are equally strong, as their known world starts to collapse around them. Both cope in different ways, driving a wedge into their relationships with their partners.However, Dano is the actor to watch. With so few words of dialogue, he still manages to convey a character who is at once, terrified, an object of pity, suspicion and yet still very obviously human.The film is filmed in a gritty down to earth, suburban grey and rain soaked style. Like the ""Killing"" TV series or ""Seven"", without the horror element. These are real people, in ordinary locations and everyday clothes. The abnormality of the crime screaming from behind white picket fences.There is much portentous music and on occasion we are being told what to feel but overall, this is classy, intelligent work. Guessing who did what, when and why is what these movies are all about and this does not disappoint.Some have drawn parallels with the War on Terror, this reviewer did not draw that conclusion, although it could be easily found. On this occasion, maybe a ""cigar is just a cigar"", what you see is what you get.By necessity the film is adult in content, however the violence is not gratuitous and whilst certain undercurrents exist, there is nothing obvious to make viewing uncomfortable. The ending deserves a mention, knowing when to fade to black is an art. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve in his largest project to date, has chosen well.SummaryAnchored with strong performances, an excellent thriller with a solid human drama centre.A long film at 153 minutes but they disappear quickly, with the audience desperate to know what happens next.Recommended",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Some merits and DE merits of the movie,The movie was awesome and mind blowing. but the main reason that i rated it 9 and not 10 is because it was very slow and at some times boring also. at many points it seemed that may be there are just stretching for example the part in which Hugh Jackson goes again and again to the house to beat that poor kid. Over all the movie was good and it was full of surprises. even till the end of the movie i was pretty much sure that the kid Hugh Jackson has locked up was the culprit but that old lady just came out of no where. another thing that i didn't like was that they left the movie like an open book. they should have concluded it and should have shown that her daughter was safely retrieved at that she was again re united with her family. leaving the movie like this was giving to ideas that may be that kid was never found and she died in that deep dark hole.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"amazing masterpiece, definitely worth multiple watches","There isn't a single bad thing I can say about this movie, the acting was so professional, the directing was amazing and the story line was one of the best I've ever scene.
Throughout the whole movie you are on edge, itching to know wha happens next. when I watched it for the first time I was trying to put together the pieces of what happens and awarding myself when doing so. the plot is so multi layered, and the ending (even though some may doubt) I can personally say I loved. the musical choice throughout the movie was perfect, made the tense scenes feel so realistic and once again put you in such a sense of dread and on edge. still now I am just figuring out some of the aspects of the movie and it will linger with me. the attention to detail in this film is so immaculate and so well done.

Very atmospheric thriller,"2 kids are abducted, a good detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is on the case but the father of one (Hugh Jackman) feels he should take matters into his own hands.Great, top stuff. Director Dennis Villeneuve probably takes a leaf from Vorbrydelsen/The Murder, and creates a tense, bleak atmosphere, where it always rains and things look glum. Bit like Manchester to be honest. The cast is very good and the plot keeps you guessing to the end, keeping the suspense high. Reminds a bit of a not-much-seen Paul Walker film called Nowhere to Run in places, and in other places Silence of the Lambs. It is better than both though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A Gut-Wrenching, Emotional, Unpredictable Thriller","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.1/5 starsAn edge-of-the-seat thriller in the truest sense of the term. You'll keep guessing right till the end and will never be able to see the shocking plot twists coming. Credit needs to be bestowed upon the Director and script writer. Supplementing their vision to great effect are the superlative skills amply displayed by the editor and cinematographer. What we get is a tense, somber, atmosphere with palpable tension and despair.And finally down to the performances. ""Prisoners"" boasts of an ensemble cast and boy do they deliver the goods. Viola Davis and Terrence Howard bring a sense of grit and fortitude to the hopelessness they face in their concise roles, while Maria Bello is a picture of grief in her limited screen time. Paul Dano is a past master at playing complex characters and he pulls of yet another winner. Melissa Leo was all but unrecognizable until you realize it was her once the credits start rolling. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a sound and assured performance meriting an Oscar nomination in the supporting category.But it's Hugh Jackman who acts the hell out of his portrayal of a desperate father driven to a frantic edge. It is without question the best performance of his career and so far the performance of the year too. I think the best accolade that can be give to this fine actor is that his act in ""Prisoners"" literally makes us forget his iconic role of ""Wolverine"" in the ""X-Men"" series and spin-offs.Along with being a nail-biting ride from start to finish, ""Prisoners"" also succeeds in being an emotional roller-coaster and even involves the viewers by making us relate to the moral ambiguity of the protagonists, and the lengths to which they are willing to go to save a loved one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Why didn't it get any Oscars?,"there are some things in this review you could see as spoilers.""Prisoners"" is about Dover Keller. A caring and loving father with a daughter and a son. The movie starts of with Kellers family and Franklins having a thanksgiving celebration. This beginning gives a light tone to the movie. But it also gives you a warm feeling. Keller then tells his daughter and the daughter of Franklin that they should go and play in the basement. Hereafter the camera focuses on a tree while zooming in on it and there is scary movie on the background. (I know it sounds stupid but it is beautifully shot) After this scene you know that there is something wrong. And there is, both girls have disappeared. They have been kidnapped. Keller has to be one himself to find the girls, but that doesn't come with no trouble...The directing of the movie is just amazing, every shot was beautiful. The director (Denis Villeneuve) chose nice angles to shoot from and I also like that he used almost no hand held camera's. The realistic feel to the movie was also a fun feature. An example is the torture scene. This is a very thrilling scene, and this is due to the realistic tune. Like the make-up on the beaten face, and the blood on the knuckles of Keller. Very much enjoyed that the movie kept you on the edge of your seat during the entire movie. The cinematography of the movie was also amazing. The cinematographer was Roger Deakings. But I didn't really like the ending. It was an open ending and I never really like those. Nolan does these things normally too in his movies, but I don't mind it in his because the story has ended. In this movie you still are wondering how it goes on and you don't have that with Nolans movies. But ""prisoners"" was still goodThe acting in ""Prisoners"" was just flawless. Hugh Jackman as Dover Keller was very convincing as a loving dad. When he beats Alex Jones you can see the hate in his eyes, but there is also regret. This a way better performance by Jackman than in Wolverine. His character is very well written and due this you can also see how determined he is to find the two little girls. Jake Gyllenhaal was just amazing as a cop. But this wasn't really a surprise. You can see that he really wants to find the two girls but is hold back by the rules. This is something Keller doesn't seem to follow... Paul Dano as Alex was just the perfect casting choice. I just adored his character. He was the best written and developed character of the entire movie it was also brilliant acted. Even the child actors were good. Dylan Minnette as the son of Dover was really good. I very much liked the scene in the beginning of the movie where he and Eliza are talking about hunting, it was a very well written scene just like the entire movie. Terrance Howerd gave a very good performance. And Maria Bello was also very good as a worried and desperate mother. The script of the movie is just brilliantly written. And the last person I am going to talk about is Melissa Leo. She was just so good. She played an innocent women who is the mother of Alex.But now something more about the ending. I know that I have said that I didn't really like I, But the is just the final minutes. Because the last 30 minutes were very thrilling and exciting. I very much enjoyed the twist in the end. They made you think throughout the movie that Alex did it or Bob, but it turns out to be someone else. I really didn't see that twist coming.But overall this is an amazing movie and I am really surprised that it didn't get any Oscars. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Script is both visually stunning and superb written and so is the acting,"One of the finest thrillers I've seen, it has some spectacular writing and my first time watching it I was mind blown in how good it was, one of the best movies I've seen at the time and it holds up at the second watching. This is one of those stories, crime mysteries that can sadly happen in the real world so this could possibly be based on a real case. The writer, director and cast all make the movie so real, it's just magnificent. The musical score is perfect, setting the mood and atmosphere and gives us a true mystery and thriller feel. The director, Denis Villeneuve showed how good an director he is with the visual story telling and that is where the movie is strongest. Cinematography is insanely good, one thing I liked was the long shots as it gave the actors to really act and be the character which they did and provided emotion to the roles. This movie will always have a strong place in my heart as one of my favorite movies and also one of the movies that made me gain interest in psychology and criminology. This is a movie that is great from start to finish!The acting is just extraordinary: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Paul Dano. All of them did such believe and superb performances, making it one of the special things about the movie. The whole ensemble cast did great, even the younger cast.

I found that the puzzles in the film and the hidden parts that we don't see are amazingly delivered to us and in the end I felt like the movie did not show me what i need to see but I know what happened and it made me feel awesome. The plot and the twists in the movie are impressive, and the fair ending was satisfying. Jackman and Gylenhaal were just perfect for the film, Melissa Leo as always was very impressive... I wanted to see more of Bello's appearances in the movie, but she was OK too... and Terrance Howard and Viola Davis were such a perfect and real match.

Heart Wrenching Piece,I have watched various films much like a psychological thriller but nothing has ever come close to this. The prisoner with the talents of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhall keep you on the edge of your seat. The most interesting thing is when you finally get to grips with what is going on you see the plot go the opposite direction. But be warned that this film is very related to reality and the emotions experienced by parents in the most unimaginable darkest hour of ones life. The emotions explored in this film will leave you will a scar that will never be removed I felt as though I was somehow glued to my seat. Hugh Jackman has very much secured himself a Oscar in my eyes and I hope you agree with me to. Jake plays very much out of his comfort zone and it is a wonderful ride. But the cinematography really opened doors don't be fooled by the dark moment in between every scene it is very much worth it. If you have not yet seen this film it is one to keep in mind because it is one that will surely be worth while.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Great Film!!!!,"From start to finish, this movie had my wife and I on the edge of our seats. I left the theater feeling like I'd been on the Drop of Doom at 6 Flags.

Keeps you wondering even after it's over.Absolutely outstanding script and performances. The actors really sunk their teeth into the respective characters, and created some very memorable work.

They are hard to watch not for the squeamish at all but at the same time one of the most memorable experiences in cinema of the last decade. Prisoners is no exception I cannot say for sure if you will be able to watch any of his films the second time but I can assure you they will stick with you and be memorable.This is taking revenge thrillers up a notch and the pacing is beautiful the puzzles fall into place never before time just at the right moment. But you forget the puzzle at times and just want to stop feeling what's going on through your body while watching it.The story revolves around the kidnapping of two little girls and the struggle of the parents to find them to get them home safely with the help of the detective (jake) .

Still at a Lost for Words!,"I still remember how I reacted after seeing Prisoners for the first time when it was released in theaters. It was one of the best thrillers I have ever seen and it was a disturbing watch. Now viewing it for a second time, those thoughts stay the same. The two and a half hour long movie takes the slow burn approach in telling the story, but that makes it even the better. Roger Deakin's cinematography is very effective as he draws on bleak, cold colors to bring us a constant sense of foreboding. I have never seen a movie as tense and it was almost a relief when the credits finally rolled up. But this is the kind of movie that will stay with you for weeks on end.Denis Villeneuve's film is about a man named Keller Dover who does all he can including bending the law to find his missing daughter who just suddenly disappeared with her friend after Thanksgiving dinner. There is Detective Loki who is assigned to the case and he must keep an eye on Keller while he puts all of his effort in finding the missing girls.There are no words to describe the acting of the film because it's just so darn good. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are the stars of the show as they deliver career-best performances. Hugh is fantastic as the screaming and clawing Dover who goes beyond the law to achieve his means. Gyllenhaal is the smart detective whose mannerisms including those facial tics are part of the character and his personality. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis deliver magnificent performances as the other kidnapped girls parents. Paul Dano was excellent as one of the suspects who can hardly utter a word. Finally, Melissa Leo is beyond recognizable as she delivers a creepy performance.Overall, Prisoners is not entertaining in a sense you would call a blockbuster, but it's a character study that shows what a parent would do to protect his loved ones. It's an undeniably a hard watch, but it may be worth that. This is the kind of film that you will never forget and it's a shame how this film got snubbed by the Academy. This is a foreboding, dark crime thriller and is one of the best films of 2013. Also for that ending......well it's an open book and everyone may have their own interpretations. I didn't like it too much the first time around, but it grew on me for the second time. The film surely packs a punch. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Mind-Numbing Experience! ♦ 86%,"It took me few minutes of thought to finally realize the implication and the meaning of the title. What would've been a pleasant experience of a crime investigation story about abductors, turned out to be a mind- numbing experience, thanks to the writers for instilling the little details of life values.Jake Gyllenhall is very good as a cop, but Hugh Jackman steals the limelight and proves he's more than meets the eye (Wolverine?). Supporting cast is good and Paul Dano is just terrific with what was given to him. There is nothing new about the story, in itself. But then it evolves into something bigger & thankfully DEEPER, which is the only reason it stands out. Other factors that sweep the experience into a great thing are the refined & genius music, fine cinematography & a brilliant direction. The period attribute is critically thought-upon and serves the main strong-point. How families react when a member disappears is shown on a larger scale.The character study is also a point to be noted while you watch. Certain elements in the film could've be done without because the confuse more than they adhere. Except that I thought the editing could've been more strict, Prisoners is another great experience of the year. Kudos to the crew!BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended!

"Dark, Complex, and Haunting","Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners (2013) is an incredibly dark, gritty crime drama. Very much a modern film, it combines realistic–if unusual–plot and characters with morally complex questions and situations. Additionally, the film is layered with symbolism, which presents no problem for a casual viewer, as it can be ignored in favor of plot, though analytical and intellectual viewers will probably enjoy puzzling through the various symbols presented in the film.The premise is simple: two families, with the help of a detective, search for their children, who have disappeared and are believed to have been abducted. The plot, however, grows increasingly complex as the film progresses, though it never becomes muddled or difficult to follow, and the twists and turns never become unrealistic, though they are unexpected. The action of the film mostly centers on Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a man whose young daughter has gone missing. The story deals mainly with his desperate search, and many of the moral issues that arise in the film derive from his growing desperation. Also central to the plot is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man with a mysterious and troubled past who has been assigned to the case. Terrence Howard also stars as the father of the other missing girl. All three turn in excellent performances, and the supporting cast is also excellent, with convincing performances from Viola Davis, Maria Bello, and Paul Dano. David Dastmalchian is also superb in a minor role.Many of the minor aspects of the film were also done very well. It has been nominated for an Oscar in Cinematography, an honor which it well deserves. The somber late-autumn weather provides a striking backdrop for the story, and the bleakness of the imagery complements the overall tone of the film. In addition, the soundtrack is very effective. Very minimalistic, it largely utilizes only strings (occasionally with a solo cello), at times echoing of Arvo Part's Fratres. It too complements the coldly eerie atmosphere.I very much enjoyed this movie (though perhaps enjoyed is not exactly the right word). It is the first film that I consciously thought while watching, ""This might be the best movie I've ever seen"". I'm not sure that it is, nor that it is my favorite, but it's close on both counts. It is, however, by no means an easy movie to watch; the brutality will likely be off-putting to some viewers, and the length and pacing will leave unintelligent or uninterested moviegoers bored. If one is prepared to watch it with an active and attentive mind, however, then Prisoners will be a powerful and intellectually intriguing experience.Highly recommended",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Enthralling, shocking, exciting, it tugs heartstrings, prompts inner rage & questions one's scruples.","The trailer for Prisoners is yet another example of Hollywood giving far too much away. Usually it implies a poor film with the funniest/most shocking moments spliced together because the distributors know the film is substandard and are terrified the film will bomb. So why on earth did they feel the need to give away so much in the Prisoners trailer?Prisoners is just a few plot holes away from being a ten star film. It is enthralling, shocking, exciting, it tugs heartstrings, it prompts inner rage, it questions one's scruples, it is the cause of much thought and heated discussions. Prisoners is a very fine film indeed and the best thriller we've seen on the big screen for many months. The summer blockbuster period is officially over and cinema just got down and dirty again!Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello) and their children join friends Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for Thanksgiving. After lunch the parents do their thing, the two older children escape to the basement and the two youngest, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) head out to the quiet road to play. When they don't return, abduction is assumed and panic and suspicion set in. The cops are called, headed by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the finger is pointed directly at Alex Jones (Paul Dano). When the police release Jones due to a complete lack of evidence, Keller declares him guilty and takes matters into his own hands.Prisoners kicks into full thriller mode from the outset. The tension is ramped up with finely directed early scenes and a subtle score (from Jóhann Jóhannsson). Though it occasionally stutters, the obvious 'jump' in the basement failing miserably (fortunately!), it picks at the nerves for the full two-hour plus running time. It's not a film that makes the viewer leap out of one's skin, but niggles unpleasantly as it ask multiple questions: Is he/isn't he guilty? What happened? What does it mean? Does the end justify the means? How far is too far? What would YOU do to protect your children?Director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) has cleverly stitched together a film that is often too close to reality for comfort and looks at issues that fill our newspapers. Take the case of Keith Bennett, the Moors Murderers' fourth victim. His body was never recovered and his mother died without being able to bury her son. Given the opportunity, would she have been justified in having a week alone the Myra Hindley and Liam Brady to find the truth of his whereabouts? The ordeal suffered by Christopher Jefferies, vilified and proclaimed guilty by the press and public, simply for looking 'odd', is also too fresh in our minds to be ignored as we watch Jones' suffering. Subtler is the prospect of ambiguity; just as Derek Bentley was hanged for his equivocal cry of ""Let him have it!"", does the alleged utterance from Jones, ""They only cried when I left them."" have only one interpretation?The performances throughout Prisoners are from the top drawer, and the actors have been gifted realistically written roles. The four parents have not merely been crafted to satisfy a particular stereotypical reaction, rather we are presented with understandable reactions. In Keller it is a desperate rage at his own impotence to protect his family and Jackman is flawless in his violence and despair. His actions are never acceptable but the way Keller is written and performed allows us to care deeply and consequently I'm sure there are many, many viewers who would turn a blind eye or even outwardly condone his methods.Though Jackman's Keller is the showier role here, Howard gives a very measured performance as the other father who has a firmer grasp of his morals though still floundering at the loss of his daughter. Equally, Bello's Grace is perhaps even easier to identify with as she crumples and enters a voluntary stasis, unable even to shower and change let alone control her emotions. Bello depicts a mother so distraught her ability to function abandons her.Davis is short changed; her Nancy brings a steely decisiveness to the table but she is given too little screen time for us to fully engage with. Gyllenhaal is the solid character in Prisoners that we can look to for balance. We don't really see what makes him tick but that is a plus point here; how many detectives arrive on the scene with the life stories laid out for us? Loki is there to do a job, solve a crime and remain as emotionally detached as possible. It is a creditable performance to add to Gyllenhaal's every-growing list.Unsurprisingly, Dano is excellent as the 'freak' who clearly 'must' be dangerous simply by dint of looking odd and being educationally subnormal. Dano has few peers in Hollywood and has cornered the market in oddball roles and there's a very good reason why: He's superb. Likewise, Melissa Leo as Jones' aunt, Holly, is perfect. Leo is a true chameleon of the screen. Enough said. Just watch her.Post-film, my companion for the evening and I debated heatedly the moral issues and how many parents may stoop to such extreme measures given cause. We agreed to differ though the questions remain. Our agreement was entire regarding the quality of Prisoners as a film, however. I can't mention the flaws without destroying the film but there are unresolved matters, unrealistic scenarios and lazy devices that keep Prisoners short of perfection. But it remains a very powerful film that, if it's intention is to leave the viewer wondering what kind of man/woman they are, succeeds admirably.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant performances but too long,"The dark atmosphere in Prisoners is just perfect. I have never seen Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal in such a great Oacar worthy performance. The director succeeded in creating a tense thriller. The suspense is hold from beginning on a high level with lot of suspicious situations. There is a good message to take away: when somebody is in danger the believe in God is important and to pray. What I didn't like therefore was the very long running time of two hours and a half! I mean, there are many puzzles but at the end it is a real torture to wait until the labyrinth is solved. So it is in my opinion sometimes too long paced and some scenes could have been cut. Please don't make such long movies. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Loved the movie,"A very well-done and well-acted suspense thriller – The investigator Jake Gyllenhaal has done great job in the movie and the mannerisms seemed interesting when he was handing stressful situations. Hugh Jackman was able to portray the parents anxiety very well and proved that he could go to any extent to protect his daughter. As parents it was nerve-wrecking for us.The director has done a phenomenal job of keeping the thrill from frame1 till the very end.

Character development and acting are top notch, as is the set design.

Excruciatingly slow.  Seems even longer than it is.  And it's long.,"Any movie so grindingly long and dull needs to be a documentary about something important, like WWII. For fiction, it would need to be an epic historical drama. For a thriller like this, the pacing and length are totally unacceptable. Even worse, I wasn't all that surprised by the ending.There were some good performances, some bad writing (much of the police work, and the relationship between Officer Loki and his captain, couldn't be less realistic), and lots of wasted talent. Maria Bello and Viola Davis should not have lowered themselves to take such lousy roles.It took me two attempts to get through this film -- it was on HBO -- and I'm sorry I made the effort.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Exhilarating Thriller Made For the Right Reasons,"Adult films of noteworthy mention rarely exist anymore, unless they are after Oscar Gold. It's been slim pickings for adult audiences who may not be in the mood to attempt an awards contender, but want to be treated like they have some brain activity. Thrillers are a great use of adult films, actors and audience. Adults want to feel the ""edge"" of suspense stories, like teenagers do with horror films; but while not wasting their time with a low quality film. Prisoners brings back that genre that has felt extinct since 2005, a colossal year for thrillers.The acting is fantastic. Prisoners hired actors who know how to act and wanted to make the picture for the sake of trying their best. Hugh Jackman punches us with his vehemence, a performance that shakes you, even if his accent may not be etched out with perfection. Jake Gyllenhaal has a more unnoticed character that slowly builds to moments allowing Gyllehaal to execute strength and power.Viola Davis brings the house down with only one meaty scene. Terrance Howard reiterates he's a talent that can convey massive emotion by saying very little. Melissa Leo turns in her best post-Oscar portrayal, but still doesn't ""wow"" us like she used to. Sadly, Maria Bello didn't cut it for me. Her crying scenes seem phony and I don't empathize with her character. The character is written to be a mother barely grasping onto hope in her life; it feels like Bello didn't put the effort in to make that character reach her full potential.After seeing as many films as I have, especially films intended to spook you, sooner or later you learn all the tricks and your threshold adapts to the environment you've grown a part of. Prisoners is the one film in a good while to actually scare me. Some images are terrifying and built with perfect sinister tone, while other scenes match those with jolting chases or disturbing moments of torture.The themes aren't anything groundbreaking, we've felt the messages of Prisoners in dozens of other films in the past. There's parallelism drawn with the conclusion, grief and religion are inevitable in a film of this topic, but those dramatics are not what interested me. The plain message that comes with the drastic twist just pleads to parents and babysitters to never underestimate anyone. Predators are lurking to swoop anything they can get their hands on at the right time. Child kidnapping is still a sensitive topic to be used in films right now and I found the plot pushing the envelope to be exhilarating.I believe in years to come Prisoners will gain a reputation similar to Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino's '90s hit, Heat: universally praised, cult-bound, and unnoticed with accolades. Both genre films give the audience credit to maintain a well-paced narrative. Prisoners doesn't feed us unnecessary information, it often cuts a scene off when the built action reaches the goal of the scene without letting us see the predictable result. Prisoners puts its genre on the path for the future.Grade: A-Rating: 8/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
How much out of 10?!,"I'll be very brief... Jackman as always is immense... Especially so considering that:The script is awkward and clumsy, The plot starts 'ok' but is soooo predictable and frankly 'same same' albeit teasing you early on that it has substance. My son and I figured the entire plot within 30 minutes (of a very unnecessarily long movie), The characters are soul-less and cardboard like. Even Jackmans character is wayward and only saved by his convincing portrayal of a desperate man. Gylenhall is absolutely ornamental in this film... An empty shell of a character, poorly acted with little direction, and leaves you wondering why oh why did he take on this role.I promise you that if you a connoisseur of fine thrillers you will walk away from this film with a noticeably sore bottom and questioning yourself as to why oh why did IMDb members give it such a ridiculously high rating. Its a silly film about a very serious issue and is just not nationwide cinema release material.This movie is a 7/10 all the way and without Jackman would struggle to be a 6.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
2 hours and 23 minutes of agony,"After viewing this film, my wife and I argued about whose fault it was we had borrowed it from the library. I insisted she was responsible; she said I chose it.We don't understand why this has rated so highly with other viewers. There are so many absolutely absurd holes in this plot that we spent more time pointing them out to each other than watching the film. The soundtrack was poor, which was unfortunate, so we often missed key words or sentences and that didn't help, I'll admit. But it really was the writing of the plot that put us off. If actions taken by the characters don't make sense, then we lose interest and that's what happened with us about an hour in.I'll not bother saying more than that as it would constitute spoiler after spoiler if I picked apart what we saw. You can make up your own mind if you watch it and perhaps you'll make more sense of some of the characters' actions than we did.I'll just end by saying that it might try to be a modern ""Silence of the Lambs"", but it falls far short of that high standard.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Great story, but many flaws","Prisoners was a gritty and engaging, child kidnap film that got our attention early and kept it until the end. However, it had many needless quirks and meaningless distractions and misdirections that it was difficult at times to follow what was necessary to the story and what was not. The highlight of the film was Hugh Jackman's character Keller, the stressed-out and angry father of one of two kidnapped little girls in Conyers, Georgia. This father's anger over losing his little girl drove the story and gave it its powerful energy that had all eyeballs glued to the screen throughout, which is the true +mark of a successful suspense story.Bad weather prevailed in this gloomy story that was so full of uncaring, devious and sick human behavior that it almost made you ashamed to be one of the same species. The entire cast did a very effective job, Maria Bello as Keller's depressive wife, Paul Dano as the uber-creepy suspect nearly tortured to death, Melissa Leo as his psychopathic aunt/mother(?), Terrence Howard as a soft and sensitive black man and neighbor whose child was also taken, and Viola Davis as his so sad, grieving wife. Jake Gyllenhaal was Loki, the also sad but serious and dedicated case detective whose outward bland calm was belied by an eye-blinking facial tick that well showed the giant stress he was constantly under to solve the case for his incompetent and pushy, but very antagonistic and unhelpful, captain.As the story has been detailed by others, my concern was for the details in the telling of the story. The first half of the film was terrific and built the story effectively and emotionally, but the second half had so many unnecessary twists and incomplete explanations of what really happened that it left me with a feeling of ""that could have been done much better"".I had the case figured out much faster than Loki did, as he missed the main clue from an earlier murder that would have solved the case if he were a better and ""more observant"" detective(isn't that their job?). That he missed it was the main flaw in the story to me, but I was also irked at the case conclusion that was merely flashed too-briefly in newspaper headlines. That part left me with.....""That's it?"" IMO, it was a too-quick and unsatisfying resolution to the long and harrowing, two and a half hour film story. However, the cut-off ending of the film that others have complained about was very impactful even if what led to it was tipped off earlier, thus very predictable.All in all, great acting in a flawed but very interesting and foreboding film story made my rating of it a strong 7. Warning... bloody human torture scenes and violent psychopathic behavior.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Fine Performances, Evocative Direction, Screwball Script","""Prisoners"" 2013 Fine Performances, Evocative Direction, Screwball ScriptI wanted to see ""Prisoners"" after I saw the trailer. Alas, the trailer contains all the best parts of the movie. Suburban parents celebrating Thanksgiving slowly come to realize that their two daughters are missing. The trailer featured quiet, dark scenes of increasing menace and despair, shot in realistic, autumnal, suburban settings. The trailer promised big, big stars: Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as one set of parents and Viola Davis and Terence Howard as the other, Jake Gyllenhaal as the police detective, Paul Dano as the suspect and Melissa Leo as the suspect's adoptive parent. The trailer promised an intelligent thriller that would interrogate how far an ethical person could go in attempting to rescue his daughter from an abductor. The trailer also seemed to suggest an examination of how law enforcement responds, for better or worse, in child abduction cases.The first twenty minutes of ""Prisoners"" delivered what I'd hoped for based on the trailer, but I was hyper-aware that I was watching scene after scene I'd already seen in the trailer.Around the time that an unlikely body was found in an unlikely spot, and a fist met a face several times more than was necessary to make any point, but certainly enough times to satisfy a film-goer's sick, sadistic bloodlust, the movie went off the rails for me, abandoned all its seriousness and intelligence, and became sensational gore and commercial pap. I was so let down I wanted to leave the theater, but I stayed because I'd roped two friends into seeing this with me.""Prisoners"" is a whodunit so there's a limit to what I can say without revealing any spoilers. I can say this. Jake Gyllenhaal powerfully performs a dedicated police detective. Hugh Jackman exercises his neck veins a lot, and his American accent is wobbly but okay. Terence Howard, Viola Davis, and Maria Bello are given criminally little to do. Viola Davis has one of the most interesting scenes in the movie. This scene is only a minute or two long and it is not developed at all. That is a shame because the scene is the moral crux of the film. And the film does nothing with it; the filmmakers went with implausible sensationalism and sadism rather than substance. Paul Dano, as the suspect, and Melissa Leo, as his adoptive mother, both give powerhouse performances in very challenging roles.Denis Villeneuve's direction is flawless. He avoids explosive stunts and theatrics with his camera. His moves are slow and quiet, even while filming ugly violence. I'd like to see his work on a better script.There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass. ""Through a glass darkly"" is a line from the Bible. Ooo big symbolism. Wow. There are many crosses, including one hanging from the rearview mirror in Keller – Hugh Jackman's – truck. Wow. Heavy. I just may think something  no, I'd rather watch snakes. Oh, yes. There are snakes. Some understand Satan as taking snake form in Genesis. Heavy. Profound! Yeah, not really. Just bizarrely implausible. There are strange character names. Hugh Jackman's first name is ""Keller"" which brings to mind the blind and deaf Helen Keller, or maybe the word ""Killer."" Jake Gyllenhaal is Detective Loki. Loki is the trickster God of Norse mythology. This is all pretty high school.There are two scenes and one character treatment in this film that I found completely implausible. The two scenes are essential to the plot. I can't describe these two scenes but I can say that one is utterly implausible because of surveillance. The action of the film takes place within hours and days of a child abduction. Not only police, but also media and neighbors would be keeping an eagle eye on all suspects. Another scene is implausible because it demands that we forget everything we've been told about a key character. One character treatment is unbelievable to me because a very unlikely character is depicted as being as heroic, in his way, as John McCain. Not plausible. I also found the final resolution of the crime to be something that would only occur in a writer's imagination, and the ending to be pointlessly cute.Again, the opening scenes of the dawning awareness that a child has been abducted are powerful, but the film totally lost me with its comic book sensationalism, sadism, and – I have to say it – stupidity.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Incredible and intense.,"Easily one of Denis Villeneuve's best films, and possibly my favorite of his.The acting in this is perfect. Jake Gyllenhaal's hard boiled detective that's played a little more ex-street kid than I expected is great. And the persona and facial ticks he employs to really sell the character would be laughable if done by a lesser actor. Match that with Hugh Jackman's desperate intensity, and you have brilliance. You cannot ask for a better performance, he gives it his all. You truly believe this man is looking for his daughter, and will do whatever he has to to get her back. And Paul Dano, though most of the time ALWAYS looks exactly like he does in this movie, somehow manages to make this performance entirely unique from his others. And no matter what, he always plays a fantastic creep.The cinematography is very subdued. Everything is muted, grey washed, desaturated. It's very observational, the camera being a fly on the wall. But it still has time to be spectacular in how beautiful it can make subdued. Lots of rain dappled silhouettes, reflections, and sub framing. Roger Deakins is a master, and it's remarkable how his style adapts to each film individually. He's not self indulgent in any way, he does what's best for the film.The writing is nearly perfect. There are one or two moments where characters or scenarios play out a little illogically. I won't spoil anything... However, it doesn't detract from the film, just something I noticed.Denis really does well in the neo-noir genre. He can do something like this, gritty and grey, or he can do slick and vibrant like Blade Runner 2049. And ENEMY is another more surreal example of this, also starring Jake Gyllenhaal.All the pieces are here: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Wolverine in a Domestic Crime Drama,"The less you know about the story of this film, the better. I went into the theater not knowing anything about ""Prisoners"" except for the names of its lead actors. I will not give you a synopsis so you can still watch the film without knowing the full story.""Prisoners"" attempts to transform a story about a neighborhood kidnapping into something more than just a crime film. When a member of your family becomes a victim of a crime, you will be imprisoned in your own sense of justice. It becomes a thought-provoking film which makes you question your own sense of morality.The atmosphere created by Director Denis Villeneuve is dark and heavy from the first frame, as Hugh Jackman intones the Lord's Prayer. The cold November rainy weather sets the mood very well. However, two and half hours of a relentlessly downcast mood can take its toll on the audiences. I did feel that the film lost its bearings somehow when scalding showers and snakes entered the scene.Whatever missteps of the story and direction is made up for by the talented actors who try their best to bring this turgid story to life. It becomes a compelling drama, better than what it may have appeared on paper. The stellar Oscar-caliber stars bring their A-game to this.Hugh Jackman is explosive here as Keller Dover, the parent with the more extreme reaction to the crime against his family. He is clearly in Wolverine mode here as he gets caught up in his own warped vigilantism. He goes over-the-top in a lot of disturbing scenes, but it was that quiet moment when he recognizes a bloody item of clothing that was his best scene.Jake Gyllenhaal does very well as the dedicated officer in charge of the case, with a name as unlikely as Detective Loki. His best scene is when he was driving through the freeway in the pouring rain with a bleeding wound on his head further distorting his vision, rushing to bring a dying person to the hospital.Maria Bello plays Keller's unstable wife, trapped by her own addiction to sleeping pills. I do not like her past work, but here she was actually good despite her irritating character. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis play the Birches, close friends of the Dovers. They are generally calm people but circumstances force them to turn a blind eye and even become accomplices to another crime.Paul Dano plays a mentally-challenged guy named Alex Jones. He somehow gets us to feel for his creepy character. Melissa Leo plays his adoptive mother Holly. Their behavior will keep you guessing as to their involvement in the case on hand.Overall, this can be a very compelling film that will keep you guessing. However, this is a lengthy, deliberately slow paced film. Despite its good intentions, I feel that it could have been edited into something less meandering and repetitive. A film like this dragged too long is bound to give rise to questionable plot devices and bad red herrings, and this one unfortunately has both.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Had potential, but was unsatisfying","I went into this film after having watched the trailer and feeling slightly apprehensive but mostly excited. I liked how the trailer hinted at Hugh Jackman's character being shown to change in demeanor as a result of his daughter's abduction. In reality, the film took a turn in a different and more extreme direction - one that I wouldn't necessarily say was good.The start of the film played out well, with a realistic and credible scenario. But I found myself throughout the film getting more and more confused and more disinterested as a result. Don't get me wrong: I like films with twists and turns in unexpected directions, but too much so can make me feel a little queasy. I felt like I was spending too much time trying to explain to myself what on earth was going on rather than revelling in the excitement and tension of the actual film. This I found frustrating. Having said that, if you want some thrilling and tense scenes, I think this film provides quite a few. I just think a poor plot can detract from well-acted, tense scenes.In a nutshell, I would describe this film as a lot of twists, quirks and unusual concepts all put together in quick succession; however, they were not really linked. I could barely draw a connection between a lot of what was happening and I found myself drawn into a strange, unexplained plot which overall left me very unsatisfied.And that's, unfortunately, how I would say I felt at the end of the film.

Director Denis Villeneuve has skilfully utilized Hugh Jackman's and Jake Gyllenhaal's skills, and supporting actors like Paul Dano or Viola Davis are always a firm choice. Tensions are high, viewers can ponder about guilt and remorse, gray and rainy background boosts anxiety... The length, however, is too much (pace tends to fade at times) and motives of the chief offender could have been different. The ending is versatile, a kind of summing up all preceding events... Unexpected, but still not wow!.Thus, a decent thriller, recommended to those fond of gloomy surroundings dinned by weather.

Unfortunate to watch this movie,"I recommend Prisoner to my friends for the movie night based on the fact that its a Huge Jachman movie (as I am a Huge fan) and current rating of it on IMDb but regret it like hell since 20 minutes of the beginning.The movie is the same old kidnapping story with awful length and pathetically slow. The director tried to make the environment for suspense and thrill but failed to do so, except for the last 10 minutes, which I do not count with 2 and a half hour.The acting however is bit better, thanks to Huge Jackman and Terrence Howard. The movie has its ups and downs but as you slide down your seat, you have to wake up to catch up the sudden scene.So, my recommendation, if you want to waste some of your time or want to get frustrated, be my guest.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
This Was Really Good,"I really liked this movie. Hugh Jackman is so good in everything that he does, he is one of my favorite actors of all time. He does a great job in this and definitely has the best performance in the film. One of his best ever honestly. Some of his scenes are just insane. Jake Gyllenhaal is also very good and plays his role to near perfection as does Paul Dano. But, Jackman steals the show. Scene to scene every actor gave a heightened level of drama to their performances which really enhanced the film. The screenplay is extremely well written also.The filmmaking is gritty and there is great cinematography, editing, and incredible dialogue. The performances in this movie are top-notch. I thought the filmmaking was beautiful and it is consistently riveting and tense.One thing I noticed that I didn't necessarily like was that the movie chooses to cut at moments of high tension very frequently. Like right when it's super tense and something is about to happen the movie cuts and takes you somewhere else leaving you wondering what happened. This happens multiple times and sometimes it works well but others it can come off as frustrating. The movie is pretty slow.Overall, I thought Prisoners was a great movie and I recommend watching it. The filmmaking is beautiful and the story is very real and amazingly written and acted. It is not a super original premise, but the way it is executed was fantastic. I thought the ending was perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A must-see thriller/mystery with excellent acting...,"Prisoners - 9/10 Superb film.Great story-line, pacing, acting. It has it all. After I finished watching it, I remarked that it was the best film I've seen in a long time. And I've seen a lot.A simplistic plot summary is this: 2 girls go missing near their homes and a frantic search for them primarily from parent Hugh Jackman and detective Jake Gyllenhaal begins. The raw, rough landscape - the washed out grays and browns in the picture - the cold, the rain: all help to make the atmosphere of the film, one of realism and desperation. There are a few red herrings thrown in here and there as we progress (or so I thought) but ultimately they all somehow connect (however tenuously in places). As I watched the film, some things happened which I could not see how they related to the overall plot - but a second watch helped out a lot in this regard. Some elements of the film were a little strange but the storyteller didn't skimp on content that's for sure. He threw everything at this and although richly populated and seemingly unconnected at times - it all adds up in the end. Barely. But it adds up nonetheless.So huge credit is due to the storyteller and the director for bringing us something a little different, a little left-field but the most credit must go to the two main actors.I've never seen Jackman in anything except Wolverine (not even the X-Men series - but just the spin off) and he is what he is in that movie - a mutant wolf-like creature/human. He does pretty well as this - but I must admit I had no idea of his acting chops. Well, here he shows us in spades. He's angry, riled, tired, exhausted, violent, desperate - at times all in the one scene - and portrays it brilliantly. A little OTT with the wild eyes in one or two scenes - but that is being picky. He held that pent-up and at times unleashed anger throughout the film expertly.But even Jackman was outdone by Gyllenhaal. Now I have seen a lot of this guy's films ever since his breakthrough in Donnie Darko. He is good. Getting better. And has a massive future ahead of him. He can do anything in my opinion, he has it all. Here, he brings a weird edge to detective Loki - with his neck tattoo, his mason ring, his weird haircut, buttoned up shirts and general worldliness. He is a character that without knowing anything about his background or personal life, comes across as a dangerous, slightly unhinged individual with a troubled past, and maybe an even more conflicting future. But for now, he's a cop and a damn good one. Gyllenhaal even gives this guy a tick - with the constant eye-blinking - which simply adds to his mystique. Tremendous, faultless acting by Gyllenhaal makes him a wonder to watch.Not to mention great turns by a creepy Paul Dano and another misfit David Dastmalchian. Both extremely convincing and off-putting in equal measure. Also, an early outing for Dylan Minnette - now, the excellent Clay Jensen from 13 Reasons Why.In short - great movie - and without giving away the ending too much - a clincher to finish. A must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A hidden gem that will stay with you long after the credits roll.,"Considering Denis Villeneuve is a somewhat popular director with wide release blockbusters like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 and most recently Dune, it is a crime that more people don't talk about possibly the greatest psychological thriller ever made, Prisoners. Prisoners is a movie about two girls that go missing and follows Jake Gyllenhaal, a detective who is tasked with tracking down the girls and Hugh Jackman, the father of one of the girls with a ""Pray for the best, prepare for the worst"" attitude. The two leads are exceptional as well as most of the supporting actors, specifically Paul Dano. Roger Deakins also killed it as the cinematographer. While it isn't as flashy as his other movies like 1917 or Blade Runner, each shot is rich with character and really makes you feel the hopelessness the leads feel. The last thing I want to rant about is the dialogue. While this film is nearly 2.5 hours long and contains very limited action, it never felt boring to me and is one of those movies where I get excited when two character talk to eachother because the script is so riveting. I cannot recommend this movie enough. While it can be depressing at times, give it a shot. The movie just flies by and if it was longer, I would not be opposed. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Dark, gritty drama","'Prisoners' is about two young girls who disappear in suspicious circumstances and what the parents (or rather mainly Hugh Jackman) does to try and get them back.And, as you can probably tell by that subject matter, it's certainly no 'feel good' movie. You have to be in the mood for something pretty horrible and disturbing to sit through it. So, if you're in the mood for that (and don't have young children!), you'll find a decent enough thriller with powerful performances from both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (who plays the cop in charge of the subsequent investigation).It's quite a long film (over two hours), so don't expect everything to be revealed at once.The only drawback is that, mainly towards the end, there are a few 'ploy holes' which the writers obviously think you'll probably overlook as you're caught up in the drama of the final act. If you don't look too closely and focus on the performances, you should still enjoy what is really a pretty bleak movie.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""pray for the best, but prepare for the worst.""","Although many people have already said this,I still want to mention how amazing the acting game was and how beautiful some scenes were shot. But I will focus mainly on the storyline. Indeed, the plot is worth of admiration. As the movie passes, there are a lot of plot twists and moments filled with tension. But even though there were a lot of unexpected turns, some scenes were pretty monotone, and the movie atmosphere is really exhausting and dark. A lot was happening and in some moments I felt like there was too much things going on. Reading the reviews here, I found some plot holes too but again, I think that was because there were too many things going on on screen and some characters actions got confused. However, I do not deny the movie was made with a good thought (I also really liked the end), but I would change one or two things.

not good as the trailer,"Story was good. But I don't think it could have been directed any worse. First of all movie was extremely slow. The pacing the timing was so awful. There were a lot of unnecessary scenes that could have been shortened or not used in the movie at all. I can say at at least 1 hour of the movie could be cut out and the story wouldn't change, in fact it would be better. The slow rhythm of the movie made it like drama more than a thriller. There were parts where it got really really boring. Jake Gyllenhaal's bad acting made the movie even worse. And it had the worse ending ever. The only thing good about the movie is Hugh Jackman. He's kind of saving the movie with his great acting.

An very under-rated film,"There are so few bad things to say about this movie, if any at all. Come to think of it, none come to mind. This film is masterfully well done in every way; from the directing, writing, acting, sound design, cinematography on down to the editing. Trust me when I say, it's a film with very few noticeable flaws.Hugh Jackman gives an insanely good performance as the father desperately searching for his daughter. Jake G honestly wasn't as stellar as Hugh, but his character was that of a calm detective trying to find the kidnapped girls. I wouldn't say he phoned it in, because his character had noticeable ticks and mannerisms that remained consistent throughout the movie. In my opinion, it's just hard not to see Jake G instead of his character like he transformed in both Nightcrawler and Southpaw. But still good acting all around. Can't forget Paul Dano and David Dastmalchain, both did stellar work.The cinematography... it's done by Roger Deakins so yeah, it's phenomenal.Denis Villeneuve proves to be a directing we all should be on the look out for in the many years to come.The writing, done by Andy Guzikowski is great. It surprises me that this isn't based on a book judging by how deep the plot goes with mystery and ""mazes"". This guy is one damn good mystery/crime writer.Basically, to sum it all up.

Powerful reflection on taking justice in your hands,"Prisoners is a chilling film that has an unsettling music and gray tones that will tight your chest from the first minutes. Prisoners has also a great cast, intrigue, suspense, and a powerful reflection on some important moral issues.To me, the beauty of this film relies on its powerful reflection on the ethics of taking justice in your hands. When and why, if ever, torture is justified; my reaction is, as has always been, a resounding no. There is also the question, if you knew that you would save some people's lives by torturing a person, would you do it or be ethically excusable? My answer is a less resounding no. On the other hand, the story asks you who is worst, the person who kidnaps a child or the abductee's father who tortures somebody to save his child. Finally, if you know that somebody is taking justice in their hands and you don't denounce them or watch impassibly, are you as guilty as the perpetrator?The story of the investigation to find the missing girls was building up well during the first half of the movie. However, the second half is a clumsy pointless wandering that doesn't help to build momentum, it builds frustration. When we discover who the baddie is, the reasons behind his/her actions are so stupid that I couldn't believe that the scriptwriters had come up with a such a thing! Finally, I found a bit unfair that two girls disappear and the story is mostly about the Kellers' sorrow, not as much as the Birches' pain, and they seem to be not having any except for some few moments in the film.Regarding the cast, I thought all the actors do a good job overall. I usually love Gyllenhaal but I found he was just all right here, except for some sporadic sparks of his best acting; I loved his blinking tick, though. It was refreshing seeing Jackman playing something dramatic and very different from his usual roles; unfortunately, I thought he was overacting, and I didn't believe for a second that he was Keller, I thought he was Jackman trying to be Keller, which is something slightly different. On the contrary, Maria Bello really feels like she's a mother in distress. Viola Davis has that powerful mix of balanced sorrow and fragility that many people display when tragedy strikes. Paul Dano is just awesome as the mentally-challenged guy on which all suspicions seem to fall. I am surprised that Melissa Leo was nominated for an Oscar; she's good in the film, but not better than Maria Bello or Dano!A good movie, with a clumsy script, food for thought, and a Hollywood ending. I thought, if Koreans had done this movie, we have got a fair ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An 8 point freaking 2 out of 10 rating for this lame movie? Really?,"A movie that is, in my humble opinion, toeing the line between So-so and bad? What happened to audiences today? Have you all lost your minds? Is the government already succeeding at dumbing-down the masses? OK, sure, the performances were solid. But what I saw in the end was great talent wasted on an insanely contrived film.We all know what the story is about and the premise is rather primal, I must admit, encouraging me to see the film. But it was poorly written. POORLY. It started with the characters then snowballed down the hill to a contrivance cesspool where it drowned.I didn't like any of the characters, except for Alex, played by Paul Dano. The second character I empathized with was Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal), who almost went on my list of ""Idiots the world would be better off without,"" but he avoided it by really trying to find the girls and practically being tormented by Dover (Jackman), father of one of the girls abducted.Now Dover was one of the worst characters in the film, probably in movie history. He was written for us to connect to, whether we disagreed with his methods or not. But in the end, he was basically jeopardizing the investigation. His level of stupidity was dangerous, to himself and everyone around him. So, he may not be a thinking man. I could buy that. Then could he at least smarten up somewhere towards the end of the film? Where was his character arc, his moment of truth? Are we to assume he actually learned something as events unfolded? Never once did he admit his humility and humanity, and yield his control of events over to fate. It could've taken 5 seconds. But he didn't. I'm not going to give away too much, but he was angry and desperate until the end.Then you had Dover's band of douchebags, like the Birch's, who also lost their daughter and are seemingly close friends with the Dovers. They most likely shared stupid pills as well. There wasn't a single useful person in the film. Loki came close but he did things I couldn't imagine anyone with his expertise, who supposedly solved every crime or missing person case he ever worked (not clear as to the kind of detective he was), doing the things he did. Also, he rarely called for backup or assistance, and don't give me that malarkey about the town's underfunded police department. Did everyone have to be brain-dead and desperate like Dover? To answer the previous question, yes, they had to be this way otherwise things would have had to happen differently, and it could've ended badly like how things happen in real life sometimes. But, as a writer, when you intend on something happening one way to get the result you want, most likely a happy ending, then you have to have characters who can comply, even at their own detriment, and that's where contrivances find their home and breed.The film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along. Some lines, like the ""solved every case"" line regarding Loki's illustrious career as a police officer, not only made me chuckle but they felt more like set pieces, like the blue lamp on Dover's end table. Other wasted elements in the film were like red herrings that only added the extra 30 minutes to the already long movie.Also, the antagonist's agenda was quite ridiculous, as most have been in recent Hollywood movies. They're now very roundabout and overly complicated, making them ridiculous, instead of more direct approaches. The bad guys are working way too hard to reach their ultimate goal. I thought the hard work was supposed to be reserved for the good guys. ""Rage against God""? Really? That makes as much sense as going through the trouble to control the money and assets of all the local billionaires, taking power away from the wealthy and giving it to the the persecuted, all to create anarchy just before blowing up the city, and making the town's wounded hero watch it all from some prison pit in nowhere land. Oh wait...",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Dir. Denis Villeneuve showing his early brilliance,"Denis Villeneuve has proven over the past 10 years to be one of our most talented directors. But it may be easy to forget a crazily intense psychological thriller that he made more than 10 years ago, titled ""Prisoners."" It stars more than seven of the finest actors working at that time (and frankly, since then): Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Mario Bello, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo and David Dastmalchian (you'll recognize him when you see him). In the course of its 2.5+ hour running time, you gradually begin to realize that it's not titled ""Prisoners"" just for the kidnapped children, nor solely for the emotionally tortured parents portrayed by Jackman/Bello and Howard/Davis. Each in their own way, all characters in the cast are imprisoned by these insane chains of events. And that includes Gyllenhaal's police detective, whose sudden violence during an interrogation costs the police a key piece of information.

However, as it turns out, it is a very good movie with a really good script and excellent performance from Gyllenhall.The plot was good, the suspense part does work and it fits the classification of an intense thriller.I went to the cinema this time really just to accompany my wife who really loves Jake Gyllenhall. I ended up liking it too and recommended it to my friends. I was gripped by it. In this movie, I felt so sorry for how low Jackman went. I could almost feel the desperation that he in felt in Prisoners and almost actually felt an empathy; I mean this sort of thing happens regularly all over the world, but he just desisted to take things into his own hands.Overall a very good movie.

How film has the ability to grab hold and not let go,"I watched Prisoners (2013. dir. Denis Villeneuve) last night and thought how film has the ability to grab hold and not let go.

The mood is somber amidst a tragic abduction of two girls in a small Pennsylvania town. I immediately felt connected and invested in the story and eager to see how far the characters would go to solve the mystery.

Nightcrawler had far better writing.,"Such a mess of a movie, started off well enough and it does hold your attention, but the plot has so many issues it's hard to know where to even start.Firstly what the f is wrong with the characters in this movie? The kidnapper does so much messed up stuff....then confesses to a priest? lol what? So then the priest kills him and doesn't tell anyone, and just leaves the body lying around in a secret room under the house? And the only thing between that body and exposure.....is a fridge.....lmaoooooNobody can talk in this movie, talking is forbidden, the guy Huge Jackman is torturing can't talk because????? Why would he not just tell him, the old lady has the girls!!!!! Like what is this writing?Then ""children's clothes"" man is intelligent when he escapes jake gyllenhaal, and seems normal enough when he's arrested, but then he turns into a whacko once he's in custody and WON'T TALK, whyyyyyyyy. Then Jake gylenhaal snaps and slams the guys face on the table LMAOOOOO IS THIS A MEME?The ending of the movie is so artificially set up...so cringe. Huge Jackman talks to the girl in the hospital, and sprints out super obviously......even though he supposedly wants to go alone, otherwise he would have told the cops ""hey my daughter is here, go save her. Instead he just goes alone, and walks into this woman's house, like the dumbest character in thriller history, and turns his back to this lady. The only way Huge Jackman could have stuffed up the situation worse, would be if he killed the black girl (Joy) as he left the hospital.
That way, Huge guarantees he and his daughter both die, and nobody will ever find the bodies!!!! But still credit where credit is due, I give Huge 7/10 for his suicide mission.I thought this was a great movie when I was 16, what 3 will do if you improve your mindset and appreciation for good films.

not bad or good,"i wanted to watch this movie so bad.honestly this movie turned out to be something completely different from what i was expecting. First i found this movie to be a bit too long and was a bit boring at the moments. However i did like the acting and atmosphere was dark and completely suitable for this movie and this story.Loved also the drama and how they showed the emotions of a family struck by this misery of a daughter being kidnapped and not knowing how to help her or find her. But at some points the story is too slow for my taste,and then the ending was somewhat disappointing for me. I couldn't say that this movie is predictable and that you know from the start how it is going to end, but it has crossed my mind several times during the movie who the kidnapper is and turned out to be that i was right. All in all i would recommend it but with precaution and must point out once again that the movie is actually slow although a lot of people seem to think that every scene is important, i believe that they actually needed to cut some scenes and the story had to move faster.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Plagiarism?,"I enjoyed this movie. Well, I really enjoyed the acting, and the cinematography is delightful for those who enjoy that kind of thing. I felt the characterisation could be better, the interactions were all pretty bleak after the feel good intro (if you've seen Twin Peaks, you'll know what I'm getting at, but it is a movie and not a show, so they had less time and I suppose didn't want to confuse the mood).I take a point off because from the introduction of the 'maze' obsessed character I started to think of a book, a book that terrified me and I would not read again. The underground maze reveal and the incessant torture of the lead husband also stank of this book. I wonder if the maze idea was plagiarised/inspired (and the plot totally reworked) by it or whether I'm just bringing my impression of this book to the film. Perhaps the idea comes from that mythological story about the maze and the Minotaur and has been reworked many times but until now I had only caught one.I read some other reviews but no one really commented on this that I saw. The ending is perfectly unnerving and directed my thought right into the obvious juxtaposition.This is the kind of movie I would recommend to a friend just to gauge them by their reaction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Great, but Hollywood diluted it","The only reason I didn't like this movie as a 9 or a 10, is because I felt like the story writers gave the audience what they wanted, rather than what the story wanted. It is as great as people say it is, but the standard Hollywood wrap up of a story is what you see at the end. Don't get me wrong, it was unique, and the ending was unique, you wouldn't guess it. But that really wasn't what would make the movie good. Sometimes a more dismal ending, is actually what would make the story memorable and cool, in some strange way.You will notice this if you watch this movie, you can tell that the writers actively steered the story toward a Hollywood wrap up, rather than where the story was taking the viewer, if u catch my drift.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Trauma and Shock Expressed Through Sounds and Visuals,"Prisoners is a gritty and disturbing tale of a father looking for his kidnapped daughter and her friend who will do anything to get her back no matter what while a detective follows leads and searches elsewhere. While the premise may sound like something out of the Taken franchise, the films could not be more different. Prisoners is bleak, nihilistic and grounded in reality. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give shocking performances as the two people leading the search for the girls with the pressure and the anxiety of their task seeping through their performances. Denis Villeneuve combines his talents as a director with the greatest cinematographer of all time Roger Deakins to create beautiful yet haunting shots throughout the film. The imagery is powerful and combined with the distressing story it can lead to some truly shocking moments with a moment in particular when a revelation about the girls is discovered gives me shivers every time I watch it. The score pounds, the colors turn grey and the fear and trauma of the characters can be felt and it's as if out of a horror movie. Not to even mention the incredible final act. The film is well paced and wastes no time from its two and a half hour run time making every second of the film count in the search for the girls. Prisoners is not for the lighthearted and can be quite distressing for even the most hardened viewer but it is a remarkable and haunting film that will leave you thinking after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Like a whistle in the wind,"An S tier crew keeping a high, low standard. I always told myself that I would be able to spot a movie by Denis Villeneuve without knowing it prior to watch, but either this was an exception or I didn't pay enough attention.Don't get me wrong but the movie is good, without a doubt a movie I could recommend to someone but not the movie you sit down to watch with your family. The tone of the movie and a bit of the plot heavily reminds me of Se7en but the climax isn't as strong. When it all goes down in the third arc we have almost lost interest of the movie, the characters are stuck and it feels like they been running in sand, getting nowhere the entire movie. The cinematography and the tone of the movie is without a doubt its strongest aspect, while the story isn't as strong. We get someone of a kind acting from Hugh Jackman and we can really feel the emotional depth hes character.My favorite shot of the movie is probably not what you expect. When the children in the inciting event gets kidnapped we don't se it on the screen. Instead we get a shot of a lonely tree standing infront of the house. Just like the shot in taxi driver, where we expect someone to walk through the door or something. Instead we get nothing, implying that something weird is going on and that something has happened. It gave me the chills.A good movie, but for me it misses character building of the ""Family"" which makes the movie not as haunting as it could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I can usually guess most of where a movie is going and I have to say that I did guess most of this one but that didn't keep me from liking the movie and there were a few things that surprise me (which is very rare). It is a movie that will make you think some and for that its a good movie.It's suppose to be high drama but there were some humorous parts and even with the gravity of the end I found myself laughing at it.

Brilliant & Hopefully Will Empower Those to Stand Up for Victimized Children,"Prisoners has always come up as a recommendation by critics and cinemaphiles, but I am completely blown away.I have always loved Gyllenhaal and Jackman movies. They are the cream of the crop and it's hard to imagine other actors doing their roles better. Combine them with Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Denis Villeneuve, and a tantalizing plot, and you have sheer brilliance. Even though the movie is 2 1/2 hours long, it feels like it, but it's completely gripping. The twists are not something one will see coming until you're supposed to because details are kept out. The entire cast does a fantastic job! There's no overacting or roles that are too small. This really is an experience that is all encompassing and emotionally immersive. I am tired afterwards, but the emotions you'll experience aren't going to go away after the movie is over. This is not a family movie and I wouldn't recommend it to any minors or young adults. It is a movie that I feel every adult should watch that can handle it's tough subject matter.In modern society, there is a massive problem that isn't talked about enough and it's crimes against children. There is one quote that particularly stuck with me: ""Making children disappear is the war we wage with God. It makes people lose their faith."" We all have to do better to shed light and hold people and companies responsible for any part in victimizing children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A gritty raw thriller,"This movie has been out for a long time. However I love it and wanted to write a review. The film itself has a fantastic dark tone. The ideal itself is fantastic. At it's core the film asks you a question about your own morals. ""What would you do if your child was in danger?"" There are characters representing different sides of the decision to answer the core question itself. I for one would probably lean towards Hugh Jackman but that's beyond the point.
There is something incredibly entertaining in watching Hugh Jackman's change in character from the start of the film to the end of the film.
I also appreciate a stand-alone film. There is much to gain from sequels. However this keeps you wanting more, it tells an incredible story, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Not to mention how captivating the acting is to where you feel what the character is portraying on screen; that is a real film.

An suspenseful thriller mixed with some of the most amazing acting in cinema.,"Prisoners is a very tension filled 2 hour and 33 minute nightmare, and not a single second was wasted. With incredible performances from Hugh Jackman, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, and Viola Davis, every single actor and actress did their part in this film. The acting was truly phenomenal and it truly got under my skin.The movie is very dark tonally, possibly due to the gritty and realistic color grading and cinematography and the violence can get kind of disturbing. This is easily not a film for the faint of heart or parents. It's a very tough watch thanks to the astounding direction by Denis Villeneuve, who always keeps you guessing until the very end. The score is very anxiety-inducing, which definitely sets the tone for the scenes that use it, but I was honestly surprised this wasn't a score heavy film. The majority of the violent scenes were silent, which made them hit so much harder.Prisoners is definitely not a film for everyone, but if you want to see some freaking ACTING, then this film is most definitely a must-watch. The 2 and a half hours practically fly by because this movie knows you desperately want to know if the children even make it out alive.

A Chilling and Beautifully Shot Film,"Prisoners was an outstanding movie! The performances of this cast in its entirety were captivating. These are all actors I was never particular fond of either, especially in relation to Jake Gyllenhaal. His character in this film had depth though and left you with certain curiosity. You know there's a back story there with all the clues and emphasis on behavior, mannerisms, and appearance in general. Also actress Melissa Leo, known for her riveting performances in Frozen River and The Fighter, totally engrosses herself in her respective character in which she worked very hard to make herself appear older and worn. This story allows you to solve the puzzle at the same speed as it's characters while asking yourself the same questions. Although both the film's writer Aaron Guzikowski and its Canadian Director Denis Villeneuve are virtually unknowns in Hollywood, their pairing with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins made this a beautifully shot film as well. The images of weather and landscape are as cold, dark, dreary, and depressing as the film itself which makes it all the more chilling. - Reviewed by AN/NR 09-20-2013",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Good, but somewhat disappointing","""Prisoners"" is essentially a remake of Mystic River (2003). It's a good mystery that uses great imagery. And despite the massive runtime, it doesn't lag too badly.I wanted to love Hugh Jackman's performance as the father, but he basically has 2 emotions in the entire film. Angry, sad, then angry again. Not that he doesn't do those two emotions well, but it's not enough. Gyllenhaal is fine as the detective, and I was pleasantly surprised by Terrence Howard as Franklin. For a movie that seemed ideal for great acting roles, the portrayals are only decent to good.The best part of the movie are the twists and turns of the mystery and how it is revealed and comes together. The imagery of the maze is an interesting motif and is used very well. I am honestly a little upset with the movie for how neatly it is all explained by the end. There is no room for ambiguity. The movie does a good job keeping us in the dark and guessing for at least 2 hours of its 2 hour 30 minute runtime. I wish it had ended with at least a little of the mystery that made it worth watching.Had I never seen Mystic River (2003) I probably would have liked Prisoners a little more.

It's a study in moral ambiguity, and at what point the ends no longer justify the means.The mystery at the center of the movie -- who's the abductor/murderer? -- at some point needs to be revealed, and the film stumbles a bit when it needs to explain itself, which it does by having the killer monologue.

Alex is suitably creepy and with a shady past, but is that enough to make him a child abuser?Drenched in the cold light of the winter season, with plenty of rain and snow, the movie manages to maintain a tense rhythm just about three quarters of the way. Then it collapses due to several problems:none of the main characters seems able to articulate their thoughts. A movie with one, strong silent type is OK, but here just about everybody (strong or otherwise) is extremely silent, even when keeping their mouth shut results only in getting additional beatingsthe Dover character, being an anguished father should attract some sympathy, but he is just a bully, determined to beat his way to the truth. A bully with a family is still a bully and the extreme violence Dover is capable of is not justified by the circumstancesthe ""investigation"" seems to be carried out by a single man. Detective Loki puts himself in dangerous situations without any back-up or contact with headquarters. Seems stupid and I doubt a real detective would risk that muchthe token pedophile priest is one of the semi-red herring sub plots that has been done way too often. Besides, even if this character could be relevant, he is also unable to relate his story in an intelligible wayat the end of the movie, Dover's wife tells Loki that her husband is ""a good man"".

Would recommend to even my greatest enemy,This has to be some of the best acting performances I have ever seen. Especially Hugh Jackman has a 10/10 acting performance. The story and reveal are amazing. Like I said I would recommend this movie to my worst enemy. This movie is in my top 10. I don't think this is a perfect movie even though I rated it a 10/10. If IMDB had more precise rating I would rate it a 9.7/10. The plot is a 10/10. And the ending is perfect the only draw back is that there is very little evidence proving who the real culprit was.

Gotta be one of my favorite Jake Gyllenhaal roles.It captures a true horror aspect that I honestly wasn't prepared for. I was constantly clenching my my seat in suspense and anticipation, and could hardly breathe through the climax of the film.This film right here, IS thriller at its finest.Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Paul Dano's performances were all outstanding! I can see why it's a critically acclaimed film. Though, Jake Gyllenhaal definitely deserves more recognition for this fantastic role!And poor Alex Jones deserved so much more.

As a father myself, watching his character's descent into desperation hit me right in the gut. Every decision, every emotion feels painfully real. Jake Gyllenhaal matches this intensity perfectly as the detective who's just as haunted by the case.The way this film builds tension is just unreal.

"A really unmainstream crime film, surprisingly","I don't know, I expected an extremely riveting thriller. Prisoners is a weird mixture of art-house sensibility and mainstream formulas. It's always verging on being contrived, and yet it somehow all works. It's extremely long, and yet I didn't mind the length. It really shouldn't work as much as it does, but somehow it does. Jackman is great, but Gyleenhaal is on another level with a less meatier role. This is his best performance since Donnie Darko back in 2001. The rest of the cast is solid, but Melissa Leo sort of overacts, yet again. This woman doesn't know when to tone it down at all. This is definitely recommended for all film fans.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Stunning performance from Jake Gyllenhaal,"The first half of Prisoners is incredibly gripping and powered by some stellar lead performances and magnificent cinematography. Gyllenhaal is comfortably the standout, turning in arguably his career best performance. It's all too common to see these aloof sullen detectives suck the life out of a movie with excessive dreariness but Gyllenhaal gets the balance between sombre and compassionate just right. Sadly though, the writing is a bit of a letdown and we are left with numerous unanswered questions and directionless subplots. To be honest, I'm still not quite sure what actually happened and how events unfolded. Everything felt a bit sloppy and incomplete, not to mention the film ran way too long. Well worth watching but a messy ending stops this from being a genuine masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A movie containing incredible acting performances, great cinematography and a story that will make you cry and look on in cheer terror as the story develops.","I will never forget the first time I watched this incredible movie.
It was a couple of years ago and I was 14-15 years old. I was hanging out with my cousin in my living-room, it was late at night (02:00 AM) and I felt ready to go to bed. My cousin had other plans and somehow managed to talk me into putting on this weird movie I´d never heard of, ""Prisoners"". I was not a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal and I only recognized Hugh Jackman from the X-Men movies and I didn´t really think of him as a good or even capable actor. I thought he got his parts in movies because of his impressive physique and great looks. I had never heard of the director (Dennis Villeneuve) and really doubted he had ever made anything worth watching (keep in mind that I was very young, dumb, pissed off and tired at this point). To say that I was skeptical of this movie would be an understatement.As I said earlier I was extremely tired and upset at this point. But 15-20 minutes into the movie I was a completely different person. I was wide awake, sitting on the edge of my seat and had no bitterness left in my body. I had forgotten about my doubts and skepticism about the movie, the actors and the director as I was busy staring at the screen trying to follow the development of the story and figure out what was going to happen next.If my interest and focus hadn´t already been captured by the clever writing and great story-development the acting sure did. The performances by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal were fantastic and captivating. However, I was far more impressed by Paul Dano´s performance as it came out of the blue for me, I had never heard of him before watching this. The feelings of fear and pain that Dano was able to give off was incredible. After watching this movie I made an effort to watch more movies starring Dano, and to this day I haven´t been able to find a single movie where he gives a poor or mediocre performance, he always delivers great performances.When the movie was over and the time was somewhere around 04:40 AM I felt as if Vincent Vega had stabbed me in the heart with i syringe full of adrenaline. I was not about to go to bed that´s for sure. I apologized to my cousin for being so rude and not wanting to give the movie a chance at first.What I love most about this movie are the twists and turns in the story, the cinematography by the always great Roger Deakins and the incredible acting which not only makes the viewer more invested in the story but also gives off a certain sense of uncomfortable realism. Seeing Hugh Jackman grief, cry and panic makes you want to jump through the screen and into the movie to give him a big hug and tell him that everything is going to be okay.I give this movie an 8,6 but because I am not able to use decimals I have to give it an 8. I will never round a score/grade up to the number above, that would mean that if I was to give a movie a 9,6 it should be given a 10/10 when I give my rating here on IMDb and i refuse to give any movie a 10/10 because that implies that it is perfect and nothing is ever perfect. Something can always be improved.I have with the years recommended this movie numerous times to many different people. This is a drama/thriller that makes the viewer sit on the edge of their seat, hold back tears and look on in fear as the desperation of Hugh Jackman´s character only increases through the duration of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Can't say I enjoyed it.,"65/100Much like most of director Denis Villeneuve's oldest proyects -aka Sicario-, this film just feels entirely unfocused and the charm of the director's most recent films lacks a sense of development and unfolding. Even when you can still tell who was the filmmaker behind this movie, it goes underappreciated.A lot of people have highlighted both Gyllenhaal and Jackman in this movie for their performances. Even when I can somewhat value them on a certain level, for the most part I just found the bigger picture annoying. Even while watching, I could only think of their performances as part of an average filmbro's TikTok compilation of ""the best male performances of all time"" and just put the bits of them shouting.The script could only do so much and, as an intent to make this movie seem like it's giving out a ton of information and plot points, they managed to extend this movie for an extremely long runtime. I understand there was the purpose of having a slowburn, slow-paced film that sort of ressembled the grief portrayed. But I have the misfortune of just overlooking it since that was the only intent behind having this movie be 2 and-a-half hours long.All I'm saying is that Prisoners will only pass down in history as the movie that supported the shift in Villeneuve's filmmaking trajectory, which is exactly the way this movie has been seen as since 2013, for better or worse...",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Disappointing, doesn't deserve the high 8/10 rating","Usually, any Imdb film rated above 6.5 is an entertaining watch, anything above 7 is amazing and 8 or above is a must-watch. However, this film is not worth your time AT ALL. I was left fuming at major plotholes in the first 5 MINUTES of the movie, the horrendous acting by every single character (save for the abducted girl Anna and perhaps the detective). Imagine that, a child actor with less than five lines and missing for majority of the movie being a better actor than the main protagonist, the dad, whose acting was passable and not convincing at all. What was even worse was that in the scenes with Anna's mum actually made me laugh out loud at the absurdity of her unrealistic version of a grieving, crying mum. Almost nothing is explained at the end of the movie, and the abductor was extremely predictable. It was obvious that it was the ------ (blanked for spoiler purposes, not that you should waste your time watching this film) from her very first appearance. The only reason why I managed to suffer through two and a half hours was so I could actually see whether I was right about who abducted the girls, and surprise surprise, I was correct. In my opinion, I think I kept waiting for the movie to redeem itself with a twist of some sort to explain the high imdb rating and I was least to say, disappointed. Probably the worst thriller I've ever watched. Don't waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"its a great phyco thriller with many twist in the vein of seven,hostage","FIrst let me say the trailer did not ruin the movie at all the trailer sums up the first 30 minutes of the first act in 2 minutes and then from there i was on the edge of my seat till the credits popped up.The acting- this was the finest acting in a film that i have seen in a long time and not just by the leading man i mean every single actor and actress was on the top of their games especially Hugh Jackman the emotion and weight he brought to the film should get him a Oscar nomination and be mentioned in the same acting quality as Ben Affleck,Leo Dicaprio,Matt Damon,Daniel Day-Lewis, and the fame as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.The plot- the plot was intriguing to me it made me think what would i do if this every happen to me, would i be the like Jackman and take the law in my own hands or would i be like Howard and let the law finish their job.The pacing- the pace was uneven i knew this wasn't an action movie but still the amount of fast paced scenes was far outnumbered by slow sitting in car watching suspects and talking on the phone the film could had been at least been 40 minutes shorter without sacrificing any story or plot.the verdict- this film is an Great Thriller with Killer performances by all cast and i would definitely recommend it only if you have 3 hours to spare (10/10]",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Splendidly filmed but weighed down by feelings of self-importance,"For all those concerned that Denis Villeneuve, director of art-house pieces Polytechnique (2009) and the Oscar-nominated Incendies (2010), has sold out on his trip to the U.S., then rest assured, Prisoners is a suitably grim, adult and metaphor-laden drama which just happens to be anchored by two Hollywood A-or-there-about-listers. Beginning with an almost unbearably tense opening hour or so, Prisoners soon dissolves into a formulaic thriller, abandoning the near-unbearable tension of the opening hour and packing the film with foot-chases and repetitive torture-porn, finding itself too caught up in tying all the many loose ends together for it all to make sense.Whilst attending a Thanksgiving dinner, the daughters of Keller (Hugh Jackman) and Grace Dover (Mario Bello), and their neighbours Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis), go missing. The only clue is a mysterious RV parked outside moments before the abduction, which is quickly found by Detecive Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) in a car park with an apparently stricken Alex Jones (Paul Dano) inside. After Alex is quickly released due to a lack of evidence, Keller is furious and unconvinced, abducting him and taking him to an abandoned former home in order to instigate his own method of interrogation.Boasting Oscar-nominated cinematography by long-time Coen Brothers collaborator Roger Deakins, this is one of the finest looking mainstream thrillers in years. Drenched in grey, the miserable colour palette drapes the film in a feeling of foreboding dread. It brings to mind the beautiful and superior thriller Zodiac (2007), only without the period setting. It drags - and it does drag - on for 2 and a half hours, and the film is so lacking in humour that any realism the film was striving for suffers. It also stars Hugh Jackman, possibly the most effortlessly likable actor working today, and watching him bang on the wall shouting ""where is my daughter!?"" - a line that should have been retired after Taken (2008) - is silly and unconvincing. The film takes itself so seriously that it almost becomes a parody of itself.Gyllenhaal as Loki, however, is outstanding, and is a character I wish the film focused more on. With neck tattoos, a strange, buttoned-up (with no tie) appearance, slick-back hair, and blinking tic, it hints at a more interesting character than the film fully allows to develop. The film is more interested in not-so-subtle War on Terror parallels and comments on post-9/11 vigilantism, that sadly struggles to keep a hold of it's ever-widening plot and multiple plot strands, over-reaching itself constantly with scenes of stoic uber-seriousness. But it's splendidly filmed, and beautifully performed by Gyllenhaal, Dano and Melissa Leo (playing Alex's mother), which could have done with some heavier editing and less self-importance.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

An A class Thriller!,"""Prisoners"" is definitely one of the best movies of 2013. It is raw, gritty and incredibly suspenseful. My heart had problems beating in a calm rhythm at several scenes.The movie opens with the Dover family walking down to the Birch's house for a thanksgiving dinner. During the dinner, the two youngest girls of both families, goes running over to Dover's house to go looking for a blue whistle toy. Time passes, and no girl is seen or heard. After a desperate search without luck, they call the police. The police is lead by detective Loki. With only an RV as a trace the investigation begins. More will i not say. The less you know, the better.""Prisoners"" is a movie which builds and builds. The suspense never stops. By a running time of approximately 2:30 hours, it never dragged. That is mostly because of the great cast, lead by Hugh Jackman (""X-Men"" series, ""The Prestige""), Jake Gyllenhaal (""Donnie Darko"", ""Jarhead"") and Paul Dano (""Looper"", ""Little Miss Sunshine""). Credits must also be given to director Denis Villeneuve (""Enemy"", ""Polytechnique"") for a very strong direction.A movie like this is all about the present of the actors. Very little is told of the background of any of the characters. And you can almost feel the characters past, express itself through their every action.So by all that being said. ""Prisoners"" is a masterful achievement. It is perfection on every level. And i believe it will be remembered for a long, long time. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Another christian movie but gripping for sure,"Just watched Prisoners at home, it was gripping for sure. The acting, the cinematography were 10/10. Hugh and Jake also did their part right.Now the downsides, story had some weaknesses, it deliberately makes you suspicious of some characters in the start (very typical of bad suspensive movies, and showing too little of actual culprits) and focus too much on some unnecessary details. It is a christian movie overall, will try to make villains out of the people who lost faith.Also, The length of the movie is 2.5+ hours, definitely feels a bit slow at times.But overall, a fun watch for the thriller/suspense lovers.

"Unfortunately, not good as I expected","Arrival and Incendies both of which were directed by Dennis Villeneuve are movies I loved very much.

Arrival, beyond to be an ordinary space alien movie, presents very powerful sub-contexts on nature of human communication, relation to strangers, philpsophy of language, theory of tempo-spatiuality of universe etc...Unfortunately, Prisoners, despite its positive features like sufficient visual narration, fails to catch a profound level which other films mentioned above reached. Character's psychological motivations are weakly portrayed and the story has lack of stronge sub-contexts altough it contains a convenient content.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar with his relentless dogged search as ""I will do anythingto find my daughter"". Paul Dano deserves an Oscar just for playing his character.

Prisoners,"Prisoners gives the viewer a dark story filled with great performances all around, gritty and muggy cinematography, fitting the setting an theme perfectly, as well as a great screenplay, excellent directing by Villueneve, with unpredictable yet non pretentious thrills and twists, a great debate between characters moral ideals, and symbolism that goes deep into faith, the principle of right and wrong, as well as being owned by a idea. Prisoners set the tone and feeling of isolation like very few films can do.

The best movie in year 2013,"I can say that this is such a fantastic movie, indeed. I did not had a high expectations about this movie, but what I saw in this movie blew me away. Hugh Jackman gave his best performance and Jake Gyllenhal almost did the same thing with his performance. I must commend the director Denis Villeneuve who did a great job. I liked the way of telling the story, rainy and gloomy atmosphere. This film keeps you on the edge of your seat and have one of the best endings I have ever watched.One of the top 5 thrillers on my list of all time. This movie reminds me a lot on a perfect Se7en. Very tense movie, with a lot of turnovers in action, time slips so fast, very interesting movie and in my opinion, THE BEST MOVIE IN YEAR 2013.

"Dat script, dat acting, dat directing","As you saw in my title the script in this movie takes the main spotlight. The twists and turns, the dialogues and the right 'till the end top level suspense. All of those aspects are majorly improved by the amazing man sitting in the directors chair and the talented men acting it out in front of the camera. Especially the one and only Hugh Jackman who steals every single scene he is in. That doesn't by far mean the other actors aren't that good. Gyllenhaal and Terrence Howard both portray two desperate men perfectly. Now to the plot which puts you in this awful situation on which two girls get abducted. A detective (Gyllenhaal) is put in charge of the case while the father of one of the girls (Jackman) takes some extreme measures. I won't go further than that to not spoil you of anything awesome (which by the way tends to be the whole movie). Directing-wise this movie is just out there in space. By I literally don't remember looking away or blinking. I just sat there at the edge of my seat biting my fingers! The composition of the opening shot just gave me the chills. A still shot of some creepy snowy woods with a dear walking by, while Jackman spells out ""The holy father"" is beautifully unsettling. A lot of the shots are still shots. They don't shy away of lingering the shots. Props to that dude named Denis Villeneuve. I'll throw it out there that this movie made me cringe. It is disturbing **** The last thing I wanna point out is the ending. It has you on your knees by being a very quiet but intense scene full of some sweet sweet shots. In the end this movie tackled all of the aspects that make a thriller great and it will definitely get itself some of those Oscar noms! 10 out of 10 baby!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Ultimately the film explores the human mind and shows how far people can be pushed to their breaking points.The dark, moody atmosphere Denis Villeneuve creates fits perfectly with the film.Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman transcend among an array of highly skilled performances from the whole supporting cast. Both actors at the pinnacle of their acting powers, career bests for sure. While watching, you really begin to understand and feel for every character.The plot is absorbing and suspenseful.

The best acting performances of the year,"I have seen many good movies from all around the world this year but ""Prisoners"" seems to be the best North American film of the year so far. It's not so much about the story of the movie that recalls the French Canadian ""7 Days"" movie by Daniel Grou that was inspired by a Patrick Senécal novel. Both films tell the story of a desperate family father who seeks revenge on a strange suspect for kidnapping (or worse?) his daughter while everything around him is suddenly falling apart.The impressive things about ""Prisoners"" are others. One must mention the constant dark atmosphere of the movie. This is due to the intensive story that is in fact the worst nightmare for any loving father or mother on earth. This movie is an intense mixture of the drama and thriller genres with a few decently used gore scenes and scary moments that aren't a far call from the horror genre.Each character shown in this movie is going through really hard times from the family father, his wife, his son and his best friends over the more and more isolated detective to the suspected kidnapper and a strange copycat kidnapper.In addition to this, most of the time in this movie the sky looks very grey, it's raining or actions take place in the middle of almost moonless nights.The inoffensive but dark and somewhat uneasy score underlines this depressive film noir approach.Not only the French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve who created the intense drama ""Incendies"" in the past delivers a detailed and intense work. The most outstanding thing is the acting. Hugh Jackman plays the role of his life as a desperate family father who is slowly going insane and ready to do anything to save his daughter. It's hard to portray a character who is going through such an incredible nightmare but Hugh Jackman is always convincing. You can feel his emotions in every word he speaks, in every move he makes and in every breath he takes. This acting performance should be worthy of an Academy Award. Jake Gyllenhaal is just as great and also does his best acting performance. He portrays a visibly nervous detective if you just take a look on his almost hyperactive eye movements. We see a detective who tries to be professional and dedicated to his job but who gets more and more isolated and who starts making more and more mistakes. By the end of the movie, the kidnapping case has also become something almost personal for him as he acts beyond rationality to solve the case. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is also worthy of an Academy Award. The supporting actors are also doing a fine job. Especially Paul Dano convinces as inscrutable and unpredictable suspect. His aunt portrayed by Melissa Leo gets better and better as the movie progresses.The tension of the story gets more and more elevated towards the end. I don't want to reveal any twists but let's say that I didn't see the incredible revelations coming. During the last thirty minutes or so, the movie even got me more on the edge of my seat than it was the case before. These last thirty minutes introduce a whole new dimension to the movie. Some viewers may dislike this new approach but I thought that it added even more intensity to the film.At the end of the day, this is an atmospheric, intense and extremely well acted film noir that mixes credible drama elements with gripping and sometimes scary crime passages. If you care for any of these genres, you can't get around this movie this year. I hope it will win a couple of Academy Awards next year as I can hardly see any better Hollywood movie these days. I'm convinced this will be considered as a classic or one of the best movies of all times one day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A bleak crime drama,"Denis Villeneuve is currently one of the best directors around and for good reason. His first American film, Prisoners, was a prime example of this. Prisoners could easily have been a film that could have been a passable but unremarkable crime drama about a child's disappearance. Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski were able to elevate the material, making Prisoners into an intense thriller about a father exploring his dark side so he can find his daughter, a police procedural about the investigation, and a family drama about a family struggling with the disappearance. Prisoners was a bleak film that worked as a character study and allowed many talented actors really juicy roles.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Fantastic, Refreshing Film of the 2013 Fall Season (May Contain Spoilers)","As expected, September gives its film lovers the chance to cleanse themselves of the uninspired and redundant movie season that is Summer. This month is the first of many that will give many cinemas across the globe freedom from reboots, remakes, rehashes, and the now-accepted void that is New Hollywood.Thus, the first cleanse offered, in my opinion, is the newly-released film, ""Prisoners"", starring Best Actor Oscar nominee Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Focusing on a parent's worst nightmare, child abduction and possible murder, the film incessantly grabs you from the first frame to the last. Walking out of this film without any feelings of gut-wrenching or punching is impossible; unless, you are a complete sociopath intending to laugh at every scene.Jackman, plays Keller Dover, a loving husband, father, and carpenter in trade, who, along with his wife, Grace (played by Maria Bello in an understandably catatonic state throughout the movie), and friends/neighbors, Franklin and Nancy Birch (played gracefully by Terrance Howard and Best Actress Oscar nominee Viola Davis), find their worlds turned upside down by the kidnappings of their youngest children after Thanksgiving dinner.Seeking the help of Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki (No ""Thor"" jokes, please!), an officer seemingly dealing with demons of his own, the only information they have is the appearance and disappearance of a mysterious RV parked not far from the Birch home. A creepy man-child (played astonishingly by Paul Dano) is the prime suspect, questioned, held, and, of course, released after the required 48-hours. Without giving away spoilers, Jackman decides to place justice into his own hands.While I understand his position as a desperate father, I cannot condone the behavior because of the fine line of criminality that Dover exhibits between protector of his child and sadist. ""Prisoners"" director, Denis Villeneuve, sharply presents that case because, as a viewer, you want the children found, but at the same time, you feel that you're participating in a crime, while questioning whether or not the ends justify the means. More so, the Birches struggle to find which side of the coin they belong as well, and they often are the voices of reason. What follows Jackman's actions is a film of welcomed twists and turns that, as cliché and trite as it sounds nowadays, truly leave you by the edge of your seat.Therefore, I recommend this film (8 out of 10 Kashmirs). The performances are top-notch. Jackson never fails to deliver as he goes back and forth with both grief and depravity as he serves as the audience surrogate. While Gyllenhaal raises the bar as he plays the reluctant hero, both wary of the individuals involved and job weary, period. Plus, I did appreciate the nod to Gyllenhaal's early work in the much underrated ""Zodiac"". I will leave that nod unspoiled for those desiring to figure it out themselves. Last, but not least, I must give special applause to Paul Dano, who delivers the role as a constant enigma. Viewers never know if he's a great deceiver or a victim himself.While I cannot find fault with the film, the film's ending is a cool smack to the face. While mildly annoyed, it was a taste of the unexpected and rarely used sublime. ""Prisoners"" is a must-see film of the Fall season.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A Brilliant Thriller with Beautiful Cinematography and Powerful Acting,"Director Denis Villeneuve, according to his biography, quit his studies in entomology to pursue his love of filmmaking. I can easily argue that such was the best decision, for if not for him, we would not have been given this wonderful masterpiece. 'Prisoners' may just be the best movie I've seen all year.After leaving the theater, I was still left with awe in regard to the incredibly dark (and awesome) atmosphere. Hugh Jackman gives his best acting performance to date, and pretty much every actor casted was sensational.You can truly feel the various emotions and mental afflictions each character faces, as it builds up to the resolution of the mystery, piece by piece. The story seems simple at first, yet the execution is just so breathtaking and well-written, you are forced to stay at the edge of your seat. You may feel like it's slow-paced at first, but as you progress, you are gradually more and more indulged by the insightful atmosphere.However, in my opinion, the strongest element (and possibly the most Oscar-worthy) of this film is the cinematography. All of the rack focuses, slow panning wideshots, close-ups, etc., along with the dark color gradients and perfect lighting, totally sold the visual tone and storytelling aspect. I really do hope Roger Deakins does win an Oscar this time. His work in this movie was incredible!I don't really have any complaints.

I've only ever seen him in one other film (Knight and Day) but i thought he was also a great addition to the cast. Although the cast was good, i would have liked to see a little more from the mother (Maria Bello). I found the ending predictable although i never had a clue who the kidnapper was right up until the last moments.

disturbing,"Yep, disturbing,,, and completely implausible. Jake is great as the detective, but Jackmans' character is a contradiction. Ending is completely wrong. Too late to UN-see it, but, maybe not for YOU. Jackman, being a survivalist, should NEVER have let himself get into the predicament he did. First mistake was turning his back on Melissa Leo, second was allowing her to make him put on the hand cuffs, third was not gunning the Camaro in reverse and taking her off with the open door she was standing beside, fourth was allowing her to shoot him in the leg, fifth was getting into the hole, sixth was not finding a way to climb back out and simply push the plywood aside, seventh was not throwing something at the plywood when he heard voices above, and attract some attention. Add to that, the fact that NOBODY even checked the Camaro and decided to dig on the opposite side of the house. May have crossed Jakes mind, but if it did, fade-out eliminated the thought. Is that enough? How about - Are these girls MORONS talking to strangers and getting into the camper? BOTH girls? When one of their fathers is a SURVIVALIST?

Possibly Best Film of 2013?,"Prisoners is a terrific maze of a thriller as the viewer is never quite sure of what's about to happen. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki who has solved every case he's had. And this one is not to elude him but amazingly, he's hot and cold, off and on, and only solves the case with a bit of luck. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a man who will almost stop at nothing to find his daughter. His and Franklin Birch (played by Terrence Howard) are fathers caught between desperation and loss of ethics. As vigilantes, they take twisted justice into their own hands. As one amateur reviewer here suggests, it is an unusual thriller clouded by moral ambiguity. However, I'm not sure if that is really the case, but rather how far are we willing to test morality and ethics.Acting is excellent by all major characters including Viola Davis who plays a distraught Nancy Birch, Maria Bello who plays Grace Dover, Melissa Leo who is excellent as Holly Jones, and Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones. Cinematography by Roger Deakins and direction by Denis Villeneuve is outstanding. Kudos to Roger who was nominated for an Oscar and this is as good as his cinematography in No Country For Old Men.Amazingly, Prisoners only received one Oscar nomination. But then many great films were snubbed by the Oscars. For example, Citizen Kane often rated #1 on many critics list only won one Oscar. Taxi Driver went 0 for 4 in wins and nominations, and Once Upon a Time in the West never received any nominations but among most critics, these films are among the best.Looking up some lists as for the best films of 2013, for example, the Huffington Post lists 17 films topped by 2) Gravity and 1) American Hustle. Gravity is a spectacular visual film with a poor script, average acting and weak plot as it defies every realistic scenario in space. It will fall into the Rocky category, a film honored by a clueless academy that should beg forgiveness. American Hustle is superior to Gravity but dries up a but at the end. I would place Prisoners at the same level, and perhaps even better than American Hustle. It is probably the best thriller since Silence of the Lambs and a remarkable insightful film into human ethics. Unfortunately, despite being in that category, it happened to be made in 2013 which, frankly, appears to be one of the strongest cluster of films, although, I would think many 9s but perhaps no legendary 10s.However, only a few graphic thrillers such as Silence of the Lambs or No Country for Old Men have ever been recognized. One wonders if being too graphic turned off Oscar nominations. Hollywood would rather have a clean sentimental screening, like Gravity or 12 Years A Slave. But as time goes on, this film should rise as a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

First, it gives you all the information in advance on a silver platter, there are no real surprises in the movie (though you keep hoping there will be some), but the clues are so visible and obvious that anyone who ever had to solve a logical question, should be able to understand the plot pretty much from the beginning... It also tries to shock the viewer in order to convey the characters' dilemmas. It's an easy and cheap way of conveying a message. I find it more effective and lasting when the ideas are presented to me to digest than being thrown at my face, trying to force me consider issues that I don't even think are worth my consideration. The movie is full packed with gaping holes in the plot. Things that just don't make much sense in 2013, and Jake's character, as a detective, seems to simply be a very bad, incapable detective.Overall, it's disappointing to see so many good actors, and good acting, goes to waste on a badly written, badly thought of, screenplay.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A seemingly generic plot on the surface is infused with such bone-chilling tension, dread, and artistic strokes that it eventually becomes a different beast altogether.The father is Hugh Jackman, who delivers a scorcher of a performance! Take away Wolverine's claws & replace it with raw emotional weight and you have Jackman's character Keller Dover. Jake Gyllenhaal is also incredibly impressive playing a character struggling between his procedural job & natural instincts. Terrance Howard, Viola Davis, & Paul Dano also put in excellent performances in their respective supporting roles.The movie, a long procedural hearkens back to Fincher's murder mysteries. In fact, given the pace, narrative quality, & sharp editing one could be excused for mistaking it as such. That is a well-earned compliment for the director Denis Villeneuve. Although in a different context when compared to Seven, the film possesses a layer of religious insinuation that adds interest to the story-structure.The film proudly shows off Roger Deakins cinematography in what may be his best work considering that this is not a spectacle movie or one shot in some iconic location. His skills elevate the production with gorgeous lighting & camera-angles. It is a technical aspect many will overlook in the dreary setting of the story, but is major strength of the film. Nowhere is it punctuated better than in a brief night-time driving sequence towards the end of the film.Overall, Prisoners is a dramatic & nerve-grinding thriller of the highest order. It is a slow-burn drama that is a fitting companion-piece to films like Seven & Zodiac.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Scarily True,"I have watched and re-watched this film since I was ten years old and the more I watch it(now a filmmaker) the little details In writing and the things as a child I thought were dumb are now so meaningful and powerful. Rain shots, screaming scenes, the crying. It has you on your toes the whole movie. Everyone and no one is a suspect and I think that's what crime and mystery movies are so lacking of nowadays. Hugh Jackman plays the family man so well and seeing that nature turn dark and twisted because of grief and sadness and anger is beautiful to see. Well done with writing. This movie deserves more than 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Not What I Expected,"'Prisoners' tells the tough story of two young girls who are kidnapped on Thanksgiving. Both sets of parents struggle to cope as they are left helpless and have to rely on Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to work on finding their missing daughters.The story starts off a little too rosy and 'happy families.' This is soon over and the atmosphere and tension build up as the families realise their children are missing, presumed kidnapped. The film has a very bleak tone and is initially quite gritty. However, the story soon turns into a Hollywood tale rather than a heart breaking story.'Prisoners' is really a film of two parts; the first is following rule-breaking Detective Loki as he tries to find the girls. His side is quite interesting and doesn't really have any negative aspects to it - it simply is what it is, an investigation. Hugh Jackman plays the father of one of the missing girls; he is understandably frustrated after the suspected kidnapper is let go due to a lack of evidence. He takes the drastic step of kidnapping the suspect and chaining him to a sink in an abandoned house to torture him. This is obviously to make the audience ask themselves the question 'what would I do in that situation?' As the film progresses, things get more and more extreme. It gets to the point where you realise no one in real life would ever do something like this and that is when 'Prisoners' looses its audience. Things just get too silly and unrealistic.Hugh Jackman gives a really good performance but his character's actions become too bizarre. Terrence Howard is really bad which is surprising. He plays the other father and has to cry and be upset in numerous points of the film. He just does not look like he cares at all though - his crying scenes look incredibly forced and unnatural. The two mothers are shown to be useless which is a little disappointing and slightly offensive; Viola Davis could have gave a fantastic and powerful performance here but all her character does is stare into space. Maria Bello lies in bed the whole time because her character becomes depressed but doesn't really revive from it - it would have been good to see her beat the illness. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an admirable performance - although it is quite similar to that in the brilliant 'Zodiac,' he plays an investigator who has never failed to solve a case with his brash approach and his 'f**k-it' attitude. He is the only character in the entire film who isn't one-dimensional. Paul Dano also gives a great performance; he somehow manages to be creepy and seem so innocent at the same time.The film could have focused more on the slow yet inevitable breakdown of the families rather than the endless - and ultimately pointless - scenes of torture. It was briefly mentioned in the beginning that Hugh Jackman's family are struggling financially - this is never mentioned again and it is fairly evidence that Terrence Howard's family are very wealthy. It seemed like such an obvious foreshadow that the two families would end up arguing at some point but they don't.A lot of reviews have questioned the ending, many have found it annoying or weird. It is a strange way to end the film but, in context it is the most positive ending possible.Overall, 'Prisoners' is quite disappointing; the story is unnecessarily complicated and becomes ridiculous. Most of the performances are good - particularly the leads. For a film like this you would expect there to be some really harrowing points - there were hardly any.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the best movies I've seen in a while,"Having your child kidnapped is probably one of the worst fears a parents could ever imagine. That's what prisoners is all about. Prisoners is one of the best suspenseful movies I have watched, it was interesting and kept me on my toes the whole time. Although it was drowned out a little bit and the ending was annoying, that's why I only rated it 8 out of 10 stars. There were parts that I didn't like especially how long it took them to find the kidnapper, although I love how the kidnapper was someone you wouldn't expect. I did love how ever the father of one of the daughters did absolutely everything he could to try to find his daughter, I thought that was sweet even if it meant breaking the laws. I would watch this movie a thousand more times if i could.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Amazing!!! 10/10,"""Prisoners"", directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Aaron Guzikowski, was an incredible story of one man who will do anything to find his daughter.Although the plot appears slow moving at first, your emotions are quickly taken for a wild ride as the plot constantly turns from one dilemma to the next, and just as soon as you think you've solved the case, a new twist sends you spiraling into a whole new line of reasoning forcing you to continuously ask ""who is really guilty?""Furthermore, the cast chosen for this spectacle did a stunning job. Not only was the crises believable, but the characters were portrayed so well, that you yourself will ask ""where is his daughter?!"" This was by far one of Hugh Jackman's greatest performances where you truly saw a father who knew the questionable measures he'd have to take if he wanted to find his daughter. As time passes on, Keller Dover, (Hugh Jackman), displays overwhelming levels of desperation and the methods he uses, though could be considered cruel, forces the audience to question their sense of objective morality. Additionally, I tip my hat off to Jake Gyllenhaal, who also did an equally spellbinding performance as Detective Loki. From what was just another case, became the focal mission of his career as he anxiously desires to find both missing daughters alive.Finally, you will not be disappointed with the conclusion, as you see that every ounce of what appeared to be trivial information is actually fundamentally one great big basket weave of a greater evil truth. This movie will constantly leave you on the edge of your seat, and I assure you, that this movie will be something you'll want to watch again and again.Amazing!!! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Gripping mystery,"A great mystery film. It's definitely the kind of movie that, afterward, you can pick it apart a bit and find some major narrative flaws, but, while it's going, it's so gripping and tense you're just in the moment. Hugh Jackman and wife Maria Bello take their two kids over to their neighbors' (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) house for Thanksgiving. Their two young daughters go outside to play and disappear. Detective Jake Gyllenhaal is assigned to the case and quickly finds the driver of a mysterious RV that had been seen in the neighborhood, a severely retarded man (Paul Dano). There's no evidence whatsoever that Dano did anything, but Jackman leaches onto him, refusing to believe the police in the matter. He soon kidnaps Dano and attempts to torture the truth out of him. The theme of compromised morality is powerful, and Jackman is great in this role. Gyllenhaal is also very good, although sometimes the character feels too much like a movie cop (this dude never calls for backup, even in the most dangerous situations!). The film is gorgeously shot, edited and scored.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the best crime thrillers in a long time.,"Prisoners is a film best left not knowing much about it. It's a long, slow-paced crime thriller. It requires the viewers to invest themselves emotionally, and will often keep the viewer on the edge of their seats throughout it's many twists and turns. Prisoners is tedious at times because of it's slow unravelling nature, however this is used to draw the viewer in and join in this thriller. More films like this need to be made and it's a shame that Hollywood won't touch this subject matter more often. Prisoners is quite a dark and disturbing story. However I felt that it didn't quite push itself as far as it could have. That being said it still is a very dark thriller, and one of the best in recent memory.Hugh Jackman is outstanding in this film, and hopefully he gets an Oscar nod. However unfortunately I feel that this film will be ignored by the time it comes to award season. All the actors in this film are great and it's a well acted machine. Prisoners is also very well directed. I cannot recommend this film enough and easily will say this is one of the best films of the year. It's not without it's problems but this is one thriller not to miss!!Rating: 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Disappointing after a compelling set-up,"This feels like a great idea burned by weak plotting and an extraordinarily dumb cop protagonist. We were ahead of him all the way, despairing at his inability to spot the most obvious clues while refusing to question what was obviously very questionable evidence. The parents of the missing children also behave so foolishly that I lost sympathy for them. I did watch to the end though, as I did at least hope they'd find the missing children. But even the ending proved to be predictable and anti-climactic. A real shame, as the story itself is a good one - it's how it's told lets it down. In a detective movie like this, the audience shouldn't be ahead of the detective. We despaired over the cop's stupidity.I hope Jake Gyllenhall isn't going make a habit of playing numbskulls; his character in Life is equally dim-witted.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A little dark, but genius","Denis Villeneuve showcases his expertise in the first try at a major budget (six times bigger than anything he had before) and a prestigious cast, creating basically the perfect blend of artistic flair and mainstream appeal, not too different of something Fincher could do.Every aspect of the movie is just superb. Visually beautiful (if you can call it that with this type of movie), a perfect score that consumes you from the inside and then disappears to let the actors cook. And do they. Every actor does an excellent job (Jackman and Gyllenhaal with more screentime, even more so).And what makes it, basically a masterpiece in my opinion, is that the movie not only doesn't lose strenght and force with a second viewing, but on the contrary, it gains value because it allows your brain to catch the incredible details of a perfect script (Aaron Guzikowski), enhancing the experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Fall at Its Core,"Prisoners (2013) is a very disturbing movie, but at the same, oddly cozy. To me, this movie is the perfect ""Fall"" movie. The soundtrack is slow and methodical accompanied by Villeneuve's masterful visuals. This film feels like a warning to anyone willing to listen and dive into the minds of its main characters. Everyone is a prisoner to something and as the characters deal with this in separate ways, even deplorable acts can become somewhat justifiable. Villeneuve is able to expertly weave an incredibly gripping masterpiece of visual storytelling along with amazing acting. Jake Gyllenhaal is especially good, his small twitches and contrasting sudden bursts of rage blend so well together. Prisoners is a perfect example of the darkness ahead, but just out of sight. It's the perfect fall movie because of the knowledge of approaching cold storms and the feeling of not being able to stop them. The ending is also incredibly unique and I've yet to see another movie even attempt a similar style ending. Overall, Incredible!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A suspense thriller that keeps you watching,"Film was brilliantly directed. A little on the violent side, but not as sickening as the Saw movies. A great story, but the only complaint you might see is that the story has been done before in some regards - it is a kidnapping story. That said, I'm OK as long as it's not direct plagiarism, isn't the same characters (i.e. Taken, Taken 2), and is well-directed and well-acted, which is certainly true in this case. I think Jackman somewhat underplayed his role, while Gyllenhall played the part perfectly. It left you with some questions at the end, and some parts were nostalgic cliché moments that just felt out of place. Outside of these minor problems, the story is insanely suspenseful and has you glued to your seat, so this is a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Prisoners not worth it,"Well acted but mediocre script & a major letdown. The commercials really had me sold. Normally I'm not fooled by commercials, I must admit, this time I was fooled.

I knew less than half way through the movie what was coming & whodunit. Unfortunately, this is a movie that Hollywood just couldn't keep their not so subtle liberal, leftist politics out of. This is set up in the very 1st scene where Hugh Jackman is out with his son shooting a poor Bambi like deer & again later when you see all the ""I'm ready for anything"" supplies in Hugh's basement. Hugh's character ends up pulling a totally foolish act that no logical, ""I'm ready for anything"" right winger would ever do. I don't think any liberal capable of thought would have done what Hugh ends up doing either. No, I'm not talking about torturing the young man. The resolution to that even turns out liberal.

"Dark, moody, disturbing thriller","Super disturbing, creepy, angry and violent with an absolute sense of dread throughout. One of those movies that I wonder why I'm watching because it makes me so uncomfortable. I'm glad I stuck with this though because it also ended up also being one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.A bit of a slow burn, heavy on the dialogue and maybe too long but masterful storytelling that never went where I was expecting, with many moments when the dots connected and I was like oh wow that's what the significance of ""that"" is or he has ""that"" to make noise with. Multiple red herrings in the suspect arena too.The acting here is also just fantastic, Oscar worthy performances from Hugh Jackman as he takes matters into his own hands when his daughter and her friend go missing; I have never seen him in a role like this before angry, possessed driven to the point of crazy decisions. Jake Gyllenhaal is also amazing as the detective assigned to the case and Melissa Leo, I didn't even recognize her. Can't go wrong with Terrence Howard or Viola Davis either who play the parents of the other missing girl.Also nice to see a movie (these days) that doesn't rely on special effects, superheroes or crazy action sequences to tell its story.

"Good, but not that good.","The French film Martyrs and The Vanishing (original version not the remake) must have been an influence, however, being a Hollywood film, this one never dares to go too far.It grabs your attention from the first minutes and doesn't let go of you, but as the plot progresses you realize that certain things don't stick together.The flaws in the armor start showing in the last act. Lots of things are either not explained or don't make much sense. Also the way the investigation of the two missing girls is handled throughout the film, doesn't correspond to what happens in real life. Where were the cadaver dogs or the forensic experts?When it comes to motivation for the crimes, the writing is vague. Or maybe it's the half hour that was cut before release.As for the finale, I must say that I was dissapointed. The director had two options. You either go for a Hollywood ending or for something that will destroy the soul of the viewer, in the style of Martyrs or Vanishing. Unfortunately, the need to please the viewers is one of the largest weaknesses of this film.What they opted for was a festival film ending, kinda like a Lanthimos film.

A suffocating thriller,"Denis Villeneuve has an innate talent for creating such an immersive atmosphere in his films that it is impossible to take your eyes off the screen.
With 'Prisoners' he approaches the criminal and police thriller with a labyrinth of emotions and intrigues as well constructed as it is compelling and suffocating. It is prodigious of this author how he creates tension and even terror with planes as simple as the depth approach to the trunk of a tree, and even more, he manages to maintain this same tension and feeling of restlessness at a level that is only comparable with David Fincher. And it is that really, this film could be a Fincher film like 'Zodiac' or 'Seven', but Villeneuve gives it his own stamp that, slowly but surely, becomes a very recognizable one and catapults him as one of the best of their generation.

Intense and gripping,"""Making children disappear is the war we wage with God. Makes people lose their faith, turns them into demons like you.""The journey leading up to Dune continues with Denis Villeneuve's 5th featured length movie. His first three, August 32nd on Earth, Maelström, and Polytechnique, weren't very good for me, and only until his 4th, Incendies, which I pretty recently watched, did Villeneuve got the right budget to make great movies.I watched Prisoners a while ago, and I remembered not really digging it. However, after this rewatch, I totally loved this movie. First of all, Hugh Jackman's intense performance outshined everyone else. The way his character lost his humanity while trying to find the answer was both heartbreaking and terrifying. Jake Gyllenhaal was also great with his change in demeanor as a cop. The way he smiled at first and then turned violent got on my nerve a little bit.The story itself was intense, slow, yet intriguing. For 2 hours and 30 minutes, I did not feel bored, and only got more gripped into the story as the movie progressed. It did not feel long. The plot was a harsh look at the way people lost their faith or tried to cling to their faith without losing themselves to hatred.Probably the best aspect that elevated the mystery was the maze symbol that became more apparent toward the end. Not only was it integral to the plot, but the mazes without a way out also served as prisons that the characters got stuck in. Some got imprisoned in captivity, childhood trauma, revenge, finding answers, and hatred of God.Overall, an amazing and gripping thriller that I wanted more of. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A Twisted Descent,"Underneath grey skies, Director Denis Villeneuve examines the lengths people will go to for their young ones, and the rationale that might be used to justify what can only be seen as reprehensible acts. Be forewarned this movie contains scenes of brutal violence that should leave you wincing.Gyllenhaal's logical and professional Detective Loki provides an excellent foil for the irrational and illogical behaviour that comes to pass around him as he struggles to solve a missing persons case. And even as he succeeds, those with blind right wing views continue to support their own evil actions through various means including religion. Blindly they cling to their original views with twisted logic and a refusal to accept facts. Inside a situation where bad actions are compounded by more bad actions, Villeneuve also explores the depths and importance of a person's own children. In particular Villeneuve seems interested in how much of a person's life fulfilment is linked to their children's lives. Throughout the film the childless Detective Loki's history and life is never really filled in. Brilliantly though, he is still engaging to the audience, and the subject of children as always increases our emotional involvement. The atmosphere is taut in this film, and punctuated by violence that is made all the more brutal by that tautness. The full 2 1/2 hours is required to follow such a complex descent into people's emotions and the illogical and prejudiced acts that follow when a child's life may be threatened. The plot is as twisting and unpredictable as people's emotions can be, and you may be surprised by the ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Very well thought out suspense thriller,"Excellent, excellent movie I'd have to say. Best suspense movie I've seen in quite sometime.First, Hugh Jackman's acting is crazy good. I expected nothing less. I love the director's take on the film. Instead of focusing solely on the details of the crime, he focused more on the emotional mental turmoil of each family member of the missing girls. If none of us have ever been through something like that before then we can't begin to understand how horrifying that must feel knowing someone has your child and doing unspeakable things to them. I really appreciated the director focusing on that.Secondly, Jake Gallenhal is just simply the man. The chemistry between him and Jackman just fit so well in this drama/thriller.

Jóhannsson/Villeneuve collab: the start of something beautiful,"The music:Now, I think Jóhann Jóhannsson is one of the finest modern film composers, and part of the reason is because of his ability to find the right balance between traditional instrumentation and electronica. This film is a prime example of that; most of the time you can't hear when the orchestra starts and when the electronics begin.One half of the score is beautifully restrained. It makes you feel calm, yet so helpless to all that is going on in the film - a near-sedative effect. There are a few scenes with little dialogue, where your senses are somehow overwhelmed by the small amount of music playing in the back. It adds depth and expresses the humanity in every character you see on screen.Meanwhile, the other half is nightmarish, frightful, and dark, yet so alluring. You fear it; you dread it. Yet, you let it pull you in. With a solo cello playing unnerving triplets behind a growling bass soundscape, the dark side of the plot is revealed to us. And the best (or the most terrifying) part is how slow Jóhannsson manages to make this.The music surprisingly works better in the stand-alone album, which is something you don't find in many soundtracks. I would say the soundtrack album for this movie is near-perfect and is definitely worth a listen for anyone who isn't deterred by the slow, dragged-out nature of the music.Music used in the film: 9 out of 10; music in the album: 10 out of 10.The film:Man, this was intense. All the actors, even the ones that played smaller roles like Viola Davis, were terrific. Cinematographer Roger Deakin's work particularly stands out, with his great use of color.There are so many things in the film that are good, but I'd argue the story is the best part. It's hard to write a near-flawless plot for a thriller, and somehow they managed to do exactly that. Great job, Aaron Guzikowski.4½ out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Sombre and eerie masterpiece,"A very sombre and eerie story, the music, dark locations, run-down houses and wounded characters left me with a feeling of foreboding. The apparent kidnapping of two children immediately thrusts two families into a crisis in the middle of their Thanksgiving get-together. The rest of the movie deals with the fallout for families, police, neighbours, suspects, etc. and the suspense is tight enough to grip the audience until the end. The leading characters are played by Hugh Jackman, as Keller Dover, the father of one of the children, and Jake Gyllenhall, as Detective Logi, the man assigned to the case. Dover is a man of strength and ferocity who sees his purpose in life to defend and protect his wife and family from harm. When this particular crisis hits, his one objective is to rescue his daughter unharmed and nothing will stop him, even taking the law into his own hands. This leads to a some horrific scenes with the immediate suspect, a young man with a limited intelligence played by Paul Dano and his mother played by Melissa Leo. Maria Bello plays Dover's wife with Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as the parents of the second child. The detective uses every resource available to try to locate the children. Detective Loki is a low-key but determined police officer who cannot keep Keller Dover from flying into a continuous rage over the time it takes to find the kidnap victims.

"""Every moment matters""","Prisoners is one of these films that will make you spend 2 hours and then surprise you in the last 30 minutes. A great film that has great acting performances, cinematography, directing, screenplay, and everything.Prisoners really surprised me with everything. Didn't expect the film to go to where it's going. Its story is so great and I believe that's thanks to the build-up that took 2 hours. Although it's a long time. But, in the end, it will all make sense and the pieces are all put together perfectly. Every film is famous for a specific scene but it's hard to find one in this film because there are so many so it's hard to pick. I'll be honest, at the first, I didn't like that the film was taking too much time to tell the story and it was giving us one piece after the other but at the end, we were able to put all of them together and it gave us a masterpiece.I believe that this is Jake Gyllenhaal's second-best performance (Nightcrawler being the first). He was able to present Detective Loki in such a unique way that only Jake himself is able to play. For those who don't know, Detective Loki's tattoos, rings, and rapid blinking were all Jake Gyllenhaal's ideas. I believe that the rings and the tattoos have meanings behind them which makes Detective Loki an interesting character that we all want to know more about. Now for Hughe Jackman, I believe that this is his best performance even better than Wolverine. In many scenes, you could feel his pain as a father who lost his daughter especially in those scenes where he was screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs. You can feel the pain in his voice. Overall, the acting in this film is ON POINT.Denis Villeneuve's way of directing this film is very unique. He was able to give us drama, Thriller, Crime, and many more using his directing and the little small details that you might think don't matter but they all will at the end. Roger Deakins with his great cinematography/camera movements were beautiful, the film really has many shots that are beautiful. Also, the colors and the editing really helped to give the audience that thriller/crime vibe.Overall, this film has everything. Acting, cinematography, editing, directing, and even the music/soundtrack may be the most part that many didn't notice. But, in some scenes, you could hear the beautiful soundtrack of Jóhann Jóhannsson playing in the background and giving you that suspense/thriller feel. Great film that the more you get deep into it and notice the little details, the more you like it.My rating is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Outstanding from both of them and how they weren't nominated for academy awards I'll never know. The film itself takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions and whilst the subject matter is dark and disturbing 2 little girls being abducted, the film focusses more on the struggle of both father and detective as they hunt for the truth about what happened to the two girls.

"dark, riveting drama/thriller driven by a traumatized Jackman and aggressive Gyllenhaal","It's hard to believe this movie wasn't based on some bestselling novel. Nope. Original screenplay. The story is emotionally evocative on so many levels, and that's just on paper. The tremendous performances by Hugh Jackman (as the traumatized but ruthlessly steadfast father) and Jake Gyllenhaal (as the aggressively determined cop) are what makes this more than just a run-of-the-mill suspense/mystery but a powerhouse drama-thriller. The little details left to speculation regarding Gyllenhaal's character (Detective Loki) are what piques my curiosity the most, and the mutliple layers to the mysteries in the movie keep you at the edge of your seat. Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Terrence Howard also give powerful performances of grief-stricken parents.

Fantastic crime drama thriller with insanely good performances,"For months I had this movie in watchlist waiting to see it after all I have heard and I must say it is one heck of a movie .

Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible as always ! The cinematography is just brilliant . The only problem of the film is that it is a tad too long and maybe problematic for certain people who loves fast paced thriller but the slow and steady suspense unfolding makes it very gripping .., and with years gone by and this film still tops many list I assume people didn't had that problem..

A Well Rounded Emotional Thriller,"Prisoners is a Thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve which is centered around the kidnapping of two daughters and how the families cope with this tragedy. The movie is both a drama which explores the evolution of various characters throughout the course of the film and how certain events affect their reasoning and decision making, where as on another hand the film is a crime, detective-like one with Jake Gyllenhaal's character of Detective Loki.The film it self is shot beautifully and the cinematography and editing really allows for it to capture a gloomy vibe, this is also because of the films filming in the fall which adds to the feeling of the film. The film has many great actors with stellar performances which seem believable. The film is generally a crime mystery which the audience begins to unravel as the movie goes on through various hints incorporated in the film.

An outstanding crime thriller.,"Prisoners is an outstanding film that surprised me. It is so realistic, and even though the story line isn't the most original, the story feels fresh and harsh. The performances are outstanding and every character feels real and lends to the film. Hugh Jackman plays a stern father who lies in a gray area of morality, and is worn down as the film progresses. Viola Davis, Terrance Howard, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, and the other cast members are incredible each in their own ways. But who really stands out is Jake Gyllenhaal, as a twitchy, aggressive, young detective with secrets. His interactions with the other characters and the situation is beautiful and perfect. Rodger Deakins spectacular cinematography creates a dreary yet beautiful world for the characters to play in and makes the film perfect.

Bleak House,"I've been trying to catch up with some of Denis Villeneuve's earlier work, as I'm such a fan of his ""Dune"" films. Turns out I've had ""Prisoners"" on Blu Ray for a while but haven't gotten around to watching it yet. I remedied that this weekend. Its unrelenting subject matter make it a tough watch, though there's clear quality there.Two young girls go missing from a small town and are unable to be found. Suspicion falls on Alex Jones (Paul Dano) a man with the IQ of a child, though he's released when there is no physical evidence that he was involved. One of the girls' fathers, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), convinced of Jones' guilt - kidnaps him and holds him, trying to torture their location out of him. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) continues his investigation elsewhere and find a connection to historic child murders in the area.So yes, it's a bleak time as the film deal with child kidnapping, destroyed parents, torture and murder. It's not a film I can see myself revisiting very often - just because it's so heavy. And long. It does have amazing performances though, from Jackman and Gyllenhaal as well as typical roles from Dano and from David Dastmalchian who arrives as another suspect a little into the film. The actual story is compelling, even if, as I say, it does feel a little to comprehensively told. I didn't think that there was anything particularly groundbreaking in the direction or cinematography, but Roger Deakins was nominated for that year's Oscar so perhaps it's better than I thought.I can't think of much more to say really. It's really well made and well-acted but it's also a bleak film about pain and desperation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Incredible,"I am completely and utterly deprived and lost for words! I don't know whether to suggest you stay clear of this film and avoid at all cost, or whether to recommend it. Prisoners has really almost redefined the Thriller genre and in a sense, set the bar so high for upcoming Thrillers, its gonna take a master piece to get your heart racing even half as fast as this one does. ""The Equalizer"" doesn't even come close to equalizing with this high ranker.Serving suggestion: use the bathroom before viewing and put your mobile on silent or better yet, completely off. This one requires no less than your full attention. And no matter how hard you try, there is absolutely no way you can predict how this film ends. I'll tell you this much though, the closing scene will blow you away! Either in a positive or negative way, but blow you away it shall - no doubt. By the time the end credits rolled, we were rendered frozen and speechless for a good 3 minutes before we all one by one got up and went our separate ways, still void of speech and comment.Flaws?

A beautiful and brooding masterpiece,"PRISONERS is an intense, unforgettable look at how far people go to protect the ones they love. Excellent performances, beautiful cinematography and a haunting soundtrack combine to create one of the best films this year. The story is about two girls who are abducted, and the ensuing investigation. One of the parents (played by Hugh Jackman) is not satisfied with how the police are doing their job, and takes it upon himself to do some investigating of his own. What follows is a journey into the abyss and dark recesses of the human soul as the rules are bent (and broken) in an attempt to solve the mystery and find closure. I don't want to give anything else away, as that would severely reduce the emotional impact. This movie does what most can't, and maintains an almost unbearable level of tension throughout it's entire run time, which is about two and a half hours. Everyone of the leads is on their A-game, and bring such pathos to their characters that you can't help but identify and sympathize with them. Of course, who couldn't given the subject matter (unless you're a psychopath)? This is greatly enhanced by a lurking sense of dread conveyed brilliantly by the cinematography (courtesy of Roger Deakins, and deserving of an Oscar) and a haunting score. You just can't take your eyes off of the screen, and you'll never want to check your watch, it's that good.

Simply Fantastic,"An excellent suspense thriller. On the edge of my seat from start to end. Totally taken by surprise by the amount of viewers who gave this film a poor review. Those types of viewers aren't able to simply enjoy a flick; instead they spend their entire time looking for problems in a movie - therefore their reviews need to be disregarded because the only type of movie that could ever convince them is one taken from a live cell phone for 2 hours of some real-time event like a city-held event such as a parade or something.There is a lot of ""red herrings"" during the middle part of the movie, but all of them have you wondering which one of them is ""the kidnapper"". This effectively removes any suspicion you might have about who the real perpetrator might be.Back to the movie - nail-biting, suspenseful and intense. Excellent acting. Great plot line. Jackman delivers an awesome performance, and his anger is portrayed very well. Jake is portrayed as a hero in the ending and you can't help but think ""humble hero"" in your mind when you see his performance at the end.If you're the type that's going to sit there for all 2.5 hours and just look for errors, then don't bother watching, and don't bother watching any other movie for that matter, because you're obviously incapable of enjoying any film. But if you can sit back and enjoy a good flick and allow yourself to engage into a world of storytelling, then this film will not let you down.

Good Movie With A Poor Last 30 Minutes.,"This movie is pretty good for the most part. The acting most of the time was amazing and the story got interesting at times. However the last thirty minutes were pretty poor in my book. Not enough to make this movie bad or anything, but still poor.The story was very good until the last thirty minutes (as mentioned before). The way the story unravelled around the disappearance of these two girls was great. I was sat there at times throughout mainly the first half thinking to myself if this person was really guilty and whether they will be found and if so alive? The story was good from the start but faltered at the last hurdle. The ending and the minutes before where pretty crappy in my opinion. Enough said or spoilers will start to fly.The cast were great at times and other times were simply ok. Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal were the stand out's in this movie. Hugh played the father really well at times i found myself liking the character as he had purpose for all his actions even if we disagree with some or think poorly of the choice. There was a scene or two i though his acting was simply ok however for the most part he was excellent and i was so very impressed. Jake played the detective very well. Not the greatest acting i have ever seen from an individual but still very good none the less. Even though i like Jake as an actor and have watched many a film with him in, i fully believed he was a detective in the scenes he featured. I though he was very believable and impressive at times. Nothing extraordinary, but enough to sell it all to me. Everyone in the cast were fine and i didn't really have a character i hated at all. But Jake & Hugh really stood out to me. Terrence Howard was my third favourite and the rest were all equal in performance. Good cast of characters if i do say so myself.The movie didn't have much (if any) action or CGI but it didn't need it at all. This movie benefited at times form more sombre moments, i do however wish there were more sombre moments.Story - 5.5/10Cast - 7/10Jake - 8/10Hugh - 8/10Overall, this movie was good but as i previously mentioned i believe the ending ruined it.

A grim slide into a very real type of hell,"(73%) Without too much doubt this is one of the better films of the year, with its fantastically solid direction, Oscar worthy performances, a great script/plot that keeps you guessing until the end, but my god is it a hard film to sit through at times. It really is the most bleak and joyless productions since 2009's ""The road"" and I have rarely ever seen anything as good and yet wanted it to be over quite as much as this trip into a very real (yet still a little Hollywood) hell. The roads this goes down are the stuff of actual nightmares, and when that is combined with the very grim, cold setting it makes for an increasingly oppressive feel.

Prisoners,"Slow burn thrillers are a dying breed. Most modern suspense films go in for gruesome and violent stories of murder to send chills down spines of the audience. A lot of this pictures offer mysteries that are not too difficult to decipher. So it is a great pleasure to discover that there filmmakers out there adventurous enough to craft a dark, intriguing dialogue driven motion picture that keeps the audience guessing for most its runtime. That director Denis Villeneuve does so with panache and some wonderfully orchestrated darkness is what elevates the material beyond escapist territory. The story is set in a Philadelphia suburb where two families the Dovers; Keller (Hugh Jackman) and Grace (Maria Bello) and the Birches, Franklin (Terence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis) are celebrating Thanksgiving together. The parents are enjoying themselves indoors while the two young girls decide to go out and play. After a certain amount of time, the parents realise that the two have not returned. After some frantic reconnoitering it is decided that the police need to be called in and the case is assigned to Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). A few preliminary investigations lead him to a suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but subsequent interrogations reveal that he lacks the intellect and the malevolence that is expected from one who has committed such a crime. He is eventually released much to the chagrin of Keller who is convinced that Jones is involved in the girls' disappearance. Filled with righteous indignation he decides that he will take matters into his own hands. While an engaging whodunit is all that is expected from a picture like this one, it is quite amazing to see how Prisoners not only aspires to be something more than just a by-the-numbers thriller. The original script by Aaron Guzikowski is an intelligent creation with some really astute observations about human nature. Difficult themes like anger, redemption, guilt, punishment and even religion find a home in this dark and at times depressing story. The film's rather chunky 153 minute runtime and the slow, deliberate pace which the story progresses gives the characters and their emotions a lot of breathing space. Though there were occasions when I found myself questioning the persistence of the director in allowing certain scenes to carry on even when their purpose in the narrative has been realised. To be fair these moments are few and far between which is why they tend to stick out. It is not possible to fully discuss the emotional weight of the story without divulging the specifics of the plot but suffice to say that the script is never guilty of feeding the audience any answers and the resolution is satisfying and I personally could not guess it beforehand. The excellent direction allows the story to be engaging at all times. The cautious building up of suspense, the natural dialogue, and the nuanced presentation are top notch and there are times when I could detect echoes of David Fincher's modern classic Zodiac (2007) that are only amplified by the involvement of Jake Gyllenhaal. That is not to say Prisoners takes cues visual cues from Zodiac. It is its own beast, but is in several ways a spiritual companion of that picture. Prisoners would not have been anywhere close to being as effective, if it wasn't for the stellar cinematography of Roger Deakins. Deakins has long been acknowledged as one of the leading exponents of his craft and here his lens work enriches (if not outright create) the creepy atmosphere that film exudes. The way the camera pans and zooms; it could be argued that Deakins' camera is a character in itself. The music in contrast comes across as merely adequate, but is never overbearing and does not take the viewer out of the moment. The emotional crux is purely dependent on the performances and in that department there is nary a complaint I can make. Five members of the main cast have Academy Award nominations and everyone plays their respective roles with great conviction. Jake Gyllenhaal has built up an impressive resume over the years and this movie adds another feather to his cap. His detective Loki is reserved yet determined and the actor brings the right amount of dedication to his role. Though, he does tend to overplay one conspicuous tick that the character displays. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the indignant, conflicted father who is willing to do whatever it takes to find his daughter is a highlight of the film. Long has the actor been under the shadow of his famous Superhero avatar. Liberated from formula he displays his talent with incredible force. Terence Howard, Viola Davis and Mario Bello do not have roles that are as hefty but they provide solid support. Paul Dano brings a lot vulnerability to Alex and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery make his mental defects seem believable. A quiet dialogue driven piece such as this one has the potential of falling into indulgence. But, prisoners never falls prey to that. There are times when the script slows down the proceedings but it is only to allow the audience a better view of the characters and their lives. Nevertheless, there is a significant of portion of the mainstream audience that may find this a little too dark and languid. But, for those who are patient enough to follow the director to the places he takes us in this picture the rewards are delectable, providing a cinematic experience that is rich, multi-layered and most of very memorable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The way it displays the different responses to grief etc will connect with any viewer and keeps you invested til the last second.It will leave you asking yourself: ""what lengths would I go to to bring my child home safe?""Watch this movie. It's hard to sit through at times, but you will be glad you finished it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Mind blown!!,"I was surffing for hugh jackman movies and i discover this and had good reviews and then viewed my boi Chris stuckmann review on youtube and he highly ratted this movie! So i watched without seeing trailer so i ahd no idea what to expect as i only read logline from IMDB which does not give much about story! It was fairly slow paced film and it can be negative for some people but for the story and direction director wanted to go for, i think its perfect, its 45 degree upward slope, So the thrill increase in constant lvl! I was moved by editing, cinematography, acting and direction, also the production was good! Really mind blowing film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A tough but worthwhile watch,"This movie feels so so different from the kinds of films Villeneuve makes these days - no epic scenery, no special effects. This is the opposite of Blade Runner 2049 or Dune in so many ways. And yet...you see the precursors. From the ways he frames certain shots to the ways he uses silence and ambient sound. The human moments shine through the rain and muck here just like they shine through the spaceships and cityscapes in his other movies. This story is a dark and disturbing puzzle that's too easy to solve and too tough to watch at points, but it's also a gifted cast being directed by a gifted director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
