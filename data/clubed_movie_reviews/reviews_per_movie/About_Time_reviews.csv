"If you think this is only a love story about a boy and a girl, you're wrong","I'm older now but this movie still gets me. It's a wonderful love story about boy meets girl but the real story is the love between dad and son. Superbly acted by all involved and with a stellar soundtrack, you can watch it ten times and be touched by the story every time. I can't recommend it enough for those days when real life is so negative.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet film with surprising depth and heart","From the director of 'Love Actually', who is also the writer of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'Bean', 'Notting Hill' and the 'Bridget Jones' films, it sure raises some expectations for this particular fantasy romantic comedy drama film about time travel.Although it shares some similarities with 'The Time Traveler's Wife' (the same female lead actress, Rachel McAdams) and 'Groundhog Day', but rest assured, 'About Time' is a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet film with surprising depth and heart. The script was well written, the direction was great and the casts made a decent performance in their respective roles.The film done a fine job in balancing the comedic and dramatic elements of the story, providing enough laughter and allowing it to flow smoothly without feeling too overly long despite its 2 hours running time.Despite the time-traveling plot device, the story focuses on the father-son relationship of Tim and his dad and the lovely romantic relationship between Tim and Mary, without being too sappy, too overly lovey-dovey or too sentimental. The message or overall theme of the film about appreciating life as if it was your last was subtle and not too forceful or preachy.The selection of songs for the film was appropriate and not too overly done for the emotional scenes.The on-screen chemistry between Rachel and Domhnall are convincing enough for the audience to watch them going through life together. On the other hand, Domhnall and Bill, as father and son, their connection is felt throughout the film and certainly evoke some poignant memories when watching them together.It's one of the best romantic comedies this year had to offer, better than the disappointing 'Time Traveler's Wife'. It's a great date movie that's not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Charming.,"Really surprised by this one;was expecting the run of the mill rom-com, but it is so much more than that; it's about family and the smiles and cries of life. The whole film was filled with charm, wit and had its fair share of heartfelt moments. Time travel is a subject that has been visited many times in the film industry, but this had its own unique touch to it.The film flows really nicely, it oozes class at some points. And the mere thought of having the ability to travel back in time sends your mind into a whirlwind of what-ifs? The acting is superb by all, but Bill Nighy was my favourite as Tim's Dad. When on screen with Domhnall Gleeson (Tim), the connection is very convincing and it was those scenes that i enjoyed the most.A very good film and worthy of a viewing by any standards7.25/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Happiness,"So, I don't like romance movies. And it's not because I don't like love stories, it's because I think most romance movies are kinda shallow. Love is a great thing, but, usually, a regular love story, isn't enough for me to enjoy a movie.I've watched this movie, like, a dozen times. It isn't about the love story nor the time travel stuff. It's because of the small things. This movie makes me cry of happiness. It is AMAZING how it makes me think about the people I care about, the people that cares about me, the small happy moments in my life and many other things that, when I notice, are making a tear come down into my cheek.This movie changed me. And it keeps changing me every time I rewatch it. It made me notice that life is amazing, even in it's simpliest moments. It showed me how I should enjoy everyday as if it was my final. It made me a happier person. And for that, this movie is my number one.Hope you enjoy it too.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This isn't just a love story, it's a life story.","Every now and then, a film comes along that changes the way I think about life. About Time is that kind of movie.

The story is uplifting, the acting is excellent and the humor is plentiful. This movie made me want to be a better person, and I'm very glad I saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"First of all, I hate this movie...","I hate this movie.Why might you ask have I rated it 10/10 then? Because it is possibly the most completely wonderful story I have ever watched.I'm getting on now, I'm a guy in my late 30's who is into action and violence and explosions and big robots smashing things and never before have I seen a movie which moved me to tears.There were elements which reminded me of silly things which I have done in the past and wished I could have done over, moments I wish I could relive and times I wish I could get - even writing this makes me want to cry! Damn you Richard Curtis, you've made me into a sissy with your perfect casting in this bloody beautiful, touching movie!!!I don't usually do sentimentality but this isn't the reason I hate this movie...

The reason you go to the movies,"Why do you go to the cinema? For me, it is to be moved. To laugh, to cry, to be frightened, to be in awe, to be amused in a gentle way. This movie did this to me in all 5 ways. I am Mr. Ordinary - I have been lucky enough to be born into a loving family, I have wooed a certain number of women, I have married and enjoyed the highs and lows of having my own family, I have lost my parents. I try in my own way to appreciate others and acknowledge that they are trying to make their way in life. This movie defines me. If you miss it this time, don't worry. You'll catch it later. Most people interested in cinema will see it at some stage. My advice is to go and see it now. It's not perfect - it's a bit English, a bit middle class, the story is preposterous. But the sentiment, the message hits the spot. Take one of your significant others. Take a first date. Take a box of tissues. It's the reason you go to the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I love it !,"I am not a fan of romance movies. From childhood, I was fascinated by the idea/ posibility/ opportunity of time travel. But this splenid film is more about time travels and love. It is a gorgeous film about family. And it has the best actors ever. It is a film so useful than its seeds grows up , for long time, in the viewer memories and new attitude about life and the others. And that makes it just a great film. For humor, tension, honesty, for the relation father - son, touching in profound senses, for the lovely relation brother - sister, for admirable portrait of small aspects of the every day existence, for dialogues and, sure, for something nameless because you only feel.

Simple yet effective,"One thing you have to do, if you decide watching this: Do not care about inconsistencies. Or trying to make sense of it. There is more wrong with the internal logic that you will be able to stomach (if you go down that road). Of course the actors are able to distract you most of the time (really nice work done there), but there will be times where you're just going to go: Really?Again, try to suppress that urge and dive into the sweetness of this movie. And the fun you can have with it too. It's a romantic comedy with a ""twist"" (if you want to call it that). But time travel issues have brought down other movies too. It never can be completely on the level. So cherish the notion of the fun and hop along for the ride",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Extraordinary movie.,"What an amazing movie. When I see the cast and the title, I immediately thought of a romantic clich√©, with full of known plot twists, and et cetera.

I was immediately captured, and the cast is so brilliant, I believed every single line. Thank you for this film, I am still under the influence of this movie. It is about life, in the most raw way.

It defines what's important in life, the comings and goings, the way time moves, the inspiration you feel from those you love and those you lost. All the acting is amazing and from a thousand miles you could tell it was Richard Curtis and the combination of some of his best work. If you're single, watch it, if you're married you'll love it and if you have children then don't miss it. It will define you, whoever you are. It left me a wreck, but a very happy one.

One of the best films I've seen,"I loved this film. I perfect balance of story, humour and sincerity along with excellent acting and a wonderful cast. Even the soundtrack was superb. Not your average time travel movie. Very thought provoking and one which tugged at the old tear ducts in the best way. Some reviews complain about how it is like this or that film. No film is unique, and for sure there are similarities with other Richard Curtis films, but that is all. Plus to be compared to other great films is surely an honour. Forget about all that and enjoy what is a great film which will inspire you in ways you were not expecting. Thoroughly enjoyable and I'm already looking forward to going to see it again. That doesn't happen very often.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
an unexpected delight,"A young man, like many others. Only he can travel in time. This main element of the plot, is something that was difficult to digest throughout the film, since it was not a predominantly sci-fi movie. This struggle was compensated by the successful interjection that even with such ability, life can have difficulties.The main character, did use this to his advantage to win the love of the girl he was so fond of but still he often faced difficult choices as to let things happen or turn the time back to prevent them.One thing that makes this stand out is the somewhat philosophical approach, an approach that is conveyed with simplicity so all can relate.Overall, it is an intelligent film, with emotion and poignancy.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable despite flaws,"Pleasant romantic comedy about a young man (Domhnall Gleeson) who is told by his father (Bill Nighy) on his 21st birthday that all the men in his family possess the ability to travel back in time. He proceeds to use this new gift repeatedly to help him fix mistakes in his life and to help him with his relationship with a pretty girl (Rachel McAdams). As a romantic comedy with some tearjerker moments, it's very enjoyable and nice. As science fiction, it will give you headaches with all the plot holes. So the more unforgiving sci-fi fans out there might want to skip this one. I didn't mind it much at first but it got more complicated as it went along. The plot itself is reminiscent of Groundhog Day and maybe a little bit of Somewhere in Time. Gleeson and McAdams both do very well and have great chemistry. McAdams is especially likable. Gleeson has an appealing ""young Hugh Grant"" quality about him. Bill Nighy steals the show from everybody, as is often the case. It's a good movie if you don't think too hard about it. But I must stress if you are someone who is a stickler for flaws in plots or someone who nitpicks time travel stories, you will really hate this. Everybody who doesn't fit that description should definitely check it out.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How can people slate this movie???,"I just don't understand how people are not liking this film. It is just perfect!!! Any Richard Curtis movie I rate against Love actually, because to me that is his best film and one of my all time favourites! But About Time for me beats love actually hands down. The film is so well thought out and the cast is just so good! I have seen this movie twice already as it was such a great story. The main focus of the film is about love and family so don't be too worried about the travelling in time, it fits into the film so well and makes some great comic moments when things go wrong. Don't listen to the haters, this really is a fabulous movie! It is a sad thought though that this could be Richard's last film he is going to direct, I hope not, but if it is, what a way to end his brilliant films!Well done Richard Curtis! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Thought-provoking feel-good fun,"An ordinary 21 year old man is shocked to discover that he has the ability to travel through time, a concept which, granted, is not new to the world of cinema. Although this unusual ability is naturally the main theme of the film, the plot still engages the viewer with the struggles of every day life including marriage, finding a job, having children as well as a few family issues to keep the plot fresh. The intriguing plot complements the few time-travelling excursions and keeps the idea crisp.The plot is thought provoking and the script is kept light, with several laugh-out-loud moments which can be all-too rare in this genre.Domhnall Gleeson gives an extremely high quality performance in his lead role and is supported well by the highly experienced rom-com lead Rachel McAdams and an ever-amusing Bill Nighy, who provides much of the comic relief in the film.The plot could perhaps be accused of moving slowly at times; however this only serves to heighten the drama of the intriguing plot twists.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow. Wow. Wow.,"I don't know how we missed this movie, but my husband found it on HBO, and we watched it because we had an open night. First of all, I had no idea it was a Richard Curtis film. I'm such a huge fan of his. I love how he blends comedy, drama, romance, and a really deep philosophical message about life.And second, I actually think this is my most favorite of his films. The film had me from the opening shot. And I remember thinking as I'm watching the first few minutes, that this is some of the best writing I've ever heard. And the performance by Domhall Gleeson is star-turning. I'm so used to seeing him as a villain in ""Star Wars"" that he completely caught me off guard with his endearing, honest portrayal.I could go on-and-on. Great story. Great end message. Great acting. Great music. Great film.I wish I could go back in time and see it for the first time again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not the best of Curtis but a very likable addition to his collection of rom-coms,"Over the years, British writer Richard Curtis has scripted some wonderful romantic comedies: ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", and ""Love Actually"". So, by now, we know the features of Curtisworld: locations in London, upper middle-class English types, lots of friendship and love, plenty of wry and sometimes rude humour, a socially inhibited boy, an attractive North American girl, a doddery elderly male relative, a freaky young female relative, probably a wedding, probably a funeral, obviously some heavy rain, well-chosen songs, and finally a clever film title. ""About Time, which Curtis has both written and directed, delivers all the familiar ingredients and is a charming addition to the canon but, while I really liked it, it was not love actually.This time, we have two love stories and a time travel device that enables both to achieve special fulfilment. There is the father-son relationship between Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson and the sexual relationship between Glesson and (Canadian) Rachel McAdmas (coincidentally ""The Time Traveler's Wife""). Both the technique of time travel (clenching hands in a darkened space) and the rules (forget the 'Butterfly Effect') are rather ridiculous, but the device serves to pose some almost philosophical questions: If you could travel back in time to change things in your life, how often would you do it and what would you change? In the end, is it a power that you would use to change the facts of the past or your perception of the present?",,Anonymous,Fantasy
I felt manipulated...,"This isn't the first occasion I've seen About Time, indeed I caught it back at the cinema and was won over by it, its sweet charm and English whimsy.But this time... I don't know, came away feeling like I'd been manipulated emotionally by it. I was ready to be enchanted all over again by a feel good movie, but instead I found myself not liking the main character, Tim, very much at all, compensating for his life mistakes by erasing them and having another go. No one gets this. We all mess up from time to time, and it's the learning from those moments that defines us. But not Tim. He just gets to do it all over again, right this time, or perhaps not as his wooing of Rachel McAdam's character came across as more than a little creepy. I get that we're supposed to think it's okay, essentially innocent, his quoting back lines to her about Kate Moss in an attempt to worm his way into her affections. Oh look, it's that nice, slightly awkward yet wholesome English lad; isn't that lovely? Well no, not really, and I found myself remembering Elijah Wood using bits of Kate Winslet's stolen memories in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as a less honourable attempt at courtship (which, appropriately, she sees right through).If you don't buy into all that, which I didn't on this occasion, then the rest comes crashing down. The supporting characters are nearly all so one-dimensional that you can sum them up in a single word - sister Kit Kat (scatty), Rory (embarrassing), Harry (rude), etc. Again, nobody in reality is like this, but that level of complexity doesn't fit in with the film so the characters are defined by their single-word stereotypes.I still have feeling for it, though, entirely because of the Bill Nighy character, Tim's dad. As with the rest of About Time, father's aren't as perfect as he is (I know; I am one), but the sweet natured relationship between Tim and his dad (he's even credited on the cast list as 'Dad') just about saves it. Still a pleasant surprise to have this element in the film, and it gets to me every time.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Soul Food,"Another reviewer wrote a wonderful review about this film but classified this movie as a dessert, I would respectfully disagree. I may have been in just the right frame of mind or seen it on the right day but to me this movie was exactly what I needed, and it is indeed soul food. I don't really feel the need to describe the plot the trailer does that well enough and the fact that I think it is a good move can be seen in my rating.Instead I'll get a bit personal here but that's how much this movie affected me. I just finished the day looking at apartments and different parts of a city with my parents (I'm moving here in the fall for college), and I'll be honest it was a rough long day but then in our hotel room watching this movie the day completely changed as clich√©d as that may seem.This movie touched me to in a way very few movies ever have and few ever will. We all have those special movies that taught us how to be a better person or made use realize something about ourselves we never saw before. About Time is one of my movies I hope it is also one of yours because those movies are why I believe film exists. Beyond the ability to entertain, they share with us a part of what it is to be human. May you find that bit of transcendence in this film and if not may you find it somewhere else because we all need it from time to time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Both comic and dramatic,"Richard Curtis is known as one of the greats of British comedy and rom-coms, creating characters like Blackadder and Mr Bean and writing and directing Love Actually. Curtis has announced he is planning retire from directing and he takes a more serious turn with his 'last' film, About Time.Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) is a 21-year-old Cornish man who is unlucky in love and lives his dad (Bill Nighy), Mom (Lindsay Duncan), kooky sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) and Uncle Desmond (Richard Cordery), the least intelligent man you will ever meet. After a disastrous New Year's Eve party Tim's father tells his son all the male in the family can travel back in time, all they need to do is go into a dark spot, concentrate and then they can go back to any point of his life. When Tim finds out about his powers he moves to London to start his career as a barrister and find a girlfriend. He finds his soul-mate in the form of Mary (Rachel McAdams) and he does everything he can to win her over.Despite About Time's billing as a romantic-comedy it's really a drama that has some comedy in it. The comedy for the most part is gentle in nature, revolving about some witty line, awkward moments and character interactions. Gleeson does let out his inner Hugh Grant, as he's awkward and easily flustered before being able to go back in time to rewrite his mistakes. Much of the humour comes from the time traveling antics that Gleeson.About Time does have a fine cast supporting cast, but they're used to various success. Tom Hollander was the best as a highly aggressive, easily angered playwright who was the most fouled mouth of all the characters. Nighy is his professional self, as a more restrained character, while still having some decent lines. But Wilson's character can easily be defined as kooky or quirky and the character of Uncle Desmond is a one joke character that he is not particularly smart and he could have been cut out of the film.At times About Time did seem like it was going to have a theme about fate and destiny and that some actions are pre-determined, no matter what is altered. A case in point is when Tim keeps meeting with his old crash played Margot Robbie. But all of that is undercut, particularly when Tim can manipulate events and when he is having to court Mary over and over again, coming across as the time-traveling stalker.Curtis has had a great career as a writer but as a director, he sometimes lacks restraint with About Time, a film that ends up being too long and overly sentimental. Curtis wanted to emotionally manipulate the audience into his way of thinking as he lays on his message of living life to the full, particularly in the final act.About Time does struggle to find a narrative as it starts out to be rom-com with a sci-fi twist, before turning into a romance and finally being a story about Tim with his dad. There are twist and subplots on the way, with some clever concepts and unique looks on time travel: but a good 20 to 30 minutes could have been cut as the end just drags and drags.About Time is a solid effort from Curtis as it has a top cast with Gleeson and McAdams having strong chemistry together, which is what we want and expect from a romantic film. The film does offer some laughs and a tranquil piano heavy score from Nick Laird-Clowes with some decent pop music in the soundtrack. But this is a film that is just too long and where many of the ideas could have effectively been done in a few short films.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
ABSOLUTE BRILLIANT AND EMOTIONAL RIDE,"I lost my father in 2016, so this movie was an emotional ride for me. I soundtrack is brilliant, cast is was amazing. Whole throughout the movie I wished this was me and clenched my fists a few times too.

About Time for These Kind of Rom-Com's!,"Normally, I'd be quite hesitant to seeing a rom-com, but as any open- minded individual, the concept and charm granted the film potential based on the promotions and instantly intrigued me. About Time revolves around a socially awkward character, Tim, who discovers an incredibly useful and all-the-more manipulative secret that runs on the male side of his family. A father essentially entrusts his son with this valuable power that allows him to travel back into his past, which means the next time Tim ruins a relationship or mistakenly goes for a kiss only to be humiliated thereafter, it's right to the nearest closet or compact room to fix the issue and reverse his horrible decisions.Moreover, the film happened to surprise me in that it carried much more heart and depth than your standard romantic comedy, and it rather flourishes in its style of authenticity. Progressively, we're either met with extremely relatable or wholly plausible situations that induce laughter or provoke various emotions deep inside that tough personality of yours (speaking from a male's perspective). Its strongly apparent sense of genuineness emphasizes the likability of the characters with Bill Nighy being a clear favorite, retaining that charisma and lovability that all have already come to associate him with. Domhnall Gleeson undeniably delivers a terrific performance, suffused by numerous subtle facial expressions, gestures, and stuttered speech that effectively composes his insecure nature.Furthermore, even though the final message of the film could be deemed cheesy, it's totally executed in a convincing manner in part by- again- its sincere essence. By the time the feature has wrapped up, the audience will be in tears. During its development, they'll be infatuated by its subject matter. In such fashion, About Time is remarkably capable of taking you on a wavy journey that consists of sadness at times and pure excitement or comedy in others. A wide variety of people will be sighted throughout its span, some veritably abhorrent and others utterly sympathetic, and it's this distinctiveness that comprises a realistic picture- something that's absolutely necessitated in a movie that deals with the kind of themes prevalent here.With that being said, the flick's length certainly becomes problematic as it nears the conclusion; its last thirty minutes or so noticeably drag out, and we encounter an unexpected scene after another. Just when we believe that we're witnessing the last point for its thematic material, we shift to a fresh setting and an additional quandary. Actually, it reminds me of Return of the King's last act which seems to present us with multiple extra scenes following several lengthy black screens. When the picture eventually finishes at the mark it sought to, it feels as if the whole matter could've been wrapped up in a more concise method without dozens of further complications as a means of elucidation.In sum, the idea of time travel is adeptly utilized in addition to the countless laughs to be had and the highly entertaining plot overall. About Time is undoubtedly one of the best rom-com's in recent years, and I hope to see more of this kind from Hollywood instead of the artificial half-assed stories, infested with detestable and debauched characters, they produce nowadays.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Charming, funny and poignant romantic time travelling comedy drama. A top date movie.","I attended a preview screening of this in London.If you enjoy previous Richard Curtis (writer, director) films such as Four Weddings and a funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually then you will very likely enjoy this sweet time travel comedy drama albeit with an ironic sense of time travel feeling of been having been here before.But that more of the same feeling is no bad thing, thanks largely to the wonderful performances of the cast and more importantly, the exquisite execution of its new spin, the time travelling plot device. In fact, the time travelling here is really good fun and plentiful as its employed with typical motives but with inventiveness by our main protagonist, a stereotypical ""loser"" played with utter charm and goofiness by Domhall Gleeson. His use of the power is at times hilarious but very useful without your typical ""changing your past will backfire"" moral message. In most time travel movies, changing events in the past is usually painted as a negative repercussion but here, for the most part, the movie is certainly promoting its benefits.The time travel premise have some set rules that nicely serves the narrative, although if you think too carefully in some scenes, you might find some minute flaws in the execution of the cause and effects which could have been made neater if extra attention was paid.There is a moral message but you have to wait until the end to get what it is because it isn't so obvious as the film rolls. You might suspect things will happen in some ways as you watch the film but they don't and you might wonder, what's the story then but let it roll and the point of it all comes at the end.However, that waiting for the end leads to my first little bit of criticism. This film clocks in at just over 2hours and it did feel a tad too long. There are quite a few points in the film which I feel could have been trimmed. I think it could have been about at least 10 minutes shorter.There are familiar stalwart faces from Richard Curtis's previous films making guest appearances with the always awesome Bill Nighy justifiably anchoring a supporting role with his usual high calibre presence. Its also nice to see one of our great British character actors who had recently passed away make a surprise and funny bit part appearance perhaps for the last time...or did the film makers travel back in time to shoot his part? Rachel McAdams is very lovely as the love interest and is believable as a girl worth manipulating time for.I'm not a great fan of Richard Curtis previous movies but this film swims along with so much charm, English middle class idiosyncrasies, a lovely romance and a gentle pacing that flows with a steady beat from beginning to end. This is not a riotous comedy, its not a thriller, nor an adventure or even a film that draws any suspense towards the last act. Its a journey through a period of our time traveller's life, sometimes funny, charming, poignant with a very clever and enjoyable time travelling premise.Its certainly a great date movie too.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The best time traveling rom-com,"When Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) turns 21, his father (Bill Nighy) tells him that men in his family can travel through time. His sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) brings Charlotte (Margot Robbie) to stay for the summer. His power is unable to make the beautiful Charlotte fall for him. He moves to London and stays with bitter playwright Harry (Tom Hollander). He has a wonderful night with the magical Mary (Rachel McAdams). However Harry had a horrible opening night for his play. He goes back in time to fix it but his magical night with Mary disappears. He uses his power but also finds some limitations.Richard Curtis creates the one of the best time traveling rom-com. Gleeson is likable and adorkable. McAdams is magically adorable. She is dating down a bit but the two has good chemistry nevertheless. The time traveling could have gone horribly wrong. The first steps help alleviate a good deal of it. My biggest fear for this movie is that Tim would use his powers to keep changing history to force Mary to fall for him. The fact that he couldn't get Charlotte helps and that Mary falls for him without his powers is also very important. It culminates in one of the more profound ways to use time travel.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not just a romcom.,"The initial 1:30 hrs was a pretty solid romantic comedy with a tinge of fantasy. If the movie had aimed for nothing more, it would still have been a decent addition to Curtis' filmography. A solid 6.5-7/10. But it is the last half an hour when the movie does indeed follow a different tread than typical romcoms and, at least for me personally, succeeded spectacularly. May be I am projecting my own emotions on those scenes (which beautifully depict a father-son relationship) for them to have the effect, but I do not consider that to be a flaw. Rather, it takes the sublime touch of a great artist to get people to do that, without the attempt seeming too on the nose or sappy.I think Curtis proves that he is one of those rare few who can achieve it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Butterfly Effect of Love,"In Cornwall, the clumsy Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) lives a pleasant life with his family but he is awkward with the girls and unlucky in love. At the age of twenty one, his father (Bill Nighy) discloses a family secret to him, telling that the men in his family have the ability to travel in time. The skeptic Tim finds that his father is telling the truth and when he moves to London to work as a lawyer, he falls in love with the insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams) and seduces her fixing his mistakes in the relationship. Along his life, Tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors, but also in the lives of his relatives and friends.""About Time"" is an overrated movie about a clumsy guy that discovers that he has the ability of traveling in time and uses his skill to fix mistakes in life. The plot is a sort of ""Butterfly Effect"" of love, but is repetitive and tiresome. The lovely Margot Robbie and the smile of Rachel McAdams save this movie from a fiasco since Domhnall Gleeson is too dull for a lead role. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Quest√£o de Tempo"" (""Matter of Time"")",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A light and forgettable film.,"There are a number of times while watching this film when I wondered what the point was. When it was finally spelled out to me, then I realized we've reached the end of the film. I find the best films have subtext that isn't spelled out to us or aimed to hit us on the head like a hammer. I find that the latter as a heavy-handed way of portraying a message or emotion, and that's what the powers that be decided this film to be, which is a shame.That's not to say that the acting was awful. I believe the acting was, in a lot of scenes, heartfelt and sincere. That likely has more to do with their strength as actors than the actual script, however, which I thought was rather weak. Bill Nighy channels his Billy Mack character from ""Love, Actually"" (by the same director), this time as a father figure. Not much of a stretch for his considerable acting chops, but he manages to sell it nonetheless.The whole affair is light and breezy. Not particularly memorable, which brings me back to my original point about the message being sledgehammered to the head. Perhaps the filmmakers thought that the film-goer would feel the same way I do, and decided to force the message in order to provide some sort of moral that is supposed to bring all this forgetful affair together and therefore make it memorable. The message itself, while commendable, is fairly underwhelming.I had a somewhat pleasant experience watching this film, don't get me wrong. However, I have no desire to see this film again, and I'm glad I didn't pay full price to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The hypocrtical speech at the end ruins a good movie,"This movie ruins itself in the last new minutes. I don't think it's a spoiler to say this movie is about a guy that can time travel. Even in the trailer we see him using it to pick up the girl of is dreams. Every time he makes a mistake with her he resets time to fix the mistake until it's the perfect date (this is shown in the trailer). In other words he has a power many of us wish we could have as well. But, in the last 2-3 minutes he gives a speech to the audience that he no longer time travels and just enjoys each moment as it comes. We're supposed to feel ""awe, wisdom"". Except he got to this nice situation he's in with the wife of his dreams precisely because he had these powers. If he didn't have them he'd not be in his idillic marriage we see him in as he gives this speech. That is such a spit in the face right at the end that hey, I used my powers to get my perfect relationship but you should just be happy with what you have. That's like a rich person telling a poor person money isn't everything. Sure, it's not, but if you're rich telling a poor person she doesn't need money try going without. In the end we get a rage inducing lecture from a person of privilege telling us to ignore the privilege.To be more concrete. Hr loses the girl because he makes a choice to help a friend. He then uses his special ability to get her back. For the rest of us we would not get that chance to fix our mistakes. That's all fine and without the speech at the end it would have been just a great movie about a guy with special talents and the ways he uses them. But, instead at the end he punches us in the face where he effectively says ""live with your mistakes even though I'm living a life only possible because I had the ability to fix mine""",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
one of the loveliest films I have ever seen,"""About Time"" from 2013 is a beautiful story, beautifully told.A young man, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) learns from his father that he can travel in time; it's a gift shared by all the men in the family and kept secret from anyone else. All he has to do is find a dark place, clench his fists, and decide what he wants to relive.He can't alter history, but he can redo certain incidents so he does better. The one thing he wants is a girlfriend. Moving from Cornwall to London to work as an attorney, he meets the pretty, sweet Mary (Rachel McAdams) and, after a do-over, develops a relationship with her, and they begin to build a life together.Though his gift comes in handy, saving his playwright friend from an opening night horror, his wedding from awful best man speeches, and helping his sister (this took a couple of time hops), Tim finds that his gift can't keep him from life's inevitable sorrows.I'm tempted to say this was a lovely movie where nothing happens, except that life happens, in all its happiness, and poignancy and bittersweet moments. It's the kind of movie that can make a man cry, the emotions are so real.I've never been a huge fan of Bill Nighy's, who plays Tim's father - I have seen in dozens of films. He is wonderful here, as a funny, loving father. Lindsay Duncan, a fantastic actress -- I saw her on Broadway in ""Private Lives,"" is great as Tim's mother.Rachel McAdams always reminds of Jennifer Garner, which is a compliment to Garner since she's a bit older. McAdams has a sweet, gentle presence, and she's delightful in this film.Then we get to the lead, Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a somewhat gawky young man who projects warmth and humor that really carries this film.The rest of the cast is top-notch: Lydia Wilson, Richard Cordery, Joshua McGuire, and Tom Hollander.A magical film about life's journey, whether you can time travel or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

unrealistically boring and absurd,"forget about the time travel, to future or backward, let's get down to something more reasonable: this family is not a millionaire's family. father is a bookworm, mother a typical house wife, son a lamer, daughter a mindless crazy spoiled brat, so how come they could live without any earthly worries, financial wise or money wise? how come they could live in a bubble-like cocoon, live so pretentiously that even the richest people on the earth couldn't live? their life styles, oh, a regular daily activities, sitting or lying on the beach, drinking or daydreaming, sun bath, watching movies outside rain or shine? dining at table, eating and drinking with their obvious stupid and dumb uncle? then the not-quite-like-a-rich-man father told his son one day that all the men in the family got a mysterious gift of time traveling power? they could travel back in time to fix some things they didn't quite like but in general, they could not change the matters, the history, in a larger manner, say, like making Adolf Hitler never born or two world wars never happen? yeah, right, if the screenplay endowed these time-travel-capable lamers with such huge human responsibilities, guess how much budgets they got to spend for the war scenes? so, easily, this lamer son decided to just change his romance experiences. givemeabreak, will you? this is such a stupid and one of the worst movies about time traveling crap. none of the characters in this brain-dead film was convincingly likable because it just built on a ridiculous budget-cut storyline. love or no love for this young lamer's romantic adventures is no compare with 'love actually' and those heart warming or heart aching time travel romances. folks, let's go down to earth to watch some more realistic and reasoning acceptable common romances, such as 'enough talk (2013)', okay? 'cause you don't have to travel in time to get it, or got to watch the film in your backyard garden at night, or in order to give you some more romantic feeling, using rain-making machine to shower you. give it a rest, guys who gave high praises to this stupid British movie, dressed up in a costume to mimic 'love actually'.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Richard Curtis continues to push the boundaries of sentimentality,"""We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.""If there is someone who can get away with being too schmaltzy, generic, charming and sentimental it's Richard Curtis. It comes as no surprise here considering he's directed Love Actually, and wrote such rom-coms as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Notting Hill among others. He has a tendency of melting even the toughest hearts and no matter how prepared you think you are for his next film somehow he gets you again. Perhaps About Time is his most sentimental film and that could turn some people off, but I must say this isn't your typical romantic comedy. Half way through the film it turns into a completely different movie becoming one about family dynamics and enjoying the ordinary moments in life. Perhaps the reason why Curtis gets away with being so charming is that he creates a perfect balance in his stories and introduces comedic relief at the right moments. About Time is a flawed film, but you can probably say this about all his films. The thing a lot of people might have a problem with specifically in this one is the time traveling element which many may find a bit absurd, but it worked for me (at least it was much better than the other time traveling movie that Rachel McAdams starred in) and I think Curtis uses this element as a sort of parable to remind us of the importance of savoring each day. It may feel like a sermon at times, but it's one I don't mind being reminded of. Carpe Diem!Tim (Domhnall Gleeson who you may recognize as Bill Weasley in the last two Harry Potter films) is a shy kid living with his parents (Bill Nighy and Lindsay Duncan) and lovable sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson). The morning of his 21st birthday his father shares with him a family secret: the men in their family can travel in time, but they can only do so to moments they personally have experienced. Tim decides to use this special ability to find love, because he really needs all the help he can get for it. Tim leaves his parents beautiful beachside estate in Cornwall for London in order to become a lawyer. He moves in with one of his father's friends, Harry (Tom Hollander), who's a struggling writer with a bad temper. In London Tim meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and the two fall for each other, but due to a time traveling incident that night is erased from Mary's memory and Tim has to find another way to win her back.I feared this film would become another sort of 50 First Dates, but surprisingly it took an unexpected turn halfway through the film and becomes something else. It is not just a romantic comedy, it becomes a movie about family, love, and life where Tim learns a couple of valuable lessons along the way. McAdams and Gleeson shared great chemistry on screen, but the true standouts in this film were the supporting characters, especially Tim's father played by the wonderful Bill Nighy. He is great here once again, while Wilson, Duncan, and Hollander all are extremely funny and used for comedic relief. It's a relief from the schmaltzy sentimentality of the film. It's as if Curtis is admitting he's manipulated us way too much with all the emotional sentimentality and now it's time for a good laugh. If you don't find this film funny then you will probably find it way over the top with the sentimentality. It's not a film for everyone, but I had a good time and was charmed by the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A very enjoyable tale of life and love,"Sometimes a flawed and somewhat predictable movie can be enjoyed by the watcher due to its charm and inoffensive manner, Richard Curtis's time traveling love story About Time is one of those films, a film that provides enough laughs and heartfelt moments that only Scrooge himself could not find enjoyment in this tale.Brendan Gleeson's very own Domhnall Gleeson gets his first big leading role here as our lovable ginger time traveling lawyer Tim and he does a fine job at being a lovable red haired version of Hugh Grant. Gleeson's chemistry with season rom-com veteran Rachel McAdams is made believable also with her slightly underused talents coming to the fore in most of their scenes and the eventual on screen romance plays out in a believable manner despite all the time traveling business occurring throughout. While this love story is a major part of About Time, Curtis has also positioned the film to be more than a man meets girl tale with a twist, and with this choice has made a film all the better for it.Playing Tim's Dad is veteran British actor Bill Nighy, who with Gleeson gives the film another side that usual rom-coms would be hard pressed to have. It's within this relationship between time traveling father and son that the movie finds many relatable and confronting issues to deal with and by films end the audience's emotional investment has been well and truly earned thanks to it. In concerns to Curtis as a director, it's also a departure for the man who has not shown this side of himself as a director before but that's not to say the film lacks a few well-earned laughs and Curtis usual array of colorful supporting characters, which is evidenced in Tom Hollander's playwright Harry.Coming in at roughly 2 hours About Time covers a lot of ground and in doing so it would be fair to say that the films first half pales in comparison to its much more concise and impactful second half, but as a whole it all comes together in such a way that it's hard to fully criticize. Watched with the right mindset About Time is the perfect movie for a night in and stepping stone for lead Gleeson to find his feet in the world of big budget tent pole movies.3 and a half clenched fists out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The absolute worst.,"As a man in my early twenties, RomComs are my guilty pleasure. I like them, I really do. And I've watched really bad ones and still liked them. Whether it was for their relatable characters or their main cast, there's almost always something positive I can ""cling"" to, even in the bad RomComs. But this one was too much. While the gist of the story would theoretically make for a good movie, gigantic plot holes, illogical use of the main character's time traveling ability and the incredibly dumb (that painfully, cringe inducing kinda dumb, not the cute kinda dumb) behavior of the main character make this unwatchable for me.

Sweet,"""About Time"" takes a charming leap through time with a 6/10 rating from me, and I must say I liked it. The acting, especially by Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams, infuses the film with genuine warmth and chemistry. The film editing keeps the time-travel narrative engaging, although its strength in exploring the value of moments in life occasionally feels weighed down by predictability. The music adds a whimsical touch, while the cinematography captures the picturesque landscapes of Cornwall.

Despite this, it remains a heartwarming journey that reminds us to cherish the beauty of life's fleeting moments.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The most touching movie,"'About Time' (2013) is a romantic movie directed by Richard Curtis, who made several famous romantic-comedy movies such as 'Love Actually' in 2003 and 'Notting Hill' in 1999. He also won several awards like 'Christopher Award'. This movie is a romantic comedy, but it is touching and instructive, which is quite different to Richard Curtis's other movies. The plot is tidy and neat, and the soundtrack was really harmonious with the film.The main character, Tim, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is a normal man born in the countryside of England. When he turns 20, his father (Bill Nighy) tells Tim that his family has the ability to travel through time. However his family had faced difficulty due to this ability because they used it to get fame or money, so he decides to use this ability for love. Therefore, he uses this ability to meet Mary (Rachel McAdams), who will be his wife. They get married and enjoy their life. However, some things go badly so Tim goes back to fix them, but when he tries to save one important thing, he realizes he loses another important one. He should make a choice one and abandon the precious things in life.This movie is really well-made because it teaches us a lot of lessons and makes us think about the important things in our life. There are no special effects or sets but it makes the movie more realistic. The most outstanding aspect of the film is the wedding of Tim and Mary. In this scene, the camera catches the beautiful scene in the wedding. The couple looks so happy that audience will admire that wedding and the wedding scene also makes us happy. What's more in this scene, the soundtrack makes the atmosphere better. The plot starts with love but it expands to the meaning of life. This skillful movie will make you feel the love of family, farewell form family, and happiness.'About Time' is the last movie of Richard Curtis who was a master of romantic comedy movies. This movie uses time traveling, so you may know this movie emphasizes the importance of time like other plain movies, but I think there is no other movie as touching and memorable. We know we will die in the future and this movie awake us about the value of our life and time. I recommend you to watch this movie for lessons that cannot be learned easily.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Rom com with charm, visual splendour and various flaws","Richard Cutis rolls out another sentimental, charming and brilliantly British rom com with About Time. This time, it's boy meets girl. Boy can travel in time. A romantic comedy with a time travel twist, AT has various shortcomings but is overall pleasant and reasonably well done. Richard Curtis writes and directs the film, and he shows his skill as a director as the visuals are excellent. The script has other issues, but much of the drama feels real and the jokes and funny without resorting to vulgarity. The humour's fairly original and you can't see all of the jokes coming. Things are repeated thanks to the involvement of time travel but it doesn't grow repetitive. This is a sentimental film but not in an overly cloying way and some of the dramatic moments are genuinely emotional, but in a calm, unforced sort of way. The acting is good all around, but the standout is Bill Nighy as the father, who's performance sparkles with both pathos and dry wit. AT is a touching and funny film overall, but it has several problems which become more apparent in the second half.While the sentimentality is fine, it's inevitably a bit soppy. The problem with AT is that there's not a lot of point. Once the central relationship gets going there's no conflict or threat, and instead the film goes into other underdeveloped subplots. The film drifts from event to event without actually saying much or offering any obstacles to the characters, and leaves various plot holes in its wake. AT has some rather problematic messages, and the implication that the main character could not have had his successes or his romances without the time travel is a bit offensive. A lot of the time, you can't quite see where it's going. AT certainly lacks urgency or true conflict, but it's well executed and enjoyable enough for that to be overlooked and all in all it's another triumph for Working Title. Many will enjoy this and it might even be a tear jerking movie for some. It hasn't got an awful lot of logic to it but it doesn't necessarily need it. It's no Back To The Future, but it does time travel in an interesting and less formulaic way than other time travel films.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An entertaining can of worms,"Making a film about time-traveling is opening a can of worms. I've seen almost every film out there about time travel: some are very accurate and some are a complete mess. This one is somewhere in between. They introduce the concept very casually to the characters in the film who aren't smart enough to ask certain questions about the rules concerning the consequences and changes it might cause...I get that this movie is first and foremost a romantic movie and time travel is only a device to prove a point but at the same time it can be a bit distracting if it doesn't work 100%. In the first half of the film the protagonist comes of as a bumbling idiot who unrightfully uses time travel to correct his impulsive mistakes, which would have been easily corrected if he just used his brain before speaking. It seems questionable in that way if he even deserves to have this power to force 'things' to go his way. Domhnall Gleeson is maybe not the best choice of actor here, Rachel McAdams does a much better job, she is instantly likable but her character seems to be written without much depth. It might seem like a bad movie judging but my rant here but actually if you look past the aforementioned shortcomings it is entertaining and the 2 hrs will fly by in no time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So bad it's enough to make you angry,"Greetings viewers. Welcome to the saccharine world of Richard Curtis where, just like ALL his other cinematic concoctions, love conquers all and life is fulfilled - as long as you happen to live in a fantasy version of London where a) it's always summer b) you live in (the incredibly expensive) St. John's Wood/Maida Vale area, c) ethnic minorities are non-existent, d) everyone has a middle class job in law, the arts or publishing, e) children never cry - they are just massively cute all the time, f) you have wealthy parents rattling around in a huge house by the sea, g) you have a kooky sister and an eccentric uncle for comedy relief and h) you are a less handsome but not unattractive ginger version of Hugh Grant. Curtis' storytelling template never waivers from the success of FOUR WEDDINGS and NOTTING HILL and this derivative bilge is the 21st century equivalent of ""All Americans still think London is foggy, lit by gas lamps and transported by horse and carriage."" Oh, and don't forget - if you need a passage of time let's have a montage set to a bland love song that takes place in a single location.

An absolute MUST SEE for anyone who breathes in this lifetime.,"I have waited for MANY years about seeing this because Love Actually has raised the bar SO high that I thought that no movie could even come close to this amazing. UNTIL I saw that it is from the same writer and director. I rented it for 48 hours and have watched it twice while I basically pulled an all nighter. There isnt a word or sentiment that has not already been captured within the plethora of positive reviews here. The first featured review is a great synopsis of the details of ""simply magnificent"" film. It will stay with me for the rest of my life. Just watch it..... Please?

Why I don't have what he has,"I've watched this movie 8 times now, and every time I watch it, I feel grave sadness, jealousy and emotional stability, I literally envy him for his ability.This movie taught me how to embrace my mistakes because I can't correct them, it taught me that in order to find true love you have to put in some effort, and to keep that love you should care about your partner, family is an important aspect in this film, so give them some time, friends are not your reflection they are different so accept them, and finally every second in your life is worthy of your appreciation.This movie has been my favourite for a long time, and still, I've watched so many movies but never encountered a movie that could touch me more than this movie, every time someone asks me for a movie recommendation, I suggest this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What do you expect?,"It's Richard Curtis. You'll hear Richard Curtis jokes. You'll see Richard Curtis 'embarrassing' situations. You'll experience all the usual Richard Curtis kooky characters. Anyway who's watched Love Actually, Notting Hill etc. Will not be surprised. Not one bit.Fortunately, our man Curtis is a bit of a virtuoso at this ol' romantic comedy game, and he deftly juggles the love story between this nervous but likable little twerp and his heart-on-sleeve Yank girlfriend, with the more science fictiony type stuff regarding time travel. Sure, there a few plot holes here and there (that whole thing about not being able to go back before your last child was born is a tad confused) but overall, it's an original spin to staple on a bit of Groundhog Day style ingenuity into what could have been a standard formula.And sadly, like the aforementioned Bill Murray starrer it does get more than a little corny towards the end, and the long speeches about 'making the most of every day' and how 'life is such a precious gift' made me reach for my patented *MOVIE BARF BUCKET* (It even has my name emblazoned on it!!) and the unbelievably sentimental montage that accompanied them well and truly filled it. There's a way to handle these no doubt imperative messages in a subtle, underhand way... NOT by slapping it on with a trowel complete with 'mood music' in the background.Still, it's a true pleasure for the most part. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll hurl.

Every Time Traveler loves her - Rachel McAdams,"If you expect About Time is another romantic time traveling movie starring Rachel McAdams after Time Traveler's Wife and Midnight in Paris, you are dead wrong.If you expect About Time is another Notting Hill or Love Actually that directed by Richard Curtis, you are also dead wrong.The truth is the main theme of this movie is not about romance but discussing the meaning of living. So if you are looking for a movie with full of tearful and touching scenes that you can watch with your boyfriend/husband in bed romantically, this is not your choice.The movie actually is not bad and I do like it. But the lines are not so clever/humorous comparing with others directed/written by Richard. Also I think the performance of Rachel McAdams is quite limited by her role. I feel this is such a waste for this big time romantic movie star to be nothing more than just a sweet and caring gf/wife. Her character is capable of being something more bigger and more complicated. And that would be something audiences would love to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A true masterpiece.,"I went into this movie expecting a cute romance, with a touch of comedy, and a bit of ""Back to the Future"" style Sci-fi flair. What I received was a beautiful and massively moving story about love. Not just romantic love (although there is plenty of that also,) but also the love between siblings, parents, friends, and even strangers. Warning: This movie will make you cry, but the end of this film will redeem any tears with an unshakable message about appreciating day to day life, and how to appreciate the beauty we experience each day. I was especially glad that this film dodges several old and annoying movie clich√©s that I expected to see as the film progressed. In closing, this film has an original storyline, very talented actors, and a genuinely moving power.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant,"If you liked Groundhog Day and Big Fish I think this is the kind of film you would really like. I recommend this film highly to heart first/emotional types of people, but it may not be a good choice for those who don't fit that description.This is a film about heart. There are some plot holes but if you get lost in the ""Science"" of this film...well then you'll miss the heart and art of it. It's a film about family. Each character is flawed and real. As the film went on I cared more and more about each of the characters who became people I felt like I knew. This is an emotional journey to say the least and while I rarely cry when watching films, this one got me. A few times. Happy and sad tears. Life tears I guess you could say.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Perfect Movie,"A perfect movie. (I've said that twice this past week as I've revisited some of my favourites films.) This is more than a love story about blossoming love (Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams), there are a wide variety of love stories in this, not the least of which is that of a father and his son (Bill Nighy and Domhnall). Lovely supporting cast. Great performances. Beautiful and textured writing. Exceptional music. Life affirming moments and profound words side by side with the humour of life. I've watched this many times (and even, accidently, bought two digital copies). I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Unconventional Drama about Love}. As a matter of fact, I think I'll watch it again, right now.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The title says it all, but it's about happiness and love, too","It is very difficult not to like a starring Bill Nighy, even the crappy ones get an extra star at least just for featuring him, but About Time is also written by Richard Curtis, of Love Actually fame, so there is only a tiny tiny chance the movie would not be good. And then Rachel McAdams plays in it, too, making it an instant hit. So like other reviewers here, I don't understand people implying they didn't like the movie (I've just scientifically demonstrated that is impossible).Time travel films are usually about two things: alternate history and second chances. Alternate history is just a plot device for telling a science fiction story in a familiar environment, while second chances films almost always talk about fixing past mistakes, avoiding regret, enjoying life. This makes About Time more amazing, because it is actually almost devoid of the quasi-religious platitudes relating to regret, guilt and consequences. It is about enjoying life, it is about enjoying your friends and your family, if you are lucky enough to have enjoyable ones, like the dude in the film. It is about enjoying Rachel McAdams, too, but that shouldn't be too difficult.Bottom line: a bit long at two hours and also having little to do with exploring the awesome power of time travel. However it is a very pleasant romance and family movie, with good solid humour, but without trying to be a comedy, and it is not one of those horrid Christmas ghost things, either. Luckily for us, the lead character was a very nice guy, as was his father, and he didn't consider living his life, then taking it from the start all over again, with other people, other children, other hours of watching... I recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cute. Just don't think about the actual time traveling.,"Cute story. Though the time traveling aspect is a bit silly and lazy. If every male in the family can time travel, wouldn't they keep overriding each other's action. Just try not to think about the time traveling mechanism too much and go along with it. It's a feel good story, but shallow in drama, most conflict/consequences was easily remedied except for the final decision (which is really accept the result of reality).Also, I found some of the cinematography lacking. Not sure what the budget was, but some day exterior shots were way too harsh and flat.Other than that, the script and acting was well done. The humor was fun too! Recommend giving it a watch even in 2021.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great love story... a great life lesson,"I came across this movie by accident and I started watching it and I must say that I wish I had the power to go back and watch it again and again, but I enjoyed it so much that I don't regret it now.This was a romantic movie that I will always love because it was a life lesson.I'm sure I'm going to come and watch it again and again and I have to say thank you for making this amazing movie.Each and every actor was excellent and the soundtrack of this movie was playing with my soul.It may be strange, but I took a notebook and wrote a few sentences of this movie for myself because I know it is worth reading later again and again.I'm sad that I didn't see this masterpiece earlier, but now I'm happy that I watched Tim and Mary's love story and experienced two unique hours watching this movie.I say again...

"A different kind of romance, but not tonnes of comedy either","I am not a romcom fan, but decided to dip my toe into their muddled waters for a rare visit to the genre. I was initially tempted by the premise of time travel, as sci-fi is slightly more to my taste.However, what surprised me most about About Time wasn't the comedy (actually I felt there was a lack of real laughs), but the storyline's willingness to expand. Instead of becoming a run-of-the-mill love story with the predictability of an infant's book, About Time goes beyond, exploring birth, families and ultimately, death.Bill Nighy, whilst a supporting member, is the true star of the show (closely followed by Tom Hollander), playing the ever-wise father. Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams are fairly routine in their roles, whilst sister figure Lydia Wilson is slightly too comical for my taste.The film's take on the wider world is completely obtuse, a posh, rose-tinted England that has no dark patches. This does feel a tad patronising, but the family's home in Cornwall is a great location for some scenes.Ultimately, I still don't think I am a romcom fan - they are too bright and cheerful for my liking - but About Time was at least a step in the right direction.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The best time traveler movie of all times,"Have seen quite a few time travel movies, but this one beats them all on all grounds. The plot, the relevance of the time travel, not overdoing it, the characters soooooo beautifully played by all (even the role of Uncle Desmond - who has such a short role to play in the movie, plays it soooo convincingly and to the best of what the character demands.) The best of all - the dialog's. You will tend to fall in love with them. Humorous, witty and so beautifully written that it makes the movie watching experience an absolute delight. And then the characters who are delivering these dialog's in a manner that I don't think I will like to see or hear in any other form than how it is done in this movie.Not much of a reviewer on IMDb, just a few one before these, but this was one movie which I just wanted to pen down about, with the hope that whosoever is reading it to figure out whether I should watch this movie or not, can simply go and get that DVD right now without second thoughts.

Not a Curtis classic perhaps but likely to improve your evening,"If you could rewind time and go back to correct your mistakes, making everything perfect next time around, would you? This is the basic conceit behind the latest British love story/comedy from ""Love Actually"" & ""Notting Hill"" director Richard Curtis. With that pedigree, most audiences will know what to expect, although the high end ""nobody actually works"" has been toned down somewhat.At the age of 21 ""Tim"" (Domhnall Gleeson), rather socially inept and certainly challenged in the girlfriend stakes, learns he has an inheritance. Instead of losing his father (Bill Nighy) and gaining a crusty old painting, he gets to keep the old man and know the secret only the male line possess, the ability to time travel.Following the usual stages of disbelief and hiding in wardrobes, he eventually lands at acceptance. Rather than money, he utilises this new tool for love, by trying to woo the girl of his dreams ""Mary"" (Rachel McAdams). The trick is used sparingly to start but over time becomes a regular feature of his life.The film is peppered with the usual Curtis trademarks, good music, great cast, offbeat locations and a slight story but benefits from gentle performances from a quality cast.There are touching moments, especially for those perhaps deeper into their own life arc and no film with Bill Nighy in the cast list can ever be totally dismissed.Domnhall and McAdams do good work, initial misgivings about the chemistry between the leads, gives way to something wholly believable as the pair grow into the roles together. Lindsay Duncan as long suffering mother and Tom Hollander as ""Harry"" both get a nod for fulfilling support duties well.The film is arguably longer than it needs to be, there is one later storyline that might easily have been excised to prevent the film overstaying it's welcome.A perfect date night movie, with precious little to offend and should leave a smile on the face and maybe just a thought or two about seizing and enjoying every moment. Not deep stuff perhaps but arguably none the worse for a film aiming at pleasant and hitting the target.SummaryEnjoyable, light, undemanding yet wholly enjoyable entertainment with a warm heart stitched firmly to the sleeve, perhaps eking a sneaky tear for those in the mood.Not a Curtis classic perhaps but likely to improve your evening and if not, like ""Tim"" you can rewind and try again until your mood is just right.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Dull, Drab, Dreary, Dire.","IMDb reviews never cease to astound me, great films get low scores, terrible films get great scores - guess which one this is?About Time is bland, pointless, and just sits there on screen doing absolutely nothing. There's nothing involving about the plot, no characters you give a toss about, and it's long, long, long.The entire premise of the time travel idea is under-used and almost seems like an afterthought for the movie. The ginger leading man is also mildly irritating and not much fun to look at, his plum-in-the-mouth dialect being representative of the kind of people in England who are generally extremely annoying too (to you Americans reading this, almost no normal person in the UK speaks like that - just the over- privileged).True, I'm no fan of romcoms, but many are sufferable if they at least manage to hold your attention for their under 90 minutes running time. But 123 minutes of blandness? I'm afraid not. I just sat there wondering when something was going to happen.....and then the yawns set in.Its so unsettling that so many people here have given this drab grey shade of a movie ten stars, and calling it the ""best film you've ever seen"" c'mon..? Honestly people, can you just not make statements like that on here anymore? I mean please? You really are contributing nothing as it shows just how few films you've ever seen.

Movies never make me cry...this one did,"I'm vaguely familiar with Richard Curtis and his works. I've seen 4 Weddings, and part of Notting Hill. I am by no means an avid consumer of anything Curtis. I saw this one because an ex-girlfriend from 25 years ago looked me up on social media to tell me that she had found my movie doppelg√§nger in Domhnall Gleeson's character in this flick called ""About Time"". So, I had to check it out.To be frank, I am no where near as charming or clever or cute as Tim. She was wrong on that front. But I'm so glad her message found me because this movie is amazing.Is it sentimental, sappy, romantic? Yes to all 3 and, therefore, not my normal cinematic fare. The time travel aspect being thrown into a rom-com story almost discouraged me from even giving it a chance. But I had to see this British movie character version of myself.My relationship with my father, or lack thereof, made this movie very personal and difficult to watch for me. You see, that's really the central, most powerful key to the plot. Yes it's a love story and it's silly and whimsical and all that. But Tim and his father have the relationship that I strive every day to have with my son, now 16, because it's the missing thing in my life that left this giant vacancy in my soul. And my life now largely revolves around ensuring that my son never experiences that vacancy.I know this sounds more like an autobiography than a movie review. So I'll sum it up this way. Don't let the preposterous nature of the plot scare you away. The time travel scenarios, though silly and highly unscientific, are crucial to the plot development. If you are a son with a son(s) of his own, this movie is for you. Anyone who says this is a chick flick missed the point and got it completely wrong. This is a guy flick for guys who aren't afraid of their own souls and the emotions that come from them. I've watched it 3 times now and each time I cry a little less and smile a little more.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
He always seemed to have time on his hands.,"Domhnall Gleeson (who looks like a young Conan O'Brian) is a lonely time traveller who meets the love of his life in Rachel McAdams and attempts to win her heart time & time again after a glitch in the process renders them complete strangers. This was good, maybe not as good as I was expecting as it drags a bit in the middle but still charming. Bill Nighy is the dad here, he's very Bill Nighy which is great; funny dry, sarcastic, explains to his son on his 21st birthday, this is what happens to the men in our family--no big deal.Really the time travel aspect is secondary here, 'Tim' just flashes back, fixes a few things, gets the girl Groundhog Day style, its more about fatherhood and life, about time and not wasting a moment of it. I loved that message at the end when the father tells him to live each day twice. Once as normal and then enjoying and noticing the little things the second time around, not worrying. A great message.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Gem!,"Richard Curtis's 'About Time' is A Gem! A wonderful, heart-warming Romantic-Comedy, that benefits from a terrific Screenplay, Top-Notch Direction & Proficient Performances!'About Time' Synopsis: At the age of 21, Tim discovers he can travel in time and change what happens and has happened in his own life. His decision to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend turns out not to be as easy as you might think.'About Time' is a tale, very-well told. A wonderful film in all respects.

Music by Nick Laird-Clowes is superb.Performance-Wise: Domhnall Gleeson delivers a sensitive performance in the central role. Rachel McAdams is adorable.

About the worst film ever made,"I'll admit straight off that I hate Richard Curtis with a passion generally reserved for mass-murdering dictators, but I was willing to give About Time a fair chance and see whether he could in fact charm me. I was wrong, and how.From the start he makes the bile rise in your stomach. There's a character called KitKat (""who is always bare-foot""); her family have Sunday lunch on the beach all year round (""no matter what the weather""); they even watch a film projected onto a rock on the beach, in the rain.But things get much, much worse. Curtis basically recycles scenes and ideas from all his previous crimes (sorry, films). We get the eccentric older family member, the kooky friends, the cute and nondescript American girl wooed in a fantasy London, the births, a death and of course a ****ing wedding. Mawkish music on the soundtrack tells us when to be happy, when to be miserable. The cynicism of the project and the vapidity of its intentions would be unbelievable were it not for Curtis's previous form.Do not see this film. Watch a Hitchcock, a Kubrick, a Wilder, something that is proper cinema. This is an abomination, a dreadful, lazy, meandering, actually quite nasty (how on earth did a film with numerous F-words get a 12 in Britain?), vomit-causing, stupid slice of celluloid which, if there was such a place as hell, would be shown there on a loop.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It gets BETTER every time I watch it, which is rare because I don't watch too many movies more than once or twice, and I'm hyper critical of almost everything I watch. But even though this film might have a couple of logical flaws with the time travel elements, the rest of it is so well done that even this cynic doesn't care.

Well duh. Richard Curtis wrote and directed both. It has some great lines and funny moments. It's a bit quirky. There is some great romance. And there are some good sentimental moments.The acting is good. I thought there was chemistry between Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson although perhaps some of that was my own perception of Mary. Many times throughout the movie I thought to myself, if I were Tim, there is no way i could have turned down any request Mary made. McAdams was appealing throughout even early on when Tim was acting like a total stalker and she didn't run away screaming.I loved the scene about making Tim decide things about the wedding which could easily have been salacious or even licentious, but instead was just a tiny bit naughty yet very cute.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
About Time,"The problem with About Time, is that it is not particularly a bad film, but at the same time it is not really a good one either. The film is purely and simply mediocre. The premise of the film sounded interesting enough with it's blend of romance/comedy and even a little bit of science fiction (if you really want to call it that), but I just felt that the film went nowhere with this material. In the right hands a story idea like this could have really been something wonderful if it was in the hands of say, Charlie Kaufman, or someone like that, but here the material loses steam and interest fast and I didn't feel the film used this interesting premise in any interesting ways. Events happen in the film where there is some sort of mishap, or embarrassment and so henceforth we go to the science fiction aspect of the film and changing the outcomes of many situations, but the problem is that the film used this plot device and gimmick too many times and it just never went anywhere and after awhile it never really seemed fresh, or original, but instead a film that has just one too many clich√©s and plot holes and it really did not feel like anything new, or breakthrough, but instead just a rehash of films that I have seen so many times before. I appreciated that writer/director Richard Curtis, tried to make us connect with these characters on the screen and giving us moments of which to laugh and cry, but again none of it really registered, or connected with me personally. I might have had a few laughs during the course of the film and at times it did hold my interest, but I just overall was not all that interested in how this film would end, or what would happen to these characters and the plot device/gimmick that was introduced into the story. At times the film almost felt a little emotionless as well. Things just seemed to drag on and it was never really all that interesting and at times, I do admit some of the emotion, or things going on, did feel a bit forced and the true emotional build up, or allowing us to care, or connect with these characters was never there. I have seen other Richard Curtis films before which I have liked, which was one of the reasons I chose to see About Time, but this I feel is one of his most underdeveloped films from a writing perspective because of how we never can connect to any one person, or event and just that none of it is all that interesting. I was hoping that like Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry's wonderful Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which did have a unique and original plot device and gimmick, but that film made us care and relate to the characters and situations more so than most films I have seen and was a film that always was fascinating and kept your interest and because of how personal and realistic it got, you could both identify with it and laugh and cry with it at the same time. The plot device there was not underused, but used in the right way and it ended up being one of the best films of the 2000's and one of the best films around period. I was hoping that writer/director Richard Curtis would have taken the same route with About Time, but unfortunately the end result was too flat. This isn't also to say that I hated About Time, because I didn't. There were times where I appreciated some of the humour in it and when the emotional content did not feel too forced, I felt that I did connect with it in some ways, but unfortunately those moments were too few and far between. I didn't like the film and I didn't hate it. I think that it is going to be one of those films which I will probably remember for a couple days and then as time goes by, I will forget most of what I saw on screen because it did not resonate, or connect with me as I wished it would have. I still like Richard Curtis and I would recommend viewers a lot of his other films whether written, or directed by him, like Love Actually, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, or my personal favourite, the made for television movie The Girl in the Caf√©. All worth checking out. I wish he would have repeated some of the successful material in those films for About Time, but as it stands About Time, is neither good, or bad, but simply mediocre and nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A sweet and feel-good  romantic comedy-drama,"The picture is definitely a feel-good picture, one of those which make you think: ""I really needed it"". The idea of travelling in time is not that original, and could therefore be dangerous to use it for the umpteenth time, on the contrary the strong feelings of sweetness and tenderness which pervade it make it pleasant to see and enjoy, never sounding trite or boring. The cast is great, and help create the feel-good atmosphere, which never abandons the viewer also when some dramatic moments are to be faced, since always supported by a positive feeling towards life and familiar bonds. There are some new faces together with some older faces of British cinema, working together very empathetically , on the background of a breathtaking Cornwall which is by itself worth the ticket.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

As Much About Family As It Was About Romance,"On New Year's Day of his 21st year, Tim Lake (Domhall Gleeson) learns from his Dad (Bill Nighy) that the men in their family can travel back in time to specific moments in their lives. There will be rules that cannot be violated lest past events altered will give rise to completely different outcomes. Naturally kind-hearted Tim uses this power to get himself a girlfriend, among other good-intentioned deeds in conscious ""Groundhog Day"" scenarios.Domhnall Gleeson (whom we will recognize as one of the elder Weasley brothers in the Harry Potter series) felt really sincere as dorky Tim, and his relationship with insecure Mary, sweetly played by Rachel McAdams (already the heroine of love stories like ""The Notebook"" and ""The Time Traveller's Wife""), was very disarming indeed. They were an ideal couple here. The scenes on how he successfully got Mary to be his girlfriend and their very different wedding and the reception were their best scenes together. OK, Gleeson may look a bit younger than McAdams, but you still can't deny that their positive chemistry was truly palpable.However despite this being marketed as a romantic love story, I felt more emotionally-connected with the scenes played between Tim and his quirky family, especially Tim and his Dad. There may have been scenes which violate the very rules upon which their time-traveling is based, but the sentiment was so poignant I decided to just overlook them.The cinematography of the Cornwall coastal panorama and the streets of London were very charming. The perfectly-timed entrance of selected pop oldies and ethereal new songs adds to the emotional atmosphere created by the situations.Some scenes that I felt went a little too long, contributing to a running time of more than two hours. The whole side plot about beautiful Charlotte (Margot Robbie) could have been shortened, as well as that endless scene where Mary was choosing a dress to wear to an event.Overall though, this is a very pleasant British love story by Richard Curtis, who wrote and directed classics like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Notting Hill"" and ""Love Actually."" Again like his other films, ""About Time"" is also about love and family, but this one had an actual fantasy element in play, and that unique magical touch adds to the fun and the romance of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy are at their best and Domhnall Gleeson does a terrific job as the male lead. As far-fetched as time travel may seem, About Time makes it seem almost believable, and poignantly illustrates the ups and downs of life do-overs.

Exceptional!,"What else would you expect from the director of ""Love Actually"" who also wrote ""Notting Hill""? In Cornwall, Tim Lake lives a pleasant life with his family, but he is awkward with the girls and unlucky in love. At the age of twenty one, his father discloses a family secret to him, telling that the men in his family have the ability to travel in time. The skeptic Tim finds that his father is telling the truth and when he moves to London to work as a lawyer, he falls in love with Mary and seduces her by fixing his mistakes in the relationship.While there are countless rom coms in the world; some good, some bad, they tend to follow a familiar formula. However, 'About Time' manages to break free from this pattern, making it a truly exceptional romantic comedy. Its truly one of the most clever rom coms I've watched. It's witty, funny, emotional, and surprising at many points throughout it. What I found truly exceptional is the balance they were able to make between the comedy and the dramatic aspect, inviting both laughter and heartfelt moments. Of course, with the addition of the brilliant time travelling sequences.This isn't just a movie about the love life between the two main leads, it also touches on the father-son relationship of Tim and his father. Rachel McAdams (Mary) and Domhnall Gleeson's (Tim) performances were on point with evident chemistry between them. Additionally, the supporting cast members also had decent performances in their respective roles (Margot Robbie is in it too by the way). The movie's score was also so good and complimented the atmosphere they were trying to provide the audience with.Score:8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not funny or smart enough to justify the sheer amount of sentiment it pours on,"When he turns 21, young Tim has ""the talk"" with his father ‚Äì although in the case of his family, the father/son talk is actually to reveal that all the men in the family can travel in time, back to any moment in their own life. Told of the downsides of just chasing money or just never working, Tim continues his life but determined to make the most of his talent to try and make sure he has true love. It doesn't work out great at first but a chance meeting with Mary starts a journey of a lifetime.There is a message at the end of this film that is essentially about living life as it comes and enjoying it for what it is ‚Äì not necessarily everyone quitting to go and travel for the rest of their life (someone needs to work) but just enjoying the ride whatever that ride is. It is a commendable message but the irony of it is that it is being delivered to someone who has just not done that for the previous 2 hours. Of course going into the film I knew that this is a Richard Curtis rom-com, filled with the usual faces and of course doing the usual things, so there is an element of buyer beware, but I was curious about the time-travel angle.Truth is that, outside of some plot points and basically the same jokes done over and over again, it really doesn't add much to what is essentially a film so sugary it will give you diabetes. The shame of it is that it does have nice ideas and themes in here but it never misses a chance to overdo it. So the soundtrack is full of easy Coldplay-esque rubbish, the narrator explains it all slowly so that the film doesn't need to be work, the relationships are all soft and cuddly, the characters are all totally fantasy people who only exist in Curtis' films and generally the whole thing is overdone and hugely sentimental. I would lie if I said that it didn't still work as such, but it really was hard work to stay close to it considering how much it pushed me away.The cast match the tone of the film and I found Gleeson and McAdams to be overly cutesy and cuddly ‚Äì not a rough edge on either of their characters or their performances. Nighy at least adds a bit of clout to the mostly empty emotion, while Hollander, Grant, Griffiths and a few others at least add a bit of grit or cleverness into the film. Mostly though the whole thing is so safe and smoothed that almost no character remains in it. Of course it is not awful ‚Äì it is too professionally crafted for that, but what it is just didn't work for me. About Time taught me a lesson about time ‚Äì that it shouldn't be used for films that I don't fancy much but might watch just because someone said it is ""alright"".",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Passing Time,"This film is mildly recommended.That tried and true formula about time travel is working overtime in About Time. a pleasing but slight little comedy. Just how many films have successfully taken this plot device and made it fresh and appealing. Not many. (Midnight in Paris, Back to the Future, Twelve Monkeys, Big, Time After Time, and The Terminator come to mind.) However, the number of movies which take that gimmick to hackneyed and overdone results seem endless. (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, The Time Traveler's Wife, The Philadelphia Experiment, Premonition, Kate and Leopold, 17 Again, The Adjustment Bureau, The Lake House, The Butterfly Effect, Frequency, Somewhere in Time, and The Final Countdown, all misfires that still boggle my mind.)With About Time, many moviegoers will find this latest version of time hopping delightful, even romantic. I found it to be an innocuous trifle, a diverting enough two hours of amusement. The film has its charm, mostly due to its likable cast, but it follows that overused ""what if"" time-changing formula and rarely pushes its own limits. It stay safely within the lines and never wants to journey outside the box, at least until its conclusion.The simple story follows the familiar road map of time travel ala Groundhog Day, another pleasant comedy with the same theme in mind. Tim is without a love connection, a misfit on the dating scene. After a father-son discussion on his 21st birthday, he suddenly learns that he can change what has happened in his own life to his advantage. His past mistakes can now be rectified and his future looks more promising with this newly acquired power. Although he cannot change history, he can relive those awkward moments and at least somewhat control his own destiny and finally get a girlfriend.Domnhall Gleeson plays Tim and he is fine in this role. It's not a real stretch, but he makes his character believable even with this unbelievable set-up. Rachel McAdams is his love interest, Mary, and this actress also generates some innovation to a clich√©d role. There is a strong chemistry between the two young actors which helps to elevate the predictability of the film. Even better is Bill Nighy as Tim's wise father. Nighy brings subtlety and warmth to his patriarch role and his acting skills are precise and spot-on.Richard Curtis wrote and directed this movie. His specialty seems to be the romantic comedy genre (the annoying Bridget Jones' Diary, the better Notting Hill and Love Actually films, and the superb Four Weddings and a Funeral ) and this film is one of his minor efforts. This time, his script starts off way too cute and takes awhile to build any real emotion or tension. The film is almost stuck in its own self-imposed time warp, afraid to jump from sentimental sit- com situations to honest adult issues. It's not until the midpoint of the film that About Time finally deals with familial complications that directly affect the relationship between Tim and Mary, and only then, does the film begin to become compelling. (Still, as with other films of this genre, this film falls prey to the illogic of time travel and its proliferation of selective changes and their lack of repercussions that never mesh with the character's sense of reality.)Perhaps if Curtis had spent more time and more initial re-writings with his screenplay, About Time would have become a more memorable love story. As it is, it's not the worst of times you will have, but then it's not the best either. GRADE: B-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pass the Popcorn review,"Richard Curtis, the director and writer of About Time, is a well-known screenwriter, whose most famous scripts include those for the Bridget Jones movies, for Love Actually and for Notting Hill ‚Äì so you kind of know what to expect from him already: a cute and funny romantic comedy, but no Oscar bait. About Time, I think, tries to be something more than a romantic comedy, and in a way it manages to do so: it's not only about a relationship between a man and a woman, there is also the love for family members. Unfortunately, this movie fails in creating any drama ‚Äì it's more like watching a compilation of images from someone's life ‚Äì and in this aspect it should have just sticked to the romantic comedy genre.Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) lives an almost ideal life with his almost perfect family: the only thing he's missing is a girlfriend. But when his father (Bill Nighy), on Tim's 21st birthday, reveals to him that all male members of their family can travel back in time, he decides to use this ability to find a girlfriend. He moves to London, gets a job and meets Mary (Rachel McAdams), with whom he falls in love, one evening in a caf√©. He discovers that changing the course of events by going back in time has major consequences, not all of which are pleasant. Therefore, he must decide what is more important, and realise that the ability to travel back in time perhaps isn't that much of an advantage.It's impossible not to notice similarities with other movies, especially with the anime The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, but that's a good thing. The main problem with this movie, like I already said, is the fact that there is no real story, no drama, no problems that last till the end of the movie and our heroes have to resolve. For example, after he finds Mary and gets her number, he has to go back in time to help a friend ‚Äì and ends up never meeting her. This story, his searching for the girl of his dreams, could have been stretched out to last an hour and a half, but instead the issue is resolved in ten minutes, and the movie goes on for more than an hour. The main character's sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) is the only one who has constant issues she needs to resolve, but her role is too marginal to be really relevant.The main problem I just explained might as well be the movie's best quality. It is just a collection of segments from someone's life, and almost every segment is positive, which makes it more a therapy than a movie. Most of the time, while watching About Time, you'll find yourself laughing and feeling happy, and once you exit the theater, you'll probably feel satisfied with the life you're leading ‚Äì which is the message of the movie. The actors, the cinematography and the music help with that: the cast is talented, the scenery beautiful (and mostly shows sunny days or calm nights). One may argue that the movie is too idealistic, that nobody leads such an awesome life in reality. My opinion is that it's not about what happens to you, it's about how you handle it, and the characters in About Time handle it very well.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's a cute story how he finally finds ""the"" girl and goes about making it happen. Lot's of humorous bits and some serious ones also, but an all around ""feel good"" movie. Much needed these days. Especially love Rachel McAdams (She's drop dead gorgeous and has a sweet personality) in her role as the girl. Bill Nighy plays the ""dad"" as he gives advice on how to use the family gift wisely and not repeat past relatives misuses, and he is awesome at this role and makes one feel that he would be an excellent father for any of us. Domhnall Gleeson plays the guy and he is perfect for this role, kind of ""geeky"" in a very nice and caring way. Many girls go for the tough guy, but this type of guy is the type who will truly love you forever and stck to it. Awesome film for the whole family.

Far Superior To Its Comparables In Time Travel,"This is a very easy movie to like. Early on I was a little irritated by the fact that Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) was able to time travel as much as he could with essentially no consequences, but once I managed to ignore the exact rules of the time travel stuff I really started to enjoy it more and more.The movie has strong performances from Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams. They work off of each other in sort of an unconventional way that works. Tim's (Gleeson) bond with his father (Bill Nighy) also feels very genuine which is critical to making the film work. The small scenes spaced out in the movie between the two and the development of their relationship allows the film to really deliver the intended message in a powerful way at the end.What is particularly great about this movie is that it's not simply a love story , even though that is a part of it. The true theme is about making the most of the time we do have. It seems like an overused theme and a cliche but the way the film expresses this theme makes you reflect on your own life. It forces you to ask yourself whether you are seeing all the good that is in your life and whether or not you are maximizing and cherishing those moments.Overall, good movie for all to see.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A wasted potential,"The movie had a lot of potential possibilities except they just used it to give a message 'Live every day giving your best by enjoying it' which is of course good but they did not need a sci-fi setting and waste that. The start is promising as we see Tim has a gift to go back in time and change it. Tim uses it to his advantage so he goes on to impress a girl by getting to know her first time and acting as per her likes next time. He uses this in every scenario to impress her. In first part we get to see how once Tim travels to same time and goes to another place, his earlier actions go on missing erasing that time line. This point was reiterated throughout showing how Tim could never change some things. However we never get to see this point into a big drama point. Tim sees his father dying and he still travels back to meet him which he can never do once his child is born. The moment that he has to let go of his father's memory which he revisits was poignant and handled well.

A heart warming story! 6/10,"Review: This is quite a heart warming story about a teenager who has the ability to travel back in time. As the main character is able to correct his mistakes in life, he manages to find the lady of his life but he is a able to correct every problem in his life. Personally, I think that they could have picked a better leading character because I was unable to relate to the one that the director had chosen. Apart from that, is great writing and there is enough material to keep the storyline interesting. In some ways, it seemed more like a chick flick even though the main character was a boy. Anyway, it's worth a watch but don't expect anything different from Richard Curtis.Round-Up: I'm really becoming a Bill Nighy fan because of his way of acting and the way that he can make any situation funny. Tom Hallander was quite funny and Rachel McAdams was a great choice for her role. She seems to add a sweetness to all of the roles which out shone the leading character who did have much screen charisma, but I think that was a deliberate choice by the director. Anyway, it's true family fun but it's not a classic like Love Actually or Notting Hill.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $86millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there time travel movie about a teenager trying to correct his mistakes throughout his life. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I feel like I've seen this movie before,The movie was OK. Just OK. I feel like I've seen films similar before. The main character finds out he has time traveling powers and (of course) he uses it to go back in time for things such as finding a girlfriend. This theme is used in pretty much any movie where a character has the opportunity to go back and relive his life. And (of course again)there is a major death which I predicted would happen as soon as I found out that the main character could go back in time. Better yet I also was able to take a guess which character would die. This film did has some good jokes and play-on-words and I liked the acting.

Awful,"Just awful. I enjoyed the Time Traveler's Wife, and this was like that except lacking everything that made that movie interesting, with hardly any significant, interesting time travel and a boring, pathetic loser for a main character who never grows at all throughout the movie.The film doesn't make you care at all about ANY of the characters, in fact, because it never really tries to. The only ""tear jerking"" that happens is because of the sappy music and the marriage and baby stuff that some women love to fawn over despite the lack of connection to any of the characters in the film.It drags on especially toward the end for no real apparent reason other than to add to the sap appeal for the characters that we have no connection whatsoever to because, again, none was ever developed.The reviews promised a chick flick that men could actually enjoy. It did not deliver whatsoever. I can't see anyone with taste enjoying this film.Rated 2 because the first 20 minutes were somewhat interesting.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I'm not going to argue with the critics who have criticized this film, I just hope that more people get a good feeling from it and experience it as a lighthearted and somewhat reflective time. By the way, I also like the design of tim and his father using table tennis as a bond for their family, because table tennis is an important part of my life, which is also what I like about this film. Finally, I hope I can watch this film with my lover in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
PERFECTION,"I have watched this movie about a hundred times. It's perfect. The first time was on a plane where the person seated next to me most assuredly thought I was insane - I cried, I literally laughed out loud, and everything in between. This might be my all-time favorite movie. They are fantastic together and the message is so beautiful. But then there's these super cute and super real moments between them that don't feel manufactured for the sake of creating drama - just real human things. The scene where she's trying on dresses is perfection. It's so grounded in such very real emotions that you almost forget it's got a supernatural / sci-fi element to it. I'll watch it a hundred more times, easily ;)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A true feel good film,"To pick apart this film would be far too cruel, because it's innocence has left most with a skip in their step and tear in their eye. Behind the extremely long duration, it was a sweet picture that expressed itself well and took audiences' through the rewarding story of Tim's (Domhnall Gleeson) life, after the discovery of his father's (Bill Nighy) secret, that the men in the family could travel in time. It featured warming performances from Bill Nighy, Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson, creating relatable characters and making an unbelievable story bitter-sweet. The comedy was both written and presented well by Richard Curtis, despite been more melancholy than his previous work it made an excellent caricature of a nervous romance and was in places, really funny. Being labelled as a romantic comedy, one would believe 'About Time' is a story of boy means girl, which is true at the start, but it develops more harmony throughout. Different relationships were explored and as each developed, the film developed a broader, more universal meaning. Even though it was a feel good portrait, it also felt very safe. Over explanatory, and slow; not making it lose it's essence but causing glances to watch now and again. Definitely worth the watch, but as films go, it could have been much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This was Unexpected.,"The welding of a concept of time-travel to a rom-com,well,that,is indeed really unexpected.Time travel and rom-com are in the two opposite sides of the movie-genre spectrum and Richard Curtis does a quite impeccable job of bringing them together,and well,the end result is magnificent.The movie,although is a romantic comedy,explores the relationship of a father with his son.The central theme of the story is that,Tim Hall,the protagonist of the film,inherits the ability to travel back in time from his father,and how he uses it to his advantage.Although the movie is a different take on love stories,its like what a good love story should be,i.e. funny and interesting.The movie showcases the trials and tribulations of Tim,right from 21 years of age till he has his fourth child.Overall,Tim Hall leads a near perfect life,barring a few moments.Having said that,well,the cons are,the movie gets a bit too dragged at times,and could have been shortened a bit.Also,the movie is a little bit too happy.But that's expected,since,the protagonist uses his gift very well to his advantage,to an extent,he can't.The performances are beautiful,especially from Bill Nighy. As for Richard Curtis,in my opinion,I still feel his directorial debut,the love anthology film,Love Actually better than this one.To conclude, this is a adorable,fun movie,one that is better,when watched with a loved one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The time traveller's wife... wait.,"I can see why some people might have a problem with the way in which the men of 'About Time (2013)' seem to manipulate the women. In some scenes, there is a rather uncomfortable undercurrent to the interactions between the time-traveling protagonist and the few women he wants to make an impression on. However, most of these interactions don't carry that feeling - for me, at least - because the most important of them would have occurred whether or not our leading man could travel through time. For instance (beware minor spoilers), the first time he meets his main love interest is completely natural, and he only has to go back in time after he accidentally erases this meeting. The pair would've fallen in love even if he couldn't manipulate the space-time continuum. He also never changes his personality or presents himself as someone he isn't; the mistakes he rectifies by travelling through time are typically small embarrassments caused entirely by his own bumbling self. The picture isn't really about time travel at all. Rather, it uses its supernatural conceit to present a sweet story about appreciating each moment of your life. The greatest aspect of being able to travel back in time isn't the chance to rectify your mistakes or acquire material gains, it's the ability to spend more time with your loved ones. This aspect of the picture packs a real punch, too. In fact, the whole movie is surprisingly resonant. The characters are charming, with enjoyable dynamics and distinct personalities, and the romance at the heart of the narrative is genuinely sweet. The film is also rather funny on occasion and is generally just a good time. It's a life-affirming flick that's about as sappy as you can get and some people might get turned off by that (to be honest, it often happens to me). However, the movie feels totally earnest. It doesn't present its philosophy on life simply to sell tickets, it truly believes it. So, yes, it is sappy and saccharine and, even, sort of predictable. Sometimes, though, we all need a bit of sap in our lives. It's surprisingly delightful. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful and sweet romantic comedy-drama,"The film lasts around two hours and maybe the first part of it is more like a romantic comedy and the second part is a bit more emotive all mixed with the idea of travelling in time.The first part is similar to Notting Hill, boy meet girl with funny situations and good dialogues.

Domhnall and Rachel were very good and Billy Nighy and Lindsay Duncan had some quite funny lines. The main characters were all pretty good. It makes you think about life and if you could go back and change some things in your life like Tim has done and the resulting consequences.Six out of seven of us really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.

A tiny miracle of a film that's about so much more than time.,"Richard Curtis has been responsible - as a writer, director or both at once - for such beloved romantic comedies as Four Weddings And A Funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually. It would seem to make perfect sense, then, for his newest film to be marketed in the same way: About Time, the new Richard Curtis rom-com featuring time travel! Never judge a film by its trailer or poster, though, as the saying goes, because there's an almost startling, heartbreaking depth to About Time, which slowly reveals itself to be a story about family and love that's only concerned in part with romance.On his 21st birthday, awkward, gangly Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) is told by his dad (Bill Nighy) that the men in his family have a unique ability to travel in time: they can't kill Hitler or take a tour of Renaissance Europe but, by going into a dark space and clenching their fists, they can revisit moments in their own personal timelines. When Tim meets the sweet, beautiful Mary (Rachel McAdams), he resolves to do everything in his power - including go back in time - to win her heart.That may sound like a bit of a kooky premise, but Curtis' execution of it - in his dual capacities as writer and director - is completely winning. In the moments when it's very much a rom-com, About Time is deliciously romantic and sweetly hilarious. There's an effervescent joy to Tim meeting Mary for the first time (again), just as the ways in which they fall - and stay - in love are close to magical. Curtis' films have always used music to great effect, and here he peppers the love story with songs that will move into your heart and stay there, like Ben Folds' The Luckiest and The Waterboys' How Long Will I Love You.But About Time isn't just about a boy and a girl finding each other: it's also about what happens after that, when romance leads to a lifetime spent together, making memories and becoming a family. Tim discovers, to his horror, that his gift cannot shield him from all the low points in life: when he starts having more to lose, the costs of doubling back on his own timeline grow ever larger. It's a point made very effectively when Tim tries to save his beautifully quirky sister Kit-Kat (Lydia Wilson) from the heartbreak and horror that has derailed her life.In many ways, this is Curtis' most personal film: it folds in life lessons and insights about death, loss, family, and treasuring what's extraordinary in even the most ordinary of lives. He seems to suggest that Tim's gift is more of a choice: it can be used in the flashiest of ways, unravelling lives and histories in the clench of a fist, or it can be used to savour all the little things that we take for granted, all the moments that slip by in the rush and bustle of a busy day. Tim's romance with Mary might be the selling point of the film, but it's really his tender, emotional relationship with his dad that will stay with audience members long after the credits roll.If there's anything that doesn't quite work, it's Curtis' deceptively simple notion of time travel. Tim's gift is more plot device than plot point, but it still raises more than a few questions along the way. Does Tim have to re-live his entire life whenever he goes back in time? Why are only the men of the family given this odd, marvellous gift? Isn't there something faintly worrying about men who can completely control the shape and nature of their relationships with the ladies in their lives? About Time breezes swiftly past these concerns, but they lurk disquietingly within the film anyway.Curtis' cast is an unmitigated marvel. Gleeson is a sweetheart, his bumbling warmth adding greatly to Tim's gentle appeal. McAdams shines brightly in a slightly undercooked role, leaving no room for doubt that men would brave the vagaries of time travel for a chance to see her smile. (It's fortunate that her second foray into time-crossed romance is so much more successful than the lamentable The Time Traveller's Wife.) Nighy, meanwhile, all long limbs and rumpled charm, is heartbreakingly lovely as Tim's dad: the father who patiently teaches his son about everything that matters in life and love.A few months ago, Curtis announced his plans to retire as a director after About Time - this would allow him, he said, to take properly to heart the film's message about consciously choosing to enjoy one's life in all its quiet splendour. For fans of Curtis, it's not a complete loss, as he plans to focus on writing and producing and has, in any case, directed only three films in his career. But, on the strengths of the sweetly devastating, unexpectedly accomplished About Time, it's hard not to feel at least a small sense of loss in imagining what might otherwise have been.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Time travel outside of a sci-fi environment.,"About time is exactly the role I'd expect Rachel McAdams to take up. The plot is interesting, it allows for funny, interesting, and complex situations. The setting is nice and very casual. The cinematography is very artsy and it fits well with the acting and general pacing of the film. I would call About Time a sweet romance. The concept of time travel in a romance seems at a glance as if it would diminish the intimacy and humor of such a beautiful genre of movies. Time Travel in this situation is used to create a romance like other romances but it doesn't feel like ""just another rom-com"" it feels new. The concept is also simple and easy for anyone to grasp with ease. The only movie I've seen Bill Nighy really fit in.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Plagerised reworked and dull,"Without doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. Storyline - banal bordering on silly. Every character totally miscast. Please Richard quit while you're ahead and spare us anymore of this twaddle. I loved Four Weddings and Notting Hill. We watch Love Actually every Christmas. Doom all Gleeson is not Hugh Grant - struggling to grasp the concept that this guy is actually a professional actor. Has to be related to someone close to Richard Curtis. Honestly a caterpillar's hips have more talent and charisma. If you want to watch a film about time travel I recommend any of the Narnia films. This is sad, insipid nonsense about people who don't inhabit this planet in any shape or form. Finally, in your next film why not just call Bill Nighy - Bill Nighy. He is incapable of playing anybody but himself. Avoid this movie at all costs. So I've clenched my fists in a dark room and gone back in time to edit this review. Dohmnall Gleeson is the son of Brendan Gleeson -established actor etc. That explains all. He's actor because his Dad is. Difference - his Dad is but he ain't!!!

Disclaimer; this film is terribly dangerous,"This film is funny, moving and genuinely beautiful. It is Richard Curtis at his best, being witty, unabashedly sentimental and altogether English. The England he depicts is rather more beautiful and idiosyncratic and eccentric and charming than anything resembling the real England, but I find it hard to be upset with this depiction when it makes you long to live there, too.However; fair warning. I rarely cry at films, and it's rarer still that I write a review, but I felt that I must for this film so as to share this disclaimer; you will, at best, cry during this film. At worst, you will be ugly sobbing for forty five minutes throughout the entire latter third. I cried so much my entire face was wet; even my forehead, although that should have been impossible.That said, I do highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The biggest tearjerker ever,"About Time is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen in my life. It's so sad, I don't think I could ever watch it again. I couldn't stop bawling the first time around, and I was glad I wasn't in the movie theater causing a disturbance. So, unless you're in the mood for an intense cry, move this film further down on your list.The preview will have you thinking it's a romantic comedy, about Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams's courtship and eventual marriage. It shows them laughing in the rain, running around in an art museum, and sharing intimate moments peppered with laugh lines. Don't be fooled. It's not a romantic comedy. In fact, Domhnall could have remained single during the entire film and the message would have remained the same. It's a story about Domhnall and his father, Bill Nighy, who share a magic do-over power where they can have endless chances to go back and re-live certain days or moments. But there are consequences, which is why the movie is so incredibly sad. For example, if Domhnall doesn't go to a certain restaurant at a certain time, he'll never meet Rachel. If he never meets her, he never marries her, etc. I won't tell you how sad the movie gets, but I'm sure you can imagine. And before you ask, yes, it's infinitely more depressing than The Butterfly Effect. This movie makes The Butterfly Effect look like a Shirley Temple musical.That being said, if you are in dire need of a cry (you're on a detox cleanse or a loved one just died) this the only movie you need to watch. The soundtrack is sentimental and sweet, the script is thoughtful, and Bill Nighy is truly fantastic. He just makes the movie; if we didn't care about him, we wouldn't be using up all our Kleenex.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just need to know that is ""must watching"" movie is all enough. To be honest, after 60 minutes watching, I talked to myself. ""Oh my god, I wasted 60 minutes of my life to watch bullshit love story"". But after that, I don't remember exactly ""when"", maybe after the main actor getting marry. I could not take my mind off the movie. It was very touching at the rest.I don't like the very first 60 minutes, but the rest of the movie was good. Because I love watching movie about the love of people in a family. Which is not the hottest or controversial topic but tender and touching. It's really impressive to watch the man argued himself ""his new born baby"" or ""more times with his father"". Finally, he had to obey the rule of nature.

Another thing I really liked about this film was how quickly it got to the point and didn't linger at the beginning, almost immediately you learn about Tims ability, soon after it then leads you promptly into the main body of the movie.

Lesson #1: All the time traveling in the world can't make someone love you.',"Expect to be in for a jolly good ride if a film is both written and directed by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Love Actually). Add a fine cast of actors, a bit of a kink with time travel (of sorts) and out comes this little British confection perfect for Valentine's Day ‚Äì or any day when an uplifting bit of romantic fluff is needed.The setting for the most part is Cornwall and the film is narrated by 21year old Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) who is awkward with finding a girlfriend and in general unlucky in love, as played out in a rather disastrous New Year's Eve party. But things change when Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, and then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend, playwright Harry (Tom Hollander) from professional disaster, and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. During his life, Tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors, but also in the lives of his relatives and friends.Tim's family is a bit on the loony side and in addition to Bill Nighy as his wondrously gifted father, there is Lindsay Duncan is his mum, Richard Cordery is his space cadet Uncle D and Lydia Wilson is his sister nutty but sweet sister Kit Kat. Margot Robbie, Vanessa Kirby, Will Merrick and Tom Hughes offer excellent cameos. The time travel idea peters out once the film has started but the idea has been planted and helps make this frothy film float. 'We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.'",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Heart-warming tale of Love and Time,"Richard Curtis does it again, delivering yet another quirky story of love, life and the travails of family past and present.The Time Traveller's Wife (also starring Rachel McAdams) also attempted a love story dealing with the effects of the hubby disappearing every once in a while, however the plot here in About Time is much more delicate.We don't have any grand notions of cause and effect, they just happen and you need to let it slide without too much over thinking.All performances are spot on the money, Nighy is sublime as the steady, loving father, Gleeson delivers an understated performance of note, off center, loving yet strong enough not to be sickly. McAdams is used to this role, beautiful, down to earth, funny and caring, she once again delivers.I agree with the previous review, a little too long but it's a minor blip and won't stop you wanting to clench your fists and go back 2 hours to do it all over again.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Less ""Groundhog Day"" and more ""Love Actually""","This is a great example of a movie without real drama. Or rather, without melodrama.I can't quite fit it into any genre because everything is so understated. The acting, the plot, etc- everything has a sort of dulled ""real life"" flow to it. There's no emotional outbursts, no unbelievable comic mishaps (with maybe one or two exceptions), and no real clear ending to the story.It's like we're just watching some guy live out some of his life, and like real life, not a heck of a lot actually *happens* (in a movie sense, anyway).But that's not necessarily a bad thing; the movie's strength is in its characters. I loved the main character, and just about all the supporting characters are enjoyable. They all have a sort of level- headed-ness that is usually omitted for the sake of movie-drama.But therein lies my disappointment with the film- with such a great premise, I wonder why they decided to play it down rather than up? The hook was seemingly made to be an all-out comedy- with the ability to ""undo"" your mistakes or actions, why not let the characters go to extremes? The events of the movie and the character's use of his power remain frustratingly low-key.This film is less Groundhog Day and more Love Actually. And that's fine, I love Love Actually, but if that's the movie you're going to make, why give your character a super-power? The ""gimmick"" is never exploited to its full potential, and despite a smooth script and lovable characters, I was left a little disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Also, I like how the main guy has such good charisma, and Rachel McAdams is great as always. I think it's a movie that leaves you feeling very happy, and feeling happy for the characters.The main thing I took away from this movie is that you should try to live each day trying to appreciate the small good things, even when stress or ordeals may upset you. Yes this sounds very generic, but it really does put perspective on how you should look at life. If you look at each day joyfully and appreciating the small moments, you'll have better days!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The story is about finding happiness, and what you would give up for happiness caused by a certain outcome. It's almost like ""The Notebook"" plus ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" combined, and as Rachel Mcadams is in all three, there's much danger of her being typecast. Or cast only Rachel in time travelling films or don't make the film! Back to the film itself, I think it's a story about an ordinary guy with extraordinary abilities. His realisation at the end is quite good, and it wasn't the ending I was expecting. Though there are many plot holes, just like many other time travel stories, it's still an enjoyable film.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quite boring and predictable,"I'm very surprised to read so many good reviews about this movie, which just reminds me of the beauty of difference of opinion. Nevertheless, I found this movie absolutely boring. Really, very boring indeed. It's just a story of an not interesting every day life with a supposedly deep meaning. I'm sorry, but The Dead Poet Society delivered that same message way better for me. I had no trouble staying awake during that one.I don't remember in recent times ever been so aware of the time passing, because the movie just kept on dragging, and dragging. It felt like a 5 hour movie with nothing memorable. Rachel McAdams is so underused, but then again, the story is rather bland. I see that many people enjoyed the dialogs. I did not find them charming, witty or interesting. I really thought I was going to see a comedy and what I got was a total waste of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It is just perfect,"One of the things that strikes me about this film is how ruined I am by clich√© plots of most movies that set up a nice situation just so they can ruin it and make plot about it. During first two thirds of the movie I was constantly expecting the main character to do something stupid or just unfortunate and that everything nice that was fall apart. The more I waited the more terrified I was, expecting all plot insofar to be a build-up for that one fatal blunder. Then it slowly downed on me that it wasn't going to happen - he was just a normal nice guy with maybe more common sense that most and he did smart but otherwise normal decent human things, and it worked for him perfectly. In the end, everything was perfect and ordinary at the same time. Just perfectly ordinary! Just perfect! It's the best film I ever watched. For me.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A must see,"Recently watched this movie, About Time, which had me yelling bravo! It is about a young Brit who finds out that he can time travel, but only to events that has occurred in his life. Watch the different momentous choices he makes with this new found power. This movie is thought provoking, funny and should be a course of study in the school of life. What would you change if you could? Or should you? What moments do you most cherish? To what extent would you go to save the ones you love? Can you really harness a moment? This movie is well thought out and delivers. It is a life changing tool for those who live in the past or only seek the future. For those who truly understand the beauty of the moment you too will be yelling bravo!!! Catch this film currently running on HBO, pop some corn and curl up in your favorite chair, you are about to enter the enlightenment zone. Enjoy....and let me know if you have seen it.

Not a romantic comedy,"The message in this film is that life is finite but beautiful if you only open up your senses and breathe it in.Although the time travel concept is initially interesting and funny it then tries to deliver a deep and meaningful message but descends into a soppy you can live happy ever after despite tragedy message .
Though clever the film fails to deliver enough laughs and the chemistry between the two main characters isn't to sell the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Richard Curtis masterpiece,"How good is Richard Curtis? In my book, he is pure genius! He inspires me to be a better person.His first masterpiece, Four Weddings and A Funeral, is a roller-coaster ride of comedy and tragedy, packed with outlandish characters and witty lines, but most of all, fun. His second masterpiece, Love Actually, is another magical roller-coaster, but with more emphasis on the theme than on the humour. About Time continues this progression, and it is not a comedy at all, but a wonderful, positive drama about humanity, family, and love; in particular, the love between a father and a son.This is a thoroughly beautiful and intensely moving film. I cried my eyes out throughout the last ten minutes. I think it moved me so much partly because Tim, the lead character, faces many of the same life experiences and choices as I have, and learns lessons with which I can identify. The film is firmly grounded in reality, not fantasy, and how refreshing is that! And the plot is totally original, you can't guess what's about to happen.Domhnall Gleeson is perfect in the leading role, and Bill Nighy is just so wonderfully honest in his role of Dad. The film belongs to these two. My only gripe is that Margot Robbie had such a small part - she is a damn firecracker!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Time Travellers Wife and others?,"This is not a bad film, just not a great film. The Sqiss summed it up in their review perfectly. There's some good stuff in it but it was bloated and even for Richard Curtis too saccharine. It's very close to The Time Travellers Wife in a lot of respects obviously the huge difference being its a comedy rather than a romance. Speaking of which there was very little chemistry between the two leads but there was a great hook between Dad and Son as The Squiss pointed out in his/her review. I think the girls will probably like this more than the boys but its not a complete waste of time just a wasted opportunity as I think it could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More love story then anything else,"Reading the IMDb synopsis on the movie I was intrigued by the concept thinking it might be more sci-fi about time travel. But it turned out this was a minimal ingredient for what turns out to be a human interest story and more so a mushy love story.Not that this is bad necessarily, but I was hoping to see some cool sci- time travel concepts.Over all the main actor seems to pull it off pretty well. And there is a bevy of cute girls with nice jobs as well.If you are male just keep in mind this in more of a movie that you will want to watch with your girlfriend to get in a chick-flick quota..",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thought provoking and emotional,"For a movie to be memorable to me it has to do one thing and one thing only, it has to make me talk to myself. This movie is not the most original thing ever done and a lot of what happens is a big slap in the face to cause and effect. Despite this, I loved it. I identified with the main character and the story, unlike many I watch nowadays, didn't seem rushed. It took its time and as a result felt emotionally impactful(I think I made up a word there). A lot of this is due to the excellent score but, I think, more is due to the excellent writing. Awkward conversations actually felt awkward and fatherly advice came out fatherly. The entire cast was amazing but Bill Nighy in particular has never been more likable. Will this movie be for everyone? Of course not. Did it make me debate character choices out loud with myself? Yes. Yes it did.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best movie i have seen in months,"About time is a fantastic movie. It is a combination of drama, romance and comedy that is not cheesy at all. I could tell that this is going to be a nice movie after i saw the trailer, but instead of being just a mediocre nice movie, it turned out to be one of the best I've seen in months, probably even years. I decided to see about time merely for entertainment, I didn't expect it to be anything other than another cheesy but fun to watch love story. This movie will keep you sitting in your seat smiling and guessing. You think you know whats going to happen next but you actually don't. I enjoyed the plot, narration, characters, settings, basically every little thing about this movie. The story line is just flawless, i cant think of any way to make it better. The characters have this amazing chemistry between each other. What i love most about this movie is that it can somehow turn a fictional story into a story people could actually relate to and learn from. I laughed during the first half, cried during the second half, it was a pleasant movie experience. This movie taught me a lot about life in only two hours. I strongly advice everyone to go see this movie. It's a winner! oh and go see this movie for a date.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Time-travel tale set in the social set of the Sloan-Rangers and Hooray-Henrys.,"A Universal film. Richard Curtis is on familiar territory in this time-travelling rom-com.An Englishman discovers that he can travel in time and uses this to try to get a girl.Those who like the rom-com or time-travel genres will love this film. Director, and Writer, Richard Curtis, has crafted this time-travelling rom-com. It is a natural companion to 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994), and 'Notting Hill' (1999). However, whilst both those films were rated 15, 'Another Time' is rated 12A in the UK. Though there should be no criticism of the film; it is not tame, it is not a kids film, but rather an adult film, for adults, that deals with adult themes. Richard Curtis was the Writer in all three films, but in 'AT' he directs too, unlike the previous two films. Camera work is a little wobbly in earlier shots and some music is a little intrusive. Having said that, the two scenes that really featured music, were both beautifully conceived and filmed.Plot is basic, but to repeat, young man uses time travel to try to get a girl. Some mistakes can be rectified, and futures changed, through the use of time travel. Thus this film is comparable to 'Groundhog Day' (1993). In both films the hero uses time-travel rather selfishly at first, before maturing and using time-travel in a more constructive way. However whilst 'GD' just repeated one day, in 'AT', time-travel is over a longer period of time.Curiously, Andie Macdowall co-starred in 'GD'. It will be remembered that Miss Macdowall was also in the 'FWaaF' Curtis-vehicle. In his two previous films, 'FWaaF' and 'NH', Mr Curtis had an English-gentleman and an American woman meeting in an upper-class environment. This film is again partially set in London as well as out in the country. Again the social-set is very upper class, lots of girls with awfully posh voices, and there is even an American.While the characters are interesting, and even stereo-typical silly things clearly have more going on in their lives than is first thought, the social-set being portrayed is very thin indeed. There has been criticism of Richard Curtis in the past for showing a very limited slice of humanity in previous films. The same applies today with this, his newest film. In a recent interview Mr Curtis said he tried to do an urban-Boston film and realized he couldn't do it, so he went back to what he knew.This is a very good film about the lives of white upper-class liberals, and certainly they will tend to mix with their own kind and set, however it is not acceptable, today, to portray London as a city solely populated by rich whites. There was criticism of the 1999 film 'Notting Hill' for showing Notting Hill as being entirely populated with whites. For the record, Notting Hill has been a very diverse multi-cultural and multi-racial area, for decades, as has been much of London. The Notting Hill Carnival is a vast celebration of Caribbean people and their culture. London also has many, many, working-class people too. Sadly, none of these groups feature in Richard Curtis films at all, except perhaps as menial servers.You would have thought that fourteen years after 'Notting Hill' that Mr Curtis would have given some thought to writing parts for people of colour and working-class people. Sadly not. Sadly, Mr Curtis has learnt nothing in all these years. He is truly colour-blind. He sees no-one else in his rich white world. This reviewer thought criticism of Richard Curtis's earlier films, for being too rich and white, was a bit harsh. Sadly, I now feel that criticism has not been harsh enough. It is a serious flaw of this film, the writing of it, the casting of it, that once again it inhabits an unreal rich white world, that only exists in the head of Richard Curtis.Having said all that however, this is a great film. Like his previous films, again here Mr Curtis gives us once again a beautiful rom-com. The time-travel thing is really just a plot device. The core of this film is about relationships. All sorts of relationships, but boy-meets-girl stuff is of course the central core of this film. From start to end we see a bevy of beautiful babes. So too does our hero. He can time-travel to change the past, change the way he interacts with a girl. For this reviewer, the first time was the best and sweetest, just perfect. However as time goes by life gets more complicated and so does the time travel. As the film progresses our hero faces decisions with great consequences. Ordinary mistakes and time-travel mistakes could have devastating consequences. Viewers will watch tensely as decisions are made. As our time-travel hero tries to learn how to live every day, so too may we. The time-travel theme is not the most important theme, so do not worry about it, accept, don't question, just enjoy a film who's central theme is love.A great supporting cast fill the characters in this film with real life. Rachel McAdams is a real stand out as one of the girls who the time-traveller meets. Domhnall Gleeson is the time-traveller and he too totally convinces as he matures through this film.If you liked 'Four Weddings' and 'Notting Hill', as well as 'Groundhog', and even enjoyed the romantic elements in 'Timecop' (1994), then this is the film for you. Highly recommended. 9/10.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brochure for the perfect life,"One friend of mine describes Curtis as the Marmite man - you either love him or hate him. Another friend can rant about the failings of Love Actually for so long that I start to replay Shallow Grave in my head and recast him as the poor lodger.This is Love Actually mark 2. The familiar Curtis characters, gentle English wit and the ain't life grand message, are all present and correct. The only thing missing is Hugh Grant. But Domhall does a lovely impersonation.Everything was set up perfectly for a great story, one which shows that even with the chance to redo any moment, life goes its own way. Unfortunately Richard never took the opportunity to tell us a story. Instead he delivers one man's life collated in delightful Kodak moments - the kind of life I am sure many a man would have like to have, certainly most of their girlfriends would like to believe so. We have idyllic childhood, bohemian family, endearing romance, with barely a hiccup to mar his perfect existence as the years slide by.Richard Curtis has said this is his last film and perhaps it is best it is. If he cannot bring himself to write even one day of rain and screaming children into his character's life, does he really have anything to say that a John Lewis ad can't do in a fraction of the time?Enjoy on a rainy day, take someone you can curl up with, while the rose coloured glasses are still on and see the life you'd like to imagine you might have unfold.

Worn out Genre,"I had great expectations for this film and went to its first showing (10:25am) on opening day. To my surprise, many people were at the showing.Overall, I was disappointed, but found Domhnall Gleeson's skill and charm in the leading role the most enjoyable element of this film. But the movie itself felt more like a series of skits. Maybe the skit-like feel supported the central theme of this movie (as with most time-travel movies), namely: live for today, relish every moment. Maybe I just feel like the genre is really worn-out, with not much fresh to offer. I did leave the theater with that ""tell my wife and children how much I love them everyday, every moment"" sort of feeling, but only because I'm extremely sentimental anyway, and need very little to elicit that emotion.The movie was cast pretty well, but I think Rachel McAdams, at 35, is at the end of her cast-as-a-twenty-something girl. Even bangs/fringe couldn't make me believe it. The film was worth seeing, but save your money and see it on DVD. No rush to see it right away, or need to see it on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An interesting take on the time travel/Rom-com... I liked it!...,"I have to admit I enjoyed this one; yes, they do make certain rules about time travel and then immediately break them, but that's not what the story is about. And yes, it is about well off white people, but again, if I wanted a film that was politically correct and socially aware I don't think I'd have Richard Curtis write it. No, this was pure escapism for me and I happily went along for the ride. Great performances all round, but the stand-out for me was Bill Nighy; he really nailed the part of the dad for me. I have to say I liked the soundtrack as well with many contemporary tunes littered along the way. So it made me laugh and I even shed a tear towards the end and there's not many films can do that. I admit I'm a bit of a sucker for the occasional Rom-Com and this one had just the right ingredients for me.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.2/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but felt a little let down","I'm a guy who really loves Love Actually. As such, I had high expectations for this film. This is a good film, but I'm not sure it quite crosses the threshold for greatness.Love Actually did a great job of showing different kinds of love--platonic, familial, romantic. About Time also does this well, with a particular focus on family bonds. Tim's relationship with his dad is the most well-developed in the movie, and it's fantastic to watch. I was even close to tears a few times.My one issue, though, is that Mary, the love of Tim's life, is underdeveloped as a character. The movie spends a lot of time telling us how much he loves her, and doesn't really spend much time telling us *why* he loves her--she's pretty much just a stock, cutesy Rachel McAdams character, without any expressed goals, ambitions, or quirks. We don't have this problem with the other characters--their development is fairly proportional to their importance to Tim. And so, one of the major plot lines falls a bit flat.Ultimately, though, this was still worth seeing. The father-son story makes the movie by itself, and there's more to the story than just those to. I just wish it had balanced those bits with the romantic element better.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cute, but didn't do it for me.","First of all, I'd like to say that I really like romantic dramas and the topics this movie covers, but I still have a few reasons why this movie didn't really do it for me. I wouldn't say it was bad, but it definitely was too long, it should have been half an hour long and it wouldn't have felt this drawling. I didn't feel anything special about the acting, it felt me wanting a little more drama. I also didn't really get the message, it was, in my opinion, really subtly delivered and maybe a bit weak. I felt something missing after watching it, like it was incomplete and unfinished. In my eyes it's a cute little story but nothing more, maybe worth to once watch but it definitely won't be my favorite.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great movie about time travel that actually teaches something about it,"The story really makes good use of its long two-hour duration and actually teaches something about the thing which until now seems to be impossible, time travel. The two acts that the movie is divided into actually tell two different kind of focus, where at the first act Tim is actually hard at accepting things and always does his best to rewind time and mend things, even to the tiniest bit of detail. But on the second act, the thing with his father teaches Tim to let go of his control and accept life as is and enjoy it. This movie doesn't concern with all those complex and complicated physics or philosophy surrounding time travel, thus making the movie feels as the lightest among all other time travel movies. What makes me like this movie even more is the tiniest bit of biblical reference Tim's Dad said to Tim. This makes him a great and exemplary character for not following the footsteps of his male bloodlines that fell to the traps of money and other worldly obsessions. The acting overall feels good, especially as the movie makes its way onto the second act where we see Bill Nighy's acting really supports Domnhall Gleeson in making the screenplay to feel more alive. Rachel McAdams adds nicely to the movie, but I think Bill Nighy's acting really steals the spotlight at the second act.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
About Time,"I don't know what is it with this new movies, they really got bad, so few moves are actually good. The 90's and early 2000's are the best era for movies.

It gets really boring as it continues on, but there are no big plot twists, nothing that makes you not be able to pause it and watch it again... in a week, or a year. So, I am sorry, but this movies should really have been thought out better. It resembles the movie Time traveler's wife, they even used the same actress, but it is not as good.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Some movies are not just MOVIES.,"This movie or I should say a ""happy feeling"" will leave you gleeful and joyous at the end. I wished this movie to never and just keep on going and make us feel more humane and more lovable. It has been by far the most touching story written by Richard Curtis and he has portrayed love on-screen with a very different, new and mesmerizing prospective. Rachel McAdams was once again perfectly suited for the role and played her part with perfection and heart but Domhnall Gleeson makes you live all sorts of emotions. The story is very different from other stories and the fantasy in it made it more wonderful to watch it. A different sort of drama. Well, I would say that LOVE is eternal and has different forms through which you can deluge to the ones you Love. A wonderful movie to watch in the Winters.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well done on time traveling love stories!,"In order for love stories to be successful in my experience they have to be pretty depressing, at least a huge struggle a person has to go through and come out still in love or just survive it. This IS NOT one of those stories, yet its still a great story about love and time travel without so much heartache (in my opinion). Very well done for that to Richard Curtis who was writer and director. I didn't think a movie like this was possible, i love that you have proved me wrong in this. I solute you and from now on i will follow your work closely. I thought for sure after looking at the previews and seeing Rachel Mcadams this was going to be a depressing and yet mesmerizing love story...like all the others. If you're like me looking for a movie that's just good from beginning to end where you learn lessons about love and loss without completely making every mistake the first time, instead just learning how to go through them the right way. This movie is the movie for you. 9 out of ten...just because? i save the 10s i guess for movies that i think will be remembered throughout time. Even though this movie is extremely well done its another story about love, loss and time travel. It doesn't stand out as much to other people as it did to me i guess so -1 for that. Because everyone else doesn't realize there isn't another love story this well done without making you completely heartbroken first. This movie holds is own with all of them without putting you through that! so just enjoy a good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
more than a romantic movie,"About Time is a nice surprise. For the first minutes i thought i was watching another sappy, mushy wushy romance movie, but this movie is more than that.It's a movie about family, the relationship about father (Bill Nighy is exceptional as always) and son. The last scene is particularly touching but i won't go into that, i'll let the viewer decideThe soundtrack is excellent and it goes well with the movie.I give this an 8.5/10 only because i think the chemistry between Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel MacAdams is not the best, but you quickly let that go as soon as the story develops.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Recognisable Curtis, but still pleasant to follow","Richard Curtis is a sign of certain quality in the British cinema, even in the event of recurrent approaches, scenes and topics, e.g. laugh between tears, ups and downs in romance, giggling moments amidst ""serious"" scenes, colourful supporting characters, and last but not least - a wedding scene... Anyhow, there is always a new angle, and in spite of some disharmony and flaws in the plot, About Time is definitely another ""well-done"" creation, with fine performances even in supporting roles (particularly Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, Rachel McAdams as Mary, Bill Nighy as Dad, Tom Hollander as Harry).The role of sci-fi was not too big (good for me :)), so the film is apparently not for genuine fantasy and fiction lovers, and the amount of big laugh opportunities is lower than e.g. Four Wedding and a Funeral, and Love Actually... Bearing that in mind, I am sure that if you have liked Curtis' concepts, you will have a pleasant and warm-hearted 2 hours in front of TV screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One day,he is taught that men of his family can travel in time by his father. He try to change his mistake returning the past. Also,he can get a girlfriend and marry her. Of course, he challenged many times. The scenes are funny, we can laugh at that because they seem as if NG scenes. I think he is cunning, but he finally notices the importance of days.

"Worth watching, but it wasn't as good as I expected","I'd probably have to give this 6 out of 10 (I downgraded it from a 7 after further consideration). Girls will probably like this somewhat more than men, but it's not entirely a chick flick. I really enjoyed Love Actually, and I love Rachel McAdams (what guy wouldn't), so coupled with the generally very good reviews I expected to really like this.The movie is certainly worth seeing and I'm sure some will like it more than others, but overall I just felt like it definitely didn't reach its potential, due in large part to a very poor soundtrack and musical score. I'm 43 and I like a very broad range of music, but I can only think of one song in the entire movie that I was even familiar (""Friday I'm In Love"" by the Cure). Because it played early in the movie and it's a great song, and also because Love Actually had a great soundtrack, I was expecting a lot more. Everybody knows a good score and/or a good soundtrack can make or break a movie, and for me at least, this was just one of those movies where it largely broke it.I'm guessing I wasn't alone in being somewhat disappointed by the movie, since we were literally the ONLY two people in the theater for a 10:20PM showing in a medium sized Southern California town. That's a little bit late, but certainly not so late that the theater should've been 100% empty. I think I'd have to recommend this one for a Redbox rental when it comes out in 6 months rather than overpaying to see it at the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Seriously excellent film,"My husband and I loved this film. We were both in tears at the end and found it highly relatable for different reasons.

The movie is seriously a ""must-watch"" for anyone that has ever found himself not appreciating the wonders in their own lives. It's truly beautiful in its complexity, and I highly recommend the movie. I love this movie and it totally grasps the human part without being weird. The two leads are a fabulous wonderful couple, which is a lovely thing to see nowadays since that is rare.

Tim has the power of transferring his own awkwardness to the plot,"This film failed it seriously. It's below mediocre. Were it shorter, I'd think it would be a pilot episode of a sitcom that didn't make it. The time-travel is a gimmick that is explored ad nauseam. Also, it is more paradoxal than the average sci-fi time travel, to the point one just gives up trying to understand the timeline logic at a given time in the film. The ""rules"" of time travel posed by Tim's father were broken several times, and at a given time it even seems to have a ""cancel"" button, making Tim potentially an immortal lord of life and death... that always acts as silly as a teenager. I though the movie would end and the credits would roll several times. Whenever that happens in a rom-com, you can bet the it fails at something, even if you happen to like the individual situations. These seem to have been glued together, as the movie just seems to be lingering about ""Tim, love and life"". It could go on and on until either Tim dies of old age or the audience of boredom... or it could be a sitcom. The jokes are not funny. It's awkward. Tim himself is awkward and time travel gives him the chances not to be awkward with this UNBREAKABLE TIME-TRAVEL RULE: he transfers his awkwardness to the movie as he travels. By the end of the movie, Tim has erased his own awkwardness by transferring it to the plot.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the music does it,"You've already read what the story is about so I wont bore you with the details.. I'll go straight to the point, the music! This is an awesome comedy romance story but what intrigued me the most was the music (have actually been playing most of the songs over and over on my phone since). The music includes pop, soft rock, r&b, soul from people like the killers, sexsmith, winehouse, T.A.T.U coming at just the right moments in the movie. A few of the songs have actually been redone with an 'about time' version (incl the theme song) and the result is very good! The music i think is what brings out the 'moments' in this movie that have resulted in Curtis' work ending up being awesome.. Take the funny 'el-mondo' song that Tim decides would be the main song for his wedding (dint think Mary would agree to it but alas..!) So watch the movie, listen to the music and some of it might actually end up growing on you..",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant film (if you actually get what it's about),"The main reason I'm writing this review is due to the fact that most of the negative reviewers on IMDb seem to have missed the point of this film entirely. I'm not going to go into much detail as I think the film speaks for itself (and I hate it when people put spoilers in their reviews).It's not a romantic comedy as most would have you believe. It's a comedy/drama that revolves around the relationship between a father and son. The romantic themes are just a small part of this great film.Once you stop thinking of it as a rom-com you will see the brilliance of it all. It's not the greatest film of all time, it's not the prettiest, the funniest or the best written.What it is is a heartfelt tale of a father/son relationship. The time travel elements are just a plot device, the romance, just a plot device. It's laugh out loud funny in spots and tear-jerking in others. It's well written, but still light and breezy when it needs to be.Look past the surface of this film and feel the emotion that these fine actors bring to the screen. Let go and just enjoy it for what it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Leaves you thinking...powerful,This film is completely underrated. I joined IMDb to rate this movie because I think the message is so powerful. My mom had highly recommended this movie months ago and I only watched it because she was speaking so highly of it. As soon as I heard the word time travel I had no interest in seeing the film but trusting her I watched it anyway. As other reviewers have mentioned the common clich√©s of time travel movies are skipped over. I wish I had known this because I could have enjoyed the film even more instead of waiting to hate the movie and waiting to confirm that I hate all time travel movies. This movie brought me to sobbing tears in the best way possible. It leaves me thinking about my own life and crying now as I think back to some of the more powerful scenes in the movie. There are flaws in the time travel that made me feel a bit uneasy so be warned that if you like a flawless movie with a story that doesn't overlook a single detail you may be slightly frustrated. I won't reduce my rating though because I loved the movie so much.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A feel good movie,"If you are looking to watch a feel good movie, without being too critical on the plot, you should definitely watch this film. Best of all, the accompanied soundtrack that goes along the show is awesome to say the least. All the songs fits perfectly and beautifully into each scenes.The main gist of the show tells that ability to time travel to relive and right the wrongs of your life. This plot may be overly used in many films but it has slanted to a more family love - father's love mostly - directions which is not often seen in most travel-back-in-time movies. The protagonist of the show is a young men who learned from his father one day that the all men in the family have the ability to time travel. So went to the adventures of his time travels, which his main motivation at first is finding the love of his life. It is wonderfully played out when he manages to find the girl he love and using the time travel ability, going back in time to right any wrong, to ensure the ideal outcome. All is well at this moment in this movie - which had done real well focusing on his love life and then fatherhood life. Then his sister's misfortune came in and the strange explanations on the adverse effects of time travel to change some outcome does not really gel too well with the general flow of the film. The later part of the show - last 30 mins, seems to be losing the grip, but a meaningful ending with the father ensures a reasonable finish to the end.Some hiccups for this movie, but the feel good factor persist throughout the movie, and I certainly did not regret watching this on a Saturday night, feeling good throughout the show.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Film Review,"I'm sure there are many who sneered at Richard Curtis's recent movie called About Time for its simplicity and melancholy but I was not one of them. Rather than sneer as others have done, I took into account his previous work such as Notting Hill and Bridget Jones and therefore expected nothing more than a simple feel good British rom-com. If I wanted to see more of a complex film than I would of opted for the works of James Cameron for example, or generally a director of a entirely different mind who is talented in other respects. The fault lies not within the film itself but within those members of the audience who are trying to find a greater meaning than intended, even the trailer makes About Time reminiscent of Richard Curtis's other films as we see a romance blossom between Tim and Marry . So my question is if you are not a fan of the heart-warming feel good British rom-com then why see it in the first place and criticise it for being exactly this afterwards?If you take the film for precisely what it is and nothing more than I can find little to criticise. The film of course had all the characteristics of your typical British rom-com with Tim Lake the hopeless romantic, the numerous laugh-out-loud moments but what I consider it to have more than any of his other films is emotion. Rather than it simply being about finding that special someone, it is about the moments we all take for granted as we too like Tim are all at fault of being overly consumed in the hustle, bustle of everyday life. This leaves little time to appreciate each and every moment, each and every exchange with our loved ones and as we along with Tim learn the importance and beauty in doing so, our heartstrings are played like a violin. Once you put what is likely considered as 'naff' to the side, this is a film that will make you tearful to say the least unless you have a heart of stone and it is this I praise About Time for, its ability to pull at the heartstrings to such an extent. I expect after seeing the trailer you may not think a hanky is in need but believe me you really don't want to be without one.To be fair I would not overly praise Richard Curtis but I find it difficult to dispute his films are exactly what they say on the tin and I know I am not alone in having those moments where all I want to do is sit down, watch a nice, heart-warming film to escape from the drudgery of everyday life. In these moments, despite its naffness About Time and films like it do have a place within all of our hearts, however much some try and dispute this. So why should this film not be praised for offering us this escape and capturing the beauty of life that we allow to pass us by?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Real 'Feel Good' Movie,"What do you want from a 'Feel Good' movie?
simple - ""You should Feel Good"" after watching it. That is exactly the movie ""About Time"" gave me.Believe it or not, it is a movie about Time Travel. But it never felt like a sci-fi film at all. it is about love and relationships.
The love of a father and son, Love of a couple, Love of a brother and in short- the story of some warm and loving people. The story of a young man who is not an 'Alpha male' like a regular movie hero. He is sensitive, emotional and shy like most of us. So the character feels so connected to me.
The movie Shows his beautiful family and a beautiful romantic relationship which made me feel to have that in my life too.More than a movie it was a beautiful experience which made a lasting 'feel good' feeling. If you have some time for love and care and some soft emotions of life, then watch it with your heart, you will feel good and positive.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Lots of love, not much else going on","About Time stars Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a socially awkward young adult who finds out he can travel in time (within his own past) and decides to use his powers to find love. The target of his pursuits is the also somewhat awkward Mary (Rachel McAdams). There are definitely some issues regarding the specific mechanics of the time travel, but it is not a big issue, since this is a romantic comedy with time travel elements and not a sci-fi film about time travel. It seems that the film will be a sort of self-induced Groundhog Day with repeated attempts to make Mary fall in love with Tim. Surprisingly, the time travel mechanic is not used much. In the second half of the film it is only used two or three times.This film is a romantic comedy, meaning it has to check two important boxes: romance and comedy. There is definitely chemistry between the leads. Tim and Mary are very similar: they are both a bit socially awkward, shy, but also very witty. The dialogue between them highlights their similarities and feels very real. Romance: check. The dialogue in the film overall is fantastic, with its British dry wit. Contributing greatly to the comedy are the supporting characters surrounding Tim and Mary like Tim's quirky free-spirited sister or his bitter playwright of a landlord. The scenes between Tim and his father (Bill Nighy) are some of the best in the film. Every character is unique and quirky almost to a fault. Comedy: check Where the movie fails, however, is the plot and plot structure, which is unfortunate considering the interesting concept. A tried and true format for films is to have an overarching conflict that the protagonist tries to solve throughout the film with many obstacles along the way. This keeps the audience invested in every scene. This film does not do that, rather is an episodic series of minor conflicts. There are a scene or two of conflict introduction, then a scene of the conflict being resolved, and then a scene or two of just Tim and Mary just being in love, repeat. The conflicts rarely involve Tim and Mary's relationship at all. For better or for worse it isn't the incredibly formulaic romantic comedy plot structure and on paper this format actually makes sense in keeping with the themes of the film ‚Äì living life and appreciating life's ups and downs. But this does not translate to screen well. The lack of central tension results in boredom. Also, it means there isn't much of a character arc to Tim. Therefore, when the movie ends, it just sort of happens.Speaking of the ending, the similarity between this film and Richard Curtis' earlier success Love Actually (2003) is very noticeable. Firstly, the ending of About Time is stylistically identical to the opening of Love Actually, complete with a disembodied voice talking about life and love over shots of random residence of London. The plot missteps can also be traced to the 2003 film. Love Actually is an ensemble comedy with each character having their own conflict and resolution. Lacking one central conflict it works in that film because there is no central protagonist. About Time, on the other hand, is a single protagonist film with a multi-protagonist film structure.Overall the film is enjoyable despite its shortcomings. There are plenty of embarrassing and hilarious situations that Tim finds himself in. And for those looking for romance, Tim and Mary's relationship is exactly what you want. But the film could've been so much more, with a better structure to the plot and better use of the under-utilized time travel aspect.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could have been better.,"This film follows along the same formulaic avenues of other Curtis films, and seemingly has lots of characters that have been tweaked a little and dropped in here. The natty, slightly crazy Sister for example.And therein lies the problem, the film is devoid of imagination. Set in a chocolate box version of London, it basically follows an all too familiar path his films have taken in the past; you know that at some point the characters will have to face a dark moment, the trouble is that even at the darkest point, it's just not that dark and not that interesting. And so this does impact even more on the story and alas makes the film seem really long, when it should hurtle through. Some scenes have no value at all and you wonder why they are there, you could have cut half an hour off this and it would have been a lot better.The acting overall is excellent and the cast, as you would expect top class, with Bill Nighy the stand out for me, just great to watch. And of course the two leads have very good chemistry, it's really hard to believe this is Hux from the terrible Last Jedi, well done Ruin Johnson.There were opportunities here to be riskier with the characters to take chances and create more situations of genuine jeopardy and raise the stakes.
Alas the characters pretty much run according to type, and the story carries on it's all to unadventurous stroll through life.I feel the genius of Four Weddings (apart from Andie Mcdowell) was that it had some great little comedy moments, moments you never forget, coupled with the sadness of death and the characters reaction to this. Sadly this film never goes to those heights, when it really should have.So, really a missed opportunity.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

(not that I don't love her, but one has to admit). For me, the time travel thing wasn't even the main topic of the movie, it was just a resource used to tell you how the beautiful things in life are the ones we pass by, lots of times, unseen. It reminded me how I felt after watching Le fabuleux destin d'Am√©lie Poulain. I'm definitely adding this one to my ""wanna feel happy"" list.

Best time-altering film since 'Groundhog Day',"Time travel is one of the more hit-or-miss story conceits in film; it's certain to get people's attention, but almost as certain to expose the film to a barrage of criticism related to logic and the butterfly effect. In the hands of filmmaker Richard Curtis, however, today's finest purveyor of charming little films (""Love, Actually,"" ""Pirate Radio"" among other notable writing credits), time travel gets personal.Whereas so many movies use time travel for exploitative comedic purposes (""Hot Tub Time Machine""), ""About Time"" more accurately represents what someone would actually use time travel for in their personal life. Time travel doesn't completely take hold of the story; it's simply the key player in main character Tim's (Domhnall Gleeson) quest for romance.Like the best of us, Tim has a penchant for fudging things up the first time. So when his father (Billy Nighy) reveals the men in their family can time travel to different points throughout their lifetime (except the yet-lived future), he takes advantage of correcting a number of social missteps, such as kissing a girl a New Year's Eve party. When the jaw- dropping gorgeous Charlotte (Margot Robbie) stays at their Cornwall home for the summer, Tim soon learns that time travel only goes so far in swaying someone's feelings. He moves to London to pursue law in the fall, where he endeavors to at last find a girlfriend, and he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams).If it doesn't sound like ""About Time"" has a compelling plot, that's because it doesn't. Yet it doesn't suck either. That's how brilliant a writer Curtis is, slapping dumb-looking smiles and movie-watchers' faces with clever dialogue, humorous scenarios and compelling romance. McAdams, unquestionably one of the best the romance genre has ever seen, runs away with this material, which she simply couldn't do in films such as, quite appropriately, ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" Gleeson also fits perfectly with Curtis' style; he's humorous, awkward and charming all at the same time.Unlike many who watch this film will be lead to believe, the movie is not about Tim's pursuit of Mary. It's not a two-hour version of the sequence in ""Groundhog Day"" in which Bill Murray's Phil Connors attempts to use ""time travel"" to perfectly woo Andie MacDowell's Rita through a series of corrected screw-ups. The narrative scope of ""About Time"" is much larger in terms of chronology, spanning the entirety of Tim's young adulthood. In fact, three- quarters of the way in, it's not even about Tim and Mary's romance at all.Eventually, ""About Time"" becomes about the challenges of living life, enduring the bad and appreciating the good, and what the ability to time travel would really teach us about living day to day and treasuring the present. An expected theme and conclusion indeed, but this final section gets a little long and tiresome without any riveting conflict. Still, Curtis has crafted characters we connect with strongly enough to hold up this last leg of his film.All that said, it's easy to poke holes in the logic of the time travel in ""About Time,"" but the concept makes enough sense that it's not too distracting and you can still enjoy the characters, the romance and the lessons learned. Curtis might not be one of the greatest filmmakers working, but he understands what it takes to elevate a romantic comedy from the rest of the cheesy pack, and that takes tremendous skill.~Steven CThanks for reading!

I don't like watching this film ......,"....because each time I watch it, I' I'm a blubbering wreck totally immersed in the belief of love ,kindness and wanting to make the world a better place. Richard Curtis really GETS people , with their ordinaryness, flaws and capacity to love. He draws rich characterisation from the story of Tim following the male family footsteps of Time Travel. You'd think it a preposterous storyline but it's given great heart and sentiment. All the actors are wonderful but a special mention for the understated joy of Bill Nighy as Tim's dad . Their relationship has me in tears each time I watch. There's plenty of laughs too as Tim attempts to woo Mary ! In my book this is Richard Curtis's finest hour ! A must see .",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A more wholesome but less entertaining Groundhog Day,"Whenever a director makes a time travel story, there would be inevitable comparisons to Harold Raims classic and groundbreaking 1993 film Groundhog Day. About Time, perhaps Richard Curtis' most sincere(and probably best) film, is a sort of repeat of Raims 1993 classic, only done more sentimental and of course less funnily. Just as a foreword: I do not think About Time is as enjoyable as Groundhog Day, nor is it as charmingly acted. But the two are quite different movies, and as something more serious(but still sweet), About Time succeeds. About Time is firstly different in that it is not exactly a romcom- while the focus of the film is on Domhall Gleesons Tim and Rachel McAdams' Mary, there is a great deal of screen time devoted to the subplot involving Tim and his family. This is a clever move by Curtis because a full two hours devoted to only two characters would be grating, overlong, and trite. With this romcom- family drama blend, there is a significant amount of heartwarming, tender, sweet moments which is bound to charm the audience and retain their attention. Curtis has also succeeded in picking the right actors to carry this story. I can find no fault in any of the performances by the talented cast; they are all uniformly outstanding. Not that the material is ever particularly weighty, but it still is rare to see faultless performances by all cast members, Domhall Gleesons and Rachel McAdams in particular are excellently charming, sharing exquisite chemistry. Bill Nighy also does superb work as a loving, wise father with great appeal. In fact, the entire cast is populated by eminently likeable and endearing characters, and Curtis deserves credit for eschewing the oft followed trope of inventing artificial, contrived hurdles, whether in plot or through an antagonist. Another aspect I liked about the film is that it has a fluid, natural pace, which keeps audiences interested because of unexpected developments in plot. Of course, Curtis enjoys making sugary films, and this film may be overly saccharine for some. The film feels like A fairy tale- there are no arguments between characters, and London is filmed gorgeously(though rather idealistically). But for me this sweetness is balanced well by the bitter consequences of the plot- having spent considerable screen time building up our affection for Tim's father, the movie closes with a bittersweet, though optimistic ending. Besides, if viewers want a realistic, gritty depiction of everyday life in the movies they watch, why not pop on a documentary. Movies are there to tell a story- it can be beautiful, it can be grim, it can be sentimental, it can be sweet, but it cannot be uninteresting, it cannot be boring, it cannot be unenjoyable. With its unashamed charm and heartwarming wholesomeness, I can find few happier ways to enjoy 2 hours than watching Richard Curtis' About Time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My rating: 8,"One of those movies that makes me begin writing while it is not over yet. A movie that I was told of from a very good and beautiful person. A movie, in contrast of all other movies coming from the big screen, that can not receive low rating. There should be more like it even if they are strongly idealistic.The protagonist had a poster of ""Amelie"" (very good one too) in his room and I hope that it was his sister's room. If you know what I mean. And what happened with this guy he never grew old ‚Äì obviously that is the meaning, we have to be more what we are in our best moments.Modest at first sight, this movie showed the important things in life and it reminded us that we always can be more good, we have to bet on the positive and graduating in life, that there are moments which we have only once in our lifetime and we should be gentle with the similar moments to them every time when they happen, to notice the little things in life, that we have to try to make our ordinary days extraordinary.

Fresh look at young adults making life changing decisions,"I watched this movie with my young teen daughter who is just discovering how clueless and well-meaning the young men in her life are. There is a freshness and charm about allowing a young man to bumble through his relationships and life trying again, and again, to learn life's lessons about choosing the right words and deeds to carry out his good intentions. Wouldn't we all like to have a second or third take on some of the key scenes in our teens and twenties? The women in the film do revolve around the men. But they are more than cheerleaders. They have depth and love and autonomy. Finally, the father/son relationship is worth the price of the ticket. Our sons and brothers and fathers need honest, bumbling, believable film role models to help them forgive themselves and love each other. This film accomplishes that.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of the most beautiful romantic movie i have ever watched,"This movie was releases in 2013 but somehow i never heard of this movie from any of my friends who loves western cinema. Until few days back i just wanted to see a random romantic drama and found out this movie on some IMDb list. I watched this movie and i just loved it. Everything was so good about this movie. Its not just about romance but also a family drama and the journey from a careless boy to a responsible man. this movie portrait various relations in a very unique way. brother-sister, boyfriend- girlfriend, friendship and my most fav father-son relationship. Although the main feature of this movie is time traveling but focus was mainly on portraying the journey of each characters. The lead actor of the movie was outstanding, he made the character as if of his own. And all the other characters whether it was lead actors father, uncle, mother, sister, wife, friends was all perfect. The direction, the cinematography, music was A+ but the best part was DIALOGUES. In the end I would like to say it is he movie which you would like to watch again and again over the period of time, its not absolutely perfect but you wont even imagine to change anything in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"About time, about us...","Too many people wrote far more interesting reviews that I would. I can only tell you I cried a river over this movie, just lying by my 10-month daughter, watching her sleep placidly, softly, peacefully, unaware of the outer world. This movie is about us and the way we see hours, minutes, seconds wasted away and how little do we care about living and, most of all, perceiving those around us: family, friends, even strangers. There's a whole world beyond our noses going unnoticed to us... just because we are too busy doing things that may not make us completely (or even slightly) happy. Not for an Oscar but cares. Little precious jewels have to be minimal, ethereal. Just like this movie: small but significant. Yeah, right, take your tissues. You will desperately and happily need them.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved this movie!!,"I adored this movie. I'm not sure why people didn't enjoy it. I found it to be Richard Curtis's best work so far. So much heart and soul, stark reality, pain and love. He captured how we should all be and not allow the stresses of our lives to keep us from enjoying what is truly important to us. It is well acted. I laughed and cried. The beach scene was just a tearjerker and I rarely cry at movies. The scene where he discovers that Posy wouldn't have been born and the beach scene were my favorite. Bill Nighy is wonderful in this movie. Rachel McAdams has such depth as an actress, she can really draw you in and portrays her characters with her ability to laugh so deeply that she is just adorable. How can anyone not like her? Plus Domhall Gleeson was wonderful as Tim. As with Love Actually, this move was wonderfully cast. I don't get too upset with far fetched movies like The Lake House or like this one, it's a movie, it's an escape. I don't understand why people want to write reviews how the time travel aspect doesn't make sense. Most movies don't make logical sense. Look at Star Wars, everyone loved that movie but was it possible? Who cares, it's a movie. It's a two hour break from the stress in your life. I adore Richard Curtis and I really think this movie is wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Movie of 2013,"A Rom Com with Time Travel! Or so I thought, and clearly, why, ever would any self- respecting male watch a romantic comedy with time travel? That's why I did not watch this movie in the theater. Turns out that was a huge mistake - I missed the best movie of 2013.This film has a very clear, simple, and truthful message. What sets it apart is how it's making its point - in the most elegant, beautiful way possible.The premise is simple - what if you had the ability to do anything over again? And again? As many times as you want, until you're happy with it? What would you do? The movie proceeds to explore this question and it finds an unexpected, entirely beautiful conclusion. On the surface it's an entertaining ride watching a young man grow up - if it was just that it would still be better than most ""romantic"" movies out there: It's funny, it doesn't take itself too seriously, it's clever. But on a secondary level it contains a deeper meaning, and that makes it stand out and puts it up there with the best movies I've seen.PS: How this can have an average of 7.x is beyond me. The only explanation is that maybe part of the audience just doesn't get it, or isn't ready?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the Rom-Com you expected!,"T's up there with the British Rom-Coms we all know and love, but it has an added Sci-Fi twist that sets it apart for me.Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams are immensely likable leads and superb in their roles and Bill Nighy and Lydia Wilson provide huge heart to it.It's fun, funny, tender, heartbreaking and a nice easy watch. Michelle disliked it but I'm not surprised at that. It just made me enjoy making her watch it even more.A really enjoyable 15/20, you might well laugh and cry or if you're Shell get bored.

The performance from Domhnall Gleeson was unexpected but truthful and you can't help but relate to his character.

The Best written & directed Slice of Life Movie I've probably ever seen.,"Film making is just getting to be such a precision art in the digital age. This movie gets the highest marks for originality. Do not sit down to watch this movie thinking that you are watching one of those worn out plots that you have seen before. There are a handful of plot twists that are flawless, subtle, and unguessable, which speak to the deepest heart of us all as human beings ..If the originality doesn't win you over and take you for a delightful little movie viewing ride, the flawless writing and eye for detail as directed will certainly earn your respect.This movie belongs in the ""artsy"" class of movies because of it's writing, but, it achieves something not usually seen in an ""artsy"" movie. It is mainstream quality, blockbuster quality, a superb date film, a wonderful family film, and something that possibly has the power to uplift even the most stubborn of us ..It achieves all of that without ever being trite, corny, or even unbelievable.

One of the best romantic and family relations movie that i saw in my life,"I like movies. I saw a lot of movies. I love my dad, and he's still alive. This movie touched me very deeply on how I think about my own life.So simple but so deep, incredible!!! And if you have a difficult relation with your dad, I encourage you to watch it. the acting is so natural, and the usual life situations so well relived. Time traveling let you think again , and again about human relations and family problems, in a so simple way that is somewhat astonishing.

"""All the time travel in the world can't make someone love you""","ABOUT TIME is a fantasy-comedy where a subject we often wonder about becomes reality for its protagonist. What if we could go back in time and redo our bad decisions, erase every faux pas, remove all our foots-in-mouth, etc?Though quietly funny and entertaining, the first half-hour or so meanders a bit, but things pick up, and the last half-hour is powerfully moving. ABOUT TIME is seldom just laugh-out-loud funny; however, there is a quietly whimsical humor throughout. Good acting by Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, as well as by everyone else, but the best of all comes from Bill Nighy as Tim's dad, a truly memorable character. The cinematography is also excellent, with some fine views of the Cornwall, England, coast. Great script and great soundtrack too. Despite the fantastic elements, this is a film about real people that, like many British productions, moves at the speed of life. Therefore, people who want a lot of excitement and explosive action may be a little bored with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A ridiculous use of the time travel,"Richard Curtis once again made another film about romance and this time it's got a twist, TIME TRAVEL. Sure, critics and moviegoers find this sweet and sentimental and one of Curtis' best flick, but don't they get tired of all the Hollywood time travel wannabees and trying to make time travel a much more easy subject? Now, time travel films are now scattered around the globe and it's irritating. In this film, it's about a man who learns that all men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. To use this, they would go inside a closet and close their eyes while clenching their fist and then voila, they can now travel in time. What the fu**?! Is that it? It's not enough science and it's too brainless. Do they think time travel would be that easy? I just hate it.I think I'm going to agree on some people who thought that this film captures the best of romance. It has its sweet and funny moments, valuable lessons about love and great music too. Rachel McAdams is charming as always. Did you know that this is her third film about time travel romance? She first appeared in Robert Schwentke's The Time Traveler's Wife and then Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. And now, in here. Didn't she get tired already? But of course, one thing I liked about this movie that it's beautifully filmed from start to finish. What more can I say?Overall, About Time is sweet, funny and sentimental but as I said, the ridiculous use of the time travel makes this film a huge disappointment. I think it's about time to stop this ridiculous subject unless if they really know the subject very well and had enough brains. I think I will give this film a score of 5. Oh and by the way, there was no chemistry between Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This is definitely the idea movie for you if you love wholesome loving family journeys and seeing a lovely realistic and modern evolution of a man that is just searching through this world for love and finds it in a beautiful and shy American girl.I would recommend that you all watch this film and if you have, well you should watch it again. You Won't Regret It.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mr Curtis is on top form with this rom-com with a difference,"There are touches of deja vu in this film which cleverly stitches in time travel to a love story encompassing all the central characters. First and foremost it is about love both romantic and familial, but with a couple of characters who can play little tricks with time. Not all the time trips go as planned but they always provide food for thought. There are the usual Curtis-marked laugh out loud moments, the careful casting of the leads, the flawed diamonds of characters that always bejewel Mr Curtis's scripts, and the tragedies that open our eyes so very successfully. Through all their faults the lead characters are such believable characters, and, as usual for Mr Curtis, the token American character, this time Rachel McAdams, is perfectly cast.Perhaps Mr Curtis is guilty of formula writing you may say, and you'd have a point, but just like his use of rain and foul weather, he manages to freshen it all up and keep us guessing until the end. It's a formula others copy but no one does it better than the director himself.And so if you want to watch a heart warming rom-com does very professionally then this is up there with the best.Nine out of ten as a film, but ten out of ten for the lead actors - all of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
WOW Factor,"I really liked this movie and when I saw the actress of the movie "" The notebook"" as the main actress I said: I am going to like this one. I was right. Since the beginning of the movie till the end it grabbed my attention.This movie as someone said, is about family, about love, about the things you did wrong in the past and you want to travel back in time and fix them. It leaves a beautiful message at the end, that we are all time travelers. That we have to live our day by day with all the stress it has, but also looking all the beauty around in each of our days. That even if you would have the chance to live each day of your life twice, there is nothing like living it, just once.It moved me in every way and this is the reason why movies are done for. This is the reason why you go to a theater for. You do not go to a theater because of the visual effects or the 3D effects, you also go to be moved in some way and when a movie leaves you with that feeling of meditation or maybe going over your head over and over some of the scenes it has accomplished it's goal.If it leaves you talking about it for a few days it means it was worth the view.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Absolutely Touching,"What a touching film. I came into it with no expectations as it was recommended to me by a friend. It first starts off as a normal rom com and I suspected it would follow the same story line as do so many rom coms. As it twisted and turned the characters grew in a different way to how I would have expected it to. Character development is so important in films, almost as-or even more important, than the actual story. This was the case in this film; I felt as if I was growing with the main character with every step. This film so beautifully unraveled the main characters journey into self acceptance that it made me feel something so deep I have never felt before in a film. Themes of fatherhood were so brilliantly expressed towards the end it had me sobbing uncontrollably with such relatability and connection between Tim and his father. Despite the outlandish idea the film proposes (could it be considered sci-fi?), it so exquisitely subdues the absurdity with English humour that has you believing in it completely. What a terrific story. What incredible emotions this film can elicit, especially towards the end. Absolutely recommend watching it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Its not just a science fictional movie, so to speak, it has the potential to move you from your very core of emotions, sentiments and intellect.Rachel McAdams is a dream floating around like a cloud, and she looked absolutely gorgeous in the movie. Domhnaal Gleeson also suited very well, I think a rather more famous name could have made this movie visible to the masses but his rawness worked so well in the movie.Bill Nighy and Gleeson's relationship was so beautiful and concrete that it could pull you to your childhood and fill with nostalgia and a thought that yes you could be a little nicer to your dad. This movie moved me and made me feel things which is the one of the most important reasons why a film is made and is regarded highly, that it has the power of instilling a feeling in you. The score worked very well and the songs worked very well.

So Much More than It May Appear,"I was approaching this title with skepticism, as I'm not particularly fond of sci-fi romcoms. But this film is so much more than that. Although it may seem apparently superficial in its technicalities, I found it to be truly meaningful and deep. The dynamic between father and son was the thing that officially declared the start of the waterworks, especially the ending sequence, something I maybe identify with or see myself or my life in, I don't know, with an outstanding, special, warm performance by Bill Nighy. This film is still a mystery to me but the thing that I know for sure is that it hugged me. A very generous peek into the future, a very painful glance to the past, the importance of living every damn second in the present, by consequence. Aside from the core of the film, the romance, with Rachel McAdams definitely more charming and emotionally engaging than the lead Gleeson, I think we are in desperate need for films like this with this kind of message.

I must say this storyline is so gentle, you go on watching it and suddenly you find yourself completely immersed in the life of Tim, Mary and ""Father"". Bill Nighy does an amazing interpretation of the ""father"". I believe they leave him as Father because of the similarities with a almighty, someone who understands more than everyone about life.

When Hugh Grant gets too old,"I liked the concept: a man travels through time to make a girl fall in love with him... unfortunately, right at the very beginning, after Charlotte turns him down, he admits that all the time travel in the world couldn't make someone fall in love. This kind of made the concept defunct.From then onwards, we're treated to entirely predictable events as the dull humour quickly drops out of the film and it makes a stab at being something serious, failing to realise that most of the intelligent male audience dragged into it by women likely lost interest a long time ago.What is probably most infuriating though, is the writer's inability to create any leading male who isn't a public schoolboy Woody Allen clone, and if a viewer closed his or her eyes, the lead was Hugh Grant right down to the exact amount of air sucked in during pauses of verbose retorts.Before the end, I had to apologise for being unable to sit through this painful mess of a film and went to another room to do something more worthwhile... and can only recommend that others skip ahead to that stage rather than pressing Play on this disc at all.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the best movies I've ever seen.,"The English drama, I confess, sometimes made me cry. This romantic comedy makes you think and rethink your life, change your perception of time.

The plot, in my opinion, is almost perfect. There are certain moments that seemed incomprehensible to me, but even with them, the movie is great.

The protagonist travels back in time and wants to make the present beautiful, but sometimes things only get worse, and he has to go back to the beginning.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The cinematography is beautiful. The colour grading is done exceptionally well. The vintage looks does wonders.
The cast, again a perfect combo. The romance, the family emotions, everything conveyed to the audience perfectly.
The story is one of the biggest positives. Simple yet gets you completely off guard. The is appears raw, like there isn't any big storyline or anything, it is so light and beautiful.

An underrated masterpiece !!,It's one of those movies which will make you feel good for quite some time even after you watched it . The story itself is whole and complete and that is quite important for a movie to shine . Every Element of this movie is perfectly balanced.The cast did a pretty good job too of bringing out all the emotions possible out of the story . The plot revolves around the protagonist Tim Lake who suddenly discovers at the age of 21 that he can control Time . With his newly discovered power he decides to take a shot at love but fails miserably . Tim learns the hard truth that love is natural and cannot be controlled by any means . Years Pass away and Tim pursues a career at law . He meets the love of his life Mary and this time it sticks . The rest of the story revolves around their whole relationship and marriage and the problems the face along way with Tim trying his time manipulation powers to fix every situation. The main focus of the film is about love and family so don't get worried about the time travel too much ! The time travel element fits perfectly though and adds up some really great comic scenes . Overall its an amazing film and one of the best Romantic Dramas out there . Worth watching with your significant others if you plan to .,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

dull and boring,"What a waste of potential, what a waste. This movie is nothing more, just 2 hours of dull and boring cinema with almost no plot at all. The story is absolutely about nothing. It stars promising, but then you wait 2 hours that something happens. But nothing interesting happens. You don't care of any of the characters, because they are so flat, so empty. There is no tension, no emotion. When there is an problem, it is immediately solved by traveling back in time. How convenient.As someone mentioned here: How can someone with time travel powers still remain such a pathetic loser? Whole movie is pathetic and boring.

"Its a romantic movie first, rather than a time travel movie.","The story disregards concepts like the butterfly effect for the most part. There are inconsistencies throughout, regarding the establishment of time traveling rules for the movie... But not to an extent that breaks reasoning.Otherwise it's a great romantic movie, very light hearted in tone.Honestly, if the whole time travel thing was removed and the final timeline was told as a love story, not much of the experience would've changed. Time travel was niether necessary nor forced into it. It kinda was in the middle where it merely served as a support to tell a much linear story, just in a non linear fashion.Overall, I recommend anyone who is looking for a time travel and/or a romantic movie, to watch this. The timeline is really simple to follow, unlike most time travel stories out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A colossal waste of time. You can still be saved - don't waste yours!,"I was completely baited by the high IMDB rating AND the recommendation of a list of movies that're similar to The Groundhog Day. That list listed reasonable entries like Source Code, good ones like Edge of Tomorrow, Happy Death Day, and excellent one like Triangle (really creepy too). And the list put this movie at #1. Sad. Despite noticing some absurdity of the list (it also listed movies like Her, Predestination, Before I Fall ... they're either not really daily-repeating or just bad), I still had high expectations of About Time after seeing its 7.8 IMDB rating.About Time has comedy potential. It has a completely absurd and illogical time traveling premise that I was expecting the time travel to bring a lot of laugh, but sadly there's nothing funny in the plot. While there were clearly paltry attempts at being funny, they fell way way short. The movie quickly turned into a completely boring RomCom without comedy. The leading characters are not really that likeable, and it's hard to care about their romance. The plot itself isn't even coherent, it's like someone just tried to turn a sitcom episode into a feature length movie. It was a disaster.So seriously, take my advice, avoid this movie at all cost!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of the most charming movies I've ever seen!,"I usually don't write reviews, but I noticed some persons bashing this movie. This movie is not perfect, non is. But, I'll tell you what it is.1. It's funny, it has lots of moments that you can identify to, embarrassing moments, the troubles of being rejected, it's been shown in such a way that you can see the silliness of it all. I guess one of the many lessons in this movie is to learn to laugh at ourselves.2. It has tear inducing drama, how sometimes we can't let go of those we love, how to cope with family issues. How love and acceptance are key factors in our relationship with our partners and family. How big is the love for our children.3. It has a great story line with the Time Travel, the actors make this movie so believable, you even believe they can actually do it. This part to me was of self discovery, learning to appreciate life, the little things, our family, our friends. That we have the control to make our days better just by being grateful and see the beauty in everything.All in all, this is a movie that'll leave you thinking for days after seeing it, and if you DO see it, take it for what it is, bask in it, put yourself in their places, and you'll thoroughly enjoy it.

"A walk amongst the hourglasses, then repeat","So then lets dive in for a quick one, shall we? A very ginger, lanky clone of martin freeman crossed with Ron from harry potter has a normal, Cornish bred lifestyle with a fairly upper middle/ low upper class family. His father is a seemingly powerful yet carefree man. His mother and sister...relegated in his eyes as simply...mother and sister. However, his love for them remains almost as strong as for his father. His want of his approval, his acceptance and guidance, fore what son couldn't say the same. Or how pleased when a son gets just what he wants. But in this case, what the son gets is a milestone of knowledge, a revelation of insight into a secret that leads to the very secret of life. Without so much as a grand fraternal initiation, a bomb is dropped upon the son, let loose by the father in the supposed joke...of time manipulation. What joys, what travels, what merry may haves and have nots, or maddening misfortunes naught had or not naught had occurred. Though from my standpoint there are many plot holes from a paradoxical minded persons point of view, many things unrealistic ( this movie in the whole, one of them) from a sci fi/ sci possiblists' experience with the genre of mind expanding, science bending ideas. Alas somehow, as if the director could bend the ether themselves, it turned out well. A pull on ones own imagination on what could or shouldn't have been done showed me that I was driven to continue the tale, that it worked to keep me watching, not with action or great mayhem, but simply with the most bizarrely calm , docile minded, understandable fellow mans point of view. And that was the point that was so miraculously well made! laughs had, a general lesson of enjoying the moment, for it is the only true constant and real test of time; no true past or future, just other nows either gone by or yet to let fly in our eye.

Essentially Good.,"About Time is a really good movie, that manages to deliver a message and touch feelings. Someone noted here that this is the reason we go to see movies, and taking About Time as a whole, I totally agree. I was moved, and this feeling is still with me as I write. And I know I'll watch it again.Now for the technical side. About Time is a light comic drama with a good heart. From the very start one can see the good production values. Very good narrative, performances and cinematography. However, it also introduces some awkwardness, primarily due to the awkward, off bit characters, including Tim. In fact most of the male characters through the movie are such, and this is a bit of a down side.At start it reminds very much of Groundhog Day. But somewhere along the way it takes its own direction and Groundhog Day is forgotten. It is not always engaging, but for its' above 2 hours length, it has a very good pace, narrative and performances and never boring. For its last part, it starts to be engaging and very moving.About Time has some drawbacks. First are the already mentioned, off bit characters. I think they were made such to add a comic side, but it mostly felt a bit out of place. However, this wasn't too severe (not in terms of screen time nor in its intensity). The second was some of the occurrences Tim decided to change. He seemed to be quite smart, so understanding the major risks and outcomes of changing the past shouldn't be too hard. Instead, he makes a mistake of changing events too far in time, more than once, which makes him a bit less likable.However, nothing is flawless. And like a person, this movie has its own drawbacks. And while they're visible, they are outweighed by far by its benefits. About Time succeeds in getting the best emotions from ourselves. Making us think of how we can improve our lives, being us, but looking at things from a slightly different point of view. And just for this, I would recommend it as a must watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Perspective from someone who's seen Groundhog Day many many times,"The #1 reason to not miss this movie is that the leads (Domnhall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams, and Bill Nighy) are arguably three of the best actors working today. Of all the things that this movie can be criticized for, bad acting is certainly not one of them.The #2 reason to not miss this movie... if you liked Love Actually, this is the same director, but instead of multiple story lines explored shallowly, this is one storyline explored in multiple ways. One life and one's relationships explored in different alternatives.Groundhog Day is possibly my #1 favorite movie of all time. The best thing about both Groundhog Day and this film is that time travel is a major theme but the main point is to explore what one learns about life through time travel. There is nothing earth shatteringly new learned through About Time, but it's a warm hug of a movie that is witty and entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Delightful but Flawed Romantic Comedy,"I've often talked about how when you have a film that falls on the border of decent and good, it really is up to the viewer personal preferences to decide how they feel about that film. I've given ""About Time"" 3.5 Stars. There are some great scenes that I think could've boosted this movie to a 4 Star rating, while there are other scenes that could've dropped it down to a 3 star. It is not, as I have already mentioned, as good as I remember it to be (how many films really are ageless?), but I do think it's still worth a watch. This was my fourth time watching this film, and I can honestly say I probably will watch it again a few years down the road. I think the fact that I spent more time pontificating on the pros and cons of this film than I usually do should be enough to indicate that I feel something special for this film, that it does mean something to me even though it does have plenty of flaws.I find the sweetness and kindness instilled in some of the scenes in this movie displays a kind of tenderness that I rarely see in modern film. I still get a few chuckles from some of the side characters (particularly Tom Hollander (""A Private War"")), and I still love the father son relationship between Tim and his Dad. No, this isn't a perfect film, but few films are.

"It's not just the humor and romance. What makes ""About Time"" such a pleasant production to watch are the reflections it brings about life and the weight of the choices we make","It's very rare to see new things in romantic comedies. And therein lies the great difference of writer and director Richard Curtis. He is capable of creating works that stand out in such a bloated and repetitive universe. It was like that, for example, with the great ""Notting Hill"" and ""Simply Love"". And he proves his quality once again in ""About Time"", one of the favorite films of many in recent years that is not one where the protagonist needs to go back in time to prevent a catastrophe or save humanity. It's actually about a guy who uses his gift to get a girlfriend. But it's not just the romantic comedy present in About Time (2013) that makes it such a pleasant production to watch, but rather the reflections it brings about life and the weight of the choices we make.The film tells the story of Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), a young Englishman at a New Year's Eve party with his family: Mary (Lindsay Duncan), his mother, Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson), his sister and his eccentric Uncle D (Richard Cordery). After a conversation with his father (Bill Nighy), he discovers that the men in his family have the ability to travel in time, but only to the past. With this knowledge, he begins to resolve all the small issues in his life. Shortly afterwards, Tim goes to live in London with Harry (Tom Hollander), a theater producer who is a friend of his father, to attend law school. And there he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams), with whom he falls in love at first sight.And here begin the subtleties that differentiate Curtis's work and that spread throughout the film. In the hands of another filmmaker, Tim could easily use his gift for just selfish reasons, like hooking up with multiple women and then acting like nothing happened. But here, he does it just to improve himself as a person and win the love of his life. The best way possible. As the plot unfolds, we begin to follow the couple's lives, which are nothing different from most couples. They go through the nervousness of meeting their partner's parents, difficulties at the beginning of their careers, marriage proposals and everything else. And everything happens naturally, without ever sounding episodic. The sequence in the subway station, which shows the evolution of the relationship, is as well executed as the one seen in ""A Place Called Notting Hill"". Also noteworthy are the costume changes according to the season, costumes worn at parties and the work routine, in a beautiful montage with no visible cuts.In addition to the passage at the station, the film is full of memorable moments, such as the entire wedding sequence, which culminates in the fun choice of groomsmen, the last train journey or the exciting walk by the sea in the third act. There are so many adjustments to the script that it would be unnecessary to list them. However, it is worth highlighting the way in which the ""rules"" for time travel are presented to the viewer (although expository), in the same way that they are explained to Tim. Another striking element is the soundtrack, which fulfills its purpose with praise. Function of reinforcing the feelings aroused by what is seen on screen. It's impossible not to be moved by songs like ""How Long Will I Love You"" or ""Mid Air"".This isn't a movie about a boy who loves a girl - it's a movie about a boy who does. Tim Lake, in today's cynical and hardened world, can be considered a great fool, naive. He loves Mary, he loves his sister, he loves his friends, he loves his family. If ""Simply Love"" took few trips outside the context of romantic love, ""A Question of Time"" places all relationships on an equal footing. This isn't a time travel movie either (thankfully). When we insert a narrative resource into a script, it can start to control the story or it can just be a device serving the story and character development. Tim and his father's insights are facilitated by all the time the characters have on their hands, but they are actually triggered by events in everyday life that are not altered by the argument of fantastic realism. The mechanics of time travel, the temporal logic, are flawed, but sticking to that in this film is going completely off the route desired by the script. If the title is ""A Question of Time"", the protagonist says, even in the opening scene, that for him, it was always a question of love.""About Time"" is a journey through the life of this boy and those close to him. We will accompany you during your single days, the emergence of love, marriage, your first children. But not everything will be good news, and we also have the troubled sister, the reclusive mother, the sick father. There are good times and bad times, just like what happens to each of us on this side of the screen. And perhaps this is precisely the film's greatest merit: being simple, basic and direct, yet endowed with an easily recognized magic, one that shows how precious the act of just being alive is, with all the mistakes and successes we make daily. Sometimes, the best thing is not being able to do more, but just having the availability to appreciate everything incredible that is around us and that we basically ignore due to lack of... time.He is already married to Mary (Rachel McAdams) and father of Posy, a beautiful little girl; Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson), Tim's sister, is in a car accident. Instinctively, one turns back time to avoid disaster. Upon returning to the present, Tim is faced not with Posy, but with a completely different child. ""Every time you change something in the past, you will have a different child,"" says his father. The new rule creates a big conflict for Tim: do I save my sister and get used to a different child or do I get Posy back and Kit Kat has the accident? This is not Tim's last crossroads, as he suffers and suffers with every decision he makes. The worst of all, however, is having to leave your father and best friend behind. Richard Curtis' script is moving by using a sentimental tone without being saccharine, touching on issues that are not the same, but very similar to those of the viewer. Even with some slip-ups in the temporal comings and goings, ""About Time"" teaches some precious moral lessons: live each moment as if it were your last, appreciate the smallest things in life and you won't need to redo anything.What makes this film different is the lightness with which it deals with this issue of time travel. There is none of that complex science fiction feel with inexplicable theories, calculations or paradoxes. But that doesn't mean the protagonist's actions fail to influence his life or the people around him, like a butterfly effect where a silly detail changed in the past causes a drastic change in the future. Tim learns in practice what he can and cannot do, however the presence of his father, James (Billy Nighy), is fundamental to his learning, as he had gone through the same thing before his son. The relationship between the two throughout the narrative goes through comical and moving moments, highlighting the good work of both actors. His dialogues make us think about small details in life, which apparently don't mean much, but are actually very important.However, neither the technical elements, the direction nor the excellent soundtrack would make the film work if it weren't for the chemistry that unites the powerful cast. Tom Hollander displays great comic talent, in a mix of hysteria and rudeness. The same applies to Richard Cordery's recurring amnesia. Lindsay Duncan brings strength and affection disguised in a strong woman. Lydia Wilson is the only outlier. Despite its dramatic importance in the plot, it has an interpretation that is both exaggerated and one-dimensional. Domhnall Gleeson demonstrates total control over his character and thus manages to illustrate Tim's entire development, from adolescence to the maturity of adulthood. But the big highlights are Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy. Nighy offers a restrained work, very different from the histrionics he is used to showing to the public. The emotion he brings to his relationship with his son is capable of softening the heart of any spectator. McAdams follows the same line as Gleeson, at various stages of adult life, but with more nuances. For example, when Tim starts talking about Kate Moss, it is possible to see, just by looking at him, the exact moment in which the girl falls in love.But the film is not perfect. With a direction that is not very daring, Richard Curtis fails in the length of the work. The theme, very simple and objective, is repeated once, twice, three and other times throughout the projection, unnecessarily extending it. Once we understand what Tim is after - which, frankly, doesn't take long at all - Curtis makes the same situation happen again in different contexts. I know we're dealing with a character who can make the same thing happen multiple times, but Curtis, with Mark Day in the editing, doesn't offer anything effectively new and engaging to make the repetition truly relevant. Ultimately, the result is a tape that could easily be at least 30 minutes shorter.It's not just the humor and romance that make this story so captivating. Obviously, time travel adds that fantasy touch to the film, but at a certain point we wonder what it would be like if there wasn't this extra ingredient in the script. That's when we realize that we could be in the shoes of any character we're seeing. In the end, even though we don't know the exact solution to the dilemmas that arise in our path, we are left with an optimistic feeling that we can handle them without having special powers. That's why ""About Time"" is so special for many viewers. Passionate, captivating, engaging: there are no adjectives that can accurately describe what this film provokes in the viewer who welcomes it with open arms.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An incredible family secret or a very pleasant surprise,"Romantic comedy, melodrama, family movies. And again I'll start with a little story, it was in the thirteenth year, when I worked as a sales assistant in the Soyuz chain of stores, then this picture came out, which I successfully ignored due to youthful maximalism (well, or another reason, it doesn't matter ), but I remembered it now, and after watching it, I realized that I shouldn't have ignored it in my time. True, the picture surprised me a little, which I admit, I was even glad. And here's my brief opinion - a very pleasant surprise. Despite all my efforts, I did not find any drawbacks in the picture, well, not a bit, although I tried, so I will focus on the expressive advantages of this wonderful picture.
So, here they are:
1. Romantic story - the fact is that in the original the picture is called ""About time"", which more accurately conveys the essence, but the Russian distributors decided, apparently, to surprise me, and named a good and touching family story with a little bit of romance ""Boyfriend from the future"". If it were not for this pleasant moment, then I would be angry with the distributors, but I will not do it. After all, the romance in the picture is only at first, until it develops into a good movie about family values, in which everything is beautiful, from dialogues. But the beginning is rather unusual - a young guy Tim, on his twenty-first year of birth, is told by his father about a family secret, the fact is that men in his family can travel in time, which was a real shock for the guy - but it turned out to be no joke, and then it started ... Dialogues that are close and understandable to everyone, structure, actors, there are certainly some insignificant questions about this ability, but I will not voice them. The fact is that the director and screenwriter of this picture, Richard Curtis, once shot the already cult romantic comedy Love Actually, so I didn't worry about the script.
2. Humor - most of the jokes and funny moments work out. It would be foolish to deny the obvious. Of course, there were a couple of moments when from the actions of the hero you experience the real ""Spanish shame"", but such nonsense is conditioned by the context, so you take them for granted. There is practically no vulgarity even.
3. Music - there is nothing outstanding and memorable in it, but within the framework of this picture, it copes with its task, you cannot argue with that. ""Quiet"" melodies wind up the right mood and immerse the viewer in the atmosphere of the picture completely, not allowing him to remember the time. I did not even notice how two hours passed, because everything looks in one breath and is not completely drawn out, although the hero goes through a series of events, although no, this is not the right word - a whole life flies in front of the viewer, and we were in it as observers who really imbued with heroes.
4. Conclusions - time travel is a rather slippery topic. And here its structure and rules do not really explain, so we can only build on the information that the heroes convey to us. I confess that I don't really like time travel films, because I think that when screenwriters use such a tool, it means they have run out of ideas, but not this time. Richard Curtis took this instrument and twisted around it a whole story of love and family values, so much so that even the desire does not arise to find fault with trifles. Family is everything, and time travel is just a tool that the hero used to understand that life is given once, with a set of mistakes and moments of happiness, and sometimes some things cannot be changed, no matter how hard you try. Maybe the script of the picture resembles a modern fantastic fairy tale - well, let it be, because inside each of us sits a child who just wants to listen to or watch a fairy tale.
A little about the main characters:
1. Tim Lake, played by Donal Gleason, is a young lawyer who, with the help of his incredible ability to find a girlfriend, turns into a whole series of events that he could not even imagine. The son of the powerful Brandon played here a young and cheerful boy in his prime, who has a long way to go. I liked Donal in this role, honestly - he fit into the role perfectly. Well done!
2. Mary performed by Rachel McAdams is Tim's beloved, with whom he is so eager to have a strong relationship. A young and enthusiastic beauty, with whom it is impossible not to fall in love. Rachel is not the first to play such a role, so she looked natural in the frame, and even the erotic scenes turned out to be surprisingly good.
3. Harry played by Tom Hoolander is a relative of the Tim family, living in London. A playwright known for his extravagant demeanor and aurally sharp tongue. Perhaps the most memorable supporting character played by the famous actor. Bravo!
Well, the well-known Bill Nighy starred in the role of Tim's father, who only attracts attention with his charisma.
This picture is purely British production, with a rather small budget (twelve million), and the United States barely collected fifteen, and if we take into account the global collection, then the figure is close to ninety million, which means that it paid off and made a profit. Because the soul is felt in the picture, and the audience saw and appreciated it.
I wonder what kind of romantic comedy I have watched? Twentieth? Thirtieth? And how much more will be ...

The most beautiful thing is love itself.,"""How long will I love you?"" The plot takes a step back, leaving the stage for family and life, for the panic when missing a loved one, for the clumsiness of confession, for the last beach walk, the last hug, the last kiss . Twice a day, you will find the neglected beauty; the child raises three, in case some two who are too smart and stupid can be companions.

Utter banality,"When I started watching the movie I expected so much more. The beginning was great and then it all got lost as if Richard Curtis could not decide what the story should be about. Should it be about time travelling? Should it be about relationship between son and father? Should it be about the family? About love or about who knows what? Like scattered pieces of puzzle those questions pop up now and then throughout the movie refusing to fall into places to form a wholesome picture. The main protagonist, Tim, has some potential but then he lacks purpose or direction in his actions, he also does not know what to do with his life or his gift of being able to travel back in time. He does appear as nice and caring though so bloody dull and boneless. Supporting characters seem to be on their own, supporting no one in particular. The main heroine is nothing but pretty face who supposedly reads other people's novels. She lacks any interesting traits or lines to say. She is almost like a piece of furniture in the movie and you cannot help but wonder what Tim has found in her... Perhaps their dullness unites them... There are no great wisdoms or even small ones either. Two hours of time claimed but utter banal, trivial, storyless, directionless movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A tremendous movie and a very heartfelt journey.,"I was a little skeptical at the premise of this movie but I have a lot of faith in Richard Curtis and took a chance on this movie. I am so happy I did. I am not a huge follower of romantic comedy movies, although Love Actually, same director of course, is easily one of my all time favorites hands down.And like his other movie Richard Curtis created a film with such a perfect cast and a story so happy and so sad that I admit it often brings me almost to tears. One thing that carries this movie is an exceptional cast. I am a firm believer Bill Nighy could very well be one of the best actors of our time.The story is so well done that I have seen it multiple times and each time I feel like I get a little more emotion out of it. There are a few movies I can see over and over again because once the credits roll, no matter what the day has brought, I just feel good. This is one of those movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Absolutely gorgeous.,"This film was really the film of the year for me. Not much else beats it and hardly anything wrong with it. it really ticks all the boxes that would fit to the genre and adds its own and ticks them off too. What really struck me about this film was its ability to take all the regular thoughts of time travel and turn them on it's head. It really makes the point that time travel cannot solve the issues of anyone's life, if anything it complicates more. In my opinion it's a must see film, no other way around it. This film really put the icing on the cake in terms of films released 2013, shame it wasn't released closer to valentines day. It would have made a perfect film to go see with a loved one.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Timeless Charm : A Review of 'About Time',"The main protagonist of the movie 'Tim' learns from his father at one point- the sons of their family can only go into the past by time traveling. Ever since Tim learned this fact, he repeatedly went back and corrected the wrong steps he had taken in different times.But time travel also has some complications and limitations. When the movie ends with various complications, it gives us a very beautiful lesson, that is- happiness and love are the most precious things in our life. As Tim's father says-""We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.""Finally, the background music, the acting and the script- everything has managed to create a wonderful atmosphere in the movie. For those who like time travel and light philosophical movies- 'About Time' is highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The most comforting, beautifully made film I have ever watched.","I find every time I watch this film I pick up more details & creative techniques.

We are shown relatable everyday live in a magical way where the protagonist has the secret special power to relive moments within his life and change how he lives. The relationships between all characters are impactful and realistic and as part of the audience you are immersed into this charming, effectively put together narrative.

Made my Life..,"Just watched this, And I'm a literally blown away, totally British, and typically Richard Curtis, a fantastic piece of British and American cinema working harmoniously together, brilliant screenplay and extremely realistic (of course not the time travel!) it has made me rethink everything I do and makes me look forward to life, yes. A lot to say for just a film, but only films like this can trigger such a response, well done Mr Curtis and well done for making me think. The way in which he takes everyday scenarios and wishes and turns the age old phrase ""if only I could turn back time"" into a reality makes this film what it is, it offers new ways round situations you may find yourself in and offers alternative routes to life's big decisions like having a baby or getting married, I have never thought so much about life after watching this film and I have to say I am not an easyily manipulatable person!

I actually found the first 35 minutes or so mildly entertaining so I though it was maybe worth giving it another go... I was wrong. As it goes on it just gets more and more annoying. It is just horribly sentimentalized, and it is way too long; seriously, someone should have taken a pair of scissors to that last 30 minutes...it is totally unnecessary and really cringe.

"This is something else, in a very good way!","When I started watching this movie I was expecting a qualitative and fun romantic comedy. But it was even better than that.

It takes some time to get used to that but once you get passed it, you realize this movie is not just about two people getting together but about life and love in general.It remains entertaining and reaches out to interesting and meaningful themes but it never gets needlessly artistic or inaccessible. This is a great movie to watch and watch again. It's funny and heart-warming. I just love the way an absurd concept like time traveling and the way this power is used by the main character tells you so much more than the story on the surface. It makes the movie stick with you for a couple of days.I recommend this to everyone, the ones who love a classic romantic comedy as well as those who love a more meaningful challenge on screen.

I have never watched a movie so many times (I estimate around 20) and been able to cry almost every one of those times. The combination of the acting, themes, plot and ESPECIALLY the writing make the final product of this movie an absolute masterpiece. Sure there may be plot holes and small mistakes, but none of that makes me want to give this any less than a ten. This is deeper than a romantic comedy, it is a masterclass in how to write a script, find the perfect actors to bring that script to life and make a near perfect structured drama with the skin of a rom-com.

"Yes, Finally","A charming, sometimes brilliant use of the time travel meme. Tim is left with the biggest decision of anyone's life: embracing the future and saying goodbye to the past, even when it means tremendous loss. Until that fateful moment, it's just been about fixing minor things and reliving good times. But, in the end, a poignant philosophical junction that is as original as it is provocative.Some parts are miscast, requiring constantly trying to make Rachel McAdams seem frumpy in order for the union with Gleeson seem believable. And McGuire plays like a comedic relief mascot. But, still, the acting is superb, Nighy, Wilson, and Cordery in particular. All in all, a delightful tale reduced to film impeccably.If I had seen this in the cinema, I would have been standing and applauding.

"A Lovely, Lovely Film","About Time is full of really nice people who love each other, and you want nothing but good things for all of them. And that often turns out to be possible, thanks to the Lake family secret. All the Lake men have a limited ability to travel backward in time ‚Äî only to earlier points in their own lives, true (""We can't go back and kill Hitler or anything.""), but usually getting a 2nd run at various awkwardnesses and infelicities is all it takes to smooth out life's little bumps and jolts.Aside from the time travel, the biggest imagination-stretcher is that Rachel McAdams's Mary is a single gal in London in her early 20s and doesn't have a boyfriend. Our hero, the gawky but endearing Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson), recognizes the cosmic injustice in that and determines to use his powers for good (or, in this case, love). But between his wistful adieu from the shy, plain girl he's met in a lights-out bistro and getting set to call the number she's punched into his cell phone, he performs a good deed for a friend, and it turns out that his little jaunt into the past has erased his evening's conversation with Mary from her memory and her number from his phone.That's about the highest level of stress this film ever reaches. It's the farthest thing on Earth from an action-adventurer. It's mainly a love story with minor elements of comedy (sometimes it takes several re-runs at the past to get things just right, and we see the failed attempts in quick succession) and pathos.It's written and directed by Richard Curtis, who earlier did About a Boy and Notting Hill, so you know he's got the characterization down cold, and Bill Nighy, Lydia Wilson, Lindsay Duncan, Tom Hollander, Richard Cordery, and Margot Robbie are pitch-perfect in supporting roles.

Simple yet powerful,"It happens to every one of us (for me at least twice a day), when we wonder into the ""if I had..."" imaginary world. In that world we can do... well everything, it consists of all the good and none of the bad.This film actually revolves around that. When everyone consider it as a rom-com, I found something in a match deeper level: A glimpse to a world when I have this magical power, and how it affects me, and the people around me.The movie provide experiences we can connect to (First love, first date, first child...) which helps sharing the emotional state of the characters, I could actually find myself in some of the characters, saying to myself: ""yes... I would do the same thing"". And that thing happens rarely.Apart of the story, the cast was fantastic. Every time I find myself upset, saying the characters are all dormant, they are all the same, they have nothing that can actually differentiate them from other.However in this story Each member of the family has his own view of life that dictated his / her behavior. I felt that they had their own mind, their own personality. (In other words, in conjecture to other movies where your can ""cut and paste"" dialog between characters and it will still work since none of them has personality. Here you won't be able to do so).The only thing that bothered me a bit was the ending. And I do it with a lot of movies reviews. Just saying that they should cut the last scene, that it would have created a greater emotional experience. So again, it's not a bad ending, but I'd complete the movie after the scene of the 2 men at the beach....",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The cast is amazing ranging from veterans like Bill Nighy to relative newcomers like Domnall Gleason and Rachel Mcadams, nobody looks out of place and nobody outperforms the other which just makes the film feel really balanced.

Highly Recommend,"There's much to like about this film. And it's okay to disregard the naysayers.For me, it isn't truly a Rom Com. There are romantic elements, and there is humor, but the strength and heart of this movie is about life lessons. It's more of a family dramedy.The cast is well put together, with the inclusion of young Margot Robbie and Vanessa Kirby creating additional interest.Without giving away plot spoilers, the central theme of time travel and the ability to change your life (with unforeseen consequences) is creatively structured with some wonderful characters sprinkled in. Rachel McAdams, and Domhnall Gleeson are at their winsome best, and Bill Nighy provides a fun and charming performance.When you look at other movie platforms (Rotten Tomatoes 71%, Metacritic 55%, IMDB 3.5) its striking how this film's audience (88%, 82%, 7.8) rate it better than ""professional"" critics. My theory on that is this: when a film over the years of its existence becomes what industry insiders like to call ""a cult favorite"" despite initial lukewarm reviews, the movie is actually a good film. The often jaded pro circuit of reviewers look for traditional touchstones to assess a movie, or use their own biased sensitivities to rate it. But in the end, the audience is the true barometer.And this movie wins on that basis, hands down.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Beautiful Romance Which Reminds The Significance of Living,"Richard Curtis' About Time is about Tim who learns from his father that they can travel back in time and relive certain events differently. Thinking how to use this power, he decides to use it to improve his love life. From there it showcases him proposing to his first love, Charlotte. And finally meeting the love of his life, Mary, and making the stars align such that they end up together. As the story moves on he begins to understand that time travel has it's consequences. And the movie ends on the beautiful note of learning to live life and not regret or change the past.The movie has a beautiful, feel good story. It is written to be a wholesome drama, and does that. The writing is quite good in the film. Whether it's the scenes for how he tries to get with Charlotte or how he changes the past to end up with Mary, good writing is what is making this movie feel like a wholesome masterpiece. It's in the writing.The movie has good music and cinematography. The visuals and settings shown create a pleasant vibe which blends well into the film and works for its themes. The dialogue is so pleasant and adds to the beauty of the movie. The movie uses these elements along with the writing to extend the film from a traditional rom com to being a drama that shows one how to live and reinforces living in the moment.The movie treats the relations and the writing between characters so well. Whether it's the obvious one about Mary and Tim, and how they bond and build their relationship and family. Or that of Tim and his father, their secrets, and how emotionally connected they are. Or that of Tim and his sister and how he helps her get out of a somewhat toxic relationship, without using the help of time travel.Overall, this is a must watch wholesome drama for all.

Very emotional,"Some choices of the main character are stupid. There's a part that is a bit boring. But the rest is cool. The story is original, and ok there are problems with time paradoxes as in every time travels movie, but this movie is very emotional and it learns how to appreciate little things, the world around us, life and time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not just another bad chick-flick!,"'ABOUT TIME': Four Stars (Out of Five)Writer-director Richard Curtis (who wrote and directed the critically acclaimed hits 'LOVE ACTUALLY' and 'PIRATE RADIO' as well as wrote or co-wrote other British romcoms like 'FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL' and 'BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY') helmed this 'time travel romantic comedy-drama'. It stars Domhnall Gleeson (who's most famous for playing Bill Weasley in the last two 'HARRY POTTER' films) as a 21-year-old lawyer in training who discovers he can time travel and uses his gift to get a girlfriend. Rachel McAdams co-stars as the number one object of his affection and Bill Nighy plays his time travelling dad. The film is as much a father-son tale as it is a romance but that didn't keep the theater I saw it in from being filled with 90% female viewers. As far as romcoms go it's pretty good but that's to be expected from Curtis.Gleeson plays Tim, who is 21-years-old when his father (Nighy) tells him their big family secret; that the males in the family can time travel. He explains that they can only go back in time and they can't change history. Tim decides to use his special abilities to win over a woman. He first tries it on his sister's friend (Margot Robbie), who stays with his family one summer, but learns that his gift can't make someone fall in love with him. Then, when he moves to London to study as a lawyer, he meets Mary (McAdams) and the two immediately hit it off. As he continually time travels though (to try and fix things in their relationship and his relationships with others) he keeps complicating things and making them worse as well as better.I last saw McAdams as a gorgeous and evil femme fatale in the Brian De Palma thriller 'PASSION' and she was fantastic in it. She used to be one of my favorite actresses but she's done so many bad romantic comedies (and other crap like that) that she's kind of lost my interest. So it was great to see her doing something completely different and good in 'PASSION'. Here she's doing another romcom, as the standard cute and sweet leading female 'love interest' role, but she's great at it too. She's the heart of the film and really drives the viewer's involvement in the story. Gleeson is a good and likable lead as well and Curtis's script (although flawed) and directing are brilliant. It is another romantic comedy but it also has a sci-fi fantasy twist and was in the hands of a good director. McAdams shines in the movie and everyone else in it is more than adequate as well. It's emotionally moving and definitely worth seeing; not just another bad chick-flick!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Movie of the year by far!!,"I watched the pre-screening last night and was absolutely spellbound. Besides amazing cinematography and acting, the story is what touches your heart and soul. This is a movie that will make you want to give your dad an extra hug, your sister a kiss on the forehead, and call up a long-lost friend.This is one of the very best movies I've ever seen in my life and I have a feeling it will be a classic for me to watch time and time again. If you like ""What a Wonderful Life,"" you'll LOVE this movie. I highly recommend this movie and plan to buy several copies to give as gifts when it comes out on Blu-ray.

"A ""perfect"" movie?","Although Romance is not my favourite genre, I love me a well-done romance story. And the way people hyped this up, I expected it to be. I was not a great fan of the notebook (in which Rachel McAdams coincidentally also starrs) but at least the notebook had some ups and downs. This movie is simply ongoingly beautiful, which makes it... well, boring. I like that it is about time-travelling but that time-travelling is not the main focus of the story, rather just something that keeps the story going. Ther are some beautiful shots and the acting is very good. McAdams and Gleeson have a good chemistry, both of them seem like normal people thrown into what should've been a special relationship. And it is - because the way they have almost no ups and downs is very unusual. You would think a Lovestory involving time travel had more interesting topics than who the sister is currently dating. All in all, a rather boring love story involving some cool time travelling.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sweet and simple time travel, yet thought-provoking","I loved this feature. I am big fan of time travel movies and this one will slowly rise up in my list of favorites as 'time' progresses. There are two things that stood out in this movie which you don't get to see in a time travel movie. First, how time travel is not used for something dramatic, but for love and family. Second, apart from being a romantic movie, this was also a father-son movie - a relationship that was beautifully explored with a sweet end in that relationship. This movie made me think about what I really want in my life. My day went well.Sweet and simple time travel, yet thought-provoking",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Funny,Clever, Original British film with great actors.","Walking into the cinema with little knowledge about the film other than it had Rachael McAdams and Bill Nighy in it, It was sure to say i didn't know what i was expecting. However i was pleasantly surprised. The film starts of with Tom a 21 year old looking for love however having no success, his search however all changes when his farther Nighy tells him he can turn back time. He meets a charming woman McAdams and even though they start of a bit slowly everything eventually falls into place and they have a wonderful relationship. There are some twists and turmoils throughout which he tries to repeat however on some occasions fate has to take its course. I have saw Tim previously in a programme called Black mirror and instantly recognised him as i thought he was brilliant in that, Domhmall Gleeson is definitely a rising star in my eyes and he suited the role perfectly. This is a film which is going to be up there with Notting Hill and Love Actually as it's original story, brilliant cast and directing are all fantastic. Great film for a date night and a must see film all round. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rare romance with a deeper moral message,"Have you ever looked back on your life and thought ""what could I have done differently""? Have you ever wished you could re-live a wonderful moment over and over again? Well young Tim Lake has the ability to travel back in time, same as his father, and his grandfather. Tim is not exactly the handsomest of men; he is an awkward, shy and slightly introverted character. Yet with these new found abilities he tries to make life better for himself and those he care about by altering little events in his past. This brings him to Mary, the woman of his dreams. When a change in the past almost erases their relationship, Tim holds back on using time travel unless only for the most important things. As his relationship with Mary grows from friends to family, Tim slowly learns that sometimes one has to let go of the past in order to fully embrace the present and work toward the future.ABOUT TIME is possibly one of the few romance movies that subvert the ""typical"" romance tropes. It is not overly sappy or awkward like the Asian ones, but neither is it over sexualised or shallow as Hollywood ones. It is an earnest little fairy tale that, refreshingly, frames a love relationship into the eventual outcome of a happy marriage and a family (unlike many which just ends with the couple in bed together). This earnestness is helped by well written characters, particularly Tim who goes through a complete coming of age tale that many can relate to.Starting from a socially inept teen with aspirations of dating the hottest girl in town, Tim soon realises that looks is not everything and settles for Mary, a woman who truly complements his character. We follow him as he grows into a confident adult and a loving father. Actor Domhall Gleason shares perfect chemistry with Rachael McAdam's Mary, making their relationship all the more ""real"". But the true breakout character is Tim's elderly yet charismatic father played by Bill Nighly who we find out has used his time travel abilities to relive precious moments in life, knowing that his life is soon coming to an end.Yes the movie does skimp pass the less desirable aspects of relationship to present a very idealistic image of romance: the squabbles, the arguments, they are never present. Family life too skims over the baby crying at midnight, the smelly diaper changes, adapting one's lifestyle around the child etc. But hey, fairy tale is fairy tale, and the movie would be three times the length if one were to go into the specifics of relationship trials and family tribulations.ABOUT TIME's only flaw is how it trips over its very own concept. At the very onset, two simple rules are set down about time travel. 1) He can't travel forward in time 2) Travelling to a time before the birth of a child will alter who that child is. Yet Tim travels back and forth in time multiple occasions, and travelling past the birth of his child only altered his child the first time. Subsequent time travels, including one back to Tim's childhood, did not cause such changes. Any newbie to science fiction can see how WRONG the whole time travel gimmick works. Does he physically travel back in time? If so, why does he not meet his past self. Does his mind travel back in time and inhabit his past body? This is true for the first half of the film where he decides to travel back to help out a friend instead of going on a date. But later on, he seems to be in many places at once when he travels to the past, being able to do what he did and do what he wanted to do.The easiest way to deal with this is to not take the time travel aspect literally. Instead, it is merely a metaphor for a strong human tendency to revisit our past and relive precious moments.ABOUT TIME brings up many life lessons. If we change who we were, we would never be who we are. If we change what happened to us, no matter how embarrassing or how negative, we would never be where we are today. All things, good and bad, happen for a reason and that reason may not seem clear at first. Sometimes something bad has to happen for someone to learn a lesson and change for the better.So there is no point trying to change the past. One should only cherish the present, for it is a gift. Take joy in the little things, settle the negatives and live it in such a way that in the future, one would never have the desire to change his past.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It was so tender-hearted and sweet and I just loved the relationships the main character had with his family. Character development! I thought it was a lost art in Hollywood!

I was still crying on my way into the lobby on the way out. I'm still thinking about this movie.

Review: About Time Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,"If you were able to travel back in time to the past events of your life, what exactly would you change? In Richard Curtis' new time-travelling romantic-comedy, Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) decides to go back and change his life, all in the name of love. Not that he could really go back and 'kill Hitler or shag Helen of Troy', as his father suggests.Since the early 2000‚Ä≤s, the British romantic-comedy is becoming as much of a staple in the genre than any piece of American rom-com cinema has recently, disregarding the American romantic indie features. Whether it be the cute accents, the ginger-bred protagonists or the intricate unique narrative tropes which excel certain points of the love story, those British buggers are succeeding in a genre that generally lacks such a large emotional response in big- budgeted Hollywood films.In the film, aspiring law student Tim lives with his parents (played eloquently by Bill Nighy and Lindsay Duncan), his free-spirited sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) and Uncle Desmond (Richard Cordery) in a charming home overlooking the bay in Cornwall, England. On the morning of Tim's twenty-first birthday, he is summoned to his father's study only to be told that the men in his family have the amazing ability to travel back in time, within the timeline of their own lives of course. In utter disbelief and against his will, Tim follows his fathers instructions; finds a dark place, clenches his fists and thinks back to New Years Eve, only to rectify his mistake of missing out on kissing a beautiful girl at the stroke of midnight. Enchanted, he returns to his father exclaiming, ""It's going to be a complicated year"", where his father replies, ""it's going to be a complicated life"".About Time is a charming, utterly tender tale of life, love and the extraordinary of the ordinary. Much like the narrative of the film, Tim travels to the past and back to the present to perfect all the imperfections of his life, yet the film is anything but perfect, and that's OK. Suffering from inconsistent plot-points to breaking the rules that the film outlines, About Time is surely not a tightly-constricted narrative leap for the genre by any means. Regardless, the film casts an enchanting spell that not only lifts one's spirit, but causes you to merely forget about the rules Curtis makes, and breaks.Writer/director Richard Curtis has had quite a bit of luck in the romantic-comedy genre, making major waves penning Bridget Jones's Diary, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Although he has stated that About Time will be his final directorial venture, only behind the aforementioned Love Actually and Pirate Radio, Curtis has succeeded well beyond many of the directors and screenwriters who hoped to successfully recreate anything Nicholas Sparks' has made, with the exception of The Notebook, of course. Fresh, spontaneous and demanding emotions, Curtis has brought new light to the British romantic-comedy front and has made the kind of films one isn't ashamed to laugh and cry at.Once Tim finally meets Mary (Rachael McAdams), Tim knows he has found the reason to adequately use his time-travelling powers. At first glance, Gleeson and McAdams seem like a poor physical match for a film that at times could be distracting or awkward. Instead, much to the extent and reality in life, the two feed off one another's unique characteristics splendidly. Tall, pale and with a hint of orange hair, Gleeson's unique on-screen charm is brashly alluring. McAdams on the other hand, stripped of all glam and instead substituted with a rather rag/tag girl-next door look, reminds us why she is cast in these roles and how easy it is to fall in love with her ‚Äì quirks and all.McAdams, who is no stranger to the time-travelling love story narrative, venturing in her third quest as the desired love interest, first in the Time Traveler's Wife and two years later in Woody Allen's acclaimed Midnight In Paris, enchants and reminds us just how adorable and likable she really is in these roles. Bringing a believable essence to the role of Mary, McAdams just may cement herself in time as the go-to, romantic-comedy poster girl.As a love story, About Time succeeds. As a tale of morality, a lesson on making each day your last and as a film about the bond between father and son, the film triumphs. Gleeson and Nighy share some of the most sentimental and heart-wrenching moments of the film that are sure to get your eyeballs sweating with joy. Incandescent as father and son, the two actors shine as the heart and soul of the film.As the pendulum swings closer to the end of the year, About Time will surely be atop my list of guilty cinematic pleasures of 2013, especially since I am such a sucker for hopeless romantic love stories with an underlining patriarchal theme. About Time may be a highly decorated cautionary tale of the beautiful moments in everyone's seemingly mundane life and the short time we have to live it, but the film, whether romantically tied or generationally suggestive, is a movie about appreciating the little things. ""Some days you want to re-live forever. Some days you want to live once"", and Richard Curtis and company really hammer that notion home with their newest film. Essentially, About Time is really all ABOUT LOVE, and we are alright with that.Night Film Reviews: 9/10 Stars",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wonderful movie,"So, I've been reading through many of the bad review of this movie. Just out of curiosity, because I found it to be very good. Certainly, or maybe, not THE movie as some followers might add, but also certainly a wonderful movie.So what brings detach and despise to this movie to some individuals. I barely found proper arguments. Most of those reviews (I cite literally) mention the word ""hateful"", ""disgraceful"", ""crap"", ""very boring"", ""worst movie of all time"" and so on. But so far, most if not all of these reviews fall to give a proper (IF ANY) argument to support their opinion. Might it be a matter of hatre to sensitiviness or life meanings what brings this portion of the population so much into this unexplicable hate?. Who knows.This piece of little art is sensitive, comprehensive, not cheesy at all (at all) and surely, not SciFi-like at all, despite of its argument basis. It is not even a proper romantic love story, because as a matter of fact although it plays with the love relationship of the main characters, it extends it so much, so much, and talks about other forms of love (such as paternal love) some might experience, that at times it might become overwhelmin.Wonderful movie, and a must see.

A beautiful heartwarming romantic film with a very deep life lesson,"My wife and I went to see this film hoping for a lighthearted romantic date flick. One reviewer called this movie a chick flick for men. Although on the surface this may be one characterization, this film is so so much more than a simple date movie or chick flick for men or women. Neither is this a sci-fi movie as some have described, although some aspects can definitely be described as magical.At the root, this film's message is living life to the fullest. Trying to always live life in the moment. Enjoying the simple things in life, like seeing your children growing up, sipping tea with your loved ones at the beach, or buying a sandwich at the local store during a lunch break at work. The film reminds us that much of our lives are spent worrying about what has happened in the past and what could happen in the future, and that much of this worry will never come to be and ends up being just lost time and wasted emotions. As much as we may want to relive certain experiences in our lives, we can only experience each moment once. There are no second chances. This moment is all we have, and we must make the best of it.Rachel McAdams is terrific and lovely in this film. She is real and authentic and her performance is wonderfully sincere.This film should not be reserved for a date night. It should be seen by parents, grandparents and adult children. We all need to be reminded about what is really important in life, and this film does just that. It will leave you inspired, awed and reawakened. Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great mix of humor and a well-composed storyline,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is a well-written, touching, humorous, and entertaining.

It was uplifting and theater-goers left feeling good about life. It was one of those rare movies that drew audience applause when it ended.

It s actually a family fantasy drama romance,"If you like a movie that is heartwarming and pleasant, somewhat magic and inspiring - this is the perfect one. it is a family movie, with a bit of romance, drama and that fantasy kick that takes you where you always wanted to go as a child - back in time.

About time is as charming as Amelie, but less fantasy-full,I'd say. just more real, which makes it easier to relate to on everyday basis.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really Great that deserves 10 stars,This film is a must see and quite the tear jerked.I must say I was taken back by this great little film. I think Curtis really understands what makes a good film and that is a good story and script to go with it. This film might go over some critics heads as they will probably be looking very closely to find a flaw and miss the lovely flow and small moments of magic. Well done Mr Curtis. I look forward to seeing your next film and hope it comes soon.I will be recommending this one to all my friends and probably look to buy a copy on DVD. I must also go back and re watch his other films to see if there was any magic I missed previously. I loved Notting hill but awful sound track.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Oh, how wrong I was.Domhnall Gleeson (Tim) added some humor to the movie, but I credit most of it to Bill Nighy (Dad) and Richard Cordery (Uncle D). However, I warn you to bring tissues with you if you have any heart at all. The same characters that makes you laugh will also make you cry. Then laugh again. Then cry again. That's what happens when you can travel through time.This movie hasn't had a lot of hype or attention, but it should.

Why do people like this film?,"Why do people like this film? It's a romantic comedy without a plot. The story-line is simple. Man decides to find a girlfriend, finds one, they marry, have three children, father of the man dies. End of movie. Of course that is not enough to fill a movie, so the director added a twist. The father of the man told him, when he turned 21, that the men of the family are able to travel back in time. All they have to do is to step in a dark secluded space, think of the memory they want to go back to and clench their fist, and voil√†! Nice idea to fill the rest of the movie. Unfortunately their are so many flaws in the story, it got annoying to me. It's a nice idea to travel back a few minutes, maybe a day, to redo something that could have been better, but sometimes the steps are major, and at some point the man finds out that his first child is now a son instead of daughter. His father explains him he can't go back before the conception because if he changes the past just a tiny bit, out comes a different child. Nevertheless, unexplained is how he manages to get his daughter back. Another thing, he can travel back in time, but not forward. So he has to relive his live with his changed past. If this is only a few minutes it is quite all right, and there is a funny scene in the movie where there has been taken advantage of that. But to prevent that the movie will get boring by showing the reliving, the director just skips to the present again. So it looks like he travels forward in time as well, but he doesn't. You have to realize that for the major flaw in the end of the movie. The man travels back to the moment his father is still alive, and the father decides to have a father-son moment so he travels some 20 years further back with his son to skip pebbles on the sea. (That is before the moment of conception of his three children!) So now the son, a little boy, has to relive his entire life, remembering all the changes he made to his past to get where he was some 20 years later. But the father will only tell him that he can travel in time when he will be 21. So by then he will probably have forgotten all his changes... However, the end of the movie shows he still managed to redo them all.This simple romantic comedy has no plot, the time-traveling part is infested with flaws. So, why do people like this film?",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"About time a romantic comedy arrived in 2013, there have been far too few","Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) is surprised when his father (Bill Nighy) asks for a private chat on his, Tim's, 21st birthday. Well, it is rather important! That's because all male members of this particular family inherits a nifty aptitude on this all-important year. Now, Tim will be able to ""time travel"" back to past years and relive, possibly change, certain happenings. Whoa, is this true? Yes indeed. At once, Tim remembers a dreadful New Yeat's party where the girl he was dancing with wouldn't kiss him, shaking hands instead. Ho, ho, going back, Tim smoothly works his way into a kiss! This is wonderful! But, wait, not so much. When Tim finally leaves his home estate in Cornwall to work as a lawyer in London, he longs to find the girl of his dreams. She soon appears in the form of Mary (Rachel McAdams) and, after a good first meeting, he records her number in his cell phone. Yet, when Tim goes to the flat he shares with a surly playwright, Harry (Tom Hollander), Harry soon tells him that his latest play, that very night, was a disaster, due to a key cast member forgetting his lines. Tim, wanting to help, goes back in time to prompt the actor, making the play a success. But, alas! When he goes back to his phone, Mary's number isn't there, for they NEVER met. Horrors! Doing some quick thinking, Tim remembers a detail of their conversation that helps him find her again. Nice! But, will Tim come to regard his ability as a blessing or a curse? This lovely film from the writer/director, Richard Curtis, of Four Weddings and Notting Hill, is a delight. Its funny, thought-provoking and touching. While Domhnall is not ""leading man"" handsome or arresting, he does a fine job. McAdams, very beautiful, does wonderfully well as his love interest. Other cast members, including Nighy, Lydia Wilson, and the rest, do great work as well. Praise should go forth to the creators of the costumes, sets, and cinematography as well as a deep bow to Curtis for his, once again, extraordinary vision. The setting in Cornwall is strikingly gorgeous, seaside and fetching to the point of EVERYONE longing to go there at once. Have you, as a romcom fan, been feeling neglected, like me?

Apparently I'm in the minority here.,"Atrocious movie. Literally I've never seen a movie with such a high regard and such a big budget being so consistently insulting to the intelligence of the audience.All the characters are annoyingly happy all the time (except the guy who hates children, because you know cynical=hates children right? Everybody knows that!). They are either archetypes or bland as hell. The movie hammers CONSTANTLY the theme of LOVE, LOVE LOVE WILL CONQUER THE WORLD to the point it feels like satire or a Saturday morning cartoon. What love?! The guys have no chemistry!! Like, at all!! Are you kidding me?? They get laid once and they are in love apparently! It also seems soo immature, the guy like trying to show off with the time travel. It's not funny, it serves no purpose and it's soooo cringy...Cartoonish as well is the script: blatantly artificial and inconsistently paced. I mean, first the movie follows the events with a fairly reasonable timing, then suddenly jumpes off years and years into the future! Hence what you achieve is murdering the tension, and by the way, there is not a single main tension in the movie! You got subplots where there is some tension, it's quickly solved, and suddenly the movie moves on into another time lapse!!! Infuriating!!! I was about to KILL myself with this garbage! No really I mean it, with every choice they make I was feeling sicker and sicker, wandering how retarded this director and writers were.Margot Robbie is in this movie, and still I'm wondering why, because its character was completely worthless.Oh and how could I forget? There is time travel in this movie, but I must warn you: it will make even less sense than the usual time travel you see in other movies. And what a surprise! It serves no purpose 85% of the movie. You could erase it from the movie until the ending and the idiotic plot wouldn't be affected!! Furthermore, the reasons the guy travels in time are, until the third act, so idiotic and absurd that I almost thought it was a joke! But no, this stinker of a movie thinks that has heart, that shows how love works (no it doesn't) and believes in these fairy tales not even Disney would buy! If there were some jokes I could let it pass, but nothing: this crap is meant to be taken seriously.Any positives? Well, I guess the dresses are pretty when we are in the wedding. The cinematography is not terrible either.But the cherry on top is the ending. I guess it's the part that the people praise. Honestly we all know why: because it's a tearjerker. I know it, you know it. Nothing else.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Smart, Entertaining, Funny, and Touching","Richard Curtis understands romance! It's been almost two decades since he wrote his masterpiece: ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", a loving examination of how quirky looking for happiness could be, yet it was old fashioned, real, and very good. He goes behind the camera this time with his own script. This only means another winner.There are some liberties taken with the concept of time in the movie, but it's interesting to see how through Tim, we are able to live our fantasies: the opportunity to have a second chance and being able to correct a few of our mistakes.The most winning part of the project is the casting, with every single performer giving winning performances. The most loving portrayal comes from McAdams, glowing, sweet, and lovely, with one of the most fantastic smiles I have seen in a recent film. Watching her react to Tim's initial moves is a joy, and her wedding scene is a romantic classic.The film, like ""Weddings"" manages to feel real and balance moments of happiness with a few incident of grief. The best is to see the realization that these people act like real people and are representing our dreams, giving us an opportunity to at least experience some of their joy.Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Has to be one of my favourite movies of all time,"I went to see this movie with a friend with no prior knowledge and was swept away on its story-telling brilliance.Sure, the time-travelling butterfly effect aspect could probably be picked apart in a trice by all those miserable sci-fi fans, blah blah. The concept is pure genius and such a refreshing way of examining the human condition and getting under the skin of the characters, I'm a sometimes fan of Richard Curtis but I think this is definitely the best ever - and I really like Love Actually.The acting is brilliant, especially Domnhall Gleeson (even Bill Nighy hits the nail on the head and doesn't go over the top) and it's a real feel good mix of laughs and tears as well as being a brilliant story.Love love love it, go and see it today.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent Movie !! A must watch ...,"Excellent screen play and script to exemplify the problems in life and teachings of how to cleverly deal with them. The deep thoughts regarding worries and concerns that almost every individual go through in their diurnal life has been demonstrated via amazingly good combo of crave feeling to get first love, mistakes, resolutions, parental love and emotions. All the actors truly justified their roles. In fact the movie is kinda generic teaching to every individual of the 21st century as to how to lead a happy life each day along with prioritizing the professional tasks. How to live life with full zeal and value every little thing that can make you smile and never take any blessings in your life as granted. Kudos to the creator team!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You need to see this movie!!!,"We went with free passes and had no idea what this movie was really about and quite low expectations to be honest. I highly doubt I would have seen it if I had just based it on the trailer however, it was the best movie I have seen in a long time. It was certainly a mix of comedy and drama but not the type of predictable sappy love story that are typical of these type of movies. The story follows a young man who discovers that he has the ability to travel back in his life. He ends up changing some things about his life to make them just right however, in the end there are some things he isn't capable of changing. More than the time-travel theme is a beautiful portrayal of love at first sight, family bonds and the powerful connection between father and son. It is touching and sentimental and gives an honest perspective about living life to its fullest each and every day-with lots of humour included as well. It's not just a ""chick flick"" but something that I think guys will equally appreciate. Don't miss this movie. And bring your tissue!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There is something very special about this film....,"It is not a great movie by any means. Its' plot is ludicrous and full of logical holes,but it is that rare true feel good film.There are probably less than twenty films that I have watched more than 2 times in my life. Three of them are films that I watch when I need to get out of a funk. I would imagine a lot of people have films that do that for them, classics like It's a Wonderful Life or Forrest Gump for instance, but for me they are Harold and Maude, Breaking Away, and the much less well known but very special film - Let It Ride. About time is now number 4 on the list. I really don't see this as much as a romantic comedy as a film about learning to wake up and smell the roses. I left the theater so full of thoughts about how to approach life and what is important. See this film when you are feeling like life just sucks cause you will leave the theater feeling just the opposite.I will add this film to my very small DVD collection when it is released. Normally there are just too many films that I have not seen and want to see, for me to spend a couple hours with repeated viewings but I am sure I will need an About Time fix at least once a year.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
forgot about groundhog day?,"20 years Before this film was done, there was Groundhog Day. That film had an almost religious following. It only had one person Everything happening to and there was only one day which was lived over and over again until that perfect day, which, i Believe, was the reason for the religious following.
This film blunders through a similiar topic 20 years later and the only thing that's been added is a s-tload of stupidity.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing Rom-Com!,Just come back from watching this film! I have to say I'm very impressed not seen a rom com this good in years! it has the right balance between humour and sensitive subjects and all over general life. At no point in the film do you feel lost as to what is going on it all makes perfect sense. Rachel Mcadams always makes a film in my opinion anyway! I was a bit jubious about how good it was set to be but I would highly advise going to see this film its a beautiful well thought out and set film! will make you laugh in hysterics and also cry in hysterics also depending how hard you are to crack! very good! film go see!! :) ! !,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Smart, Witty And The Replay Value Is Off The Scales!","About Time is a film directed by Richard Curtis, and stars Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy. The story centres around Gleeson's character Tim, who at the age of 21, is told by his father that all men in their family can travel back in time. Instead of looking for knowledge or wealth with his new found power, he uses it to advance his pretty well abysmal love life.Now, like so many, I had next to no info on what this was about. I had ""Time travel, love story, certainly not sappy"", and for me, that sounded pretty good. When I sat down to watch this though, I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. This film really captured me from the word go with it's hilarious script and fantastic main actor, and I'm not ashamed of saying it.The performances are all top-notch. Domhnall Gleeson works his role perfectly, as a shy but charming young British man. He's ridiculously relatable, and his character feels incredibly genuine. Rachel McAdams also gives a stellar performance, and she is really adorable in this film. Call me strange or whatnot, I don't care, because I found her incredibly cute! The rest of the ensemble is wonderful, with special mentions to Bill Nighy, who plays dad, and gives a very emotional performance, and Tom Hollander, who gives an absolutely hilarious performance as Harry, a writer who is incredibly self-centred. All in all, wonderful film on the performance level.This is certainly not your average Rom-Com, in which you can predict every aspect possible. It makes some twists and turns which you certainly can't see coming, and ultimately, the route it takes is a route not commonly seen in romantic films. Curtis doesn't try to clog up the film with tremendously silly, clich√©d issues within the relationship, as so many romantic films do. It just takes you on a ride that so many relationships undertake. Ultimately, it feels like a real relationship, except this time with time travel! And whilst I'm on the topic of time travel, I believe they used that aspect incredibly well. They didn't use it at every opportunity possible, and in a nice twist, the actually used time travel for teaching us lessons, to accept everyday as it comes, to anticipate the next and to not live in the past. Ultimately, on a sentimental level, About Time delivers a lot.In conclusion, About Time is by far, one of the best movies I've ever seen, period. It's free flowing, smart and incredibly charming, and it begs for repeat viewings. Richard Curtis has nailed it out of the park here, and I'm sure I'll be raving about this film all into the future.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
