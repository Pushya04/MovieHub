Excellent '50s tale of reality TV that wasn't,"I was growing up during the Charles Van Doren scandal, and I remember his face on the front page of the paper and my mother crying. When I asked her what happened, she said, ""He told a lie."" He told a whole bunch of them, in fact, and was part of the quiz show scandal of the '50s, which Quiz Show so beautifully dramatizes. Robert Redford does a fantastic job of recreating the atmosphere in perfect detail, as well as the fascinating story of the '50s version of reality TV, the quiz shows, going awry.Paul Scofield is absolutely mind-boggling as Van Doren Sr., and Ralph Fiennes is wonderful, handsome, and charismatic as Charles Van Doren. The rest of the cast is marvelous - John Turturro, David Paymer, Hank Azaria, and Rob Morrow.Van Doren was a dream contestant - good-looking, educated, with a beautiful speaking voice - and captivated the country with his intelligence. Unfortunately, it wasn't reality at all, just fantasy. But, as Van Doren says while verbally sparring with his dad, ""It was mine own."" It sure was, and he went into oblivion because of it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"An Interesting Study Of TV Corruption, But Strangely Lacking In Intensity","In the late 1950's the TV game show ""Twenty-One"" was rigged. Popular contestants who could grab ratings were fed the questions and answers, and those who the network wanted off were told to take dives, all for the sake of keeping ratings up and selling Geritol. ""Quiz Show"" is the story of the scandal, and of the potential danger of the power of television. The movie focuses around two contestants in particular: Herbert Stempel (John Turturro), the reigning champ at the start of the movie who the network decides it wants to dump in favour of someone more glamorous who can pull in higher ratings: Charles Van Doran (Ralph Fiennes), a college literature professor. Stempel feels cheated of the glory that he feels was his due, while Van Doran is tormented by his desire to tell the truth, but also to cover up his involvement in the scandal.This is an interesting film that gives a fascinating look at the inside workings of the TV game show of that era. And it does paint a fascinating moral dilemma. As Dan Enright (David Paymer) - Twenty-One's producer - says to the Congressional committee that investigates the scandal, this was after all just a TV show; by definition a piece of entertainment. The sponsor sold its product, the network got ratings, the contestants made money and the public got entertained. Where was the victim? And yet it WAS dishonest. It's a fascinating issue, this whole concept of a victimless crime. And the ultimate irony was summed up by Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the head Congressional investigator: the Committee got Van Doran, but what he wanted was to get television. In the end, as he says, television will probably end up getting them.All in all this was an interesting movie, although - strangely for a true story - I felt it lacked any sustained dramatic intensity. Remembering Jack Barry from the 1970's as host of the game show ""The Joker's Wild"" (he was also the host of ""Twenty-One""), I was very impressed by Christopher McDonald's portrayal of him. Although the role wasn't really that central to the movie, McDonald had Barry down pat, and I felt as if it really were Jack Barry I was watching.All in all, this is a very good movie. I wouldn't run out and buy it, but it's certainly worth a rental.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Fantastic film, phenomenal performances","It would be pretty surprising if Quiz Show, Robert Redford's film about the 1950's quiz show scandals was anything short of excellent.  The principal actors give phenomenal performances:  Fiennes' Van Doren is usually unflappable and cold, but manages to allow vulnerability to surface at times, and Turturro's Stempel is a study in almost sociopathic and manic behavior.  What allows both actors to transcend mere greatness is their ability to make the viewer both admire and detest their characters with something as subtle as a glance or body language.  Morrow's character of the `whistle-blower' is there as the moral fiber; the outsider who looks upon the situation both with objectivity and as the devil's advocate.Redford's direction is rich and well-paced.  There were not any slow moments in the film, and he did not have to adhere to rapid-fire editing to achieve the momentum of the film.  Perhaps the subject matter is a factor, but I have found that with the exception of `Ordinary People', the films I have seen under Redford's direction have been good in a technical respect but lean toward the maudlin.  With Quiz Show, he does what should be done when telling a true story  he does not resort to preaching, rather he directs with an objectivity that allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions.Quiz Show is an excellent film that I highly recommend, especially to see the razor-sharp performances of Fiennes and Turturro.--Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,History
The End of Innocence,"As a twelve year old growing up in Brooklyn, I did not even know the name of the show I was watching every week; to me it was just a vehicle to see if hero Charles Van Doren could hang in.  He was handsome, articulate, witty, and all the girls thought him incredibly attractive (although their pre-teen minds did not yet understand sexuality).  Growing up in a Jewish neighborhood as I did, Herb Stempel did not come off so nerdy as he looks now in retrospect.  When it came out that everyone had cheated, us kids felt not only betrayed, but sleazily cheated personally.  The girls felt somehow violated!Here Redford turns in an understated masterpiece.  He sets the stage and the standard, and gets fantastic performances from his actors:John Turturro as Stempel is excellent, but a fine job by Johann Carlo as his principled wife, which may be overlooked in such company, is the rock upon which his family can really rely.Ralph Fiennes, as the hapless Charles Van Doren, manages to get across his character's dilemma: a mere achiever in a family of ultra-achievers.  In any other family he'd have been prime, as a Van Doren he would always be an also-ran.Many have pointed out the great job of Paul Scofield as Mark Van Doren, Charles' father.  He is the epitome of the WASP-intellectual padrone.  And he has our sympathy when his son so sorely disappoints him and disgraces the family.David Paymer is excellent and believable as Enright, the unsavory producer. He makes it almost seem disloyal not to cheat!Bit parts are all little plums: Martin Scorsese as Martin Rittenhouse, the Geritol exec, smugly contemptuous of the public and the government.  George Martin as the network president, clearly Jewish, and just as clearly a ""Teflon Don"" in his own world.The scenes at the Van Doren estate are designed to convey investigator Goodwin's (Rob Morrow) culture shock and outsider status, and they represent the academic WASP world of the time accurately and wonderfully.All in all, a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A colorful, well-written portrayal of a forgotten event in the history of television","""Quiz Show"" is the type of movie that invites viewers to ask themselves how they would act under similar circumstances. If you were a contestant on a TV game show and the producers offered you a load of money to do a fixed show where you're given the answers in advance, would you do it? Or would you turn your back on the producers and walk away? In this film, Charles Van Doren does not walk away, but he does hesitate. As played by Ralph Fiennes, he's a bright, likable fellow who seems like a good man despite his willing participation in a fraud.The film is smartly written, tightly plotted, and populated by interesting characters. It is also entertaining. It unfolds like a great detective story, except that no murder has taken place. There isn't even any crime. As shocking as it may seem, there were no laws against rigging a quiz show back in the 1950s, because no lawmaker had considered that such a thing would ever happen. When the scandal came to light, those working behind the scenes who engineered the fraud managed to survive with their careers intact, and the people who suffered the harshest consequences were the contestants, who were simply pawns. That says something about the distortions of television culture, but this theme, among others, is nicely understated in the film.Director Robert Redford has a gift for finding the drama in seemingly mundane topics, but not in a contrived or manipulative fashion. The '50s quiz show scandal is the sort of topic that could easily have made for a preachy and artificial TV movie. It's a great credit to Redford's film that it doesn't contain any long moralizing speeches. Though the movie has many great quotes, the characters talk like real people, and the situations grow out of their personalities. We end up rooting for several characters at once. We want Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the lawyer sent to investigate the show, to succeed in uncovering the scandal. But we also feel for Van Doren, who almost comes off as a tragic hero. We even feel a little for the pathetic and unlikable Herb Stemple (John Turturro), the whistle-blower who's been bamboozled and humiliated by the producers.The movie works on the most basic level as simple drama, the high points being those scenes where Goodwin uncovers each new layer to the case. The first time I saw the film, I was put in mind of a detective story like ""Colombo."" There's no mystery, of course, since we know from the start who the perpetrators are, what they did and how they did it. But the labyrinth of corruption that Goodwin must probe is fascinating to behold.Goodwin naively assumes he's practically taking down the network (the movie hints that the scandal goes to the very top) even though no laws were broken. The situation has the feel of a conspiracy, the people talking in euphemisms like they were mob bosses or something (""For seventy grand you can afford to be humiliated""). The contestants themselves are no dummies: they are smart, knowledgeable people who could very well have been used honestly on a trivia show. The producers simply wanted to control the responses to make the show more dramatic. What made this unethical was the amount of deception it required. It's one thing to have entertainment that everyone knows is fake (e.g., pro-wrestling), it's quite another to pass off something phony as something real. Of course now I'm getting preachy, something I praised the movie for not doing. But that's exactly my point. In a lesser movie, there would have been characters explaining the distinction. Here, it's left to us to assess the situation. That's the best kind of movie, the kind that invites further discussion.Above all, the movie is about integrity and what defines it. Goodwin (in a classic reversal of our culture's typical view of lawyers) is the boy scout in the story, who says at one point that he would never have participated in the fraud if he were in Van Doren's shoes, and we believe him. But a large part of the film involves his relationship with Van Doren, a man he likes and doesn't want to hurt. His desire to protect Van Doren (but not Stemple) from ruin while bringing down the true perpetrators of the scandal leads to one of the movie's most memorable lines, when Goodwin's wife calls Goodwin ""the Uncle Tom of the Jews,"" because he's sticking up for a corrupt Gentile. We respect Goodwin and admire his reluctance to hurt Van Doren, but we, too, wonder whether he's handling the case with the proper objectivity.The movie has some interesting subtexts dealing with the anti-Semitism coming from Jewish producers themselves. In one scene, producers Dan Enright and Albert Freedman basically explain to Van Doren, in so many words, that Stemple is too Jewish for the show. This is a phenomenon I've rarely seen dealt with in the movies, possibly because there aren't too many films depicting the history of television.The film is often criticized for departing significantly from the facts of the case. For example, the real Goodwin actually played a minimal role in exposing the scandal. I can understand why those involved in the case may have resented these inaccuracies. But filmmakers do have dramatic license. Probably this film should have changed the names of the characters from their real-life counterparts, to reinforce the fact that it's not an exact account of what happened. The purpose of movies isn't to duplicate real life, but to reflect on real life, to gain fresh insight, and ""Quiz Show"" achieves that purpose with dignity and style.",10.0,Anonymous,History
TV's age of innocence ended with Quiz Show scandal...,"Robert Redford's brilliant direction and a quartet of expert performances make QUIZ SHOW a highly interesting, thought-provoking experience. Unfortunately, the end of TV innocence in the '50s brought us other game shows in recent years and real life survivor series that are guilty of shortcomings just as egregious in other ways but not to be discussed here. Manners and morals began a fast decline in the late '50s and only got worse with each decade, in my opinion.The real-life story of Professor Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), son of a famous scholar, Mark Van Doren (Paul Scofield) is told in a lively and detailed way with many sights and sounds of the '50s making the atmosphere look very authentic. When the less than charming winner of a TV show, Herb Stempel (John Turturro) is dumped in favor of the more charismatic Charles Van Doren, the story goes swiftly through a series of expertly written scenes in which all of the behind-the-scenes goings on are revealed and characterizations are sharply defined. In truth, the ratings game between Van Doren and Herb Stempel went on for many weeks before a showdown was reached.An especially touching scene shows Charles wanting to reveal to his father the truth about his upcoming appearance before an investigative committee--relaxing as the two have an informal midnight snack in the kitchen, but unable to tell his father (played to perfection by Paul Scofield) who is a symbol of unwavering integrity. In fact, Scofield is so good in his supporting role that it's a pity the script didn't expand his role to give him more screen time.John Turturro as Herb Stempel has the unfortunate task of appearing to be an obnoxious nerd, whose only redeeming moment comes at the end of the film when he realizes how destroyed Charles Van Doren is by the revelations. He never tries to make the character anything less than the boorish, self-absorbed fool he is and does an excellent job. Rob Morrow is sometimes less than convincing as the tenacious investigator.Despite its lengthy running time, it all moves along at a brisk pace under Robert Redford's outstanding direction. Well worth your time, although I can't say television has raised the bar very much since its fall from grace, especially with regard to daytime talk or game shows. Are audiences any wiser today? Maybe only Regis Philbin knows...",,Anonymous,History
Quiz Show,"QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10).The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way).Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.",7.0,Anonymous,History
What can I say? That's show business!,"The other day when I was renting movies I passed this one called Quiz Show, never heard of it, wasn't too sure if it would be good or not, so I figured I would just wait and check it out on IMDb. When I saw the rating I was very impressed, not to mention how this was nominated for best picture of '94, considering it was up against: Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and Shawshank Redemption, it didn't really stand a chance. But I rented this movie and I'm convinced that 1994 had to be one of the best years for films. Quiz Show is an incredibly impressive film by Robert Redford, which I didn't even realize that this guy could direct! The story is just a perfect one for any type of a debate conversation on what is right and what is wrong.21 is a popular TV quiz show in the 50's where they ask very hard questions and the guests win lots of money, Herb Stempel has been the reigning champion for weeks. But he's not exactly what you would call the TV hunk, he's got the ""radio face"". Charles Van Doren is a huge fan of quiz shows, so he auditions, and when the executives see him, they go crazy over him, he's handsome, he's smart, he's charismatic, and his family is famous. They tell Herb to ""dive down"" and get a wrong answer so that Charles can take over as the champion. Everything seems to go smoothly, that is until Harvard grad government agent Dick Goodwin is convinced that there's something wrong. He is determined to prove that the show is rigged and that 21 is ripping of America's intellects.Quiz Show is a great film, the acting, the picture, the editing, everything about this film is pretty much flawless. I couldn't believe that this film is not anywhere near the top 250, I don't see any problems with the film. But I know every film has a hater or two. But for me the film, acting wise, the film went to Ralph Fiennes, he did an incredible performance and was so touching during his statement to the jury. I just would highly recommend this film to anyone, this is a great film and Robert Redford did a terrific job.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Scandal in the 1950's by Robert Redford,"In the 1950's the law didn't protect as a good as it does today. Quiz Show movie was shown to the public in 1994. It dramatizes about the scandals in the show Twenty One because there was discrimination with Herbert Stemple who was a humble and smart person (nerd). In the Twenty One game, Herbert was playing with an opponent. In that game the host was Jack Barry who asked the questions to the contestants. They played for points, so the person who scored highest won the game. In that game Herbert won $64,000 dollars and after that he was still winning various games.The producers, who were Dan Enright and Albert Freedman, were seeing that the program didn't show the ratings that they wanted, so they expected that was for the nerdy guy who had a poor appearance. So Dan Enright and Albert Freedman contacted Van Doren, who was handsome with a good appearance, and was a college professor in the Columbia University. The producers met with him before the show to tell him that they were going to give him the answers because they wanted him to be the protagonist for all the shows. At the same time they talked to Herbert to tell him that if he lost the game they are going to put him in another show. So they played. When Barry asked him the last question and Herbert knew it, but he missed the answer and obviously Van Doren won.Van Doren was winning a lot of shows and making a lot of money in the easy way called FRAUD. Then appeared Dick Goodwin, who was an idealistic Congressional lawyer, and he got access to Van Doren. He was visiting him for several times and Goodwin started to suspect about why Van Doren was wining all the quiz shows. After that Barry was investigated in anywhere to try the proof that the Twenty One show was a fraud. Then Van Doren was tired about that he was doing and in the next show he told the producers that he didn't want to win with their help because it was to be a scandal for him and his family. So he lost the next game. Van Doren went to talk with his father and he was disappointment because his son was embarrassed his family with that fraud.So, Van Doren was embarrassed and he decided to say the truth in the committee meeting in Washington because he thought that is better for the people felt that he had deceived them. Yet he felt peace inside himself, and the producers were fired for the fraud. The Twenty One show was canceled.In my opinion, I didn't like the end of the movie because the law didn't work well because nobody went to the jail. If the people do a fraud they have to go to jail because they were wrong. In the movie Van Doren just said, ""I made a mistake and that's all"". And he walked way like he didn't do anything.In conclusion, sometimes the people don't make the money, the money makes the people",6.0,Anonymous,History
A wonderful film,"I watched this film for about the fifth time last night. I first saw it a couple of years ago when my mum brought it home, she'd picked it out of the bargain bin at the supermarket, and what a bargain!It is a superb tale, I notice some have said 'who cares it was just a dumb quiz show', well that is hardly the point, many films are made where, what was seemingly the subject is actually just a background for the real story to be told.Quiz Show is a brilliantly told morality tale, but that is not to say it preaches. It can get away with not preaching because the consequences of their actions didn't harm anyone. It doesn't say, 'if you do something wrong you will be punished'. It says 'If you do something wrong, can you live with yourself'. ""It's the getting away with it I couldn't stand"" Charlie says at one point.A classical tragedy of a man with the world at his fingertips who throws it all away at his own volition. As a classical Shakespearean actor Fiennes is perfect for the role.A wonderful intelligent and literate script, the pieces between Charlie and his father in the Athanaeum and at the picnic are wonderful.Subtle music and stylish presentation are the icing on the cake.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Fascinating funny start, bland middle part and a predictable ending.","This movie should have been at least an half hour shorter and should have ended with a bit more spark.
Acting is great though. Especially John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes perform excellently. But they cant save this movie from becoming a bit bland half way through. Still it is an enjoyable watch, but I must admit that although I have seen it several times I start skipping some parts in the middle. The story isnt very shocking to say the least, but it has become a fascinating movie nonetheless, that is to say the first half of the movie.The storyline: John Turturro, looks like a nerd and wins every quizshow episode. But the advertisers want someone younger and more attractive looking to boost the ratings. Enter Ralph Fiennes, a succesful white hansom teacher, who gets the answers to the questions in order to quarantee that he'll stay on the show in order to keep the tv ratings high. Will they find out the deceit? That is the suspense.Robert Redford succeeded in a beautiful portrait of the fifties, a period in which television was what the internet is nowadays.The sweetness and innocence of that period is portrayed beautifully, but the drama is lacking in this story and on top of that the movie lasts over 2 hours. For first time viewers this would be recommended if they wanted to see a feel good story about innocent fraud by a tv show quiz host.Could have been better.

A study in ethics,"Although `Quiz Show' is entirely concerned with morality and the nature of moral choices, I can't think of a single moment when it isn't obvious whether or not a character is doing the right thing.  There are no moral dilemmas whatever.  And a good thing too - thorny ethical issues would only turn it into an episode of `Star Trek'.  If you think a film needs to be confused about right and wrong in order to be interesting, watch `Quiz Show' and realise your error.Here's most of the ethics in a nutshell: the star contestants of a popular quiz show are cheating, with the connivance of the producers, the sponsor, and the network.  That they shouldn't be cheating is never in dispute.  The interesting questions are:  Why are they cheating?  and, What is it like for them, and how do they maintain dignity, when they're found out?  Of course, in an intelligent character study like this there are plenty of other questions.  I won't ruin your pleasure by giving away any of the answers. The best scenes, probably, are the ones in which a character must admit to someone or some group of people that he has cheated.  All these scenes are very good and each is handled in a different way.  But they're just cherries in a rich fruitcake.  `Quiz Show' is one of my personal favourites.  It was nominated for Best Picture of 1994 - an unusually fertile year - although the award went instead to some big dumb propaganda piece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
So tasteful it becomes mummified...,"""Twenty-One"", one of the most popular TV programs in 1950s America, is found to be fixed. Dramatization of the real-life quiz show scandal, adapted from Richard N. Goodwin's ""Remembering America: A Voice From the Sixties"" by Paul Attanasio, has no juicy scenes of nostalgia or melodrama. The movie has been so tastefully made by director Robert Redford, the dramatic center of the narrative barely comes to the surface. There's momentum here to keep the first hour interesting and engaging, but Redford allows the film's second-half to get bogged down in legalities when what we want is some behind-the-scenes fireworks. The cast of heavy-hitters (including John Turturro, Rob Morrow and Ralph Fiennes) and the cameo players are excellent, and the conception of the story is polished.

Great social commentary film,"Those of you who remember The Joker is Wild or other similar quiz shows in the 1950s and 1960s on television will be transported back in time during the film Quiz Show. Those of you who are a little younger will think Quiz Show is a very fascinating and creative film. But to my fellow young'uns, let me tell you this: it's a true story.This piece of social commentary that's sometimes hard to watch but has fantastic acting, well framed shots, and great scene transitions is directed by none other than Robert Redford, the master of all elements mentioned. Quiz Show really is an important movie even though it's the poster-child for the ""people are mean"" mentality. It was nominated for Best Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor at the Oscars, but John Turturro's and Ralph Fiennes's performances went unrecognized. But, it was released in 1994, the same year as Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption, so it didn't really stand a chance during awards season.In the film, Christopher McDonald is the host of the incredibly popular television quiz show ""21"". David Paymer and Hank Azaria are the show's producers. Martin Scorsese is an executive to the show's product sponsor. Everyone has a stake in the ratings, so when successful contestant John Turturro wanes in audience popularity, the network asks him to ""take a dive"". Will he do it? Will he tell the truth that the show is being rigged—and, more importantly, will anyone listen?While I kept asking myself, ""Why wasn't this Timothy Hutton?"" every time Rob Morrow was on the screen, the other leads gave excellent performances, most of them more likable in this movie than in any of their other movies I'd seen. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, and each time a new character's plight was introduced, my heart completely transferred its sympathy to him, a testament to Paul Attanasio's fast-paced and well-defined script. Every character was made to be both likable and unlikable; this is the type of movie that will make you talk about it afterwards.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Polished and professional drama,"The ratings of 1950's quiz show `21' are in freefall due to the dominance of dorky Jew Herbie Stempel.  The sponsors and network owners put pressure o the producers to replace him.  When WASP Charles Van Doren comes to audition for another show they offer to ask him the questions that he already answered at the practice.  Herbie is told to take a dive and Van Doren becomes an audience draw.  However when Herbie starts making noise about a fix, a congress employee, Dick Goodwin, decides to go after the network.This is a glossy, professional piece of work that sadly was never as huge as hit as it deserved to be (probably not enough explosions for the US audience).  The story is based on a true story that happened in the 50's and it's used here partly as a bit of history but also as a look at television in terms of it's most basic desire to sell and entertain at any costs  if that means fixing shows or getting the `right' ethnic groups on screen then s be it.  It is effective on that level because it's hard to imagine anything has changed since 1950.  The actual human drama comes between Van Doren and Stempel  the film makes them both real people, neither good nor bad but having a bit of both.Turturro is the best thing in this film.  His Herbie has so many levels which he must touch throughout and he does them all well  whether it's humour, pride, anger or realisation.  Fiennes is good but at times I did find it hard to be sympathetic with a WASP born into a lofty family who gets more given to him.  That said Fiennes did him well.  Morrow was a strange choice  famous at the time for Northern Exposure, he does a weird performance here  almost doing an impression of what he thinks a tough Noo Yark investigator would be like.  The supporting cast is filled out with quality so deep that even the extras are famous now! (Calista Flockhart turns up briefly).  David Palmer and Hank Azaria are good as 21's producers, Christopher Mcdonald is good as the host  people like Griffin Dunne, Mira Sorvino, Timothy Busefield and Barry Levinson come and go, and Martin Scorsese has a wicked role as the money behind the scandal.It works on many levels  at it's most basic it is a true story of great interest, at best it lets you see how television works and how men with money can rarely be reached for any wrong doing.  Working on so many levels this is a polished professional drama that involves from start to finish.",,Anonymous,History

propaganda,"I watched this again recently, and I was struck by the movie's dislike for John Torturro's character. Watching this ten years ago, I thought the characterization was pat but not subversive, but based on this viewing I've changed my mind. What I find loathsome is how far the filmmakers would go to contrast the Jewish Stempel with the WASPy van Doren, to the point of completely dehumanizing the former. It may be true that the real Stempel possessed all those physical and verbal tics that the director burdens him with, but Torturro does not (or is not allowed to) imbue the character with an ounce of quiet dignity in the way Fiennes so obviously does, and that upset me. In the eyes of Goodwin, the protagonist, and therefore in our eyes, Stempel's sole character trait is his ""jewishness."" As stereotypes go, this may be the worst kind, a well-meaning one that seeks to illustrate a big truth at the expense of small truth. Overall the acting was just OK, and Ray Fiennes' crucial performance leaves one cold, although Hank Azaria and Paul Scofield were very good in smaller roles.What this film exposes, yet again, is the toxicity of a certain kind of liberalism, dutifully espoused by Redford. In his heart, he wants nothing more than to be a van Doren, nothing less than to be a Stempel. In his wide-eyed buildup to the scene at the van Doren estate in Connecticut, where all those liberal lions gather, Redford is like a southern belle pining for the good old days; he likes things the way they were, and sees past (or rather embraces) the aloof ruthlessness with which they dismiss everything but their little games. Love for fellow man has been bred out of them along with all but the blue pigment out of their irises. Redford would do anything to be part of the clique up on that Olympus, and if mocking Stempel is what it takes, he'll do it.",6.0,Anonymous,History

We even started a game to see who could guess right whether he'd be using the awful accent or not the next time he spoke.

Much Ado About Nothing,"Do you ever watch a movie wishing all the main players could just take a cold shower and get over themselves? That's the way I feel watching ""Quiz Show.""As a depiction of the famous 1950s scandal that revealed contestants of the NBC quiz show ""21"" were being fed answers, ""Quiz Show"" brims with pretentious portentousness, from the opening scene where a car radio is switched on just as a report about the new Sputnik satellite is broadcast (an excuse for someone to actually say ""All is not well with America"") to the end credits where we hear a way overwrought performance of ""Mack The Knife.""Many of the acting performances are very good, especially Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren, the golden boy of ""21"" whose erudition is enhanced by pre-show prepping; Paul Scofield as his proud father Mark, who travels the lofty circles of intellectual society with admirable rectitude and the privilege of not having to worry about how to earn a living; and David Paymer as Dan Enright, the producer of ""21"" who justifies his shell game by talking about how his program advances ""the cause of education.""There are some terrific scenes in ""Quiz Show,"" most involving two of the three actors mentioned above, like when Enright first broaches the idea of feeding a shocked Charles the answers to the questions, and a gorgeously shot picnic at the Van Doren home in Cornwall, Connecticut, where the extended Van Doren clan throws obscure Shakespeare quotations at one another, basking in the beauty of their Updike lifestyle. Director Robert Redford displays an engaging subtlety in these and some other moments that reminds you why people were so impressed when he made ""Ordinary People.""But there's a reason why Redford made that instead of ""The Chosen,"" which becomes clear with his depiction of the film's Jewish characters. They are actually caricatures, and central to the story as the script puts a lot of weight on their distance from the aristocratic Van Dorens. One caricature, the jealous low-class Herbie Stempel played by John Turturro, rails about his intellectual prowess and the fact he was forced to take a dive as ""21""'s top contestant for ""Van Moron."" More obnoxious still is the assimilated caricature of Richard Goodwin, a congressional investigator of quiz-show corruption as played by Rob Morrow, so pushy he feels the need to tell even the guy selling him a car that he was first in his class in Harvard.When Goodwin hesitates to put Charles on the stand, his wife, an obnoxious caricature herself played by Mira Sorvino, accuses him of being an ""Uncle Tom of the Jews."" Actually, it seems an odd moment of understandable mercy from Goodwin, who otherwise ruins lives to improve his own in such a way its no surprise he wound up working for Bobby Kennedy.The Jewish issue keeps coming up, in the most heavy-handed contexts. When Goodwin tells Van Doren about being first in his class, Van Doren says he's surprised Goodwin doesn't wear it as a tattoo. Shuttered in a glass booth, Stempel wonders when they will drop the cyanide in. I almost wonder what kept ""21"" host Jack Berry (Christopher McDonald does a nice job with the role) from pressing Stempel with ""Is that your final solution?""It's just a quiz show, folks. Like Enright's assistant (Hank Azaria) tells the committee in the last lines of the film: ""We're not exactly hardened criminals here. We're in show business."" That Van Doren and others played fast and loose with the public trust is a matter for their own consciences, and hardly merited government interference. Because they were the only victims of their own crimes, the movie seems to implicate NBC and sponsor Geritol of the ultimate crime; frankly I see Goodwin as more blameworthy.Maybe Redford did, too, which is why Morrow comes off so obnoxiously in his film. But such divided loyalties do not help bring off a complicated story that is already overlong, nor explain why it is we are supposed to feel so sorry at the end for Van Doren and not Stempel. Is it simply because Stempel has bad teeth and a sidewall haircut? Or because Van Doren's ancestors came off the Mayflower rather than Ellis Island?Even when ""Quiz Show"" questions such elitism, it doesn't really puncture it, nor does the film explain why I should be so up in arms about what went on here. I just see a group of people on different power trips colliding into each other, and while it makes for some nice fireworks, it doesn't leave much to chew on.",4.0,Anonymous,History
TV tends to make the worst out of people,"This film was not so much an indictment of TV. It is instead a commentary of how TV tends to make the worst out of people. TV is not the problem itself-but those who run the networks, producers and sponsors. They bought into the philosophy that ""The ends justifies the means"" Just get the ratings-it doesn't matter how you do it-just do it. So, Enright and company decide to ""Just Do it"" and they did. And the result was the scandal that that this film documents.I always liked Robert Redford as an actor and director-even if I disagree with his politics-but here he made a masterful film about the unfortunate true story of game show scandals of the late 50's. It documents Richard Goodwin's(Rob Morrow in a somewhat odd casting)investigation into allegations that shows were rigged. When he dug deeper and deeper he found that it was true.Once Goodwin appears on the scene, Enright and NBC executives go in ""I got to protect myself"" mode. By attempting to blame everyone else and pointing fingers at others. Truth is, the blame for this scandal can not be pinned on one person or another. The blame is extended to lots of people.Herb Stempel and Charles Van Doren are not exactly guys in white hats. They both agreed to accept answers to questions in advance-and when Stempel was asked to take a dive-he did what he was told. I agree they were victims-but only because they agreed to be a part of the scandal and they were later dumped when the fraud was discovered. Van Doren could have been firm and refused to get on the show by dishonest means. Herb Stempel should have done the same thing. He also should have screwed the producers and give the correct answer to the question ""What picture won the academy award for best picture in 1955?"" ""MARTY"" That is what his wife wanted him to do but in the end he chickened out.The question towards the end of the film ""Who gets hurt"" Redford does not answer the question-but leaves it up to viewers to decide. I think it hurts every one involved in the scandal. Though no one went to jail, they were punished by society itself. I think Van Doren had a lot more to lose because of his family's reputation. He lost his job at Columbia Unisverity and never taught again-he was disgraced for life. He went to work for the encyclopedia Britannica-but he remains in seclusion to this very day. Stempel was hurt too-but he didn't have a reputation to protect. He went to work for the New york city transit department. I come to the conclusion that whatever damage that was done was brought on by themselves.Has TV learned it's lesson? Not really. I do think the TV audience has learned. I think People now know that not everything in TV Land is what it appears to be. People also know just how corrupt TV can make people-even those with the best of intentions can become corrupt.Maybe it was a scandal that had to happen to wake people up to the realities of TV-and without proper discipline and checks and balances-just how corrupt TV can become.Great Film by a great actor and Director-Rent or buy it today!",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Movie in a Little Historical  Context,"Wow, I sat glued to the screen for two hours without a break. That doesn't happen often, but the movie was that good, even with a one-note plot, and no action or romance. Yes, it did bring back 60-year old memories, sometimes fond, sometimes not. First a few words on historical context.In the summer of 1955, Revlon cosmetics experimented with a big money quiz show, not sure how it would work in prime network time. It was called the $64,000 Question. Up to that point, quiz shows, whether radio or new-fangled TV, offered only small amounts of prize money. So this was an unimaginable amount to offer. Not surprisingly, the show was an immediate hit, earning a permanent place on the CBS network. Viewers were clearly enthralled, especially when a delicate little Dr. Joyce Brothers showed off her expert knowledge of Boxing, of all things. Thus, it was possible for contestants to win not only big money, but become minor celebrities in the process, that is, if they caught the public's fancy.Of course, network programming being a commercial enterprise, imitators soon followed, the most successful (I think) being Twenty-One. Unlike $64,000, it had the distinction of two contestants competing against one another from inside the famous isolation booths. There viewers could watch them sweat as they pondered their answers. The format was also a come-on since most everyone had played the simple card game of being the first to reach 21 in point count. I think this format had the most built-in drama of any other TV quiz show, which by 1956, were at least several.The movie, of course, exposes the biggest scandal in quiz show history, which occurred in 1956-57 on Twenty-One. I was in high school at the time and never missed these shows. I think it's fair to say that practically all viewers believed the shows were honest—I know my family did. And that's even when quiz-whiz Herb Stemple missed probably the easiest question asked him, namely, who won Best Picture Oscar from just 2-years earlier. We all shouted ""Marty"" at the screen while he appeared terminally stumped, and we felt suddenly superior to this know-it-all. Likely, more discerning viewers suspected something fishy from that point on. But remember, this was the 1950's when, coming off a triumphal big war, most everyone still believed unquestioningly in authority. My friends and family certainly did. So when the rigged nature of Twenty-One was exposed in 1959, the public was generally shocked, especially as fair-haired boy Charles Van Doren was implicated. In fact, the big money quiz format was so discredited, it didn't revive for many decades.The movie itself amounts to a narrative triumph. Skillfully scripted, acted, and produced. The contrast between the nerdy-looking Stemple and the aristocratic Van Doren is striking. So, in retrospect, it's not surprising that producers Barry and Enright would see real ratings potential in a good-looking guy with a well-known family name. Fiennes's smirking Van Doren comes across as a rather slimy character once he's been compromised. Still, that scene of him amid the outdoor intellectual gathering is one a commoner like me can only imagine. As a result, I can understand how he could be seduced into establishing a reputation separate from his illustrious father (Scofield). Then there's the blue-collar Stemple harrumphing around his cold-water flat, having trusted the producers to come through for him after he took the humiliating dive. At times he's almost a comedic figure in his thrashing about.I guess my only reservation is with Morrow's casting as the bulldog investigator Jim Goodwin. To me, he doesn't project the kind of force necessary for untangling the shenanigans or tangling with stone walling network bigshots. But then, maybe he's intended to be a Peter Falk type Columbo with his disheveled appearance and mild manner. Be that as it may, the network honcho's are well cast and appropriately slippery as they seduce Stemple and Van Doren with prize money and promises of network jobs. Viewers can almost see their numbers-crunching brains in action. Tellingly, no woman is featured in the two hour runtime; and as an odd moment of curiosity, there's no indication whether Van Doren's successor Vivian Nearing was fed her answers or not.Anyway, the movie's fascinating in what it shows about the corruptive potency of TV ratings and commercial sponsors, a risky marriage that nevertheless endures. Thanks Robert Redford for reviving this sorry episode for generations later than mine.",,Anonymous,History

How Quiz Show play with people feelings.,"This is the movie from which we can learn many things and prepare our self to be smarter in life, because there will be many people coming across our life who will be like the characters which we have seen in the movie. I analyzed from this movie is how the studio producers of the quiz show, Dan Enright and Albert Freedman, take advantage of the people to make more money and get their quiz show a top rating in television and fool people.The thought, which came to me when I was watching the movie, is quiz shows were not popular at that time. Just to make them popular and make more money from the shows how people trap the people, who are in need of money or a job, and then try to take advantage of them. In this way, they are cheating people, breaking their trust and spoiling the meaning of QUIZ SHOW. We need to give respect of one idea and encourage people to participate. It is a saying that beauty is greater than brains. We have to give importance to both these things and have to respect for every human being on the earth.In this movie, I felt that how they were trying to play with people's feelings. When they were in trouble they did not even bothered about that person from whom they made so much of money and fame. They were so mean. Rather than helping, they ditched them, which is very bad and hypocritical. The thing I learned from this movie is never ever try people to take advantage of your weakness. Rather learn to fight against it to be more successful in life.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""We Want A Guy Who Looks Like He Can Order A Table At 21.""","I remember back in the day when the scandal of the rigged quiz shows came to public attention, in one of his monologues Bob Hope said that with all the investigations uncovering all the crooked doings on television the most honest thing on there was professional wrestling.It was quite the scandal back in the day, the producing team of Barry and Enright were far from the only ones rigging their shows. In one fell swoop nearly all the television quiz shows went off the air. For a long time the only ones you saw on television were Concentration, Password, and The Price is Right and none of them were for the big money that 21 and others were giving out.Poor Charles Van Doren he was just ahead of his time without knowing it. Today a guy like Herbert Stempel would never make it through the screening process. But he did back in the day and therein lies the tale.I remember it well from my childhood. Herbert Stempel, nerdy ex-GI who probably was a Democrat who voted for Ike just ain't cutting it on the Nielsen ratings. They need someone with glamor and when Charles Van Doren, scion of one of America's most glittering family of intellectuals and folks who were definitely madly for Adlai tries out for one of the Barry-Enright Quiz Shows, they think they've found their star. Stempel gets promised all kinds of stuff to throw the show, but his promises are welshed on.That does not sit too well with Stempel who starts protesting loud and long to the Grand Jury in New York County and finally to the Halls of Congress. Van Doren and his family are disgraced.I remember the attention given to the real Charles Van Doren. A matinée idol professor, he looked to have a golden future. I could have easily seen him running for public office at some point had the scandal never occurred.John Turturro as Stempel and Ralph Fiennes as Van Doren ring true to their characters, especially Fiennes as I remember Van Doren. There was an Oscar nomination for Paul Scofield who played Charles's father Mark Van Doren and Rob Morrow does very well as Richard Goodwin the Congressional investigator who reluctantly brings down a great liberal hero to be.Robert Redford did a great job recreating a forgotten piece of Americana and the times that accompanied it.

"""It got to the point where the most honest thing on Television was The Wresting Matches!""....... Bob Hope (in a monologue.)","As much as I find myself to be the Political Antithesis of the 'Sundance Kid', Johnny Hooker, Waldo Pepper and Roy Hobbs; I do admire most of his work, both in front of and behind the Motion Picture Camera. Mr. Redford' talents match up to his 'Movie Star Good Looks' and as long his directorial jobs avoid heavy handed propaganda for the New American World Socialist Party (the Michael Moore/Jimmy Carter wing of the Democratic Party); such as that LIONS FOR LAMBS (2007) project of his.However, 'Sundance' has proved that he can really give us a top rate 'Film', as opposed to just another 'Movie'. Just one cursory glance up and down his list of Directorial Credits, we find ORDINARY PEOPLE (Directorial Debut, 1980), A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992), THE LEGEND OF BEGGAR VANCE (2000) and today's victim, QUIZ SHOW (1994).The story here, in this film with the most generic sounding of titles, is that of the Television's Quiz Shows' rigging scandal of the 1950's. Accusations of TV producers' providing contestants with answers to questions that would later be asked as a part of a tensely fought on-air ""contest."" Though there had been some early rumblings about ""fix"" by disgruntled Ex-Champion on TWENTY ONE, Herb Stempl, no one seemed to give any credence to such talk until there was an angry contestant on the Daytime Quiz Show, DOTTO, got angered about being double crossed. This started small, but soon now-balled into an avalanche; engulfing not only DOTTO'S and its fellow daytime 'Minor League' programs, but it also reached its tentacles up to Primetime and to THE $64,000.00 QUESTION (CBS)*, THE $64,000.00 CHALLENGE (also CBS ), but also the Jack Barry-Dan Enright production of TWENTY ONE (NBC).Having been an eyewitness of 10 years of age, I can remember well how this series made its debut, doubling the number of ""Isolation Booths"" over THE $64,000.00 QUESTION'S one (1); they added the element of competition between two (2) contestants to the suspense of one contestant's sweating it out, racking his own brain in pursuit the answers. Its first few weeks on TWENTY ONE, we saw a parade of moustaches, scholarly looking spectacles and goatees; all decked out double-breasted and tweed suits. Locked in intellectual jousting, fighting to the ultimate gray matter finish, no one seemed to catch-on with the public, personality-wise . With none of these Albert Einstein and Dr. Zarkov look-alikes getting any sort of substantial advantage toward holding that coveted ""21 Championship Belt"", Emcee Jack Barry abruptly stopped and removed the 2 competitors; promising to bring them back at a future date. (A surefire ""Kiss of Death"", if you've ever heard one!) Enter the self-taught, super nerd, Herb Stempel (John Turturro).Herb racked up an impressive string of victories over the period of several weeks, managing to eek out wins over whoever came his way. The show was gaining a following, but the seemingly colorless Mr. Stemple was just not getting over with the public. His knowledge was admirable, of course; but lacking the charisma needed in the TV Business. TWENTY ONE needed a little tweaking to get it up to the level of a Star of the First Magnitude.Bring on Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes).Hailing from NYC, as was reigning Champion Stempel, he and Professor Charles were nothing alike otherwise. Herb was a Jew, educated in NYC's Schools and at the City College of New York, employed as some sort of clerical job. On the other hand, the WASP, Van Doren, was the son of a long tenured Literary Professor at the Ivy League, Columbia University. Charles qualified as an aristocrat, a blue blooded upper crust socialite. The Van Dorens no doubt, did not cross the Atlantic on board the Mayflower, but they surely were there when the trinkets were traded for Manhattan Island.Furthermore, the youthful, handsome and very eligible Charles proved to have a wide appeal to men and even wider sex appeal to the lovely, young ladies. Either way, Van Doren's entry into the fray created a super charged interest in all things academic. His face appeared everywhere, even on the cover of Time Magazine. ** So the nation was now witness a series of long, and drawn-out matches, all of which led them to ties, no decisions and great serialized TV fun and excitement. The ""Nervous Nerd"" Stempel vs. ""Prof"" Van Doren was truly a 15 Round Bout, winner take all.And finally the day, or rather, the evening came along when, at last the Van Doren-Stempel feud would be decided with Herb's answering ""ON THE WATERFRONT"", instead of the correct ""MARTY"". *** Mr. Van Doren began a long run in the King's Chair; one in which he lost a lot of weight and began looking frail and worn; until he also lost to whoever. Then it became readily apparent that a real problem existed and a Congressional Sub-Committee had convened with the purpose of getting to the bottom of things, PDQ.Yes, Mr. Redford, we heartily concur that this was a great production of a story that had to be told. Thanks Bob and by the way, who was this Mamie?

What won the Academy Award for 1955?,"Herb Stempel saw ""Marty"" three times but is forced to give an incorrect answer on ""21"", thereby allowing whiz-kid-in-the-making Charles Van Doren to take over as the champion of the show.  Herb's time in the sun is over but naturally he is trying to hang on to the fame, respect and money as long as he can.  Van Doren is then tempted by the same things but due to the behind-the-scenes mechanics of the show, is at odds with his conscience.This movie is about several things and they all meld into a great period piece which should be seen by anyone interested in a bit of a history lesson combined with magnificient acting and clear, crisp cinematography.Redford hired fellow directors Martin Scorsese and Barry Levinson for small parts, and got a great performance from everyone in the ensemble.  Of special mention is a scene when Charles Van Doren and his father share a piece of chocolate cake. Paul Scofield and Ralph Fiennes are especially memorable as father and son.

This movie almost has it all,"That TV-stations always have played a dubious role in the selection of their candidates isn't anything new. Only a couple of years ago there was a game show over here where some people weren't allowed because they weren't 'fit for the screen', a nice euphemism for saying that they were just too ugly. So that I saw this in this movie didn't surprise me. But giving the questions and answers to the contestants, that was really something new. But apparently it really happened, because this movie was based on actual events.In the late 1950's, an idealistic young lawyer who works for a Congressional subcommittee discovers that game shows aren't always played honestly. He focuses on two contestants on the show 21 and finds evidence for the fact that NBC and the sponsor have been screwing with the system. He interrogates Herbert Stempel, an ordinary working-class Jew from Queens and Charles Van Doren, a member of one of America's leading literary families, although he doesn't want to blame them for what has happened. He wants to nail the TV-station, but when the official hearings are held, the big guns escape and the true victims are the two contestants...If you only want one reason why you shouldn't miss this movie than I would definitely say that you should watch it for the acting. John Turturro is excellent as the Jewish, seemingly media crazy Stempel. But Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren, Rob Morrow as the lawyer,... all did a fine job as well. In fact, I find it very hard to say which actor did the best job, because I liked them all. Of course they would never have been able to give away such a performance if there hadn't been a well-written and very interesting script thanks to Paul Attanasio.Normally I don't say too much about the writer but this time I will make an exception to my own rule. The reason for that is because Paul Attanasio isn't just an ordinary screenwriter. He is also a movie critic and many of the critics always say that they know so much better what a script should look like, but this man actually proves it by writing a very good one himself. But a good script isn't of course all the work. Without the good direction of Robert Redford this wouldn't have worked either.All in all this is a very good movie that deserves to be seen for many different reasons. Some very good acting, a nice script, good direction... this movie has it all. The only problem that I had with it was that it was a bit of a slow starter. But don't let that be a reason not to watch it. It's a very fine movie and that's why I give it a score of at least 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Pride comes before the fall.,"""Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall."" Based on real events, Quiz Show is the tale of what happens when a beloved American past time turns out to be rigged. Young lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) stumbles upon a conspiracy behind the scenes of the popular game show ""Twenty-One"", that is used in order to keep the winners that get the best ratings to remain the ones on the stage.The film, directed by Robert Redford and written by Paul Attanasio off of Richard N. Goodwin's book, is elaborately staged, focusing on several different characters from Goodwin to ousted and unstable former ""Twenty-One"" champion Herbie Stempel (John Turturro) to the new reigning champ, the prim and well-educated Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes). It's set up like a Shakespearean work of true drama, and Redford constructs it in such a detailed and extensive way that it all feels so resounding. There's not a lot to stick with you after it's over, but the way he plays it is so grand and alive, with Attanasio's script so seamlessly weaving together the rises and falls of these men.The whole thing boils down to the male ego in a fascinating way, with each character letting their pride get the best of them at various stages of their careers. There's a lot of talk about their wounded spirits, about what it means to be a man, about showing the world their worth and the drama that ensues as a result is wonderfully entertaining. The performances are marvelous all around, with the standouts being Fiennes and especially the manic Turturro. They breathe such life into these intriguing characters. Redford orchestrates it all with a swift pace that never gets dull for a moment and always left me entertained and wondering what was going to happen next. A very fine picture.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A fictional account that I cannot abide,"What is the problem with Redford? Is he trying to ruin the lives of people or sully their memories at the expense of their surviving family memories families. Like JFK before it, I can only hope that those who watch this movie will seek the truth. It is not in this movie. Charles Van Doren was not getting back at his father. His father was a wonderful, not boring, professor at Columbia. The Geritol marketing director played by Scorsesee (sp?) was not aware of the fraud. And neither Van Doren nor Stemple lived the lives stated at the end of the movie--apparently to give it a dour ending. Redford commits the atrocities of money and capitalism that he said he was targeting. Redford, the fake mountain man, grew up in Santa Monica and is just another Hollywood virtue monger who should examine his own virtues before speaking about (er, fabricating) the lives and virtues of others.I will admit that when I first saw this movie, I thought it very good, but after seeking the truth, I cannot in good faith give it more than one star. I will not recommend movies that criminalize innocent men and besmirch admired professionals without evidence.If you are interested, there is a Hollywood history of such Constitutionally protected atrocities. You should also search out the truth about the wife of William Randolph Hearst portrayed as a worthless woman in Citizen Kane. She wasn't a worthless woman and she was living and crushed by the movie. Hollywood blames Hearst for killing this great movie, but if he did it to protect this woman, he is to be admired.Just because it is protected by the constitution doesn't make it right.",1.0,Anonymous,History
What a beautiful film,"This is one of the greatest films no one has ever heard of. It is unbelievably underrated, considering that it was directed by the well-known actor-turned-director Robert Redford and features such familiar faces as Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort in Harry Potter) and John Turturro, who is actually a fabulous actor, even though nowadays he is mostly famous for his kooky supporting roles in comedies. This is a well-written, well-acted film.

An Intellectual Movie about an Intellectual,"I understand that a few liberties were taken with the facts in this film. They always are. The fundamentals of the quiz scandal of the fifties, however, did come through. This is a movie about men and their integrity. From Herbert Stempel to Charles Van Doren we have a range. These men were both geniuses, but Van Doren was the son of one of or great poets and critics and Stempel was just, well, Stempel. We idolize our pretty people (nothing new). Van Doren, of course, had to eventually face the music or face jail time. There were two golden ages of television. The first was when Milton Berle and his ilk caused people to put away everything early and watch each week. Jackie Gleason was also a part of this. The second began when TV began to exert its power. These big buck quiz shows were all over the place and the advertising revenue became phenomenal. How could one not begin to see the orchestration going on behind the scenes when such money began to speak loudly? Like the internet today, the media had moved beyond the legal system. One had to almost ask: Did anyone do anything illegal beyond the basic limits of fraud. And if they did, who was harmed by it?The performances are wonderful here. Rob Morrow, who should be doing a lot more, is excellent as the bulldog investigator. Ralph Fiennes comes across so well as Van Doren. He has that little snobby accent down cold. We want to hate him, but he is part of a great family and so automatically demands respect. John Turturro as Stempel is a juggernaut. He knows what they have done to him and he is really offended. He is crash and boorish and smart. Not what TV really wanted. The scandal plays itself out in a believable, realistic way that is so nice to see. If you want a movie that requires you to see the entire issue and make your own decision, see Quiz Show.",9.0,Anonymous,History

""" If I already know the Question, is knowing the answer, really cheating? ""","From exceptional Actor/Director, Robert Redford, comes this insightful but true story called "" Quiz Show. "" Based on the book written by Richard N. Goodwin, it entails the revealing truth concerning the quiz shows of Early Television. Taken from the pages of Goodwin's book it relates how a weekly prize winner but, later disgruntle loser, like Herbie Stempel (John Turturro) a Jewish contestant became an overnight success, winning a great deal of fame and fortune on a weekly T.V. show called '21.' Loosing ratings, he is selected by network corporate sponsors and studio heads to be replaced by a youthful handsome, more personable and attractive contestant named Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes). Reluctant to know the inner secrets of the game, Van Doren, is surprised to learn he is to be given the answer to the hidden questions before they are asked, he initially refuses. However due to the flux of fame and money, he succumbs to pressures and plays the rigged game. However, when government oversight official Dick Goodwin, (Rob Morrow) begins to investigate suspected fraud, everyone involved feigns ignorance of possible cheating. Through diligence and persistent questioning, Goodwin eventually discovers multiple layers of deception and clumsy attempts of corruptions and makes a good attempt to bring down N.B.C.'s executives. The movie is superbly directed and the cast is equally superior in their quest to excel. As it result this movie becomes a Classic and the cast which includes Paul Scofield, David Paymer and Martin Scorcese makes it what it is, a winner. Easily recommended. ****",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not what I expected,"I must admit it's not a fantastic story.....quite tame for today's issues. The plot could have been a little more intriguing, meaning the core of the plot was divulged to the viewer earlier on in the film. I would have liked to have had some suspense, or surprises interwoven into the plot.Redford in my opinion has proved himself as an accomplished director in his own right over the years. I have no problem with his ability to direct, though I thought the screenplay could have been better, something Redford could have worked with to make it memorable. The actors were all capable and some were very impressive with their characterisations, though this doesn't save the film (for me anyway).The underlying aspects were dealt with extremely well. I was trying to imagine myself as a contestant and wonder how I would cope with the situation placed upon me like it was with the character; Charles Van Doren. I suppose there comes a time in everyone's life where the struggle between right and wrong is a constant battle to a certain degree, given the situation. The final overview I have is it is so difficult to question one's own judgment and integrity while being tempted by either money, fame or acceptance.Truly, I have to be honest.....I watched it (or should I say, I came back to it 3 times) I literally forced myself to finish watching it.

"Gripping fact-based drama,which is to the point but engaging nonetheless.","Often underrated, ""Quiz Show"" is a brilliantly detailed and well executed biopic of the infamously rigged quiz show ""21"". The costumes, set designs and atmosphere echo that of the late 50's and the storyline is strong enough to keep you engrossed for the 2 hour running time.The acting is often overlooked, which is a shame because it is indeed brilliant. Perhaps John Turturro is overly nerdish as Herbert Stempel ( very nerdy name) but so was the character in real life. Rob Morrow is very convincing as the lawyer hunting for the truth, Mira Sorvino equally impressive as his wife. Impeccably English Ralph Fiennes is seen here in one of his breakthrough roles and is excellent as Charles Van Doren.Periodic without being nostalgic, engaging without being over-long, thought provoking without being manipulative.

A historical essay about truth...,"This is a classy, intelligent and hugely entertaining drama about a seemingly forgotten part of television history. It's one of the smartest and most sophisticated films I've ever seen about the meaning of ""truth"" in a socially practical sense.Redford tells the (true) story about a fixed quiz show very thoughtfully. He passionately sympathizes with the side of truth, but he's also smart enough to not get out of his role as an observer either. He trusts the viewers to meditate about the subject themselves and to each individually draw conclusions about how meaningful and valuable ""truth"" really is in our current system.I've always been interested and fascinated about the ""illusion of truth"" and the practical side of lying. Everyone knows that being truthful and honest is the right thing to do as a human being, but paradoxically it also seems that, in our practical society, ""making your own truths"" can make you much more successful. It goes even further. When you're able to keep up a specific strong illusion of truth, you can even fabricate a situation where everyone involved seems to get an advantage out of it! It's only when the bubble actually bursts that most people start to realize that they prefer the truth over fabrications, even though it's sometimes hard to rationally explain why.I guess people are so angry when they are confronted with other people's lies, because lies can also produce very terrible consequences. It's impossible to truly draw a fine line between when it is acceptable and when it is not. A society would implode if there wasn't any ""certainty of truth"" anymore, because there would be no trust. A whole society can lose its credibility just as much as one individual can.You, yourself, can choose what kind of person you want to be.1) You can be one of the many people who tries to make a profit from that inevitable, immoral loophole in our society. The immorality of lying can be compensated by the generally good (personal) consequences those lies might carry with them.2) You can be a person who believes in the values of honesty and trust and who believes that those values are an inherent part of the moral foundations of a free society. Bending the truth to gain profits can have horrible, sometimes unforeseeable side effects, even if it's only in the long term.The most valuable thing this film may actually show, is that it is especially important to be aware of what both sides of the argument imply and ultimately may have in store.It's a very interesting film overall. It's well acted (the cast is fantastic), it's very solidly directed (I wonder if Redford got any tips from Scorsese, who played a small role in the film) and it has a very strong script about themes that will always be endlessly fascinating to me. Quiz Show managed to keep me entertained both dramatically and intellectually. I'm very much impressed and I strongly recommend seeing this film!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Quiz Show is the answer,"In 1958 millions of Americans tuned in to watch Twenty One, the quiz show where two intellects locked horns in a battle of wits. A question and answer format the first contestant to reach 21 points is declared the champion. The winner not only gets a cash prize they also have the chance to come back the following week to defend the title.Herb Stempel (John Turturro) - a working-class everyman from the Bronx - has been champion for 6 weeks. With an IQ of 170 he's a formidable contender. Lately, however, he has fallen out of favour with the producers and the shows sponsors. They are looking to inject fresh blood to boost ratings. Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), an upcoming contestant, is a perfect replacement. He's suave and sophisticated and handsome. Ideal TV material. But here's the problem, with the questions secured in a bank vault before the show airs, how can they knock Herb, a proverbial walking encyclopaedia, from his perch?The answer is easier than you might think.Based on a true story, Quiz Show depicts the events of the TV scandal that rocked the nation. With ratings on the line and corporate sponsors calling the shots, participants were fed the answers ahead of time. This ensured producers were in control of all aspects of the show, including who the winner was. Even the sweat on the contestant's faces was manufactured by turning off the air fans in the sound proof booths.But why would contestants go along with such a ruse? In the movie we see Van Doran initially turn down the offer on moral grounds. With the cameras rolling and the audience clapping, however, morality left the stage. Stempel on the other hand takes a dive because of the promise of a good job on another quiz show. Ironically, it's the network refusal to honour this promise that ultimately leads to the mess being uncovered.With Robert Redford at the helm this is a slick and well-polished movie. It explores the line between fact and fiction, honesty and integrity. It also asks the question what would you do? While none of what transpired was against the law, it was the first time the greedy underbelly of the TV entertainment business was exposed. And not for the last time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Might Be Redford's Best Film As a Director,"""Quiz Show"" is an interesting commentary by director Robert Redford which tells the story of the game show scandal in the late-1950s.  The popular game show ""21"" is rigged.  The big wigs behind the scenes are supplying certain contestants with the answers in the hopes of keeping the ratings high.  When one contestant (John Turturro) is ousted by another (Ralph Fiennes), the first whistle-blows on what really goes on behind the scenes. It is not pleasant.  It turns out that there is corruption through and through the show from its producers all the way down to the host himself. Rob Morrow begins the investigation and learns that this feel-good game show is not as fun and innocent as it leads you to believe.  His attempt to change the system hardly affects the quiz show business at all as they are still rampant today.  What is the point of Redford's film?  It is complicated in one sense but very simple in another.  In one area it shows that the most innocent looking things in life can be altered to create profits for those in charge.  However, it also shows that the dirtiest of things can still survive due to their popularity (regardless of their poor elements).  ""Quiz Show"" is one of those films that has more questions than answers.  In fact some of the questions may never be answered.  It's a thinking person's film that makes you think twice before watching ""Jeopardy!"" or ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"".  4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,History

brilliant,"I'm not sure why I'm so surprised that Redford made such a great film; ORDINARY PEOPLE is compelling, and certainly a showcase for great acting. But QUIZ SHOW is superlative.Much of the thanks can go to the screenwriters, who have fashioned a script which is fascinating, full of great scenes, rigorous, and propulsive.  The opening scene sets up the conundrum: we are a people who often smirk at what we're being sold (either in media or by other salesmen); still, we buy it, knowing full well it just ain't so.Paul Scofield is astonishing; Ralph Fiennes is outstanding.  Rob Morrow's accent is unstable, but otherwise he's not bad.  Redford's direction -- in spots, influenced by Scorsese (who has a good cameo) -- is nice and tight. Very good production design, as well.A very wise decision was made to move the father/son confrontation (the son's confession) from a restaurant to the father's classroom.  The Shakespeare-toned verbal sparring is wonderful, and when Scofield protests ""your name is my name!"" the impact is formidable.  Later, when the parents are standing by their son after his testimony, a reporter notes that the academics are meeting to discuss whether or not to let Charlie go; Scofield's brave face crumbles in such a way that we see the father hadn't even really considered this possibility, and a new nightmare is beginning to unfold.QUIZ SHOW is a movie with fierce intelligence.

Good But Overrated,"I remember seeing this many moons ago. I enjoyed it. But found it to be a bit overrated.Rob Redford is a talented director.

The story takes place at the zenith of the power of the packaged goods marketers as they wrestle the networks into submission. You don't see the ads being made or any overt presentation of the marketers at work. But they're there, behind the scenes; you can feel the pressure on the programmers.

After losing to Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a well-to-do intellectual in a family of intellectuals, Stempel begins to talk to the government about his life on the show, and that peeks the interest of a low level congressional subcommittee investigator, Dick Goodwood, played by Northern Exposure's Rob Morrow with a great Boston accent.

The TV show made its own rules, an advantage in that moment because the FederalGovernment didn't have a regulation.The people who were born to God worship, forgot God and started to worship the manwho got all the answers on the Quiz Show , putting in the first time Hebert Stempel andafter that Van Doren, with a better appearance and important family name. The war wasstarted between Stempel and Van Doren, they were fighting for the power, where afterseveral rounds, Stempel delivered the answer to investigator Mr. Richard Goodwin, theparticipants were getting the correct answer.Mr. Goodwin was trying to discover something wrong in that kind of Show, becausefor every body was impossible to answer all the questions, including big names of theEducation. After that Mr. Goodwin got all the evidence and carried it to the investigativeCommittee of the U.S Congress.The Society after the big scandal was hurt, sad, because they put all attention on the''hero'' Van Doren and they discovered he was a fake hero.Julio Freitas Brazil",9.0,Anonymous,History
Television Was On Trial!,"I watched this movie in my Video Lit. class, when we where watching 1950's Television and watched ""Quiz Show"" because it was about 1950's Television Quiz Shows.  Well we had to do an essay on the movie and i thought wouldn't it be cool to put it on IMDB.com, so here i go:In the 1950's television was new and the shows where good but you never saw it really effect people in anyway.  That was true untill games shows from radio came like Twenty-One and 64,000 Question.  In these shows you can see real people winning money and it's effecting their lives.  When watching the show you see people like yourself answer questions that they might not know, and you never knew who was gonna win.  That is why quiz shows where popular in the 1950's.Then in the 1950's the people found-out of a scandal.  When a show like Twenty-One was giving the answer to contestants on their shows so they could have reoccurring contestants.  The people's vision of real people of the street was ask questions to see what THEY know, and not just to see reoccurring contestants.  They were lied to, and they did not want that.  In the outcome, game shows weren't watched.One big argument of the show is that some people think that NBC who showed ""Twenty-One"" and Gertiol who sponsor the show should've got punished. Since the manager of the show said that he never told either NBC and Gertiol of the answer giving, they weren't.  Personally i don't know what to think, Gertiol i don't care about, but NBC i do.  They bring us great shows like ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Friends"", ""Just Shoot Me"", etc.. and they might not be if it wasn't for NBC.  But then on the other hand NBC was running this show and should know of everything that was going on, so in which I can't decide!Now, after awhile that game shows where still going on, but not a real popular hours, they made a come back to primetime.  Shows like ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"", ""Survior"", and ""Greed"" became hits, because now shows know not to lie to the public, or at less we hope they do.  Even the show ""Twenty-One"" made a come back, but i never left the ground.It depends on your viewing public for trust.  Now there are shows that we know aren't real, but they are still hits.  Shows like ""The Jerry Springer Show"" (talk show) and ""WWF"" (wrestling) we know are fake and staged because they told us, and people still watch it because it's what they like. The there are shows like ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" and ""The Rickie Lake Show"" are shows that the viewing public wants and believes are real.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This movie was simply fantastic.,"I am always impressed when a movie can be made where you already know what happens, but it still keeps you interested (i.e. Apollo 13).  This movie does just that. The acting was truly remarkable.  John Turturro puts together another outstanding performance as Herb Stempel.  His character is what initially grabs you in this movie.  Rob Morrow, who prior to this movie I was no fan of, was also terrific.  Although his accent my grate on you, his delivery and timing is perfect as Dick Goodwin. Many people that I've spoken to about this movie have been afraid to watch it thinking they would be bored.  I begged them to do so and they were rewarded.

A Quiz Show where only the audience wins.,"""Quiz Show"" is a dramatic dissection of the 50's NBC quiz show scandal. An excellent production in general with the ""feel"" of a theatrical docudrama, the film does a good job of showing the nebulous nature of corruption; the blurring of good and evil, the compromising of moral precepts, the ""whistle blowing"", the covering up, the rationalizations, and the rest of the dialectic which all such scandals seem to follow. (eg: Watergate, The Insider, Erin Brocovich, etc.) ""Quiz Show"" has no clear winners with the exception of the audience.

Way overrated,"I think narrative films about real events should be judged against the drama of the underlying factual story. I find reading about the real story more interesting than watching this movie and I am not into reading much. It is always sad when someone ruins a great story with potential by making a poor movie because then it is impossible for someone else to redo it. This film is an argument for why actors should act, not direct. As other critics have pointed out, this film lacks intensity. The real characters were more interesting than the make believe ones in the movie. I guess truth is stranger, and more entertaining, than fiction.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A Great Dramatic Telling of a Classic American Scandal,"Herb Stempel (John Turturro) is America's everyman, with the exception that he knows everything. The star of ""Twenty One"", he is asked to take a dive in exchange for a new contestant -- a more handsome Gentile with a notable family. He does take the dive, but soon regrets it and calls the local district attorney to investigate. Next, Congress gets involved and things snowball from there.Based on a true story, this was well before my time (1957-1959). But the idea is timeless... a heroic Congressional staffer who stands up to power to keep things honest for the American people. America needs more idealists like Dick Goodwin. And the story, which sells itself, is made even better with this stellar cast: John Turturro, a grossly under-rated actor playing Herb. Ralph Fiennes as Charles VanDoren. Dick Goodwin played by Rob Morrow (Joel Fleischman on ""Northern Exposure""), whose name is unfortunately not well known in film -- he really grabs the reins of this picture. Hank Azaria also appears, and Robert Redford directs. Martin Scorsese, Calista Flockhart and Ethan Hawke cameo.I've seen some complaints that the historical accuracy is a bit off on this one, but as near and I can tell it's about 95% right. And, folks, it's a movie. Entertainment. As Redford observes, if it was to be 100% accurate, he'd make a documentary and not a drama. Certainly there's some irony to all this -- a film accused of distorting the truth for entertainment being about a game show distorting the truth for entertainment. But, you know, I never felt deceived -- anyone who enters a movie ""based on a true story"" who expects perfection is grossly naive.I could go on and say how well-done the sets and costumes were for making this appear appropriate to the time, or how much I enjoyed the portrayal of VanDoren's father. But the important part is this: the film was nominated for multiple Oscars, and this is one case where it deserved to win the ones it was nominated for. A powerful film -- engaging, dramatic and suspenseful. Like ""The Insider"" or ""Thank You For Smoking"" for the entertainment industry, a far less obvious sinister force than Big Tobacco.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Rotten apple-pie,"It is not just that we have been lied to, the film suggests; that the average schmuck plucked off the street, or even the photogenic all-American pillar of ethos that followed him, did not grasp the Dream with hard work or quick wits, but were rather the corporate stooges fashioned to con viewers. This is fine, Hollywood actors were groomed after all in the stardom that was meant, in one of many ways, to represent the plausibility of that Dream.But these people, so the story goes, conned viewers out of the reality of the frame; this is where it begins to really hurt. It is not that people expected television to be reality, a show was understood to be a product of fancy. But more, that people implicitly trusted their eyes to tell them what's what. Remember, all this was back in '57, and for the most part there wasn't even a New Wave to challenge erudite film-goers at Cannes or Venice about the artifice of the filmed image, much less the broad American audience sitting down at nights to watch a quiz show.So, it was all thought to be true as far as the eye considered. Into this staged reality about ephemeral glories and vain fixations comes the Redford film; by recasting the staged image inside another staged image - the TV show inside a detective film murking for truth against artificial realities propped up by an immaculate surface -, it re-appropriates what is essentially scathing about the actual events.Oh, the final vision is a user-friendly cynicism, such as has infused everyday life since the days when we discovered just how powerless, pointless we could be in the face of the grand schemes. It is very fittingly staged as a court-room trial; where, once again, there seems to be a script, audience participation, and actors performing, seducing with treacly soliloquy or stentorian morals. The important battles being fought are swept aside into the spectacle, the purely superficial, as in TV.So, eventually the unimportant fall-guy assumes all the blame, and the powerful higher-ups at the network and sponsor get away scott-free. And this is why it's all so scathing in both directions, up and down; they get away, but we know - and can, with hindsight, make the films about it. The cost has been our disillusionment with the media landscape. They're all meddling with the truth, of course, or are in cahoots with who serves their interest. This has been our revenge; even the slightest hint of rumor can damage public opinion, the network owner explains. So, the apple-pie has been rotten to the core.It is a fine film, story-heavy, the era minutely recreated, with some little imagination that moves. When the quiz show whiz scheduled to lose looks out from his box, about to answer wrong, we see the promise of TV lights reflected on his glasses.And there is some marvelous stuff about a son who has lived life with borrowed images from the father and now has to re-assert his own - by investing himself into a TV fantasy where every image is a fake. His deliberately wrong answer that would extricate him from the self-indulgent fantasy is about Belgian kings; he answers King Leopold who is the father, when the true answer - which he knows - is the son.",,Anonymous,History
"Quizically enough, I liked this movie","Strangely enough, I liked this movie. Now, I say strangely because I am definitely not a fan of quiz shows, especially those similar to Jeopardy in which you have to be of genius status to be in the game, let alone win. But alas, I am intrigued by conspiracies and the uncovering of conspiracies, no matter how trivial. This movie held my interest just because there was the air of foul play throughout and I wanted to see if and when the cover would be blown, and also whose head would be on the chopping block for it all. I found myself even more interested knowing that the movie was based upon a true story. Bravo to Robert Redford for his role as a director. I had no idea he directed this movie at the time, but I'd say he hit a ground rule double with this production (not quite a home run, but long enough to hit the ground and bounce over the wall).",7.0,Anonymous,History

An Excellent Movie!,"Are game shows really rigged? I remember watching this week that ""Jeopardy!"" ace Ken Jennings who won $2 Million last year from seventy-four games, lost to another opponent in which throughout the final games, Ken wasn't the same as he would answer quickly in previous games, but would make goofy faces as he loses. In Robert Redford's film, we discover how the producers of NBC's Twenty-One rigged every contestant on the show where eventually somebody would find out.The name of the game is Twenty-One and like ""Jeopardy!"" itself, the game show has various categories from history, science, math, movies, etc., and the champion is Herb Stempel (gifted actor John Turturro) a Jew living in Brooklyn who has won over various tournaments with a winning streak of over $100,000 where he knows all of the commercials by heart, and is being bribed by producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) so that way the show can get a new contestant who is better looking and not that hideous to TV viewers.During interviews for contestants, a pretty boy WASP teacher name Charles Van Doran (Ralph Finnees) tries out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough were Enright tries to get Van Doran into the show Twenty-One to beat Stempel, and decides to go through with it, just because Enright B.S'd the cause of education to him.Now after Van Doran has beaten Stempel, Redford shows the audiences the ups and down of a successful individual having fame, getting the answers from the producers, and losing the persona he once had.Attorney Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow, another gifted actor) reads Stempel's article about Twenty-One being rigged, so now Goodwin is investigating whether the incident is true or not and if Van Doran is being fed the answers from Enright instead of looking the answers by himself.""Quiz Show"" is not just a movie, but a document on what goes on the inside of a game show where the next time you watch a game show, you ask yourself: Are these people actually smart, or are they just being fed answers like everybody else? Are game shows discriminative towards people of genders and races? Or for the matter, is Ken Jennings really smart, or did Alex and the gang from ""Jeopardy!"" feed him the answers and later played him a fool?",10.0,Anonymous,History
'Quiz Show' reveals quite a few truths,"In the era of reality TV, we're used to the blurred line between fiction and non, but in the early days of television, the public was easily suckered in by the grandeur of that magical living room box. ""Quiz Show"" examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism.Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons.The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show ""Twenty One."" Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, ""take a dive"") by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture.Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up — everyone wins.The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth.""Quiz Show"" isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the ""slight"" transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really?Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too.""Quiz Show"" paints an honest portrait of ""the business"" back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as ""it's what the people want."" Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. ""Quiz Show,"" even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier. In that sense, how much of a scandal was this really?~StevenThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more!",8.0,Anonymous,History

Old Time Film Making from Mr. Redford,"This film really does look like it was shot and made during the 1950s. Be it the sets, the dress, the attitudes, etc.. Moreover, this film also shows us where America start to go wrong. Right at that moment when the Beast that was television was starting to grow up. Based on the actual scandal involving the hit game show of the day 21, this film shows when producers made the decision to forsake integrity for ratings. However, what is really special about this film, are the performances, primarily from Fienes, Turturro and the real-life Charles Van Doren. They are so moving and powerful, especially Turturro. This is a classic film that asks the audience to take a hard and educated look at when TV went wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I LIKE this movie !!!,"I can't explain exactly why, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I've just watched it about 3 times on Comcast OnDemand.First of all, the song 'Mack the Knife' sung over the closing credits is worth the price of admission. The slow tempo of the rendition over the slow-motion scan of the studio audience is compelling.Did anyone notice that two of the card players have played defense attorneys on TV's 'Law & Order'?For some reason, I really, really enjoyed Rob Morrow's portrayal of Dick Goodwin. Morrow had kind of a flinty look in his eyes; his accent (presumably Brookline, Massachusetts) was kind of gritty through the entire movie as was the cigar chompin'. Were those his real eyebrows? IMHO, a very appealing performance.I also liked the development of the Charles van Doren character. 'Charlie' started out kind of bemused and innocent, turned increasingly cynical as the deception progressed, and then had another brief moment of child-like joy as he left the game show.Also, I don't think the Mark van Doren character was nearly as stiff as some folks have commented.",9.0,Anonymous,History
4 Stars!,"Quiz Show is a really thought-provoking and engaging period piece about a TV show scandal from the 50s. Rob Morrow plays Dick Godwin, an investigator for a congressional subcommittee, that reads an article in the paper that grabs his attention about a closed-door judicial hearing about a show he enjoys watching. Looking for a good challenge, Godwin decides to investigate the case and see if he can take the famous quiz show ""21"" down.Morrow is aided by a show's former contestant Herbie Stemple, played by John Turturo, a blue-collar Jew trying to make ends meet and is enraged, both by the fact that his 15 minutes of fame are up, and also by the fact that the producers of the show made him take a ""dive"" when his ratings were up. Godwin is eager to go along with Stemple until the ex-contestant claims that the show's current reigning champion, Ivy League college professor Charles Van Doren is cheating. Morrow, a Harvard graduate himself, has befriended Van Doren in his investigation and starts to ask himself what's really going on? The beauty of the movie is that we're asking ourselves that question as well too, as the script cleverly keeps some of the secrets from us until a little later in the movie.The movie's moral frame interestingly rests on Morrow's character Godwin, who clearly has a better sense of right and wrong than anyone else in the movie, yet isn't quite sure what to do with them. When someone asks him, `If someone offered you thousands of dollars to appear on TV and cheat on some questions, and no one would ever know, would you do it?' Godwin unflinchingly says he wouldn't without a second of hesitation. The movie's suspense comes from Godwin's search for clues, but there's an anticlimax here because he solves the puzzle but when it's all over, he finds himself looking back and wondering if his efforts really changed anything within the system. Herbie Stemple has a similar anticlimactic moment as well.This film is one of my favorites just because of the overall attention to detail. A lot of the suspense and drama is cleverly drawn out and the sets have an authentic 50s feel. More than anything else, I think the characters are really just engaging and that just helps keep us gripped on the drama. For example, Charles Van Doren seemed to me a creation that goes against so many Hollywood stereotypes. Most good looking guys in movies have girls with them, but Charles Van Doren never really had a love interest in this movie, except for a couple fractions of scenes where he's taking out a girl, most of the time he talks about how too many girls crowd around him. He also seems to like and admire his dad more than most adult sons do, at least as seen on screen. Those characteristics of Charles Van Doren struck out at me, especially because of his eagerness to befriend Godwin more than he really need to if he was doing it entirely for ulterior motives.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A good legal drama based on real events,"3/4Back in 1957, there was a scandal concerning a game-show called ""21"". The producers of the show were working with the contestants to rig the show by providing the favored players with the answers to the questions. ""After all, it's a show.""Robert Redford's account of the downfall of game-shows is very intellectually stimulating. It provides an all-encompassing glimpse at each individual character leading up to the trial. Every characters motive is reconciled with the audience as it builds up to the conclusion (It's rare that you see this in movies similar to Quiz Show). In my perspective, no character was either a protagonist or antagonist. This is a rare example of where the dilemma is arguable to both sides. Kudos to Redford.Most of the preformances are good, with Morrow giving the undisputed standout. The producers' efforts seemed lacking in authenticity at times, but they did their roles fine. I found the characters to be little developed past their time on screen, which slightly marred the movie for me.There are quite a few questions left un-answered for me. Most of them involve the final court case, because it felt slightly sped through in the midst of the rest of the movie. A bit more resolution and clarity in general would suffice, without being redundant.Quiz Show is entertaining, informative, and historical. They take fewer liberties than most true-story movie renditions, which is a plus in my book. It also never feels to keep you engaged.",,Anonymous,History
Enthralling and ultimately quite depressing,"The line between reality and fiction in television has always been a blur. Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation.In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case.Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the ""Uncle Tom of the Jews"" is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that ""audiences forget, corporations don't"". The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process.Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film.What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,History

Something Special,"This is one of my favorite films of the 1990s.  The movie as a whole is not perfect, but there are certain scenes which are nearly perfect.  I'm a fairly pessimistic moviegoer, but in those near perfect scenes, the acting, dialogue, character interaction, and cinematography are all very impressive. It is apparent that this movie was made by skilled, intelligent people. This is a movie that requires a brain to watch.  If you want effects, look elsewhere.  If you enjoy excellent use of language and character development, this movie is for you.  The power in this movie is that it portrays real people dealing with real issues of personal integrity.  The tension that is created in some scenes over such issues is very powerfully and masterfully done.  I RARELY give movies a 10, but this one is something special.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An acting masterpiece,"There have been only a handful of movies in the last 15 years where I've thought about the performance for days after and thought, ""how did that actor nail down that character so well?"" But John Tutorro's Herb Stempel is an acting masterpiece. It's significantly better if you've seen at least eight other roles by Mr. Tutorro, including must-sees Knish in Rounders, Jesus in Big Lebowski, and Julian in The Color of Money...But those roles merely show Tutorro's range...they don't hammer home his acting skill. This performance turns Tutorro into the character of Stempel. He is the highlight of this very good movie and turns Quiz Show into an absolute must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Superb,"An absolutely superb movie, a movie that's about ideas ultimately and in this case questions of integrity and the value of television and what we can believe and trust. The production design, costumes and music are superb but it's the script that's really terrific, we're taken inside the unfiltered truth of TV in the 1950s where all is not quite what it seems. What I like about the movie partly is it writes its characters as real people not as stock types or clear cut good guys and bad guys. The performances are great and without even noticing it the focus switches from contestant and their story we follow to the Washington investigator who just won't stop. The film is also a return to a time when the idea a TV station would value ratings over truth was a shock, it is also a warning on the power of television. I'm so happy when I find a film like this, one of such high quality it reminds me why I love cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Ethics For Sale,"Quiz Show, directed by Robert Redford, is a story of the quiz show scandal of the 50s, an era now seen as nostalgic and a more innocent time. Gullible would be the better description. As television came into more middle class homes of suburban tract house dwellers, the family hour centered around game shows and trivia buffs who wanted to guess my line, play 21, and name that tune. What viewers didn't know was the extensive corporate monies that manipulated who accessed the growing nation's airwaves. Geritol, Encyclopedia Britannica, and cigarette advertisers virtually controlled television and awareness of the public. Advertisers poured millions into television programs like 21, a quiz show that pitted contestants, many with extensive educational backgrounds, against the Joe Schmo underdog, Herbert Stemple. John Turturro plays the irritating, celebrity-obsessed Stemple to a T. When investigated by D.C. congressional snoop, Dick Godwin (Rob Morrow) for questionable practices, the corporate door is slammed. However, when the golden boy Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), from a family of academic elites, is outed by the envious Stemple, the quiz show hoax becomes a televised national event of disgrace.Redford's expose is a morality play within a film about television that is a superior story of ethics and capitalism run amok. How the American public was snowed by the medium and corporate manipulation of geek Stemple, a man with ""a face for radio"" versus the upper-class Van Doren, and Godwin, an ambitious Harvard man who believed in the American justice system is the triangle and grand story.Redford does not over look the numerous details of an era when Ike and Mamie were chic, the GI-Bill was a means to making a better life for the millions of returned veterans, and Geritol guaranteed freedom from tired blood. It is a tale of the past as corrupt as today, but without the internet, cell phone camera shot, and bloggers to give us an instant condemnation of celebrities with feet of clay. Redford's warning is as valid today as then.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great film!,"Most ethical decisions, unlike most of those seen in film, are not life and death, though they are important....that is the beauty of this impressively acted and written film. Most people probably consider this film boring because the action is quite cerebral.....it deals with motivations, human weakness, the problem of living in the shadow of greatness, as well as the beginnings of the ""staging"" of what the public wants (WASP vs. Jew), instead of what is right, that continues to this day in the media.I am not a fan of Robert Redford, and like very few of his films because they are usually politically motivated.  However, this film was great, and highly underrated.  This was one of Ralph Fiennes first films after ""Schindler's List"".....he has played two very different characters...one that never realizes his immorality, one that does.....they were both great performances by a gifted actor.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A 1950's Scandal,"Hats off to director Robert Redford who produced this film about a true story which occurred in the 1950's and involved a game show where questions where answered and to one person the answers where given. Game shows were a great thing to early Television and over fifty million people watch this show and saw Herbie Stempel, (John Turturo) and Ralph Fiennes, (Charles Van Doren) compete in a quiz contest and this went on for quite a long time and when it ended Charles Van Doren was the winner. There was an investigation into this show because rumors were starting to circulate and Van Doren was even going to tell his father, Mark Van Doren, (Paul Scofield) that he was fed the answers to questions but he just was not able to tell the complete truth. Of course there is a big investigation and the public eventually finds out the complete truth. Great acting by Ralph Fiennes and Paul Scofield. Entertaining film.",8.0,Anonymous,History

I will never look at a quiz show with the same eyes I had before I saw this movie.,"Directed by  Robert Redford who was nominated for an Oscar. Redford in my opinion is great director. He has the eye for it! Brilliant writing by Paul Attanasio, who was nominated for Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. This is a true story, which makes this movie even more interesting.John Turturro (The Big Lebowski) is just outstanding in the part of Herbie Stempel, who has been winning the Geritol Quiz Show, and really gets addicted to the attention. The favored contestants had the answers before hand, but Herbie is asked to lose to a successor Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient, Schindler's List) Charles Van Doren. Van Doren is a lovable, well bred, educated, nice looking young man who teaches literature at Columbia University, and that infuriates Herbie, who hates him.Rob Morrow (Northern Exposure, Last Dance) plays Dick Goodwin who is an attorney with the Federal Government working for a Congressional subcommittee investigating the scheme in the late 1950s. Morrow and Van Doren are of Jewish background, and Goodwin likes Charles Van Doren and wants to protect him.  His wife Sandra Goodwin, Mira Sorvino (Jake's Women, Mighty Aphrodite), even tells him about over protecting Van Doren. After many lies and cover ups, there is a congressional hearing and everything is brought to light. All this with Redford master touch directing.Look who is acting in the role of one of the sponsors of the quiz show! It is the talented director and N.Y.U. Professor, Mr. Martin Scorcese. Scorcese was one of Oliver Stone's (Any Given Sunday) teachers at N.Y.U. He is also excellent at that as well.Favorite Quotes: Charles Van Doren: ""I flown too high on borrowed wings."" A Senator:"" An adult should simply not be commended for telling the truth."" Favorite Scenes: The Van Doren family picnic with everybody quoting poetry, Van Doren father and son,  sharing a piece of chocolate cake and a glass of milk and their dialogue, Van Doren Jr. purposefully losing the contest.The music is great as well.

One of the best movies ever about American Jews,"Quiz Show portrays various Jews of the 1950's with great brilliance: (1) John Turturro is a ""schlimazel"" -- Yiddish for someone inept and unlucky. Turturro plays an intelligent man, a striver, but also a failure. He is very cynical. He is dishonest, but not really such a bad guy. He will never be fully integrated into American society. He will always wear a sign around his neck reading ""Jew"". ""Jew"" because he makes no effort to hide his Jewishness and because he fits antisemitic stereotypes: clever, dishonest, hook-nosed and ugly.(2) Rob Morrow is Turturro's opposite -- well-educated, good-looking, and highly successful as a hotshot young government lawyer. Morrow thinks highly of himself. He is super-ethical and is offended by other people's dishonesty. He greatly admires the Van Doren family -- the ultimate academic WASPs with a WASP house and WASP speech and WASP attitudes -- in principle above the dirty game of making money, their minds set on higher things. Morrow can integrate if he wishes -- but at the price of giving up much of his Jewishness. His wife sees this clearly and objects.(3) The producers of the rigged quiz show are Jews, as is the owner of the TV network. These characters are dishonest, indifferent to morality, and highly successful -- especially the owner, played with spine-tingling accuracy by Alan Rich.In contrast to these Jews is Charles Van Doren, played by Ralph Fiennes. He is tall, handsome, and American (i.e., a Gentile). He is like Morrow in being well-educated. He is like Turturro in being dishonest. He is even more dishonest than Turturro, since he is also a hypocrite.I have known all these characters. They are highly familiar to me. I can attest to how close to reality they are. The movie nails them. It gets them exactly right. A triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A superb film: the best I've seen in recent years.,"Paul Attanasio's screenplay is taut, intelligent, subtle, beautifully paced.  This is a morality play, the offenders being not only the contestants and their producers, but also the sponsor, the network and ultimately the quiz show audience.  And it's not over until the scene that accompanies the final credits.  The acting at every level, from principals through other important characters to bit parts, is outstanding.   Ralph Fiennes conveys the charm, intelligence, poise and moral weakness of the Van Doren character.  John Turturro and Rob Morrow are excellent foils, playing roles that are not quite as difficult with great skill.  The two producers are a smoothly choreographed duo, like a veteran pair of used-car salesmen. Paul Scofield is deft and authoritative as Van Doren's father.

The Black Sox Scandal of Early Television: Outstanding Snap-Shot of the 1950's,"Millions of television viewers thought they were watching legitimate knowledge competitions, such as ""the $64,000 Question"" and ""21"", in which the contestants were being asked difficult questions supposedly sealed in a vault. What the public didn't know was the producers did not perceive they were broadcasting competitions but rather entertainments. And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes. Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions.""Quiz Show"", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac. The salesmen expounds upon the design, interior, even the radio. He allows the potential buyer to start the engine. The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy. Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something. Then strands of the Threepenny Opera song Mack the Knife intones: Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has Macheath dear And he keeps it out of sight.Television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting.The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol. When the ratings for the quiz show ""21"" begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of ""gentile"" extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, ""Marty"". Only problem is, ""Marty"" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic.In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed ""rules"". He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent ""21"" champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged.An incredible film with a first-rate cast. ""Quiz Show"" presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Very Well Made, But I Don't Care Much For The Movie's Message","""Quiz Show"" is a pleasure to watch, a very accomplished and engaging movie which I have seen repeatedly in the cinema and on TV.  What I can´t get over, though, is the movie´s finger - wagging moralism;  I mean, it was only a daft 1950`ies TV quiz show that had been rigged, and not a presidential election.  The NBC president is portrayed as a less reputable character than Jabba The Hut, whereas Charles Van Doren comes out as the poor victim for loosing his $80+ / week lecturing job while grossing over $100,000 in quiz show revenues.  The movie's finale comes across as a fairly ridiculous attempt by Hollywood to smear dirt on a competitor.Just as an aside:  quiz shows aren´t educational and Geritol does not really make you ""feel stronger fast"".

honesty for its own sake,"This may be Bill Clinton's least favorite movie, because it argues that honesty is essential even if there isn't much at stake.  The central question of the film - are quiz shows dishonest, and if so, is that really a problem? - may seem like small potatoes by Hollywood's standards, but this modest scale is actually what makes ""Quiz Show"" work so well.  Lies - even little ones - should not be tolerated, right...?The peripheral issues are interesting as well.  The movie has a lot to say about image perception and prejudice; poor John Turturro, who plays a homely Jewish character, is bumped off the quiz program and replaced by handsome Protestant boy Ralph Fiennes.  The nature of intellectualism and entertainment is another area of focus - do we watch quiz programs because we like smart people, or because we like suspense and high money stakes?Despite these great concepts, and wonderful performances from all concerned (especially Paul Scofield), ""Quiz Show"" is missing a little something - dare I call it ""pep?""  The film is oh-so-slightly slow.  And it tends to raise more questions than it answers, which is of course perfectly legitimate, but it can leave viewers frustrated.  ""Quiz Show"" makes American society look pretty damn shallow and obnoxious - advertisers and showmen are in complete control here.  And that's rather depressing.  The movie doesn't go very far beyond pointing out such harsh realities, but then again, maybe there's nowhere left for it to go.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Then by chance, a university professor (Ralph Fiennes) came along and became the replacement. Ralph Fiennes did a good job as a calm, all rounded intellect.

"Review Of ""Quiz Show""","""Quiz Show"" is a 1994 Best Picture Nominated film directed by Robert Redford. The film tells the true story of a Congressional investigator (Rob Morrow) who is soon wrapped up in a web of conspiracy surrounding a popular game show called ""Twenty One"". Now, the plot of the movie has always been something of interest to me because I always love a good quiz show now and then. The thought of a quiz show being rigged has entered my mind on occasion, and this film properly explores that subject in depth. One of the greatest aspects of this film is its performances from Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro. Turturro's character is the man who is told to ""take a dive"" because he is not as aesthetically pleasing as Fiennes' character, and their performances really help draw a line of contrast between the two of them. Rob Morrow also did a very good job in the film's leading role. The Academy-Award Nominated script is also something I found to be very well executed as well. There's some fairly memorable, compelling, and even at times amusing dialogue all throughout this screenplay and I truly enjoyed watching this story unfold on screen. Robert Redford's Directorial work really shines in his fourth film - he's proved himself to be a jack-of-all-trades. The movie also does an astounding job of exploring just how pivotal TV was to the American population during the 1950s. Overall, I felt that ""Quiz Show"" was a riveting period drama that presented a very fascinating look into the Game Show Scandal of the 1950s.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The birthday scene at the Van Doren home was exquisitely warm and cosy in cinematography, dialogue and portrayal. Perhaps better even than being there.I was spellbound and still am.

When I first heard about this movie I thought that it would be a boring one but after wards I thought differently and especially how this movie ties to how Americans can act when it comes to money and popularity. It was kind of cool to see how Redford was able to tie this film with On the Water Front. Both of the movies have a character that had to make choices to fix their guilty consciences. If no one has read the document by Matthew Warshauer called Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Changing Concepts of the American Dream and see how some of the quotes are similar and connects to Van Doren, Goodwin, and Stempel.

A timeless film which transcends the subject of tainted quiz shows,"The other comments for this film have described what a wonderfully written, acted, and directed film this is. I will not add to those, except to say that years from now, when the box-office hits which overshadowed this film will be looked at as dated curiosities, this film will almost certainly seem as fresh and vital then as it does now.What is so very refreshing is to see a film that honestly shows us what a complicated thing morality is. There are a few clear instances of right and wrong, but only in the details, never in the big picture. After all, this was just television. Is it wrong for a game show to be produced in the same way as professional wrestling? Who were the victims? Can you describe them in a way which makes it clear the the quiz show was the perpetrator and not just an innocent bystander?What these questions show us is that the true subject of this movie is not just the tainted quiz shows, but all of the changes happening in society at that time. This involves the very structures of society, and goes beyond obvious allegories like television vs. the movies or the loss of innocence in the media. To make matters more interesting, the ways in which class, culture, and ethnicity all play a factor in how one reacts to these changes are an important part of the story. What the movie is depicting is the inevitable and permanent passing of the lifestyle which we associate with the 1950s and, like the morality of the characters in the movie, it is left to the viewer to decide whether or not this is a good or bad thing, or maybe a little of both.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Wake Up Folks - Movies Are Not Real,"An extremely well made and enjoyable film, its a hat tipper to director Robert Redford. The cast is a wonderful ensemble, a dream troupe really of veterans and current stars, who all seem so perfectly natural, that again you have to marvel at Redford's expertise. But, my endorsement for this picture comes with a footnote. I have a real problem with historical movies trying to pass off their stories, well told and entertaining as they may be, as the gospel truth. Any person viewing this movie will no doubt believe that this scandal went down exactly as it is portrayed here. But look more carefully, and you can separate the facts, from the Hollywood fiction. The facts are what we know can be proven, the Senate testimonies of Van Doren, and the admissions of Stempfel that prompted the investigation. But what of the rest? What of the oh so incriminating and slanderous conversations between the network executives, the allegations of cover up, is this all really true? Perhaps, but more than likely, the movie uses its share of license with reality. And it has to, movies usually go all the way and present a complete one sided view, that is so throughly convincing because of the medium, you are left with the misbegotten feeling of having received an education. Each and every word that was scripted for all i know may have actually been said, and each person painted as a villain may have truly deserved the treatment received in this film. Somehow though, I doubt it. The fact that it is presented as a tell all expose, about a notorious cover up, but in itself is a fabrication of the facts, just strikes me as completely ironic.

And so, Redford's ""Quiz Show"" gives us a real life example of McLuhan's insight by showing how, in the 1950s, corporate TV sponsors sought to increase the number of viewers by rigging game shows. The boob tube was the ""medium"" used to transmit bogus entertainment that camouflaged the real ""message"", namely that TV sponsors used deception to attract a larger audience, thereby increasing product sales potential. McLuhan's insight was, and still is ... potent.In no uncertain terms, Redford's film renders a scathing indictment of television ""entertainment"" in the 1950s. What shocked me was the extent of viewer gullibility in those days. But the film's story is relevant now because it shows that today's unethical TV programming has a historic precedent. Current game shows may not be rigged. But, the lack of ethics has invaded shows that are more important, like news and current events, with gullible viewers assuming that what they see and hear represents the absolute truth with no hidden agenda.While the film's theme is potent, its cinematic package is less so. For one thing, the film is too long. Some scenes could have been edited out, especially home life of the main characters, and the film's first three minutes.Casting and performances are generally good. I especially liked Paul Scofield as the erudite professor. And Allan Rich was perfect as executive Robert Kintner. But Rob Morrow's Boston accent seemed unnatural and forced. And some of the main characters were annoying, like Herb Stempel, Dan Enright, and Al Freedman. The film's production design was impressively lavish, almost to the point of looking too slick. Cinematography was acceptable, but for such a big budget film I could have wished for more photographic pizazz.""Quiz Show"" is best considered as a cinematic study of a culturally significant set of historic events. One should remember, however, that film is a medium, too. If the viewer keeps in mind that this film is an interpretation of history, not history itself, then he or she will be more discerning, and be less prone to gullibility.",,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"Based on a non-fiction book by one Richard Goodwin, a former US Congress investigator who played a key role in unraveling the American TV quiz show scandals of the late 1950s. An exquisite and beautiful film.The time is the fifties, the place America : the Soviets have just launched their Sputnik, the first man-made object to enter space, heralding the US-Soviet space race and heightening Cold War tensions ; Dwight Eisenhower is in his second term as US President ; and two in every three households has a TV set. To ensure greater viewership, the producers of certain TV quiz shows secretly provided the quiz contestants with questions and answers beforehand. This virtually guaranteed the shows' popularity, because the viewers ""just wanted to see the money"", as one character says.Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren plays another of his idealistic yet morally ambiguous characters, who is sucked into the morass against his will by the producers' guile, and also by his own need for fame and attention. And so Van Doren comes to make his own little Faustian pact with the Devil. Fiennes is one of those rare actors, like Al Pacino or Michael Douglas, who simply exude charisma, and whom it is always a delight to watch no matter what they're doing. And yet it is John Turturro who steals the thunder right from under Fiennes' nose. If you really want to understand the phrase ""disappear into a character"", just watch Turturro in this film. In his voice, his walk, his physiognomy and right down to the movement of his eyes, he becomes Herb Stempel, the geeky and disgruntled contestant whose antics lead to the whole controversy. Every scene he's in, no matter how serious, threatens to become uproariously funny.Robert Redford as director proves to be a consummate storyteller, fully self-possessed and in control of the medium. The story is told as part drama, part history lesson and part comedy. The script is so interesting that even though one knows the outcome, its a lot of fun watching it happen. Every line of dialog is perfect, every scene is necessary no more no less. The whole film is peppered with literary and scholastic references, from Shakespeare and Keats to more obscure figures like Proudhon. The Shakespearean motifs are especially pronounced, from the verse game played by Charles' family, to the comparison of Charles Van Doren to Hamlet.This is yet another film that enough people haven't seen, or have simply forgotten. One of the very best films I've seen in some time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great film of Redford's,"I watched this film for about the fifth time last night. I first saw it a couple of years ago when my mum brought it home, she'd picked it out of the bargain bin at the supermarket, and what a bargain! It is a superb tale, I notice some have said 'who cares it was just a dumb quiz show', well that is hardly the point, many films are made where, what was seemingly the subject is actually just a background for the real story to be told.Quiz Show is a brilliantly told morality tale, but that is not to say it preaches. It can get away with not preaching because the consequences of their actions didn't harm anyone. It doesn't say, 'if you do something wrong you will be punished'. It says 'If you do something wrong, can you live with yourself'. ""It's the getting away with it I couldn't stand"" Charlie says at one point.A classical tragedy of a man with the world at his fingertips who throws it all away at his own volition. As a classical Shakespearean actor Fiennes is perfect for the role.A wonderful intelligent and literate script, the pieces between Charlie and his father in the Athanaeum and at the picnic are wonderful.Subtle music and stylish presentation are the icing on the cake.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Thank you...a great commentary on TV's golden era....,"Thank you, Robert Redford. This scandal occurred before my time, and at first when my friend told me the plot of the movie, I thought... ""so what?""; that was in the early 90's before we were inundated with the reality trash we now see today; and this film is worth watching more than a few times to catch the innuendo and commentary, which is brilliant.For example, Marty Scorcese, when grilled by the senate ethics committee (well portrayed by Rob Morrow), as the slick CEO of ""Geritol"". ""Young man, I tripled those profits, that's the kind of salesman I am, making people want Geritol!"". He smiles smugly.Rob Morrow is the ethical lawyer, attempting to unveil the conspiracy of commercialism and public spin; a crime now permeated on the American public daily, and not only with game shows, but also politics, news commentary and talking heads.There are a few obstacles. Rob Morrow's Boston accent still sounds more like Brooklyn; Ralph Fiennes as the too-perfect Charles Van Doren, a young man duped into promoting the scandal, and representing the public demand for class differences and competition.John Turturro is excellent. After this film I have followed his performances more closely; he BECOMES Herbie Stempel, the man exploited by TV executives for his common looks and appeal to the mass audiences. Johann Carlo as his wife Toby is also noteworthy; proud of her husband she did not believe he was bribed to win the game show ""21"".David Paymer and Hank Azaria are right on the mark as sleazy TV executives. We can imagine the likes of these two producing ""The Apprentice"", even today.Paul Scofield is also excellent, as Van Doren's father, a noted author and professor, who was disappointed in his son's sell out to the TV game show; representing the old school, when values meant more than money. The end of the film is reflective, and will make one sad we cannot return to the days when every form of TV entertainment was not controlled and manipulated by corporate interests. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Gem of a Movie,"Small dramas, when well made, comprise some my favorite cinematic gems. Large spectaculars, flashy adventures, and spine-tingling thrillers are a major fare of movies, that's what film making technology does best. But the small dramas, well scripted, well acted, that focus on characters and dialogue, these are rare and worthwhile finds. ""Quiz Show"" is such a movie. Robert Redford deftly tells the story of the 1950s TV quiz show scandal, in a way that lifts it well above simple docu-drama.

"Cheating Scandal On ""Twenty-One""","Robert Redford directed this intelligent account of the real-life cheating scandal that rocked television quiz shows in the 1950's, with the show ""Twenty-One"" in particular being targeted by young lawyer Goodwin(played by Rob Morrow) who works for a congressional subcommittee that suspects something is wrong when long-time contestant Herbie Stempel(played by John Turturro) loses to popular and rich Charles Van Doren(played by Ralph Fiennes) and he cries foul, though his motivations are based on pride and money, rather than ideals. Paul Scofield plays Mark Van Doren, Charles' father, who can't understand what the fuss is all about... Most interesting and authentic recreation of that time makes potent observations about class, beauty, and favoritism, and doesn't let the audience off the hook either, making their culpability in the scandal quite clear in a clever fashion. Superb direction and performances in underrated film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Yeah, I can see this being nominated","There's something appropriate about Robert Redford heading up a movie about the mid-century quiz show scandals; after all, a lot of this movie centers on a government bureaucrat sniffing for answers. It's not Watergate, but surprisingly engrossing for something related to television. The movie takes its time basking in '50s nostalgia before the real drama kicks in. But when it does, it's remarkable. Subtle, but riveting nonetheless. And even with the shady goings-on it's one of the classier movies I've seen in a long time.That said, the cynicism runs alarmingly deep. The dirty laundry is aired before Congress, but it's not the bad guys that end up paying. The contestants who played along end up being destroyed, while the larger machine continues to churn right along; and that is one bitter ending.Great movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Very Intelligent Film!,"Robert Redford's Quiz Show is a pretty decent film that has some social, economic, and political morals to share. This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points.Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions.As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased.Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Your name is mine!,"That is the crux of it.

Answers raise questions,"This movie provides a look at the Quiz Show scandal of the late '50s.  It is good entertainment and raises questions about human nature--how people can be driven by greed to cheat, whether a situation of sort of ""entrapment"" cheating is more morally justifiable than without, whether ""anybody would have done it,"" and more specifically, whether you or I would have acted in the same manner in the situations depicted.Still, there is another issue:  whether trivia is so great as a thing in itself.  This question must be borne in mind, and was addressed well in a letter to the editor of a newspaper I was reading a few weeks after ""Quiz Show"" was released.  It pointed out that we must be careful not to glorify trivia, and that in fact those who dwell on it too much are losers.  I consider myself a trivia expert in many categories, and I and many people enjoy trivia a lot, but we are reminded to look elsewhere (like writing movie reviews, I guess).  The high water marks of ""Quiz Show"" project an apotheosis of trivia, trivia for trivia's sake, needing nothing else. Obviously, this raises questions of values, and substance.  Remember that other accomplishments in life, life's basics, are more important.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Inside the booth,"This is real event from the 1950's.Audiences at home are glued to their seats as Twenty One, their favorite quiz show on NBC starts.What they don't know that the show is fixed.The producers arrange the outcome of the competition.Herbert Stempel, a long time contestant, has to step aside since they want a new contestant, the non-Jewish Charles Van Doren.Later Stempel speaks out what happened behind the scenes.Richard ""Dick"" Goodwin, a congressional lawyer starts investigating the case.Quiz Show (1994) is a very wise movie directed by Robert Redford.It's based on Richard Goodwin's novel Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties (1988) and it was adapted by Paul Attanasio.Its producers include Redford, Goodwin, Michael D.

The sore loser is a winner,"* * * ½ (3½ out of 5)The sore loser is a winner>Concise, sober and interesting depiction of the famous NBC game show fraud (""21"") in the 50s. Based on a true story and firmly directed by Robert Redford.The backbone is entertainment in a historic perspective. Luckily, Redford and the superb cast allow for realistic tinges of despair and downright meanness to surface among some of the unfortunate Hollywood parading that somewhat bogs the movie.David Paymer and Hank Azaria - as media piranhas Dan Enright and Albert Freedman - are particularly annoying in their hysteric characters. Redford goes for a touch of the Coen brothers here - Paymer and Azaria do a truly smashing job - it just doesn't work in this context.There are exceptional and formidable performances all the way round. Most of them work. Lead by two major performances: Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro.Fiennes seems to find the same venom deep in himself that made his performance the year before - as the sadistic German commandant in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) - a tentative stand out. He was both compelling, original and darkly seductive. This time he seems to turn that very same venom upon himself as he carefully embodies college professor Charles Van Doren. An educated man who is tempted and ultimately lured by the promise of money and fame on the game shows made for the revolutionary television.Fiennes' Van Doren is intelligent and wise, but nervous and disillusioned when among his peers - those are namely his father and other intellectuals - and he has even adapted a slight stutter that plays ingeniously well with his facial expressions and quirkiness. His performance is scintillating brilliant.Opposite him is John Turturro in what may be his finest performance to date. Turturro is Herb Stempel - the former game show winner who is found to be too geeky and greedy (and Jewish) for the network and therefore scheduled to ""take a fall"" - and he has never been better.He gives the term ""sore loser"" a whole new meaning.Turturro is always intriguing but has also become somewhat predictable. He is mainly used in eccentric and frenzied roles simply because of his onscreen magnetism (as in The Big Lebowski). Only Barton Fink (1991) hinted at the more shaded and jaded side of Turturro; one that showed us glimpses of emotional understanding from underneath that charismatic and provocative shield. That is visible here although Stempel basically whimpers and whines throughout the movie: Why must he take a step aside for Van Doren? Why? Why? It is hilarious all the same.Yet it is with his wife and child at home that we glimpse the sensitive side of Herb Stempel as portrayed by John Turturro. A man who is to be respected for his intelligence, sure, but also for his commitment to family and honesty. After all.Furthermore both Paul Scofield as the elder Van Doren (""Your name is my name!,"" he protests after learning that his son was aware of the scam: the father-and-son scene is simply mesmerizing) and Rob Morrow as investigator Dick Goodwin deliver high caliber performances.Where do all these powerful performances leave the movie itself? On solid ground actually. The movie is taut and tight in form - interesting not only because of the morals at stake here - but because Redford treats the material like a murder mystery with Van Doren at center, caught in an emotional tight rope (to tell or not to tell?).Redford peels layer after layer off of Van Doren and his slow psychological disintegration has you pinned to your seat.The moral seems to be that amidst lost idealism we must rise again. Simple awareness of the gradual and ever-changing assessment of moral justification that resides in society today can help us make the many temptations - in what was already then considered a ""consumer-land"" - go away. Or can it?Along the way we are treated to some unfortunate candy-coated moments though. When Van Doren caves in and issues an amendment at a hearing he is at first applauded. Only to be sucker-punched by sheer Hollywoodism. A senator adds: ""An adult should simply not be commended for telling the truth"".As if the senator was expecting the audience - not at the hearing, but you dear viewer - to applaud him. These self-conscious John Wayne values do not fit the movie. Not when so bombastically dropped.All in all Redford delivers no answers - this is entertainment based on reality - but he is knowledgeable about human nature. When he brings that out in the open - by way of Paul Attanasio`s razor sharp screenplay and the amazing cast with Fiennes and Turturro in front  - Quiz Show is intelligent and alluring cinema.",,Anonymous,History

Quiz Show a remarkable film!,"I felt like it was very well done, great camera angles, some fairly creative shots that spoke for the characters when they themselves were silent...just a well done, quality film, that never drys out or leaves you in a lurch. John Turturro is outstanding as a neurotic, slightly obsessed and racially-sensitive Stempel, Rob Morrow carries the role of Goodwin as if he were the man himself, and Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren was a better choice than anyone else I could imagine, also as if the role fit his personality so closely as to blur the line between actor and role. Hank Azaria had a relatively small part, but is always a good fit regardless of the subject matter, a phenomenal character actor who has finally made quite a name for himself; quite overdue, I feel. Paul Scofield handles his role as Charles' father without so much as the slightest effort, it comes so easily. David Paymer is a man who seems to receive so few accolades one might hardly notice him, but he also is tremendously talented (see Mr. Saturday Night for a strong example of Paymer's abilities as supporting actor opposite Billy Crystal and Julie Warner).All in all, a wonderful film on a subject in which one might not normally find interest, but very well done and an outstanding yet understated collection of actors and actresses make this one:4 out of 5 starsWell worth seeing!

Mr Redford may be warning us about lieing.,"I assume that you have already read the synopses' presented by other commentators, therefore you know the gist of the story. I have to say that I like Robert Redford a lot better than I did before. After thinking about what he may have been trying to say with this movie, I think he may have been telling us that it is wrong to tell a lie. And that sometimes there are consequences for breaking one of the key rules that all societies hinge upon. He might be saying that sometimes the consequences are not so obvious and forthcoming, but, sooner or later, all lies are discovered and known and varying degrees of consequence will follow. I feel confident from viewing Mr. Redford's body of work that he is a moral man and his choices for making movies are based on a set of moral values. Bravo! Ten commandment morality will keep our civilization vibrant and growing. Deviance from it will set in motion an inevitable decreptitude and freedom's destruction. Rosebud.",,Anonymous,History
Not quite my cup of tea.,"A well made drama yet somewhat aloof and restrained. Robert Redford's fourth film as a director has been widely praised but it is not quite as wonderful in my opinion.

Camp look at quiz show corruption.,"Based on a book by the Dick character (played by Rob Morrow, the lead of TV's Northern Exposure), Robert Redford's 1994 film evokes the quiz show world of the first years of television, done in the camp style of 50's movies and television. Thus, the bright colours, the superlative performances (which don't go so over the top we forget they represent real people), all the classic/cliche voices of 50's entertainment - the wise old man (Charles van Doren), the brooklyn investigator (Dick), the nerd (Stempel), the nagging wife (Toby Stempel), the con men (Dan Enright, Albert).

"Good movie, but not quite history-","Anyone interested in the events portrayed here ought to read the book ""Prime Time and Misdemeanors"" by Joseph Stone and Tim Yohn (Mr. Stone was the Assistant D.A. for Manhattan at the time his office investigated this affair.) One point he makes is that the Quiz Show scandal was far from harmless- many of the principals involved were tainted by it and took years to rehabilitate their reputations (such as professor VanDoren himself.) On the larger scale, acceptance of such dishonesty damages our whole society.Before the scandal broke, parents held-up the contestants as examples to their children of what they ought to aspire to intellectually. Afterwards, no one wanted their kids to pattern themselves after people so corrupted in moral ambiguity.Interestingly, there was nothing illegal about giving the quiz contestants the answers, so long as the shows' sponsors knew about it beforehand (otherwise this would have constituted fraud.) But when the shows' staffs and contestants lied under oath about the quiz rigging, they became guilty of perjury, a Federal offense given the circumstances. The deception was bad enough. Lying about it afterwards only made the situation that much worse.The story of the quiz scandals should serve as a wake-up call to people who nostalgically yearn for the era and tend to think of the 1950s as the time of shark-finned cars, suburban tracts and ""Happy Days"" icons and music.",,Anonymous,History
Engrossing and very well acted drama,"This is an engrossing and very well acted drama chronicling corruption in a popular quiz show in the fifties. John Turturro is magnificent as Herbie Stempel, a Jew who claims that the aristocratic Charles Van Doren (excellent Ralph Fiennes) has been fed the right answers during the show. Robert Redford's motive is to suggest the loss of innocence in America with the end of the fifties and the impending arrival of the culture wars and civil strife. Whether an American audience in the fifties was that gullible is open to question however. The film is a trifle overlong but never boring. Recommended.Overall 8/10",,Anonymous,History
A Personal Favorite,"This film gained some critical and popular attention when it was released, but nearly not enough, in my opinion. It is preachy, to be sure -- but pedantry isn't necessarily a bad thing, provided the filmmaker has something worthwhile to preach about, and carries it off with commitment and insight.Robert Redford did have something to bring to our attention in this film, and it was not as many have suggested, the corruption of TV executives. It was also not fundamentally about dishonesty or fraud. The film's real purpose was to mark that place in time in American culture when TV became more important then reality, when it began to stand in for many of our higher values.Watch the film with this idea in mind, and it will take on a great deal more depth. Observe the relationship between Charlie Van Doren and his father -- the two standing ultimately on different sides of the cultural divide that was opening in American at that time. The side onto which Charlie Van Doren stepped, seduced by money and easy fame, is the one on which we live on today. Our culture was not always thus, is Redford's subtle message -- and here is when it changed. Bravo.Redford is also to be commended for the performances he drew from his cast. The stand-outs are obvious, but what's important overall is Redford's attention to character development and realism. This is something the current crop of hot-shot directors (Soderburg, Cameron, Spielberg, Scott, to name but a few) cannot seem to manage, so instead they give us visual spectacle, shallow characters and few ideas. Perhaps it takes a senior member of the acting community rescue us from these vapid directors.""Quiz Show"" is one of the few movies of recent years to be a film about something important, and it was executed with an unusual degree of wit, style and attention to detail. This film will always reside near the top of my personal favorites list. I rate it nine out of ten.",,Anonymous,History
