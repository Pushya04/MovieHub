"'Apocalypse' doesn't do everything wrong, but it certainly doesn't do everything right.","Following the success of the 2002 adaptation from video game to film that was 'Resident Evil', comes its tantalizingly-trailered sequel, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. I have to say, I was entranced by the trailer of this film. I seriously thought that this film had the potential to rise above 'Mortal Kombat' (1995) and 'Resident Evil' as the best cinematic event to spawn from a video game. 'Apocalypse' doesn't do everything wrong, but it certainly doesn't do everything right.Let's start with a brief synopsis. Firstly, this film picks up literally days after the first drops us off. 'Apocalypse' opens with a rehashed explanation of what we learned about the two main characters in the original, Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Matt Addison (Eric Mabius). Again, we are told that this Umbrella Corporation is an international super-power and that Alice is (or more accurately was) the head of security in an underground research facility dubbed ""The Hive"", which harbored research and specimens pertaining to biological weaponry. After that, we are treated to the scientists who wheeled Addison away at the closure of 'Evil', opening the zombie-infested annals of ""The Hive"". Immediately before the audience 'knows' what happens (its pretty obvious and is given away in the final shots of the first 'RE') we transition into a militaristic evacuation of important personnel associated with Umbrella Corp. After a few assorted events that do (and simultaneously do not) move the plot line (a 'do not' being the lead-scientist asking how bad the situation is). After this, we are introduced to nearly a half-dozen other characters, including a renegade police officer (Sienna Guillory), the remaining members of an elite task force (Oded Fehr, Zack Ward), a VERY stereotypical Black man (Mike Epps) and a hulking creature (which, if you paid attention to the first 'RE', you would be aware of its appearance) that totes both a rocket-launcher and a hand-held chain gun named the ""Nemesis"".As far as performances go, the aforementioned actors and actresses do well with the material that they are given. Guillory has Helen of Troy (not from the film 'Troy') on her resume, as Jovovich has Joan of Arc, Fehr has the mummy hunter, Ardeth Bay from the 'Mummy' series and Epps is credible in several comedies. There is no real emotion in the script, so the viewers really can't ask for any emotion from the actors (sadly true).That is where 'Apocalypse' stumbles, and in many places, falls on it's face.The plot is paper thin with nearly no real complications for the audience until the last ten minutes (which is a near-complete turn around from the original, which actually evoked SOME thought from the audience). It is basically unleash zombies on the city and shoot 'em up. The small sub-plots really vary from little to no relevance in the story whatsoever. It is pretty predictable that there is some kind of 'oh no, my friend was bitten and eventually, I'll have to kill him just before he bites me' situation, and the big action/set pieces are blatantly set up. The characters are thinner than the plot, with their arcs being straighter than a steel arrow. Alice begins the movie as an ass-kicking femme fatal, and finishes the film being...oh, you guessed it, an ass-kicking femme fatal. Jill Valentine (Guillory) is another one of these masculinely tough females, although sans Alice's super powers. The only real life that is brought to the script is through the epitome of black stereotypes, played by Mike Epps. It was sadly ironic, however that my favorite bit of 'Apocalypse' involved a reference to another video game franchise.Again, 'RE: Apocalypse' is not completely bad. Although few, it has its moments. Mike Epps has his funny lines and his one encounter with the Nemesis brought laughs from the entire audience, which was something needed in the film. The Nemesis was done well a majority of the time (although there is a bit where the big oaf crashes through a wall and his head piece actually shifts visibly on the actor's shoulders) and makes a formidable villain for a good margin of the film (although his closure is a bit weak). Many of the action sequences had great potential...but the majority of those action scenes were fast-cut, much like 'AvP', so much so that it was very hard at moments to see exactly what was happening in the shot.'Apocalypse' suffices much more as an action movie than it does as a horror film, and it struggles to keep interest, even for someone who has faithfully played the video games. I will be glad to admit, though...'Apocalypse' has the BIGGEST, most unexpected scare of 2004. I won't say when or where...but I am glad to have experienced it. 'Apocalypse' isn't exactly worth all eight dollars of your admission fee, but it doesn't make a bad Saturday afternoon matinee...6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad,"I wouldn't call this a brilliant movie, but it certainly kept me watching from start to finish. Michelle Rodriguez's character is replaced by another kick-arse heroine to work alongside Jovovich's Alice. There's also a new super-evil dude to contend with. Naturally the biggest baddies of all are the people who work for the Umbrella corporation! And, man, those zombie dogs are just freaky!In this movie we get to know a bit more about how the T-Virus came to be, and get a new perspective on how it can be used for good and not just bad. Naturally, though, it's mostly all bad!As usual, there's a lot of action and a lot of death. And the Umbrella Corporation sure is good at twisting the facts of the truth. I'm intrigued to know what happens next.So I'm ready to watch movie #3.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two babes with big guns killing zombies,"*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Lethal megababe Alice, (Milla Jovovich), is back. The Hive gets reopened for some reason. The zombies take advantage of the human's blunder and pour out into Racoon City. Alice and another hot chick decide to bring the war to the zombies. The rest of the movie is one long fight scene with zombie dogs, slobbering creatures and a big monster with a rocket launcher all wanting to waste the killer babe squad.While ""Resident Evil 2"" is light on plot, it is heavy on kills, explosions and various other forms of mayhem. I definitely felt I got my money's worth. There are really only two differences between this movie and the original ""Resident Evil"". One, this movie introduces a new monster, the Nemesis. It's a big monster with bad teeth wearing an overcoat and wielding a rocket launcher. The other difference is that they added another hot woman to the zombie killing mix. Alice needed some babe backup. Overall, I was pleased with this one. It's worth a look.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Really Fun Action-Packed Sci-fi Sequel,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a kick-ass action flick but when i first watched it on video way back in early 2000's i didn't like it. Now in 2022 I've watched it again & think it's Awesome!!!Apocalypse isn't as good as the first film but it's still a damn good sequel & companion piece to that film.The Apocalyptic scale of Raccoon City promised at the end of the first film is on full display here. The city is in a panic & the corrupted Umbrella company is locking everything down & locking everyone in. The virus has spread from the reopening of The Hive & our hero Alice (Milla Jovivich) is on the hunt. Jovovich is Awesome again in her ""Ripley"" type of role & gets to team up with other survivors including some left-behind S. T. A. R. S soldiers & what we get is a group of survivors trying to make their way to safety & rescue a young girl lost in the chaos.The action scenes are well done with cool kick-ass stunts & slick feel to it all. The atmosphere is done well with a blueish look to everything & with a mist & rain it has a nice Horror film feel & look. There's plenty of Zombie action & the cool looking Nemesis creature that is like a big mutant Terminator & looks Awesome.Mike Epps (Next Friday) is pretty fun as one of the group & has fun in his role.Apocalypse is just a damn good fun action-packed ride, a fun late-night movie ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alice In Zombieland,"A film that directly continues the first part of the saga known as Resident Evil.The casting is excellent, Sienna Guillory is the right choice for the role of Jill Valentine. Alice, Jill and Carlos fight not only against time, but also against a formidable opponent called Nemesis.Nemesis looks great, quite sinister and scary. The make-up and special effects team did a great job.The film is solidly directed, although the fight scenes could have been better, but overall it's not bad at all. Carlos Olivera is a fun character, Oded Fehr portrayed him excellently.Milla Jovovich is always excellent as Alice.What is specific about these kinds of films, and especially about this Resident Evil franchise, is that you can watch it many times, and each time it is more fun. It is designed to entertain the viewer and it certainly succeeds in that.The movie is definitely worth watching, it's fun, with solid action and a tense plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"About as good as the first, overall","After having seen Resident Evil god knows how many times, and being pretty psyched for the sequel, I finally got to see it, and on the premiere night, too. Of course, I knew that the director of the first RE, Paul W. S. Anderson, wasn't doing this, since he was busy making his dream project, Aliens Vs Predator. Luckily, I can cope with changes like that... as long as the change isn't devastating. For this movie, however, it's hard to tell... maybe the mediocre attempts at scaring the audience and providing shocks was Anderson's fault, as he wrote the script, but it may be the new director, first-timer Alexander Witt, who's responsible. Let me say this upfront; I, as many others who enjoyed the first, really liked the ending, the whole foreshadowing thing, and, thankfully, the film picks up exactly where the first one left off. Actually, it goes a little further back, to show us exactly what happened before Alice woke up. The plot is decent, about as good as it gets when it's Paul W. S. Anderson writing it. It doesn't drag... heh, it doesn't drag... heck, it doesn't even leave the slightest chance for it to drag, as it's constantly moving. The movie never allows the audience to catch their breath; apparently, someone(I'm guessing Anderson or Witt) has never heard of the danger of overdoing action sequences. For anything (at all) to be good, entertaining, thrilling, whatever... there needs to be what is commonly referred to as 'buffers'. Without those nice little talky-talky scenes in-between, heck, maybe even a dash of good old-fashioned character development, the action just ends up being trite. And that's pretty much what happens here. They try to squeeze as much action into every single frame as possible, and it ends up annoying the audience rather than exciting. The director also has a horrible habit of blurring the image whenever there are more than five zombies on-screen, apparently to (I guess) cover up a bad job on makeup... or something to that effect. If the first had too much make up and such, this has too little. The acting is decent enough. Milla Jovovich gives the same good performance that she usually does. The rest of the cast are acceptable. The characters are mostly clichés and stereotypes. Of course, by mostly I mean almost 90% of the cases. You got the stupid reporter who just wants to make a story out of all of this, despite her being in obvious danger; The bad-ass cop who's suspended but still takes her duty deadly serious; the half-witted pathetic guy who's obviously only there for comic relief... actually, scratch that last one, as he was actually pretty darn funny. For once the person who's supposed to be there for comic relief works, instead of just being the *most*(or even worse; least) laughable character. The special effects were well done, but not spectacular. Definitely not the best I've seen. The action was good, but really over-the-top. The scenes with the Nemesis range between being some of the best action in the movie to being some of the most pathetic and smirk-inspiring scenes. The cinematography is nothing special. The film introduced an unnecessary amount of characters, most of whom are just fodder for the zombies or Nemesis anyway. The showdown between Alice and Nemesis was somewhat pathetically staged, and probably would have seemed out of place, hadn't the rest of the film been of the same quality(honestly, it seemed like a video-game... and while I am quite a big fan of them, I'm considerably more interested in playing them than watching them). That big ol' hunk o' biologically engineered walking death was simultaneously underdeveloped(for what they had him/it do) and overexposed. The film is noisy and loud, but not as loud as the first film, and while the sound is often horribly overdone, it doesn't distract as much as several other big action hits. The film is also less loud when it comes to the soundtrack; it was nice to have some change from the one-note *loud* heavy metal from the first film. All in all, a pretty entertaining flick, but out of your mind much faster than it got in(and that's saying a lot, believe me). If you liked the first, are a big fan of one or more of the actors, or you just have nothing better to do for 90 minutes, give it a shot. It kept me watching through the end, and, despite a few disappointments, kept my interest as well. It just didn't stay fresh in my head for more than about fifteen minutes after the credits started, which is very little for a film with so much going on in it all the time. I recommend it only to big fans of the first or of Milla Jovovich. I suppose big fans of Paul W. S. Anderson(they must exist, somewhere) will probably enjoy it too. I will say that most who liked the first will probably like this as well, but possibly a little less due to the lesser directing. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil Apocalypse Has a Lot to Offer,"I've watched Resident Evil 1 to 5 many times, and I have RE 4 and 5 in 3D. Having seen all these movies numerous times, I now have come to the realization that Resident Evil Apocalypse is my most favorite in the franchise. Granted, the first movie in a franchise is usually also the most enjoyable because it introduces us to the movie's universe. As such, the first half of Resident Evil 1 surpasses all others and can be watched many times without regret; however, while Resident Evil 1 is one of my favorite movies of all time, it fails to deliver enough thrills in its second half; and this is exactly what RE Apocalypse compensates for. Apart from that, RE Apocalypse has a great first half, because it is one thing for the T-virus to spread inside the Hive and a completely different thing for it to spread to the entire city. That being said, RE Apocalypse is thrilling and engaging from start to finish, because the universe in which the story unfolds is entirely different from the one in the original RE.Also, while we had some bland characters in RE 1, such as the medic or the first guy that is pulled in and killed by a horde of zombies, almost all of the characters in RE 2 are colorful and each of them contributes to some aspect of the movie. It also feels good to distance oneself from the claustrophobic feeling one gets in RE 1. RE Apocalypse is an action-packed horror movie that has a lot to offer. We are presented with a stronger and more agile version of Alice who can perform fascinating Kung Fu kicks and acrobatic moves, the most interesting of which, in my opinion, is where Alice is running down a vertical building. The Nemesis is a real life replica of the most feared monster from Resident Evil games. Jill Valentine is simply perfect and makes a video game character come to life. Moreover, the sense of humor helps the movie to not get boring. I remember the first time that I watched this movie, it left me wanting for more. It has a cliff-hanger ending, and you can't help but wish to know what happens to Alice next. This is very important, given the fact that many great movies let the audience down by a disappointing or predictable ending. The movie has been shot beautifully and the background music is exciting. This movie is strongly recommended to all action-horror fans right after RE 1.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a Bad Sequel,"Resident Evil Apocalypse is not a bad follow up to the action packed original. The story picks up right where the first movie left off but also introduces new characters Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera. The zombie outbreak is now overtaking Raccoon City and the government along with the Umbrella Corporation is detaining the citizens while trying to cover up the truth. My favorite part of this movie is the realistic depiction of all-out war with the undead as the police and army try to hold off an ever growing horde of zombies lumbering toward the city. This film has great special effects, action-packed battle scenes and halfway decent acting; all of which make up for a predictable plot line and an overall lack of gore. If you enjoyed the first Resident Evil I recommend checking out the second installment as well. I'm sure you'll find it pretty entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Return  to bloody zombies with high technology science fiction,"The movie concerns about living dead in Racoon City where a lethal virus outbreaks and it infiltrates into human body creating the Zombies after to bite themselves .

They have to confront several Zombies starving of meat and a nasty and evil Corporation chief.The film begins as ¨Omega man¨ movie , as a city without people , totally uninhabited . After that , Milla Jovovich will find a motley group at a church where she'll fight against weird creatures and later with Zombies that a mutant virus has transformed into flesh eating . It's a good horror film , made in fast moving and is neither boring , nor tiring , but entertaining . From the beginning until the end the action pace is nonstop . In the picture there are action, terror, suspense , creepy atmosphere and a little bit of gore . The motion picture takes parts of ¨Alien¨ and ¨Dawn of the dead¨ and of course : ¨Resident Evil I¨ .

"More elements of the game included, worth a matinée.","Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I think that's what makes IMDb such a great site for reviews. When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from ""excellent"" to ""pure crap"" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said, everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out. I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie, but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.I hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?The review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people. It's just a flat-out good flick worth a matinée price.",,Anonymous,Horror
Alice's Apocalyptic Awakening...,"The feral infected are lurkin' in the dark, lips pared back carried by a silenced heart, corrupted by a virus that reanimates the dead, the only escape option is a bullet to the head. Nemesis awoken and is armed to the eye teeth, mutated from a human that's still carried underneath, Umbrella has its fingers on the pulse and in all pies as a thermonuclear device is delivered from the skies. Apocalypse or Holocaust, Armageddon take your pick, can't believe a virus could escape and make everybody sick, or that politicians tell us lies and mislead us with intent, and do things to their public without gathering their consent.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first,"I liked the first movie, it was good average entertainment. I think this one is slightly better than the first, mainly because this one is scarier. I admit i preferred the zombies in the Dawn of the dead remake but thats because they were fast. The script is no great shakes, the cast are OK. Though the bad guy seemed like he was doing a poor man's Schindler. The FX was fairly decent and the movie never becomes boring, it's too fast paced for that. Some of the sets were obviously based on the games. At least it made me jump out of my seat a few times. Needless to say a third one seems very likely but i like where there going with one scene reminding me of Brian De Palma's The Fury. 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't expect a brilliant plot and you'll be in for a treat,"When you see a movie like this you should never go into the theater expecting too much. Especially if it's a sequel. Fortunately enough, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does a great job of following up to the, in my opinion, very good first movie.The basic premise is the same; a lot of zombies that have been infected by the T-virus are out to get our heroes. The difference is that this time they're out and about in Raccoon city, the city where The Hive from the first movie is located.Milla Jovovich again does a great job as Alice, with her this time is Jill Valentine, known from the video game, played by Sienna Guillory, whom also does a great job by the way. Not that there's a lot of acting taking place, the better part of the movie the protagonists kill zombies, blow things up or perform death, and gravity, defying stunts.This is what makes this movie so good though; the over-the-top-with-tongue-in-cheek approach to the action. The first time Alice enters the movie for real she does it in such a brilliant way I almost clapped my hands.Take this movie for what it is, a fun action romp through well known movie making territory, and you should have a great time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's not RE 2,"This movie is NOT Resident Evil 2. This is NOT a sequel and NOT a prequel. It's based on the game, while the first movie is NOT really based on it. There's no continuity. At the end of the first film the city of Racoon is TOTALLY abandoned and ruined, during this one it's full of people and just starts to ruin. At the end of the first film Alice wakes up in the hospital of Racoon city, in this one she wakes up in a lab who knows where. It's not a good film on its own because it refers to first one and starts before the of end of that. And so on ... If you want to see how they turned one of the games into a film, than watch this. Otherwise, avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best of the series,"Despite what others say, out of all the six movies in the series, Resident Evil Apocalypse is the only film which came close to what the games were.You see a lot more lickers, zombies and of course Nemesis himself.

"OK not the best, but a fine movie for 90 minutes of entertainment","I used to hate zombie movies I took a lot of courage with the first resident Evil movie and it was good. When Resident Evil: Apocalypse came along in lots of reviews and pictures I felt a lot of excitement for the movie and when I watched it for the first time at the cinema (which I rushed to get in because not only was I excited there was a lot of people coming to see it) I was blown away by the movie. I liked it so much I went again.When I got the DVD (including the first one) and paid close attention to the action and details. I found one or two bits in the movie that were wrong but there's an explanation to them, It's a movie! I thought Resident Evil: Apocalypse was good because when you watch a movie like Dawn of the Dead (2004) you only see the Massacre of the city and everyone dying without putting up a fight. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse you actually see highly trained soldiers and special forces fighting the infection, thats what I like to see! Men with guns making a stand and fighting.Oded Fehr was excellent, he hates guns but he shoots them like a professional and does some good moves and stunts. Milla Jovovich is highly skilled in martial arts and none of her action moves are fake. Sienna Guillory proves to be a professional when it comes to the job.To put it all together I think few of the critics were harsh about this movie when they don't even know the skill and effort in this movie, OK it is not the best movie in the world but I think its original and its another piece to the Resident Evil collection.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Movie,"I personally loved this movie. I saw Resident Evil 1, and it wasn't as good as the 2nd one. Maybe its just me, but I love the action, and the constant suspense when you never know what will happen next. The music,I admit, wasn't as good as it should be. Milla is a great actress and she does a lot of her own fighting, and that is admirable.I did, however, find a lot of bloopers, which made the movie less enjoyable, but most weren't painfully obvious.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an action packed show.This movie would definitely give anyone an adrenaline rush for the fight scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty cool but not as suspenseful as before,"When I played Resident Evil on PS console for the first time, I was scared most of the time. It was very suspenseful and scary, so was the first Resident Evil movie. In contrast, in the second Resident Evil movie, the main character, Alice, had total ownage. It kind of reduced the suspense in the movie, because she was too powerful so that nobody could actually hurt her.Suspense is a very important element in any Resident Evil movies/games, but in the second Resident Evil, only the first part of the movie (When Alice hadn't appeared), was pretty frightening. After Alice arrived, it turned into a pure action movie instead of a suspense movie. The action was pretty cool, but I personally prefer more suspense.The graphics were pretty good, and it was really nice to see some shots that were directly taken from Resident Evil III. Near the end there was even a shot that was taken from Resident Evil X, Code Veronica. I guess there will be another Resident Evil movie, and I hope it is as good as the first one.In conclusion, I gave this movie 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Macho women with guns vs. mediocrity,"Film adaptations of video games have a decidedly mixed life. On the one hand, they are commercially viable with a built-in audience. On the other, they are often lifeless, barely more than live action versions of the games, less films than advertisements. Occasionally, as in ""Tomb Raider"", a fantastic lead can overcome the video game-to-file curse. Sometimes, the movie separates itself from the game enough to stand on its own, as in ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within."" The first ""Resident Evil"" had both of these: only a passing resemblance to the wildly popular game series and a dynamic lead in Milla Jovovich. The success of the movie spawned a sequel, and as in the video game world, so often, the sequel is an overly-hyped, rushed-to-production mess like ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse.""The film begins roughly where the first one left off. Alice (Jovovich) is one of the only survivors of the first movie, having fought her way thought legions of undead when the nefarious Umbrella Corporation's experimental T-virus infected hundreds of people. When Umbrella tries to investigate the events of the first movie, they unwittingly release the T-virus into the streets of Raccoon City, turning the populace into slavering zombies hungry for human flesh. Umbrella shuts the city down to contain the virus, and Alice must fight her way out with the help of mini-skirted cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a small team of elite soldiers, and a trash-talking common citizen (Mike Epps). Along the way are obstacles like undead beasts with huge tongues and a giant mutant named Nemesis.This film is a massive mess of teenage game-boy dreams. The plot is thin and the characters by and large thread bare. Most come and go so quickly that you never even get to know their names before they become a zombie snack. The actors try their best, though, and Jovovich is always a treat to watch in action. Guillory is also quite effective in her role as Butt-Kicking Babe #2, making a rather crowd-pleasing entrance. Epps provides the film's few intentionally funny moments, while there also fine performances by Oded Fehr and Zack Ward as two of the soldiers accompanying Alice. Of all the featured players, only Thomas Kretschmann, as Umbrella's laughably clichéd Eurotrash representative, comes off as particularly mediocre.But all the girls-on-zombie action in the world can't save this film from itself. The film has the quick-cut action scenes and loud, forced nu-metal soundtrack of a straight-to-video release but the effects budget of a minor studio release. Indeed, hardly a scene goes by that isn't punctuated with deafening explosions. Director Alexander Witt, taking over for video-game-to-film director Paul Anderson (who wrote the screenplay), has made a cold, hard film lacking any of the (relative) depth or humanity of the first film. Sure, this film may be based on a video game, but that's no reason to turn the characters into automatons. In addition, the film ends with a bizarre and seemingly arbitrary sequence that will leave most viewers to bang their heads in frustration...and, of course, opening the door WIDE open for a third film.What could've been a more action-oriented follow-up to a fine video-game adaptation has become an incoherent and numb series of shoot-em-up action, a film so ridiculously conceived that it thinks nothing of sending its main characters through a graveyard during a zombie assault. Granted, it's immensely enjoyable to watch the female leads getting their action hero on, but both Jovovich and Guillory (and indeed the whole cast) deserve a better vehicle for their acrobatics. Skip the theatre and just wait for the DVD so you can go right to the good parts. 5 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Worthy Sequel, which flows like the Original","I was a little skeptical about this sequel since I liked the original, but after 5 minutes, I knew that this would be a worthy sequel. I don't think it is as good as part 3 or the Original itself, but I do believe that this film is top notch, going for a different style.The plot is basically the same where the same character, Alice teams up with some survivors and fights the same corrupt bimbos who let out the virus in the first place. Although the plot is still not fully developed, I think that the themes, kills and action have changed. I thought the one eyed looking creature was also awesome as well. These elements to me is what made this sequel still stand the test of time.The action scenes and kills are much more better, the themes of setting the story into the open, public cities was an excellent choice because it gave the film a different feel where anyone (infected or not) could be killed or under threat at any time, and even the elements of the nasty corporation being fleshed out more gave us these gritty feelings of really hating those characters.Overall, even if the plot of RE2 is not well-developed on any level, the film itself is still entertaining.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil Apocalypse Action Packed But Flawed,"Resident Evil Apocalypse is action packed but flawed from director Alexander Witt whose admirable in making this sequel but the lack of character development, too many characters, real suspense, and a more central villain are what weighed it down. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Thomas Kretchman, Jared Harris, and Mike Epps. The rest of the cast are okay in their small roles of characters from the games who only make brief extended appearances before being written out out of the movie too soon for the audience to care about them. The action is pretty much non sop and impressive but after a while it gets to but a bit repetitive. The only one that really stands out is probably the one near the end which is well executed. The special effects and the make up artists have done a great job of creating the creatures including the zombies, dogs, Lickers, and the newest one introduced known as Nemesis who was actually Matt from the original. He mutated into Nemesis after being scratched by the Licker near the end of the first film. The Nemesis character is intimidating but he lacked screen time since there are other villains in this movie besides him. His showdown with Jovovich near the conclusion is a bit of a letdown like the third movie but it was fitting for that film. Despite some flaws with character development, suspense, and the movie juggling too many characters this sequel isn't that bad. Overall Resident Evil Apocalypse is a decent sci-fi thriller with plenty of action, amazing special effects, some suspense, humor, and good performances by the cast who make this second film in the series worth watching but it could've been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I'm leaving town, and I suggest you all do the same""","I recently saw the theatrical trailer for the movie Resident Evil: Extinction and it occurred to me that I never saw either Resident Evil movies, even though I've been wanting to see them. So I rented the movies yesterday and watched them last night and I have to say that I was a little surprised about the rating on IMDb, I really loved Apocalypse, I think I liked it better than the first Resident Evil. Milla Jovovich is still so awesome and I think she's improved since the first movie. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse we have more action and in my opinion a very awesome story, one that is even up there I would say with George Romero's zombie stories.We start where we have left off where Alice has been left in the lab with her friend, Matt. But she escapes and finds a world that is not the same, where the virus has broken out into the world and zombies are now walking above ground. People are doing their best to survive and there are now new people called STARS where they are being eliminated by a huge new monster who might be familiar to Alice. But she is with survivors: Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera, Captain Nicholai and they find a little girl, Angie Ashford who's dad Dr. Ashford is the man who created the virus and is being hunted down.Resident Evil: Apocalypse was very awesome to watch and it's a buy for me at least. I'm really looking forward to Extinction now, I can't wait to see how they continue the story. See, the only bummer about me watching this now is because now I have to wait for the sequels as well. But at least I get the experience of the theater. But anyways, I would recommend this movie for anyone, it's an awesome movie to watch and has terrific action.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
feels like a video game,"I enjoyed the second movie in the Resident Evil franchise about 18 years after its original release. It was fun to see ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" after all the movies that I've watched in between. This part is done very well, with interesting camera angles reminding me of scenes from the video game. Also the cast walks and talks cheap like in the game and so it all works nice. It was a good decision that the story does not focus too much on Alice in the beginning. The space was used to introduce new characters to the film franchise like Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera. The new beast Nemesis looks pretty awesome and doesn't come in CGI. So enjoy this gem of a video game adaptation!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Sequel,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse is an excellent sequel in my eyes. It didn't try to mimic the first film, and did things its own way to further the storyline. However, too much action just about eliminates the horror aspect of the series, and the end is just way too out there for my tastes.Story: Well, that pesky Umbrella Corporation doesn't know how to leave well enough alone, and re-opens the Hive, unleashing the virus onto poor Racoon City. The city becomes a necropolis, and Alice bands together with a few other survivors in an attempt to escape the city and bring Umbrella down. This time, Umbrella steps up the game, unleashing Nemesis, a monster bent on taking them out.Direction: Alexander Witt is no Paul Anderson, but he is a grand action movie director. He brings a different style and look to this film, which I liked. However, he never really builds up any suspense or horror into this film, which was my main problem. Still, he did a solid job and made a damn good sequel.Acting: Milla Jovovich(Alice) kept her performance from the first film, but is much tougher. She can do just about anything. Sienna Guillory(Jill) portrayed the games heroin Jill excellently, and I was not disappointed with her at all. Mm, sexy! Oded Fehr(Carlos) is one of my favorites, and as usual, he rocked the part. However, their talent seemed wasted in this film, because none of the characters really have any depth.Score: Jeff Danna scored an action film. Not the hardest thing in the world to do, but he did so with great skill. Though, it was pretty standard stuff.Violence: As with most sequels, the violence is kicked up a notch or two. There may be a total of five minutes in between shoot outs if we're lucky. The blood level was also increased. We get head shots, bloody gunshot wounds, zombie bites and related gore, decomposed bodies, hideous creatures, an exploded head, and impalings. Yum!Profanity/Sexual Themes: Mike Epps was in the film. Enough said about the language. As far as sexual themes is concerned, we get to topless zombie strippers, and a naked Milla Jovovich in a tank of liquid. Nothing to invoke any wood.Substance Abuse: None.Overall: Overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a good zombie sequel. The only thing that bothered me was that there was no real horror or suspense. Perhaps even a bit too much action, and the ending was way too far fetched. Still, I was entertained, and that is all I expected to be. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Frenetic Sequel,"Resident Evil Apocalypse picks up directly where the first Resident Evil film leaves off. Milla Jovovich again leads the cast as Alice, this time having to fight her way out of Racoon City before a nuclear bomb goes off. I find this film as enjoyable as the first with colourful supporting characters, strong action and a quick runtime. Nemesis is a great villain and the CGI is much better than in the first film. On the downside there is not much character development but this doesn't detract from the fun of the film as we barely have time to catch a breath as the audience. In summary Resident Evil Apocalypse.is a fun switch your brain off thrill ride which slots nicely with its predecessor. This is a film i always have a good time with when i am looking for a quick 90 minutes of escapism.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
little disappointment,"I've played all series of RE video games. And when i heard about ""Nemesis"" i thought it would be great. The visual effect of ""Nemesis"" was great. But for video game, Nemesis' big enemy is Jill Valentine and all STARS members, not Alice. The problem was that for me. When i watched the movie i cant believe my eyes because ""Nemesis"" has showed mercy someone. The Nemesis profile in my mind was not that. And what about the rest of Racoon City? But the biggest bullshit was Alice. I cant remember that kid of ""creature"" in video game contents. For a magazine, that movie was in the worst 10 movies in 2004. I think its very bad for RE fans.........................................",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Does just enough to stay afloat,"I said in my review of the original 'Resident Evil' that I hope the character of 'Alice' evolves and really stamps herself as the undisputed lead character of the series. That was probably the strongest thing 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' actually had going for it. The character really came alive. In the previous film I mentioned she often felt like just another member of the crew. In this one though there can be no doubt that she is in charge.There's just enough going on in this film to keep it watchable. Near the start all the zombies came out again and I feared this was going to be a one trick pony with the character simply avoiding them for the entire run time. Luckily though in the second half of the movie a number of other things popped into the story to keep it fresh and interesting enough to be sustainable.There are some very good action sequences in this film, but there are also some rather dull and unimaginative ones too. The consistency of quality just wasn't quite there. Also the characters, other than 'Alice' , really weren't that memorable this time around around. Most were either boring or simply annoying. For a sequel though 'Resident Evil: Apocalpyse' certainly holds its own and doesn't let the franchise down in any way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The 3 E's...  Exciting, Entertaining, and Energetic","This movie is what might happen if you take a typical zombie flick and give it a plot, lot's of action, and a large city with PLENTY of extras to show mobs of zombies. It has humor. It has suspense. And it has a plot that unfolds; even if you've played the games, it's got plenty of changes to keep you guessing. With, I might add, several of the game characters (Jill, Carlos, and the little girl). I enjoyed this movie better than any since Lord of the Rings, Return of the King. Not that you could compare the two. It's just that there haven't been too many good movies since then.Milla Jojovich is really cool and she's a talented actress. Her character really rocks when her hidden secrets come out. Mike Epps kept me rolling with laughter. He's always funny, and it was quite nice and different to see Oded Fehr in this role as Carlos. Cool. As for Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine... she was a PERFECT match. This movie was very fun and I'd love to see it again and again and again....I voted 9/10. I thought they out-did themselves on this one and i thought the first one was good....",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing like the first amazing movie..,"I cannot even begin to describe disappointed I was upon seeing Apocalypse. I had been waiting to see it for a very long time and was quite sure the critiques were just being critiques and that the movie was awesome! I should have respected the experience.What the hell Alexander Witt?! Where are the zombies, man?! The whole movie was about the Thing-and-Robocop-hybrid Nemesis (Ah, and how scary I'd imagined it would be..) and the long-coming death match between him and Alice. There was no room for zombies!Alice was turned into a superhero, acrobatic cycler, angry Lara Croft. Don't get me wrong, this does not give the movie a game-like feeling. (If you want to see the best example for that, watch Silent Hill) The director takes Resident Evil by the hand and dishonorably turns it into an average action flick.How low can you get, adding pointless action scenes to a zombie movie just to keep the tension up? (""Omg! They're gonna get bored! Milla, break through this window with your motorbike! This'll give us a few more minutes."" )And Jill Valentine... Great choice of actress but bad, bad practice integrating her to the film. She was absolutely suppressed by Alice and didn't really serve any purpose to the film. Maybe two alpha females can't be a good idea.The writing was bad (lots of ""But why?""s and ""But how?""s), the ending was bad (although it was supposed to leave us surprised and excited), the characters were mostly shallow and it was not, I repeat, NOT nearly scary enough.Resident Evil is supposed to be scary. That's like the first and very simple rule of the RE trademark, unfortunately the director preferred to ignore it and showed us how unimaginative he can be about scary movies. If I were a studio, I would never, ever hand him over another horror project.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better then the first one.,"Milla kicks zombie butt again, and does it harder. REA is bigger badder and more fun then RE, OK the script was pretty dire, and the quality of the acting the same, the zombies still look the same as in RE for scariness but Milla's Alice is now a gun toting action woman with an attitude who you don't mess with-especially if your a zombie.Whether they'll be a third episode of the franchise is anyone's guess, but if they do do it, then it would be nice to have Sienna Guillory's character back as a counter to Milla's Alice. Fast paced lively and doesn't challenge your mind. 8 out of ten.Just on a nitpicking point how many of you saw the same zombies being repeatedly killed in different shots as they slowly plodded towards the STAR police line.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Thin Story But An Enjoyable Sequel Nonetheless,"After surviving the horrors of The Hive and managing to escape, Alice (Mila Jovovich) discovers that the T-Virus has found it's way into Raccoon City resurrecting the dead. On her route to try and get out the city, she comes across other bands of survivors and they join forces to try and escape before the Umbrella Corporation resorts to extreme measures in ""cleansing"" the city. To do this, though, they first need to rescue the daughter of Dr. Ashford (the creator of the T-Virus) who is still within in the city limits. This will be made all the more harder, however, as the Umbrella Corporation have sent in a formidable opponent to stop them...Nemesis.Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a pretty decent sequel to the enjoyable Resident Evil movie, and is made much more enjoyable with the introduction of Nemesis. Thankfully, Nemesis makes more than just one solitary appearance as he is such a formidable character & presence (just like Pyramid Head in Silent Hill), and I'd maybe go as far as to say that if it wasn't for that character then the movie may have lacked a wee bit even with all the other action.The action in the movie is pretty relentless from start to finish with a good few impressive action scenes, two of which being the church scene involving Alice and three Lickers, and the action following the scene where Alice runs face first down a 200 foot building.The story line continues on from the 1st movie, but never really develops much until the final few scenes which lead onto the 3rd film, so don't expect much from this sequel story-wise.The acting is a wee bit dire in some places, mainly from Sienna Guillory who plays Jill Valentine, but thankfully it's not bad enough to actually throw you off from watching the film.All in all, like I say, this is a decent sequel and even if you're not familiar with the game series, it's still an enjoyable action flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Frustrating- Well made movie with nothing in the center,"Picking up at the end of the first movie this film tops whats gone before, but at it heart is a decidedly empty center.The plot begins with the evil corporation going back into the Hive complex that was the setting of the first film. They are unprepared for what they find and are almost instantly over run by the walking dead. The dead spill out into the city above and it becomes a fight for survival.This film moves better than the first film. Certainly the handling of the dead and the mutants is infinitely better. The action scenes are first rate, the performances are very good, in fact this film has everything to be considered ""Dawn of the Dead 2"" except a real plot.Thats the rub, for the first half hour there is no real plot only introductions of characters. The second half hour the plot finally kicks in, but by that time I was a bit too distanced from it to care. Essentially the plot has to do with this band of people trying to get out of the city by rescuing the daughter of one of the scientists responsible for the whole mess. The corporation behind it all has their own plans and it becomes a three way battle, good guys, corporation and monsters. If only there had been more to the script, then we'd be talking classic here.I don't know. I gave the film a 6 out of 10, but its probably better than that, I'm just awash in serious disappointment because whats good is so good, that I wanted more behind it.Try it and decide for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil: Not so Evil!,"I don't quite get why every one is complaining about this movie. I'm a huge fan of RE, esp RE3. I don't know how many times i have played that game. I've got all the RE games and I love em.So, the movie was a bit of a let down in some places but it was your basic zombie-bust'em-up.What I thought was a bit pathetic was dragging a kid into it, made it a bit more family friendly with that. I reckon that was its biggest let down. Like Jurrassic Park 3, when they had a kid in it, it got cr@p! But despite the kiddie-factor, RE:A managed to overcome it (mostly - the main highlight was the bit in the school) It had more suspense than the first and I reckon this is a good example of where the sequel is better than the first.A bit cheesy that at the end, obvious sequel to follow!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great action,"Action packed zombie goodness, but the plot leaves something to be desired. The characters are developed and well acted, but the storyline feels disjointed. In my opinion, the movie should have ended after the group escapes raccoon city, the last five minutes just serve to set up the next movie and don't add much. But Alice kicks ass as usual and it's a worthy resident evil successor.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than the first,"This is a great movie if you look solely for action. If you're expecting more, don't expect that. I wish that these movies followed the games a bit more....but what are you going to do right? But Jill definitely made this movie better. First of all she's really HOT and she carries a gun, there is nothing better than that. Finally, a GOOD character comes into the story. Milla Jovovich definitely plays her part, but if it was just her, it wouldn't be the same. Although the camera work was awful and there was barely any plot, the movie sells in its 90 minutes of packed action. A 7 out of 10 is good enough for this movie, but I wish it could have been more gory, but oh well......once again 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't waste your time,This would probably have to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. All dialogue (except milla's monologues) was ridiculously stupid with some characters even dying after their action hero one liners. In terms of storyline progression and character introduction this seems to have completely missed the point. I cannot even begin to explain why i hate Jill Valentine.The change in directors has played a big role in the demise of this movie. In fact i doubt that Paul Anderson has even bothered to watch the first movie. The camera jerks around wildly and I wouldn't be surprised if there was some secret competition among inadequate directors to see who could change angles most often.This is neither scary nor that great on Action.This is my first Comment about a movie on IMDb but this had to be said. If you liked the first movie don't watch this.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
What the Hell was this piece of crap ????,"This movie need some adult supervision in its production, script writing and editing. This ""movie"", and i use that term in the most liberal sense possible, looks like a bunch of 8th graders (Sorry if I offend any 8th graders out there) were given complete reign over this movie from start to finish.if it weren't for the fact that you had extremely loud explosions and gun fights from time to time ... OK most of the movie... I would have fell asleep in the theater. This movie was boring, badly edited, poorly directed, badly acted, plot less, pointless, worthless.if you are just looking for plot less, shot em up movies then this is the movie for you. But then you might even be disappointed with this movie still. I can not believe that any studio really allowed this movie to go past the script stage. I personally would have wrote on the front page of the script, ""This is total garbage, please look for another job, you are wasting our time."" , even if it was only the first 20 pages were even looked at.The ONLY good thing out of this movie is that this gives hope to ANYONE that is attempting to make it to Hollywood, that they have a solid chance in making it. I don't ever have the greatest sense on script writing, but I believe I could have scripted this movie in a couple days being completely drunk a lot better then this piece of garbage.On the Snooze Scale from one Z to ten Z's this was a solid ZZZZZZZZ(8)",,Anonymous,Horror
"Great film, entertaining franchise","I love the ResiEvil films, the entire franchise is just pure entertainment, granted, starting with Apocalypse they moved away from the horror and further into action sci-fi but it's not a bad thing.RE Apocalypse starts off directly after the events of the first movie, there's a little flashback narrative by Milla Jovovich to fill in the questions for anyone skipping the first film, apocalypse upped the action by 70% and added more characters from the games like Jill Valentine to the movie franchise, lots of martial arts and gunplay throughout the film, it's good fun.If you like zombies, action, hot women, guns, sci-fi etc then you'll enjoy the ResiEvil series.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bad movie for you gamers ***2/5***,"Well, we all know that the video game industry is making huge amounts of money. $50 per game, as opposed to a $10 movie ticket. So the movie makers think ""Hmmm, ima gunna make a movie based on a popular video game and it'll be great! Everyone'll love it"" Well they were horribly wrong. Just like the people who made video games based on movies. (Catwoman)And we're going to see a lot more of them.The Resident Evil series will always have a place in my heart. the stories of classic video games such as Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, the game this movie is based on are butchered in this film. I really don't like the character Alice, as she is just a Hollywood add-on to woo people who have never played the games. She was good in the first film, because that was an original story, set in the RE story.This movie, being a remake of RE3, didn't meet my expectations. The problem was, after playing the game and loving it, I continued to expect a lot of things from the movie. In other words, I have a lot of high standards on sequels and movies, I want the same enjoyment i got from watching, or in this case, playing, the original. Which in most cases, was not satisfied.This movie is OKAY for anyone who has never played the Resident Evil games, or know nothing about the story preceding the movies.

Zombie killing cheese at its best!,"The first Resident Evil movie surprised me with its mystery/thriller aspect and more serious tone. I loved it. Resident Evil 2 on the other hand is what I was expecting from the first. It's complete and utter cheese. It's so bad it's good. It's cliche, it's hokey, it's everything I thought it would be. While I wish it had followed more closely to the tone of the first film I cannot help but be thankful that this is the direction it took. If you know what you're getting yourself into than there is nothing to complain about. Valentine looks like a cosplay of a video game character. The action is over the top and the acting is ham. The cgi is a huge step up from movie 2 years previous. However, what I am most thankful for the the kick ass practical effects for Nemisis. Brilliant! Every step is heavy, you can feel the danger every time he's on screen, a proper killing machine. This is the type of movie to enjoy with a few drinks and some friends.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Over The Top Brain Off Entertainment,"In this sequel to 2002's video game adaptation of Resident Evil.The virus has escaped to the city and Alice has escaped with abnormal abilities and is aiding a group of survivors left for dead by the deceitful Umbrella Corporation who plan to nuke it to get rid of and cover up the zombie epidemic by all means necessary.Resident Evil Apocalypse is the perfect popcorn movie one of which you cannot take seriously at all.It's pure entertainment and it knows it is and it delivers what it promises to contain, a rush of non-stop action.The movie strays further away from the games but adds two existing game characters Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliviera.This movie is meant as a big budget action film it's supposed to be over the top and it's supposed to be a special effects extravaganza so of course critics will over-analyze it and label it as garbage but those critics don't know how to have a good time.The elements of cinema here are actually very good aside from one thing.The acting is awesome a big improvement from the first Milla Jovovich is more intense, Oded Fehr is as cool as ever, Sienna Guillory is bad @$$, and Mike Epps is a riot.The visual effects are no longer grainy and cold looking but they're sleek, glossy, with a Tim Burton kind of feel by which i mean a lot of night settings but with lots of various colours in the night settings.The dialogue is just brutal, it's unbelievably cliché and not in a purposeful, campy way it's just plain old bad dialogue and it totally distracts you from the films mood.Aside from that there's more adrenaline pumped action, better gun brawls, amazing martial arts choreography, great explosions, and realistic gore.The plot is really interesting you really want to know the secrets of Umbrella and once again were are left with a giant cliffhanger that gets us looking forward to the third movie in theatres September 2007.Overall I have to say taking the film in a much lighter and humorous tone made it far easier to enjoy the over the top action and entertaining storyline unfold.It's obviously just made for fun, there's no uplifting message just pure brain off entertainment.Paul WS Anderson steps down as director but still contributes as writer which is very evident as everything else seemed to improve but the dialogue got worse lol.See it for the special effects and don't expect a brilliant adaptation of Resident Evil 2 or a terrifying zombie flick like Dawn Of The Dead expect to be entertained and you will be.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a disappointment!,"After seeing the first Resident Evil movie and liking it, I was expecting a whole lot more from this film, which I had been anticipating as soon as I found out they were going to make a sequel. Unfortunately, RE Apocalypse doesn't have any of the things that made the first one good! Resident Evil was first and foremost a horror movie, with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci-fi touch, a lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game, with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional background for the RE world. The make-up and special effects were top-notch, and all of the actors, including the ones with minor roles, did a fantastic job.RE Apocalypse accomplishes none of these things. If you're expecting a horror movie, what you get is a weird combination of the Kung-Fu and action genres. There's no character development, the plot is shallow and even Mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one.I found the movie to be extremely boring and run-of-the-mill, and was also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great if they'd improved upon the first movie's many strengths and taken out just some of its weaknesses.In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly discouraged me from seeing the third one, which is set to be released next year.

"By Sequel Standards, This One Is Pretty Impressive","After Alice escapes from Umbrella Corporation's secret underground laboratory (The Hive) as seen in the first film, she stumbles into Raccoon City, which has already become overrun with people infected by the T-Virus. Umbrella Corp closes the city to leave everyone to die.First, I must confess the first film took two viewings for me to appreciate it. I watched it once and was not moved, but was very impressed the second time. This sequel caught my attention the first time. Now, sure, very little happens in it and it has some flaws, but as I say, by sequel standards it is quite good. A film series never really manages to make a great sophomore effort (with the exception of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II""), so take each one with a grain of salt.I could debate the merits of director Alexander Witt versus Paul Anderson. Anderson still wrote this film but declined to direct, and Witt is admittedly a very inexperienced director. But he did fine... and kept the similar style that Anderson had, leaving the two movies very seamless (which is important when they run one to the other without pause).I enjoyed the subtle references to other films, like the line ""10 points"" that I assume to reference ""Deathrace 2000"" and the line ""Finish him!"" that clearly is from Anderson's previous effort, ""Mortal Kombat"". Very nice work.The Nemesis was a great creature. Not exactly like the game, but a formidable foe. The move to make him the counterpart to Alice was a good plot device and plays out well. I also liked the dogs, which are more true to the video game version. Those dogs in the game can be quite the pain in the butt. I think the way the zombies walked was perfect, exactly how zombies should. Many films get this wrong these days, not making the corpses Romeroesque enough. This movie gets it, keeping the tradition alive.It's a long tradition, too: this is a sequel to another movie (""Resident Evil"") based on a video game (""Biohazard""), which was based on an older video game (""Alone in the Dark""), inspired by Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" series, which was inspired by Roger Corman's ""Last Man on Earth"", which was based off of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"".I disliked the fast movements by the people and the fast camera work that went with it. Many times things happened too fast to really see what was going on, and I found this to be a real setback. I don't recall the first film doing this (another Witt/Anderson difference?) and it seemed very strangely paced for a horror film (though maybe properly paced for an action film).The geeky guys get the ladies: Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, which is crucial since geeky guys are obsessed with Milla and have been ever since ""The 5th Element"". They also now have their Jill Valentine, the darling of the ""Resident Evil"" games. The film creators did a great job keeping the costume for Jill very close to the game, though I think the actress could have looked more similar. (And in the third film we have Ali Larter as Claire Redfield, which is an even bigger stretch.) As you can probably tell, I endorse this film. While I think Paul Anderson would have made a better sequel than Witt did, that's just being nitpicky. For what we were given, we have a great package and a respectable bridge between the first and third films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sienna Guillory was the BEST THING ABOUT THE MOVIE. The actress portraying JILL VALENTINE, nailed her character, she portrayed her really well. If there's a third part to the franchise I hope that Alice is killed in the begginning of the movie or she's not in it at all and hopefully they'll get rid of Paul W. Anderson. I hope they bring Chris Redfield and Barry Burton and Albert Albert Wesker as the main villain of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than average action movie,"Just saw this movie for the first time on DVD. I was a fan of the videogames which the movies are loosely based on. That being said I am no fanboy and you will find that this is an unbiased review. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this movie. The movie does seem to convey a sense of suspense and the fight scenes are action packed. Computer animated special effects were below average. The makeup job they did for the zombies slightly makes up for it. I did not notice as many plot holes as I expected for a action movie based on a video game to have.

Game fans will hate it but otherwise its good,"Don't be put off by the low rating on this page - its been dragged down by very pathetic fans of the games who despite the fact that it has been nearly five years since the release of the first movie still haven't come to terms with the films.This film does exactly what is expected of it - it's got two hot actresses in little clothing, good actions sequences, humor and the acting is good (especially for Milla), people who tell you otherwise are usually Game-Loving/Film-Hating. Don't expect any vast life changing lesson from the film because its not trying to do that.The script is passable and moves the story at a good pace - most of the fights are by the script bar two but those two are just so dam good that you don't really mind.One special mention has to go out to Seinna Gulliory who plays Jill - not only does she look the part but she plays it perfectly. It would have been very easy for her to just fade in comparison to the killing machine Alice but instead has emerged as one of the film-lovers favorite characters. Her accent is perfect and came as a big shock to me when I found out she was English.Bottom Line - Don't be fooled by the low rating - it succeeds at what it aims at - its just a dam good and enjoyable action/horror for the majority of the population who don't spend every minute of their lives glued to the Games.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good movie, lots of action, hot women","I thought the movie was good. The action was a little frantic, but the overall plot was well thought out. Following the storyline of the game introducing new characters is a great idea that the director does well. Milla and Sienna do a great job as the heroines. Mike Epps does an excellent job providing some comedic relief. I really like the fact that the writers made the movie for fans, and that it is something fans of the movie and the games would enjoy watching as the story unfolds. Perhaps you will even remember a part from the game in the movie. All else I can really say without giving the movie away is that as long as Milla keeps looking hot I'll see whatever they decide to do in the future. I will look forward to a sequel if it is done as well as the first two.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cos its a thriller!,"When I say thriller, i mean its like Jacko's 80's video, not any kind of enjoyable film. Let me start by saying I thought the first movie was acceptable. It wasn't brilliant, and it wasn't what most of the fans wanted, but I thought it did a good job of painting a picture of the umbrella corporation and the way it works. (Why the computer couldn't just inform them of the virus outbreak remotely though i wonder, but thats another film) Anyway, getting back to RE:A, what exactly was the point of this film? I'm writing this in utter disbelief after reading some of the other reviews. Terms such as ""excellent action sequences"" and ""non stop adrenaline"" are used frequently, but i wonder what film they refer to. Certainly not apocalypse.The action is jumpy and blurred, much like the car chase from the Bourne supremacy which spoilt the whole film. The camera so rapidly its impossible to tell what is going on. I wanted to see shotguns blowing heads off, zombies getting decapitated etc. Sure its gory, but hello Anderson; its a f***kcing zombie film, thats what we want.Resident Evil has got a better storyline that most zombie films with the first film spending a lot of time explaining to us the whole Umbrella Company, and this is fine. The start of the film even showed promise, until they went into the Hive. (Why would you? why why why without at least 50 armed soldiers) But we already know about that, there's no need to cram so much weak plot that there is no room for any action. We don't want to see the Umbrella bosses, its a faceless company and thats how it should stay. I'm not going to point out the plot holes as I've only got 1000 words in which to do it.Get James Cameron for RE3 or don't bother.A poor film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than the First Resident Evil,"I enjoyed this installment of the franchise a lot. It is my favorite of the series.

"Stimulating visuals and kick-ass female leads, but not much else.","The film begins with a recap of what happened at the end of the last film with Alice waking up to discover Racoon city dead empty. After this we see the virus is released by some Umbrella workers who go into the hive to check what had happen and in doing so, they release the virus and these zombies into the city. To counter attack this problem Umbrella decides to seal off the city even with many uninfected citizens and law-enforcements getting left behind. Alice discovers that she has been injected with a virus, which has given her superhuman abilities. She also come across a small group of survivors led by officer Jill Valentine that she teams up with after being contacted by doctor who wants them to find his daughter and in exchange he'll get them out before Umbrella nukes their mishap.Now this felt like a video game, but that doesn't mean its actually a good film. I found it to be an improvement over the unexceptional first flick, but not by too much. The original film was directed by Paul Anderson, but he decided to go with the ""Alien vs. Predator"" project instead of directing this piece. He might not have directed the film, but he did write the screenplay for sequel. Instead debut director Alexander Witt sits in the director's chair and brings to the series a far more expansive cookie cutter action flick that's very nice to look at. Well, that is the case when you can see what's happening! Just like the first film this one is just as slick and overly showy in detail. But what did become distracting was the constant use of stupid slow-motion and hasty editing that just got in the way of some of the action. Witt goes out of his way to up the action in leaps and bounds. While, these moments might be longer and be filled with many stylistic Matrix touches, but they just seemed quite pedestrian and unexciting at times. The fast and furious camera-work and pounding metal soundtrack is what gave these scenes its jumpy and highly-powered bursts. It just falls in the same hole as the first film with the arty techniques taking over the show, but at least on this occasion there was more brainless action to go around within it's flashy imprints. What I found a crime was that, where was the splatter? Yep, the violence is watered down and even far more than the previous flick, but the CGI effects were slightly better. The monster make-up is top-notch, though. The morbid claustrophobic atmosphere of ""The Hive"" in the first is replaced here with an subdued post-apocalyptic presence in the city.Again the ragged plot and characters are secondary to the gloss and glitter of the production. The basic story sets up a typical small group of one-dimensional survivors trying to survive from a horde of zombies, rabid dogs and a mutant killing machine and at the end it gets us geared up for another sequel. It's the usual fluff with many incoherent and illogical lapses and cardboard, comic characters. The plot throws in everything but the kitchen sink from that of the power and influence of the corporation to flashbacks and heroic nonsense. But they don't bother to make too much sense of it with the inane script coming across with the standard cliché dialogue. They even try to demonstrate some humour with a comic relief character played by Mike Epps that draws more duds and only adds to the misfire. The humour just feels miscast, but Epps' performance is the most lively. The other performances are reasonably cold, but I thought that the always sexy Milla Jovovich was fine and kicked ass again, but really she wasn't given enough to do and she should've been made the centrepiece. Sienna Guillory looked great as the strong willed, mini-skirt wearing Jill Valentine. While, the support roles from Oded Fehr, Sandrine Holt, Zack Ward and Jared Harris are thin at best.""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a boisterous and overblown piece of junk that just can't keep still for too long. Well, at least this popcorn flick does kinda entertain and gladly flies by quick enough. Amen!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Mindless Fun,"After reading all the heinous reviews of the movie I went in to this last night with ridiculously low expectations. To my surprise I actually left the theater extremely pleased. I didn't like the first ""Resident Evil"" film but this one was a lot better. There was actually some sort of plot going on and the action was really great. Okay so the acting wasn't stellar by any means but it didn't make me want to vomit either. If you're looking to have a good time and aren't in search for the next ""Citizen Kane"" then this would be a recommendation for you. I am certainly looking forward to the third installment since they left me kind of hanging at the end and I haven't followed the video games. I also think they should have titled this one ""Nemesis"" instead of ""Apocalypse"" because now they're going to be in a bind when they actually get to the one that's supposed to have that title.

Resident Evil 2/ Paul S. Anderson needs to die. SLOWLY.,"So tonight I was in a mood for pain, and boy did Resident Evil2 meet my needs. The only cool highlights of seeing the movie were a reference to GTA3 (Thereby cementing the fact that the movie needs to steal from better things to survive), and a preview for a much scarier looking film : White Noise. This one looks wicked creepier than the film I actually went to see. I won't even talk about acting because it is like shooting fish in a barrel. On a related note, why was everyone so eager to see the character of Jill Valentine? She was hot and all and wore mini-skirts, but reeked of that horrible Tomb Raider movie and was about as bland and expressionless as a mannequin.There were no scares because I could predict everything that was supposed to scare us about 2 minutes before it happened. They were all of the lowest ""BOO"" quality because no one knew how to properly build tension in the movie. The zombies were drunks with a biting problem. It's impossible to believe they can take over an entire city when they can't even walk straight. The sub baddies (lickers and zombie dogs) should've gotten more screen time as they WERE kinda cool. Nemesis at first was cool but then got lamer and lamer as the movie went on. The script was totally illogical. Would it be too much trouble for Paul S. Anderson to at least make us think there is a chance in hell of say, an ending? Not necessarily a good one, but an ending? Does he know how to do anything but make bad movies that demand sequels? I bet he took about half an hour to whip up the story for this. I'd bet even more that I could whip up a better movie story to this than he could. At least he didn't have the funny black guy die. I could go on, but you get the idea. This gets a D-.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Borrowing elements from the video games Resident Evil 2, 3: Nemesis, and Code: Veronica","Resident Evil was a fast-paced, enjoyable, horror/adventure romp. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is Borrowing elements from the video games Resident Evil 2, 3: Nemesis, and Code: Veronica.The film opened to theatres on September 10, 2004. On a budget of $40 million, the film grossed $51 million domestically and $129 million worldwide, surpassing the box office gross of the previous instalment. Resident Evil: Apocalypse received mostly negative reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences but criticised the plot. Resident Evil: Apocalypse has lots of action,Milla Jovovich still deserves much of the credit for the film's short-term success , for what people refer to as ""star quality,"" perhaps nothing more is needed than the alluring oddity of her face, the widely-spaced cat's eyes and innocent animal look, fearless yet poignantly unprotected. The filmmakers can count themselves lucky to have an actress who can conjure audience empathy out of nothing;this sequel has a pleasing B-movie insouciance, not to say incoherence: it's a film with little on its mind beyond giving the audience their money's worth of horror, action, moody industrial settings and hip Gothic attitude. The no-frills script amalgamates various genre classics from the 1980s: the all-night race through a derelict city derives most obviously from Escape From New York, while the evil corporation pulling the strings recalls Aliens, as do the monstrous mutants of their creation. The easily-dispatched zombies themselves seem like something of an afterthought – an element for the characters to wade through, rather than a threat in their own right.As for the warrior women who dominate proceedings, they're swift-moving physical presences rather than characters, all sharp cheekbones, taut limbs and video-game poses. Specific acting skill is not required, nor is martial arts training beyond the basics – shadows and flashy editing make the action sufficiently hard to follow in detail, and stunt doubles do the rest.So, if you're into horror-action films, this is a good bet. If you're into cerebral movies about the human condition, you'll want to find another way to spend a couple hours.Lovers of Zombie films and action flicks should like this fast paced sequel.Followed by Resident Evil: Extinction.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hollywood never learns...,"Forgive the crude review and its grammar and stuff as I'm dyslexic.The biggest problem in Hollywood now is giving work to people like Anderson and Boll, who are pretty much dead weight. none of their films are all that great(bolls are pure crap) and neither of the films have any real originality.Resident Evil was basically a combination of James Camerons 'Aliens', Renny Harlins 'the long kiss goodnight', a little bit of 'space odyssey 2001', and misc bits from other films like 'Alice and wonderland', 'dawn of the dead', and 'the matrix'.Re2 seemed to attempt to take more elements from the game which was a good idea, but the nemesis was made a terribly generic monster that could have had its ass handed to it by Jason Voorhees on a good or bad day. The direction of Alexander Witt was on par with Andersons script. Not a very good combination for movie goers as it was another PG-13 zombie film that only got an 'R' for lame nudity and cursing.I found it very hard to watch as I was quite familiar with Jill Valentine, Carlos Olivera, Nicholai SOlokov and the Nemesis itself. And ALL were done terribly, or made from bad guys to good guys(Nicholai, Nemesis). Jill was thoroughly unlikable and Sienna Guillroy's performance matched it very well, Oded Fehr as Carlos..well, he's too old, looks nothing like the character but god almighty the man was the only charming part of the film...Well, he and Mike Epps. I would have rather seen these two guys put together in a zombie film as a swat cop and a smart ass for about 90 minutes than watch RE2 again.And finally the nemesis itself...well the body proportions did NOT match at all(Giant head, giant feet, long legs, stubby arms, stubby torso and small hands)mix in the fact it was made into a complete pussy of a creature well..thats pretty much all I can say. It was a stupid silly monster that wasn't fun to watch and blended in the background much like a lot of the performances.It's a stupid film with unconvincing special effects, terrible editing, followed by terrible direction and writing.I give the film a 3/10.

I loved Dawn of the Dead from this year also but this is a different type of zombie film. It showed people who were intelligent and you didn't know what was going to happen next.

That's what I did.It sort of weaves in and out of cool, suspenseful moments, and then back into the worst acting in recent cinematic history.There seemed to a different accent for every character. It's completely ridiculous. I had to laugh at that.Every character is a rip-off of a character we've all seen before. The street-wise black guy character is a complete cliché' and an obviously inserted ""comic relief"" character, but for some reason, he actually manages to be funny, and not in an unintentional way.The plot was actually kind of cool. It got me into it...a little. It was a rip-off of ""Escape from New York"", but it worked for this film.Also, we get to see one or two original zombie scenes.

The second best in the series.,"After seeing the first film I definitely wanted to see the sequel,
I can honestly say it was at least a little better then the first because
there is more. This time there is more action less scares.I seen this one on DVD with a buddy, after I responded well to the first
he had the second film and brought it over and we watched it, I loved it
even more because it had a lot of action and it left me wanting more,
because it ends on a cliffhanger.This film pretty much picks up right were the first leaves off,
Umbrella employees re-open the hive and release the zombies,
within a few hours the city is over-run by the undead. 
Alice wakes up as in the first and enters the city and helps a group
of survivors as they battle against Umbrella Corporation.There are plot twists that are confusing and some unexpected but it's fun.
And the best part a video game favorite, Nemesis is in it, and he is awesome.I give it a 7/10. A fun follow up to the first, and like the first, ends on
a cliffhanger and leaves you wanting more. But I'll be honest the series
goes down hill from here. This is the second best in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't go into it expecting Dawn of the Dead or any other even moderately smart movie. It's all about the action, explosions, monsters, and thin, thin plot that the game has.

"Is better and worst than the original, but still fails to transfer the ""Resident Evil"" franchise  to the screen.","If you find my review of ""Resident Evil"" you will very quickly discover I didn't like it. Simply because the director took the ideas and settings of Resi, and made his own thing. Eliminating gore, suspense and horror and instead making a lame action film. This film, has more to do with the Resi franchise, but still comes across as more of an action film than a survival horror.The film, once again, starts off well, with the threat of the virus unleashed and Racoon City being evacuated. However, after that, it goes rapidly downhill. There is actually a lack of zombies in this film (which is odd considering the city is meant to be full of them)and even when they're on screen, they're presented in a dull, laggy collage of moments which is meant to intensify their horrid appearance, but just makes them boring.The film centres around our main protagonist (super charged naked Milla Javovich - spelling?) as she is now a super hero and is helping a group of survivors escape from the city. It is good to see some of the characters such as Carlos and Jill Valentine appear from the game but they're characters are never explored and one gets the impression they're there to look cool and kick butt instead of having actual depth. But then again, this film has no depth.At the end of the first film, audiences were treated with the possibility for a sequel involving Nemesis (a rock hard ugly dude in leather.) In the game, he is a force to be reckoned with and is truly terrifying and screamingly brutal. In the film, he comes off VERY cheesy, he is armed to the teeth with explosives and machine guns, and seems to appear, shoot at our main female, then disappear. Very disappointing.There are some good moments though, such as making Lickers less powerful, making for a fairly entertaining shootout in a church (that is a until an overly dramatised bike scene is introduced), and a school full of zombie children. Although both these ideas are full of potential, they're both streamlined into lame action set pieces and never used to full advantage to creep the audience out.The ending is the worst for the entire film, in which Nemesis joins up with our heroes to fight the evil Umbrella Corporation. It must be said that these ""teaming-ups by former enemies"" is a horrid idea, also idealised in Aliens Versus Predator (directed by the same guy who made the first Resi film and also produced this film.)As I stated before, this film is a lame cheesy action flick - not the survival horror it deserves to be.For the moment, I am hoping there is not a Resi 3 in the pipeline.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The perfect sequel! Hollywood, take note: This is how a sequel is done!","After watching the first Resident Evil, I've thought it to be the best zombie virus film I've seen. Now, after watching Apocalypse, I know I was right. The definition of a good sequel is that it picks up where the first film has ended, smoothly continues, leaves no loose ends and unanswered questions, doesn't open itself to plot holes, and takes the rules made by the first film to a new and improved level. Resident Evil: Apocalypse does all of these, and in a nearly perfect way. In my opinion, it's easily in the top 5 of the best sequels ever made. Another thing I liked, is that it shows features that we've seen before (or will see later) in other famous films in their respective genres, like Terminator, The Matrix, The Descent and pretty much ever new zombie flick made in the 21st century. Resident Evil is probably the hottest name in the zombie film industry, and by right.The screenplay and story are excellent, although the name is slightly misleading - the only place going through a ""zombie apocalypse"" is Raccoon City, not the entire world as the name (and the end scene in the first film) imply. Perhaps Resident Evil: Raccoon City would have been a better name, but never mind that. The plot involves everything we've learnt and today know to want and expect to see. An area infected by zombies, survivors trying to escape/live through the ordeal, and excellent action scenes of battles. As for the new and evolved rules - they're absolutely there and are very exciting, but I wouldn't want to risk spoilers.The acting is excellent. Milla Jovovich is as talented, beautiful and deadly as in the first film, and is this time joined by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, the perfect femme fatal! I also liked Jarred Harris's roll as Dr. Ashford, but altogether a great work by the entire cast!Direction and cinematography are also great, featuring some terminator style shots from the point of view of the beings controlled by the Umbrella Corporation. The soundtrack is also just the way it should be in a zombie flick.It took me to this week to familiarize myself with the Resident Evil anthology, and not a moment too soon. I only wish I'd known it years ago. As a big fan of the Underworld anthology, I salute the better predecessor. I know I'm about to have a great time watching the rest of the Resident Evil films, including the animated ones. This film in particular is, as I've said, better than the first, and leaves plenty of room for more improvements (or a devastating fall from grace) in the third.

No atmosphere. Just a really bad sequel...,"""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" starts right there, where the audience has left Alice. But while the first movie had a really cool and claustrophobic atmosphere, watching this movie just gives you the impression that the makers had too much of a budget and too many thoughts that just don't fit together to make an enjoyable film.The main female kick arse characters of this movie - Alice and Jill Valentine - are not credible. It is simply not enough to take two good looking actresses and let them toy around with guns. The character of L.J. is laden with dumb stereotypes.

Mindless (but fun) action.,"I'm a fan of the Resident Evil movies. They're clearly made by people who are not overly concerned with sticking closely to the video games, and I think that's a good thing. The series boils down to basically a few action flicks with a sprinkling of zombies and Milla Jovovich.Apocalypse is pretty similar to the other two Resident Evil movies, only it's set in the same city that the second and third Resident Evil games are in. There are enough familiar names and cameos to keep fans invested in the plot and its hodge-podge of movie clichés.As ridiculous as it is to see little, 100 pound Milla fighting a 400 pound monster or outrunning an explosion, it somehow works amongst all the other ridiculous stuff that's going on. I love all the casting, (except for the Mike Epps stereotypical character) and Jill and Alice are hot and tough enough to keep the movie interesting. Apocalypse is not frightening or mind-blowing, but I just can't help but enjoy a video game movie that is fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
entertaining yet horrible,"hello my dears, (spoilers a head and sorry for the language)to be fair, I really thought this movie would be a great one. I wanted to see it in theaters, but unfortunately I didn't have the time. When I first saw this movie I was glad I didn't paid a ticket for this. Here are the reasons why:there are few good points about this movie. The acting wasn't all that bad and at least they tried to make it good but they failed. The script was totally horrible! Many dumb and ridiculous things were in it and let us not forget those horrible - yet typical for American movies - lines like: ""stay!"". Honestly, who says that against a zombie dog?For those who enjoyed resident evil: nemesis (the game) you will be shocked and p!ssed off. The great characters featuring in that game have been translated to the big screen in a horrible way. you won't even see your favorite characters like Carlos, Nicholai or Mikhaïl. There is a Carlos and a Nicholai in the movie, but the only thing they have in common with their superior game characters is a name.and let's not forget how they Scwed up one of the fan's favorite enemies. Yes indeed, Nemesis. In stead of the big, great monster we here have a big zombie that gets defeated by a thin, small girl... in hand combat! Other then that he even has feelings, no tentacles but a machine gun and he can actually scan people. Other then this he actually looked like Nemesis but that's about it.The acting wasn't that bad but it wasn't good either. I won't say it's the fault of the actors but the script really made them look bad. The most horrible character of this movie must be Jill Valentine. What was once a great, sweet but still kick-as heroine now turned into some boring, ridiculous, dumb *****.Many people say it's so much better then the first but I do not agree. The first one had nothing to do with the game, in the second one they destroyed the game completely. The first one had better action, better characters, actually everything was better.my conclusion is this one: other then the good make-up and special effects, this movie isn't really a recommended one. If you have ever played resident evil or if you aren't a fan of zombie movies, then don't see it. You only will be disappointed, if you want to see a good zombie movie go and rend ""Shaun of the dead"", ""Dawn of the dead"" or the Romero classics or buy the games. They are much more entertaining, have a much better script and much better acting and also much better zombies.I gave it 2 for destroying everything they could have done and Scwing up really good things in the resident evil universe. They should have chosen Romero's script for resident evil in the first place. Since the first one was good, I'm going to give the third one a chance, although I'm already fearing (and also wondering how) that they are going to Scw up another great character in the resident evil games: Claire Redfield.greetings from Hell",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Distracting enough for undemanding genre fans,"With the virus breaking out of the ""secure"" Hive, the Umbrella Corporation order Racoon City to be sealed off and isolated  even if it traps most of the residents inside with the undead infected. The Corporation's scientists are all evacuated, with the exception of one who has lost his daughter within the city. He refuses to leave and turns to the only member of the Corporation's staff still left inside for help  this person being none other than Alice. Joining a band of armed survivors, things don't look good with Alice running out of time - but then the Corporation take the decision, to protect their stockholders and executives, that the city will be destroyed by a nuclear strike at dawn. Meanwhile they take the opportunity to release the Nemesis programme into the city to test its effectiveness.Although the first film was not actually any good, it still did enough to please those who knew what they were getting into when they sat to watch it, and enough of the target audience must have gone to see it to justify a sequel a few years later. Despite clearly having a wider playpen within the story, film doesn't feel like a massive budget has been poured into it in some areas. Specifically the plot and dialogue are pretty weak; the attempt to escape Racoon City has a few things piled onto it to try and up the ante but none of them really ring true and it mainly comes off feeling like the narrative was an afterthought. This is backed up by the poor dialogue and total lack of characterisation in all areas. Of course if you are target audience for this film then it seems unlikely that such things will matter to you and it probably does what you need it to do. There are fights, zombies, big guns, things going bang and men in monster suits. None of it is anything special but it is noisy enough for the teenage male target audience.As with the first film, the theme of the big corporation is not used that well and, although it is stated how evil the company is, we are never really given a sense of them in the same way as some other ""sinister forces at work"" movies have done. The direction makes it all look slick enough but forgets to add the horror and tension that it really should have had. Jovovich is pretty handy but throwing in the odd scene where she looks angry and hurt over her past is not a replacement for delivering a character. The rest of the cast are pretty low rent and make the cast in the first film look better. Guillory is a ""feisty action woman"" who looks like she is from the same cookie cutter that produced Buffy, Charmed, Alias and a hundred others, she does the basics and no more. Likewise Epps, Fehr, Vavasseur and others just play their roles without having any real charisma or anything different, although Epps is actually quite amusing in the outtakes on the DVD! Overall this did what I expected it to do  it was noisy, uninteresting and par for the genre course at best. It has an audience of course and I guess some sections of that will enjoy it but not that many.",,Anonymous,Horror
Way better than the 1st,"Resident evil 2 by far blows the first resident evil away. I'm not saying the first one is bad (i still recommend it) but the second one is better on so many levels. I think the 2nd one does a much better job of explaining the disease than the 1st. In the 2nd movie, you also get a wider and more colorful cast. All the cast in RE2 played their parts very well. The one thing that sets RE2 apart from the first is the action. RE2 is non stop action from start to finish. You also get a wider variety of enemies. In RE2, you get a much more varied environment than in the first movie (which took place entirely in the ""HIVE""). You also don't have to have seen the first one to appreciate the second movie. The RE2 gives a brief summary of the first movie in the beginning. The movie is sometimes labeled as horror, but that is very wrong. The movie is not at all suspenseful, which is one of its flaws. Overall RE2 is a good action movie that will satisfy your need for violence. 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Non stop action, some similiar game adaptation moments, and pure entertainment.",Resident Evil: Apocalypse (5 out of 5 stars).I will say i love the sequel. It lives up to the first movie. Its fast paced. Has plenty of action. And it has some similiar sequences that are like the games. Love the cast ensemble in it. Nemesis is great in it. May not be as scary as the games. Milla Jovovichs character is tough as always. She has enhanced abilities that makes her kick the undeads. There is a lot of exciting action. The story follows Alice and Jill trying to escape the city from the horde of undead and mutants. The cinematography. The script and direction is exciting and fast moving. Don't except any character development. The ending was a little weak compared to the first movie cause i was expecting it differently. If you keep a open mind as an enjoyable action flick.

If I ever see this film again it will be because I have a gun to my head.,"I didn't think it was possible but this film falls even shorter than the first Resisdent Evil film. I bought the DVD only on back of the brilliance of the game it is based on - what a mistake (anyone want to buy it off me?) It bears no resemblance to the game other than two of the characters and they are hardly 'characters'. Who was that English (Austrian?) wheel-chair guy and who did he get acting lesson off - Vin Diesel? Instead of spending money on bad effects they could have got some decent actors. The nemesis creature, pant-wettingly scary in the games is about as scary as Dan Acroyd in the film. At least its bad in a funny way. This is the equivalent of a McDonalds in the film world.

Brilliant Sequel,"This is a very good sequel to RE that really thrilled me, shocked and sent me creeps!

The sequel is not worse, anyway. The whole city of Raccoon is plagued, dead are all around, and only Milla again as Alice may save them all. She does. The movie never gets boring or slow, it holds you glued and gets you more and more excited. The very end makes you ask what the last part be?

Siege,"While the setting could remind many of the old Western movies, it does pack quite a bit of action in here. And therefor makes it more straightforward then the first movie. It also is picking up where the first one left us off. So it does make sense, to watch the first Resident Evil movie. You do not have to have played the games though. Though there are characters in here, that you might have seen or heard of, if you did, it also offers things, that have not been handled in the game series at all!Milla is joined by some other people and we do have a ""funny man"" in here too. So there is some comic relief after all (if that was the one thing, you were missing in the first movie). On the other hand, it is far more lighter, because of the absence of any real story.

"Loud,empty,mindless and soul-less!!!","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsExpanding on the plot of the original movie,a major virus has broken out over Raccoon City.The Umbrella Corporation is responsible and is refusing to provide adequate care.As flesh-eating zombies terrorise the streets,Alice (Milla Jovovich) leads the resistance who fight back and attempt to make The Umbrella Corporation accountable for their actions.Making video games in to movies is a nefarious business,as anyone who's seen the publicity surrounding any movie that's been adapted from a video game (even if that movie in all honesty is quite enjoyable,i.e. Street Fighter) will tell you.And making a sequel is an even riskier endeavor,as anyone who's seen the publicity surrounding any sequel to a video game movie (i.e. Mortal Kombat:Annihilation) will tell you.Given I didn't find the original movie from director Paul W.S. Anderson (who penned the script for this one and who recently helmed the Alien Vs Predator movie) that much of a mind-blowing experience and that I was never in to the Play Station video games the original film was based on in the first place,I wasn't exactly rushing out to give this sequel a go.And had I known what a cr*ppy spectacle this new film from director Alexander Witt (aptly named since he's made such a Witt-less film!) was going to be,I would have evaporated what interest I had altogether.If the lame,unengaging story and woefully inane dialogue don't put you off,I should warn any viewers that are especially sensitive to loud,sudden noises that they're happening here,to and nether in this film (I was surprised the Fat Slags didn't show up,to be honest!!!) to the point where you're always on edge waiting for the next shuddering scene to come up.Even the special effects and creature designs look tacky and unimpressive,but they ultimately sum up the tone of the whole film.It's a droning and unmerry experience,where no one seems to be having a good time and nobody seems to be nice to each other.It ultimately shows up what a joyless and ugly spectacle this misguided loser is.Aptly,since everyone in the film seems to be trying to avoid a plague,that is exactly what you should avoid it like.*",,Anonymous,Horror
A most enjoyable sequel...,"Now for a sequel, I must say that this 2004 movie ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" had it where it counted. And it was a fast-paced and exciting continuation of the 2002 ""Resident Evil"" movie.Oddly enough I wasn't overly keen on the third movie in the game series that introduced Nemesis, but I do like him here in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". I suppose it is because he is given more character and backstory here in the movie as to what was the case in the game. And ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a great combination of interesting storyline, character development and action.The storyline in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a bit more grand than in the predecessor, and there is a very nice feel of having the atmosphere from the Resident Evil 2 and 3 games present in the movie. That was something I really liked. There are lots of small details and Easter eggs to be experienced here, if you are an avid fan of the game franchise.Now, they definitely upped their CGI game in this sequel, and the lickers were much more interesting in this movie, as in comparison to the previous much. So having proper CGI really counts for something, especially for a zombie horror action movie like this.There was a good amount of zombie action in the movie as well, which is something I really enjoy. So thumbs up on that account.Again, the movie benefitted from having a really great cast ensemble. Much can be said for Milla Jovovich, but she really is nicely cast for the role of Alice. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" also have some very nice other casted performers, such as Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Jared Harris, Mike Epps and Zack Ward.If you enjoyed the 2002 ""Resident Evil"" movie, then you will most definitely also enjoy the 2004 sequel ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"".My rating of this sequel is a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.

Not bad at all.,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a mixed blessing. It is better in some ways to the first, but worse in others. Some of the dialogue was bad, so was the bad guys 'German' accent, it was so bad, but he did seem like a bad guy, unlike some films. Milla Jovovich is back thanks god with a whole new cast, and they deliver. The Nemesis is the reason I watched this film, he is so much like his game counterpart, except he doesn't use the hand-tentacle thing. Some parts are bad, like the Lickor's skin, but I'm glad they are back. The graveyard part was just stupid. It has humour in it, JD seems to be in there just to be funny. The zombies have multiplied, and Alice, Jill and the crew are always trying to avoid them, but thanks to the addition of Angie, the film seems to make the T-Virus a thing to fear, its a great film, watch it for a good night of moderate horror, in fact, watch Resident Evil 1 and 2, make your judgement, and let everyone know it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could this movie have been better I wonder?,"An average 5.7? Could this movie have been better I wonder? Well it is though. The challenge is that the movie is both a sequel and an adaptation of a video game. The latter actually goes with a note: I suspect RE to be an sort of adaptation of night/dawn/day of the living dead. This being said I laid bare one of main weak points: human flesh eating zombies. They are so run-of-the-mill you need a good twist to make the audience raise an eye lid. However, the movie hardly makes an effort to do so.But how do those other guys do it? Romero uses gross shock effects with twisted humor in his (living) dead movies. Neither of these are abundance in this movie. Carpenter uses desperation and a feeling of weakness and insecurity(the thing). These are only vaguely used. Some stories rest on the sadness in losing people(Stephen king: Salem's lot). Well on rare occasion we see people being interested in the fate of others. (Who is that guy over there being eaten alive? Oh him, just one of my fellow troopers.) Some use a joyful almost childish humor (lost boys, fearless vampire killers). But this is not to be seen here. Some use the clean inhuman chilliness of advance science (Ash(the robot) and Mother(ship's computer) in Alien, HAL2000(ships computer again) in Space 2001). We are missing that here too. It looks to me that almost that the writer(s) and director shy away of going one step further. To make the movie stand out, to make it a little bit more interesting. The result is a fast paced action movie with though people and lot's of explosions and guns, zombies, some other monsters and evil scientists. And it's not strange to do so: this way you aim at the most people and it's the safest bet on a wide sale.Could the movie have been better? I imagine it could have been, with more sick humor, and more chilliness and more feeling. A slight change of the script. It might have resulted in a 7 and from the IMDb audience that is quite lot.Owen",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"No plot, no acting, no suspense, but a lot of eye candy","The title says it all really.The acting was amongst the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few crappy movies in my time.Not even a shimmer of acting by any of the actors. I simply have to assume the audition went something like this. For the male actors: ""Can you walk? Can you wear clothes? What? Never acted before? Doesn't matter, you're hired"". For the women: ""Can you walk? Do you mind wearing scant clothes? Never acted before? No problem, we'll give you some drivel to spit out since acting isn't a pre-req for this 'kind' of movie"".I did like the eye candy, I admit, both the props and the sexy women. However, when they have less than zero (negative) acting capacity, one just wants to demand the money back, or for the theater / producer to pay me for wasting two hours on cinematic suffering.The Plot then.. Well, it was thin as ice. It took me until the middle of the movie before I though I might possibly have perceived what the story was about: Getting out of a doomed city. Short version of the film: Blam Blam Blam, one liners ala: ""Me get wood"", ""Bit me"" and for some odd reason a lost Harry Potter side kick ""Oye, a thought upon me stuck, where be thee Elves""!?Don't get me started on the awful camera and editing of the fight scenes. The zeleot who edited this clip EDITED AWAY with all the fights. The only thing one sees is someone having a huge problem holding a camera still!! This really bugs me, since if they at least had had an average camera guy, the fight scenes might have turned this movie from god awful to below average (the props and special effects were nice, so at least I could've gotten an OK fighting movie out of it).As it unfortunately stands, I'd have to rate it a 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"It hurts, and always will...","I've always loved the Resident Evil games, and consider myself a true RE-fan. After watching the first one, which became a complete disaster, I didn't know what to expect of this next installment, so I kept my expectations low - and yet, I was utterly disappointed. This film was laughable, dumb, badly written, horribly acted, and the effects were lame. The whole film reminded me of an unpleasant visit at my dentist, after him having a few drinks; I suppose you get the picture. But all in all - just to keep myself short - this film traumatized me, and almost ruined my view upon Resident Evil; luckily, with the games at hand, I found salvation. Well, to say it as it is - this film (and the first one as well), made me hurt, mentally and physically, so I'd recommend people with brains to stay away from it. I learned my lesson; if you play with fire, you get burned.So, the next time I'll expose myself to true torment, I think I'll just stab myself in the eyeball - It will be less painful than ever watching this complete piece of trash, which name is - dare I say it - Resident Evil Apocalypse.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sienna Guillory is painful to look at, please someone feed this chick!!On the other hand, Oded Fehr isn't bad.Being Canadian myself, I believe I have the right to criticize the typically Canadian-made cheap-*** look of this movie. The rule is simple: you can blow up stuff, you can shoot at stuff but never, never break anything expensive. During the movie, I could hear bean-counters in the background, worrying the movie was gonna break its low budget. The helicopter crash scene is a complete joke - you can hear the producer say ""well, show the chopper in the air, then show it crashed, the audience will... imagine the crash"".The choice of location is an insult to intelligence for the Canadian audience... we can see about 10 Canadian companies logos in the backgrounds. Please.... ""Raccoon City, Ontario""??The plot holes in the story are wide enough to float an aircraft carrier sideways through them. The guy who wrote this movie should go back to writing stories for ""Clifford the big red dog"" or become script editor for the Teletubbies.One last mean comment: how can a director screw-up the acting of zombies??? The zombies in that movie are the worst i've ever seen. In Raccoon City, ""dead"" equals ""moronic looking"". The extras on this movie should look for other jobs, like... playing heads of lettuce in grocery commercials.Please, stay home and hit yourself on the head with a telephone book!!

My name is Alice and I remember everything.,"I am going out on a limb here and rating the sequel better than the original. I do that because it had way more zombie action and a lot less sci-fi. Sorry, gamers, but I want a movie, not a game.Alexander Witt had scads of experience as a second unit director and cameraman, and did a decent job in his directorial debut. Unfortunately, he was up against some real zombie action, now (Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead), so the film fell short for some. Their loss! Milla Jovovich was back and juiced up with the virus and evolved into a kick-ass beauty that would give Jet Li a run for his money. She is accompanied by Sienna Guillory from Love Actually, Helen of Troy, and the Principle of Lust, and that gives us a duo of beautiful action babes.Say what you will, but Nemesis was as bad as I've seen since Robocop, and damn ugly to boot. I haven't seen such rabid dogs since Rottweiller; they were awesome! Like I say, this film had a lot more zombie action and a fitting end to the jerk in charge.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Splendid action scenes and Milla, you can't go wrong","Another Resident Evil movie that I feel is under rated. Not as good as the third movie - Extinction, but worth watching for some crack action sequences as well as good creature and special effects. Milla Jovovich again is great in her role, and as usual a very pretty presence on the screen in her cute outfits. This movie has a lot of eye candy and is plain fun to watch. People who like science fiction, action, or horror movies would all find something to like here. I especially liked the Nemesis creature, and all the tricks it had. It was like a super ""boss"" from a video game. This had some nice production values in the various sets, and it was convincing in making a futuristic setting appear plausible.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The least you need to know,"Character Development: Not much, but typical for an action movie.Character Appeal: Milla Jovovich plays a kind of female Arnold Schwarzenegger, a grown-up Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She's no great actress, but she's convincing as a zombie-killer. She also has a natural, unaltered-by-plastic-surgery, beauty that makes her very appealing to the male target audience of this movie.Cinematography and Editing: OK overall. However, as in some other recent movies of this genre, you can't really see much when the zombies are being hit by punches, kicks or bullets due to a combination of quick cuts and rapid camera movement. This may bother some people, but I didn't mind it too much.Gore: Surprisingly little for a zombie movie, mainly due to the camera movement and editing mentioned above.Holes in the Plot: Typical for an action movie. The biggest one I noticed--zombies only appear when they are necessary to the plot. At times the city seems completely deserted, not a zombie in sight. At other times, on cue, masses of them appear out of nowhere.My Take: I liked The Apocalypse better than the first movie because it takes place in Raccoon City rather than in the subterranean Hive, which I found to be too monotonous and confining. This movie delivers what it promises--non-stop action from beginning to end. It's not going to win any Academy Awards, but it's good escapist entertainment. (6 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Only suitable for the braindead.,"First off, if you're reading my comments you need to know: I loved the first Resident Evil film, and know all about the videogames (although I'm rubbish at them, and couldn't care less if the movies 'stick to the plot').Right then, here we go - Resident Evil 2 is the victim of more bad directing decisions (and lack of talent) than Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.In fact, Jar Jar Binks had better lines than Milla did in this one - and a deeper character.I don't want to criticise the cast & crew too much, because RE2 fills all the boxes on looking good - but the (first time feature-length) director Alexander Witt deserves all the stinging criticism you can throw, with lesser vitriol directed towards the people in charge of Sound, Editing and (apologies to Paul Thomas Anderson), the utterly abysmal script. The plot is no better or worse than the first one; it's the execution that stinks to high Heaven.I'm used to seeing films screened for a media crowd - people who would sell their Grandmother and throw in their own sister to 'hit target', who know (and care) absolutely nothing about films, and see no shame in asking a row of people to 'shove along' 5 minutes into the movie because they've been sitting in the bar and couldn't be bothered to come and take a seat. They are scum. And even they laughed along with me throughout this pile of unmitigated nonsense calling itself a sequel.I don't want to ruin the film for you (the Director has done a fine job of that himself) and I'm not going to tell you to avoid this at all costs, because I ignored the same advice myself.So, in the style of the film, here's a few random thoughts: Milla and Sienna are both gorgeous, but it's hard to keep a straight face when you see what they're dressed in, or how 'hard' they think they are, or the absurd stunts, moves and decisions they make all the way through the film. (special mention for Sienna, who would surely want to leave her performance - if you can call it that - off any future CV). Oded Fehr carries a lot of weight in this film; problem is it's on his face. Old chubby-cheeks makes the most ludicrous entrance, and you can't help thinking that somewhere in Raccoon City there's a kebab shop with nobody behind the till. The top Umbrella scientist had me howling with laughter, like a bad Stephen Hawking joke, and the evil Umbrella leader-guy suffers from a comedy-Euro accent. The zombies are just poor; badly lit and directed, as if they only had make-up for a dozen, and new extras drafted in on a daily basis. Unusually, the comedy relief character is actually amusing from time-to-time. The monsters are rubbish - three lickers left over from RE1 (in the most outrageously terrible, over-the-top 'fight in a church' I've ever seen), a handful of demon Dobermanns (also left over from #1) only now even less intelligent, and the big reason for the sequel - Nemesis, who appears in a sequence which was surely left on the cutting-room floor from Terminator 2 (and for good reason). I've been more scared by things that have come out my nostrils, and if you're going to have 'super talents' including super-jumps TRY not to make it look like the actor is on a trampoline. There was a lot of talk about Milla's 'running down a building' bit. Well, Pierce Brosnan has done it way better in Bond, and in fact it's not a patch on that jeans advert where the boy & girl crash through walls and then run out into the sky. And - skipping to the end - Alice vs Nemesis is poor, followed by a blatant (and totally over-extended) setup for a third sequel (think what they did to Ripley for Alien3). At least we got to see Milla naked again, which seems to be the obligatory book-end of these Resi films - something I am in favour of. Perhaps the worst thing of all is that (a) there is virtually no gore or horror (who the hell do they think the audience for this film is??) and (b) the MTV editing and idiot-level direction kill any flow or interest in any & every fighting scene. Did I mention that even pets would be able to follow this film, given the constant and embarrassing exposition - either through 'futuristic graphics', or trite dialogue.My God this film is bad.

"I was impressed, sort of.","Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) was a lot better than I expected. I was disappointed by the first film. It was kind of cool because it's been awhile since I seen a zombie movie on the big screen but the end results were mediocre at best. The sequel was far more entertaining and more like a video game movie. The only thing that would keep this movie from getting a higher rating is the fact that there is very little blood or gore. Besides a couple of scenes there really isn't much. The actionset pieces were pretty good whilst the pacing is just right for a movie of this type.Taking place right after the events that have transpired in the first film, Racoon City has been overruned with zombies! The Umbrella corporation (doing what all big companies would do) remove all key important members of their company from the city and seal off the exits in hope of trying to contain their little accident.The city is sealed off from the rest of the world. It's residents are cut off and are basically left to fend for themselves whilstthe virus runs it's course. But a few people inside don't want to become a zombie's midnight snack. So it's up to Claire and Alice plus a few other survivors to try and survive. But a wrench is thrown into their plans. Umbrella wants to try out their latest and most expensive project to date.

A bit disappointing,"I was disappointed with this film. The action scenes were ludicrously fast, you could not see what was going on! You never got a good look at the zombies or the monsters really, as a horror fan I want to see the blood and the bites and the killing! It was never really explained what happened to Milla, and personally I felt they got a few ideas from Alien Resurrection (the whole using mutations to whoop ass deal). The ending was confusing and made me feel like I was watching someone playing the game rather than a film version of it - I kept waiting for her to advance to the next level. The first film was much better, a good blend of horror and sci-fi action, good actors and you could actually make out what was going on! And by the way is it just me or was anyone else annoyed that the female STARS member was decked out in a mini skirt, boob tube and army boots throughout the film like that was completely normal mercenary uniform?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ridiculous and stupid, while trying to be serious","This is a really silly zombie flick that tries to be serious for the most part. Much more silly than the first movie in this series and there is way more plot holes, with more corny kung fu fighting. Yeah there is more action in this one compared to the previous one, but doesn't have hardly any of the survival horror elements like the first one and the plot is just stupid. Yeah it has Jill Valentine walking through dark corridors and checking rooms, but that is about it. The only positive thing I can say about this sequel is how it's dumb to the point it is sometimes more entertaining for few parts compared to the first one. And showing two girls with guns in the first one was hot, but it's a bit more hot in this one because of Sienna Guillory who plays Jill Valentine who is one of the characters from the actual video games. And how it has a little bit of the similar aspects to Resident Evil 3 Nemesis. The plot is very simple, a group of people are trying to escape Raccoon City after a infection spread that turn the civilians into zombies, and zombies aren't the only thing they have to watch out for a giant monster nemesis and a nuke that is planned to blow up the whole city is on there way. As silly as it is, Alice this time around has special abilities from getting injected by the T-Virus instead of turning into a zombie herself. The side characters are way much more annoying this time around, you know those morons that doesn't stick with the group and goes ""I can't take it anymore"" and tries to leave where it's safe and gets the whole group into trouble. The plot this time around also almost has nothing to do with the game, same can be said about the future installments of this movie series. The first movie also had a lot of silly techno and rock action, but this one overdose that as well. Sure the creators try to add a lot of cool action sequences into this, but almost nothing about it makes sense at all.5.2/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Action Flick,"This movie has everything a well done action movie should have: an intriguing story line, amazing special effects, and scantily clad beautiful women with large weapons!! Great fun for everyone, except the zombies.The director does a wonderful job of making the movie look exactly like the video game it is based on. I particularly enjoyed use of a large corporation trying to control the world as the villain.Don't get me wrong: this movie will never win an Oscar.

Could have been better...,"I am a fan of the games since I played the first of them a few years ago and I was somewhat disappointed by the first movie, but this one is far better, though they could have made more of it! It was great considering the game it is based on is far the worst of the series (IMHO the first one was the best followed closed by the second one), but it's getting more and more exaggerated towards the end (even by RE standarts) and the ending itself is horrible.As I said before, it's FAR better than the first (which hadn't much to do with the games and this one at least is based upon one of them) and maybe, if they are continuing at this rate, the next one, or the one after, could be great, but this one as well as the first one is only for hardcore RE-fans like me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Lots of action, no story and extremely bad sound mixing","The movie starts kind of interesting, where somehow zombies break out in a city and the umbrella corporation decides to close the city, leaving everyone as a victim for the zombies. Then it's just one big sequence of killing, killing and killing. Then there's a new character, the Nemesis, who is killing all umbrella security men with a huge machine gun and a rocket launcher. Apart from these facts, there is no storyline. What really irritated me are the sound effects. They are about 10 times louder than anything else in the movie, making me grab the remote all the time to put the volume lower when there were explosions and then higher again so I was able actually to hear any voices. The person who mixed the sound effect must've been an amateur, a pro would've used a compressor/limiter to make the volume of the sound effects equal to the rest of the volume in the movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very entertaining sequel for an unwanted film,"Trapped in Raccoon City, Alice joins a group of survivors to fight their way out of the zombie-infested city to find a young girl at the heart of stopping the plague before the entire city is destroyed.This is an immensely fun and exciting effort. One of the better parts to this is the incredibly frenetic action that utterly overwhelms here based on all sorts of different measures. Paced more like an Action than film than a Horror film, this one has a nearly continuous series of attacks, shootouts, firefights, brawls and chases that all combined together that makes this an unrelenting and non-stop Action film, getting going right from the start and never letting up. From the madness of the barricade to leave the city, the troops' firefight with the creatures along the burning city streets and the church hideout, it really contains a lot of action and shootouts quite early and runs through them into the ecstatic final half. These contain even more impressive action scenes as the first encounter with the hulking humanoid monstrosity wielding rocket launchers, mini-guns and more in a frantic, exciting shootout, a daring battle with mutant dogs in the school and the impressive shootout to allow them to take out the heli-pad which turns into a blazing action scene full of brawling, hand-to-hand combat and a further shoot-out among the security center with a second helicopter gets a lot of exciting moments packed into this. With all this action it really does put a lot more positives in here as this makes for continuous special effects showcasing the ravenous zombies and deformed mutants throughout here, and that also puts in a healthy amount of blood and gore to be had. About the only part here that's not really all that interesting is the finale which tries to go far too overt for its own good rather than just letting the good it's established stay in the forefront. Instead, this one seems as if all the different conspiracies and actions against the main city here are simply to keep the storyline going for future films rather than serving any special point for this one. That's still not enough from making this one a wholly enjoyable and entertaining watch.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Brief Nudity and children-in-jeopardy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Great Thriller,But Confusing!",Don't get me wrong Resident Evil:Apocalpse was good but the original was easier to understand.This one had more action and better characters but it was so confusing. I mean one minute you think everybody is dead and seconds later they're fine as can be. The thing about the scientist and his daughter was just too much of an interference with the plot and storyline. Just when you think it's going to end it does not.On parts the film just drags!It really should have stopped during the plane-crash but they drug it on so they can make another sick and twisted sequel.Mabey they will just make it a trilogy.It's not a must see but it is worth your time.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Once again, the ""mainstream"" critics are wrong.","Here's a warning to all movie snobs - STAY AWAY! Everybody else go have a good time. I really enjoyed the movie, but let me fill you in on where I'm coming from:1) I like the Resident Evil video games.2) I love watching Milla kick decayed zombie butt.3) I love the addition of another hot babe who knows how to kick decayed zombie butt.If you identify with the above, then this is the movie for you. Also, keep in mind that a person's level of enjoyment for a movie like this goes down as his age goes up. Let me put this in fundamental terms: this is all about Milla in tight outfits, shooting guns, back flipping off motorcycles, breaking zombie necks, and just looking mighty fine doing it all. Folks, that's all I really need sometimes. Oh, and Sienna Guillory doesn't exactly open the eyes of the Oscar voters, but she sure makes a sexy Jill Valentine!Atmosphere plays a big part as well. Things are often loud, dark, and chaotic. So you can expect a booming soundtrack, a handful of jump scenes, and a whole lot of gory deaths. My main complaint is that sometimes things are a little too chaotic, especially in some fight scenes. The camera is too close to fully absorb everything that's happening. Come on cameramen, pull back a little.One thing many zombie movies lack is a main antagonist. Characters usually have to deal with a bunch of generic zombies chasing after them, but that's not the case here. Nemesis is one scary monstrosity. I've played the video game, and he's something you don't want on your tail. The addition of the Lickers (creatures from the game) is also a nice touch. The CGI is well done.If you're in the mood for an all-out, non-stop thrill ride that is intent on preventing you from catching your breath, and you don't insist on the deepest story in the world, then there's really no reason not to see Resident Evil: Apocalypse. And ladies, I know I've gone on about the lovely Milla, but if you have the slightest interest in zombie movies or you just like fast-paced action with a serving of gore, then there's plenty for you to enjoy as well.In terms of pure entertainment value this falls between 3.5 and 4 marks. I'm gonna shake up my rating system and give it a 3.75!!! It's Friday; you never know what kind of wild antics I might get up to.THE GISTPlease don't go into this movie expecting anything resembling realism. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a movie based on a video game, and in my opinion, it's exactly what a video game inspired movie should be. It's gory, it's violent, it's got lots of heavy artillery, it's got a super cool villain, it's got well-toned heroines puttin' on a show ... in other words, this is the movie most adrenaline-fueled guys have been waiting for all year.",,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining at best,"I get private messages all the time from people saying that I am way too lenient with my reviews. All that I really care about is that I'm entertained, especially if it's a movie that I really want to watch. I had gotten so sick and tired of everyone telling me about ""Resident Evil"" that I decided to check it out. It was like a war. Half of them loved it and half of them hated it. I was at a friend's house when I watched it. Sometime later on, I came over and he asked me if I wanted to watch this one. I didn't really care, figuring it was going to suck.""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" picks up where the original left off. You know something is wrong. Something weird is happening to a woman. She escapes from some weird medical facility and into the streets to find them deserted. There are still people around, but they are either hiding, or mindless zombies. The corporation from the original has unleashed their latest weapon, Nemesis. It is an odd looking creature that has connections with Alice, our hero.This one was good. It was full of action and I do enjoy action. It captured my attention long enough for me to watch. It was okay. If there was a third, I wouldn't pay to see it. I'd just wait till my friend gets it.

Whoa...Resident Evil Apocalypse DIDN'T suck.,"OK, I had VERY low expectations going into this movie. And in so doing, I usually end up hating the movie. Even AvP, the second time I saw it I knew it would be crap this time around, and I ended up hating it still even when I lowered the bar for it...well..I loved and hated it. That's a different story.OK, Resident Evil, the first movie...my gripes: The zombies had metal teeth it seemed Glossed over the entire game for the most part Had cheap heavy metal music in the action scenes Too many action scenes as opposed to horror/suspense Cliché ""we're not leaving you behind"" dialogueI'm sure I could think of others.Anyways, Resident Evil : Apocalypse comes along. Different director, same writer (who did such classic crap as the first Resident Evil, as well as AvP and that Kurt Russel flick Soldier). So I initially think...great, how much will this one suck.Then I see the preview. It had seemed as though my thoughts were backed up. We have a very sexy Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory)...perhaps the sexiest female lead in the movies this year..at least in that character. Then we have Nemesis. Also see a lone Jill walking down a deserted hall. I'm thinking OK, they may have some horror elements this time around. Then comes Nemesis with a machine gun, elite commandos, and helicopters. All hope was lost.Then...I stepped into the theater.For once, the trailer did not do the film any justice...at all!(Granted Nemesis still toted a machine gun around but, it didn't matter when you saw him. Why? Don't question me..it just didn't!)The unexpected happened: THEY FOUND A BALANCE BETWEEN ACTION AND SUSPENSE IN THE RE MOVIES!Yes there was elite commandos kicking zombie ass, and all the S.T.A.R.S members knew some pretty nice hand to hand combat, but the action wasn't bad! It didn't have cheesy heavy metal guitar riffs, or one man armies, aside from Milla Jovovich's Alice character, but hey, she has a reason.This movie was good! It wasn't very scary but, it wasn't very tame either. It had it's downfalls, such as two extremely cheesy parts, one is the entrance of Alice once she has clothes on(well...more than that paper thin hospital gown looking like it was made of..well..paper), the other a line spoken by an Umbrella soldier, ""We're expendable and we've just been expended"". Is Expended even a word?The make up effects on Nemesis were the best I've seen since Lord Of The Rings, mind you they don't rival it, but that would take a lot.It did fall prey to having the generic token black guy in there, which the audience seemed to just eat right up(no pun intended). He was tolerable though. In fact, although I couldn't help but think he was added for comic relief his character did make me kind of smirk the odd time.The movie went by at a nice pace too, not too fast, not too slow. The zombies still attacked in packs but, in Resident Evil 2 and 3 it seemed to be the norm, so it was better. This time as well, there were no metallic looking teeth.Also, they did a great job tying the two films together, picking up before Resident Evil ended and after the events in the first one. Very reminiscent of Resident Evil 3 taking place during and after Resident Evil 2. Deliberate? Perhaps. Nice homage? Definitely.The ending left room for a sequel and I must say, if they improved on it this much from the first one, I am rather looking forward to seeing what they do to the third one permitting they make it.Until then, I suppose I'll just have to keep hunting down S.T.A.R.S members and eating my braaaiiinss....",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than The First. A Campy Trashy Fun Action Movie,"Let me start this review off by saying that I hated the first Resident Evil movie. It was a boring and poorly done film and i've never understood how anyone could think that it is possibly a good movie. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is considered by many fans to be the worst in the series. However, I personally think it's better than the first film. However, it is NOT a good movie by any means. It's actually a really bad movie. But, it's bad in the sense that it's so campy and trashy that it's actually fun.Like the first film, this one doesn't have much of a plot to it. It's just Alice and a group of survivors trying to escape Raccoon City while fighting a bunch of zombies. Now as I mentioned before, the quality of the film itself is pretty terrible. The acting is awful, the dialouge is atrocious, and we still don't feel attached to anything or anyone in the film. However, the film pretty much plays out as a non-stop action movie which is what keeps it from being a bore. There's plenty of zombie action and everything from shoot-em-up gun-play to martial arts. Some of it is actually pretty damn cool to watch, and some of it is so over-the-top and silly that you'll be laughing your ass off. Despite how bad it is, it makes for a fun watch.Considering how bad the first film was, I find it hard to understand why so many of the fans of this franchise hate this movie. It had much more of a video game feel to it and was more of what I imagined a Resident Evil movie being like. Is it anything like the games? No. But, it is a fun trashy action movie that while isn't a good movie, is still fun and very much in vein of a video game movie. I would never recommend this to someone who is looking for decent movie to watch. However, I could totally recommend this to those looking for a zombie action movie (although there are much much better zombie action movies out there) and people who love cheesy bad movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A disgrace to the Resident Evil movie fans,"This is the worst Resident Evil movie I have ever seen. The music was the worst part. The way this movie was directed was weird and cheesy. The music did not fit the situations and topics, all the other soundtracks for the other RE movies were pretty good, but this was such a weird concept of music, that it just became stupid. The special effects were unusual also, I mean... i know it is an old movie but c'mon! At least make the nemesis in this movie not look like just a pile hard caramel!

The camera angles, the small details, all straight from the games, a very nice blend between RE2 and RE3, of course there are a couple scenes that are corny, and a few confusing plot parts, of the few.

Excellent,"As you know in the 1st movie the T-Virus is unleashed and blah blah. This movie shows us Raccoon. ^_^ The bigger problem here is that all the teenagers like me who spent their whole childhood playing Resident Evil think the 1st movie was.... different than we expected. Disappointing. (Who the heck is Alice?) However I liked this 2nd movie a lot... it's even my favorite movie! It has loads more elements of the game, like Jill and Carlos, Ashford (that should be called Birkin)... Talking about Ashford... He was the one who made me like the movie. I think he's one of the best characters there since he's the ""vehicle"". Let's face it... without Ashford they would all be dead. Keep this in mind when you go see the movie. So the problem here is that the ""hive"" is reopened and the virus unleashes to the city. Umbrella immediately tried to rescue their scientists, only, their high priority extraction (Ashford, wheelchair high IQ scientist)) refuses to leave 'cause his daughter is still at school. They go get his daughter but she has a car crash. So she is trapped in the city. And then come all the other characters. Ashford who is already outside the city, uses his wheelchair laptop to help them (of course he makes a deal with them that he only helps them if they rescue his daughter.

A Second 'Evil',"Two years after the original came out, they made a sequel called ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse."" Even though it was much better than I expected (with a plot that was a LOT more coherent and less dumb), its action was a lot more unbelievable than the action in the original.In this one, the T-virus has escaped from 'The Hive' and is now running rampant on the streets of Raccoon City, turning people (and, once again, some dogs) into vicious, flesh-eating zombies. Milla Jovovich returns as security operative Alice who, with a group of survivors, agrees to find the daughter of Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) who is trapped within the city limits.The movie was a lot of fun, just like the first. Paul W.S. Anderson's script was well-written (although the ending was a little unsatisfying). Instead of Paul W.S. Anderson, Alexander Witt stepped into the director's chair for this one (he appears as a sniper who works for the Umbrella Corporation towards the end).Overall, as good a sequel as the filmmakers could have made (just don't look for any logic).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where the series immediately took a downturn.,"Apocalypse used to be the only movie from the Paul WS Anderson franchise I liked because it had a lot of elements from the game but I think rewatching it now, it is actually it's downfall. Now here me out, I've been a hardcore fan of the games since I was a kid and I was super stoked to see the characters finally be put in the movies but wow not like this. For starters, there are way too many events that happen in raccoon city to cover in a single movie let alone with the addition of Alice's story now. This leads to the movie just being really all over the place, half the movie there isn't even a motive for any of the characters other than survive. Alice and Jill feel like they fight for screen time more than they fight against zombies. Leon and Claire just straight up aren't here at all either. Instead there's this racial stereotype comic relief gangster that just only exists to make really out of place jokes and some new guy in a wheel chair that's really important to umbrella who lost his daughter in the city but it's never even revealed why this guy is so important or anything he's just a plot device to give Alice a reason to do cool things to do I guess. The thing that made the first movie great was that it was its own thing you didn't have to worry about writing about all the other characters and it seems like they just bit off more than they could chew by cramming the raccoon city incident into one single movie. The action scenes were also terribly corny and this is very clearly the movie where Paul WS Anderson decided to use the resident evil license to make his crush/ wife an action star from here on out. If you don't think this is true watch the three musketeers, he did the same exact thing. Gave his wife all these dumb action sequences that are just so out of place and corny and they just immediately take you out of the movie. I love action it's my favorite genre but a lot of it in these movies is just extremely hard to look at and poorly shot and just plain boring. The soundtrack is cool and there's a few cool action scenes but overall very weak film. I don't have too many positives about it. Watch the first movie, watch the CGI movies but Paul's movies just get worse from here on out.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Weak sequel with shaky, incomprehensible action scenes","This film manages to be worse than it's mediocre predecessor. Although the plot is good, the film's execution is terrible. In an effort to mimic a video game, the action scenes are blurred and incoherent with split second edits rendering everything incomprehensible. In fact, I ended up with a headache. The Special Effects remain decent however, and (MINOR SPOILERS) a secret weapon called Nemesis is an impressive creation. There are a few scant suspenseful scenes and Jovovich barely manages to leave an impression. This film can be seen only with a finger ready on the fast forward button.Overall 3/10",,Anonymous,Horror
"satisfying, albeit unnecessarily complicated, both action and plot holes abound; an omen of outlandish twists","Read my review for the first Resident Evil to get a gist where I stand on it, before this one, but only if you're a major fan of the games. As a fan of zombie action movies, it should satiate, just don't expect much in the ways of horror. Some bad acting and plot holes are almost as frequent as the action itself, but the pacing at least never lets up. And fans of the game should, at the absolute least, be appreciative of more Licker action, Nemesis (a boss from RE2), and Jill Valentine. Meanwhile, the increasingly bizarre story arc of Milla Jovovich continues, as she delivers a sort of Sarah Connor badass whose abilities border on the absurd, and by the end you'll likely laugh while the word ""how"" breaks the sound barrier. She delivers the role on a silver platter, though, so if anything I'd fault the writer (aka her husband) for the often-laughably-bad script. In the end it's a gritty, dark action with slivers of horror elements and little that bogs it down, except for the writing and outrageous (albeit ""fun,"" in a silly manner) ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's a fun watch if you just want mindless action,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) takes the franchise in a more action-heavy direction, but in doing so, it loses some of what made the first movie work. The story is straightforward and somewhat interesting, but it lacks any real depth, feeling more like an excuse to string together set pieces rather than a well-developed plot. The horror elements are almost an afterthought, making the zombies feel out of place in what plays more like an over-the-top action movie.The directing choices are questionable, with excessive shaky cam and overblown shots that make certain action scenes harder to follow. Slow motion is a nice touch, but it's used so frequently that it feels more like a gimmick than a stylistic choice. That said, the cinematography does have its moments, particularly in a few key sequences. The introduction of Nemesis is handled well, even if his overall presence in the movie could have been stronger. Milla Jovovich remains the highlight, delivering her signature mix of badassery and effortless style while taking on enemies with superhuman agility.The script is basic, filled with cheesy dialogue that doesn't add much weight to the story. The soundtrack keeps the aggressive, industrial vibe from the first film, but the overall execution of the movie feels uneven. While it has entertaining moments, it doesn't match the balance of action, horror, and sci-fi that made the original so engaging. It's a fun watch if you just want mindless action, but as a follow-up to Resident Evil, it's definitely a step down.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Cheap fanboy/fangirl fodder,"In contrast to the previous film, this second installment of the series inspired by the survival horror video game series, Resident Evil, feels intended for a built-in audience of the franchise's existing fans. Characters from the games not present in the previous film appear with little introduction, exposition is delivered through a series of choppily edited recaps and distracting subtitles identifying people and locations, and many elements of the production feel like cheap cop-outs, including its laughable swooshy sound effects, its combination-horror-strings-and-indusrial-synth score, and its nonsensical ending.

Either there was budget cut or Alexander Witt wasn't capable of delivering the cashing-in follow-on.Mike Epps is funny, but unnecessary comic relief and Iain Glen as the 'evil scientist' Dr. Isaacs gives a good performance. There is amazing stunt work, Milla again plays heroine Alice superbly and Oded Fehr is on top-form, however, there are lots of problems The film is let down by its TV feel, the zombies are ruined by blurry manipulated camera work. Sienna Guillory is handed a dreadful script and costume. The effects and music are a mixed bag, sometimes great and at other times sadly distracting.It's a sci-fi with plenty of action, but Apocalypse lacks the suspense, atmosphere and finesse of the first instalment.",,Anonymous,Horror
As A Fan I Have To Say  It Is Pretty OK (But Not As Good As Before),"I'm the fan of the first movie and the game but this movie is nothing compare to both. It was sort of the disappointment cause it look so good in the trailer. This movie has lost its believable story and style that the first movie was built on.It is not all that bad, if you look in the action movie wise and not comparing it to the first. The movie picking up where the end of the first movie left off. They have done a good job with the Nemesis makeup and costume, really look like in the game. And Milla did look hotter than the first movie.The casting and acting of this movie is very average (though, much worst than first movie). This time there is hardly any dialogue. They concentrate too much on how the character in the movie should be like the game rather than trying to develop more realistic storyline.Anyway I have to warn that if you're planning to watch  expect more of an action fighting rather than zombie movie. Also expect the cheesy ending (unlike the first) and also tacky battle scene that you normally seen in Mortal Kombat and Kick Boxing movie but uses here between Nemesis and Alice.The most disappointing of all in this movie was - there're hardly any Zombie.Recommendation: Yes, But Don't Expect It To Be As Good As The First.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It - Thanks",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Resident Evil: Apocalypse""","I'll be fair in stating that ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is the perfect film to close out the turbulent summer of 2004. So far we've had ""The Passion of the Christ,"" ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" - all of which have had a significant impact at the box office this summer.""Apocalypse"" will be easy fodder for the critics, as they will balk early and be on alert for the slightest flaw. They'll pick apart the MTV-style editing, bad pacing, and seeming lack of an actual plot. Fanatics will pick apart the film for not staying true to the ""Resident Evil"" video games. For the record, I never played the video games that ""Resident Evil"" is based on, so I can't comment on accuracy.This film was really a birthday present for myself. I used one of two (count 'em - TWO!) free tickets that came with my purchase of the DVD for the first film ""Resident Evil (Deluxe Edition)."" It doesn't disappoint in the action category or special effects, as there is plenty of both.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely horrible,"I didn't care much for the original Resident Evil movie, yet it did manage to work here and there as a trendy horror movie enough that it earned a spot on my DVD shelf. This one, as I feared, is all style, no substance, very much like AVP, Walking Tall, and all of these new generation actioners with slick-looking trailers but no teeth.Basically, it's 90 some minutes of a few people strutting around striking cool poses, always trying to look cool in blurry action sequences that defy physics. That may sound good to action fans, but believe me, the whole movie is a hollow experience. There's no character development, nothing to make any of us care about any one of the cast of characters within it. As in the first movie, the universe apparently revolves around Paul W.S. Anderson's wife, Milla ""ALICE"" Jovovich, who now has mutant abilities.The zombies in this movie, which is why a lot of people like me would come to see a movie like this for, are perhaps the greatest crime in this film. If they could have just gotten the zombies right, I could forgive a lot of the quick-cut garbage. The very few sequences zombies are seen, *you can't even see them!* I have no idea what they were doing, but it seems whenever a zombie(s) is on-screen, the camera begins shaking terribly and the screen gets blurry and in slow-mo, then begins showing you a hard-to-see montage of zombies (again blurry cam employed), so you can literally see nothing but vague outlines of the zombies marching around. And I may not be 100% up on my Resident Evil game lore (I've beaten Zero and 1 for Gamecube), but most zombies I'm aware of in film don't die when you break their neck. But egads, if you're making a zombie movie, just make a zombie movie. It's like the director or cinematographer Also, like Resident Evil before it (and this may be a budgetary issue), it seemed like the people making the movie forgot they were making an R-rated movie. Violence is MTV quick-cut to the point where you can't tell what's going on in any scene with anything other than two people talking to each other, and the gore is minimal. There's a couple of scenes with nudity... admittedly, quite good nudity, but they seem to serve the only reminder to the audience that they're watching an R movie.Watching the movie and dabbling in the Resident Evil games, RE:A seems more video game-like than the damn video game series, which at least were imbued with a healthy dosage of effective Japanese horror ala Parasite Eve, Ringu, etc..One thing... RE:A does make a zombie fan very appreciative that George Romero is finally able to do his 4th zombie movie, Land of the Dead, and that should be out in June.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Expands on the Original with Elements of the Series,"This film I do have to say, I really liked when it first came out. I'm pretty sure I saw this in the theater with my family and then went again with friends. This is another one that I picked up pretty quickly after it came out on DVD and have watched it throughout the years. Again, this is another one that I hadn't seen in some time with a critical eye so I was wondering how it would hold up. The synopsis here is Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in Raccon City hospital after they're has been overrun by zombies and must now make it out of the city before a nuclear bomb is dropped.We start with giving us the back-story of what happened in the previous film from our main character of Alice. This includes the events involving her at the end and waking up again in the hospital where we get a cool shot paying homage to Day of the Dead with the newspaper headline.It then shifts to Raccoon City to show us the events that will lead to what we just saw. Everyone is going about their daily lives and it feels like a normal Midwestern city. We are taken below the ground to the entrance to The Hive. Umbrella employees are opening it and are overtaken by infected. T-virus spreads out of into the city. Umbrella sends in SUVs to collect important scientists that are living there. One of them is Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris). He is concerned about his daughter and he is informed that she is being picked up as well. Her name is Angie (Sophie Vavasseur). She gets picked up, but there's an accident leaving her stranded.We then get to meet Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory). She enters her home and hears over a scanner of what is happening. We get a cool introduction through a board she has detailing she's suspended. She goes to her station and takes out the zombies that are in there. She meets with her partner and tells him to get out before it's too late. She also frees L.J. (Mike Epps), who was in custody. Everything is breaking down around them.Umbrella is forced to close off the city and not allow anyone to escape. Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann) makes this decision which causes Dr. Ashford to try to find someone alive inside of the city to help get Angie out. Alice finds an Army/Navy surplus store, gets dressed and finds weapons. She encounters Jill, Sgt. Peyton Wells (Razaaq Adoti) and some other survivors. They band together and learn of their way out when Dr. Ashford calls them on a payphone. He's able to hack into the Raccoon City mainframe to do this. They then head for the school, but encounter a much more dangerous threat. Alice isn't the only one that Umbrella has been experimenting on.They also encounter a group of Umbrella para-military members. They're led by Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr). With him are Nicholai Ginovaeff (Zack Ward) and Yuri Loginova (Stefan Hayes). They're bitter when they're not evacuated and are all too ready to turn their back on the company that stranded them inside the city limits.That's where I want to leave the recap for this movie. This is another one that now I'm a bit more critical of movies while also being fair, I wasn't sure how this movie would hold up for me. As I started this I said I've seen this quite a few times and after this viewing, I still really like it. It for sure is still my favorite in the series.This of course is taking on the games of Resident Evil 2 and 3, where the infection has gotten out and our survivors are trying to get out of town before Raccoon City is 'contained' and wiped out. I dig that they brought in Jill, Carlos, Dr. Ashford, Nemesis (Matthew G. Taylor) and Nicholai. There is also the unit of S.T.A.R.S. that they include here as well. They all aren't necessarily the characters from the game, but it is at least hitting the nerd part of me there. I do have to comment, I hate that they used the outfit Jill wears in Resident Evil 3, as it is not very practical.What I also like here is that we still get part of that contained feel that we do from the previous film, just in a bigger sandbox to play in. It is this time around I noticed we really aren't getting a lot of the zombies. There's some of that, it is mostly early on before we get to some of the stronger villains. This isn't that dissimilar to the games themselves though. The main problem of the story works for me. Umbrella is constantly making bad decisions that they need to fix. They also seem to be a bit overconfident. I also like the idea that the 'Nemesis Project' is focusing on Alice and Nemesis. They're too sides to the coin there where one is smaller and more agile to the bulker, stronger one. The showdown is inevitable. This does pigeon hole it into the action/horror film that it is.Feel that next should be the acting. Jovovich is really good as our heroine here. I like that she just has this look of Alice and fits so well into the role. When I see her that is one of the things I think of first. Guillory wasn't who I pictured at first as Jill, but I think she does a really good there. Fehr is good as Carlos. I really like Kretschmann as a villain. He is spineless, but that fits and we don't get to see it until the end. Vavasseur is fine, Adoti, Ward and the rest of the cast are as well. I really liked seeing Harris and Epps here for completely different reasons. Taylor fits what was needed for Nemesis with the size. Also the small cameo by Iain Glen which grows into a much bigger role of Dr. Isaacs, I liked the intro to him here. Since he becomes so important to the series, I like that we get him here to start.That will take me to the effects and cinematography. I was surprised how much better the special effects were here. The zombies all look good. The CGI for the lickers looks much better here. The action effects are fine for the most part. I actually have some issues with the cinematography for them. They decide to go with this blurry effect and some of the camera work took me out of what I was seeing. Some of the CGI there doesn't necessarily hold for me as well.So now with that said, this to me is one of the better video game adaptation horror movies out there. I like what they're doing with the concept here and it is the logical next step. Resident Evil 2 is my favorite of the series so combining that with 3 works for me since they take place at the same time. Bringing characters from the game tick my nerd box, even if they're not necessarily the same. Some of the action and effects work, there are just some slight issues there for me. The acting is fine, no one necessarily stands out as great though and the soundtrack also just fits for what was needed. Overall I'd rate this as fun movie and to me, it is an above average movie overall.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has an apocalyptic affect on the series alright.,"To start, I've watched and enjoyed the first RE movie, and while it wasn't among my list of -good- movies, it was worth watching.As well, I've played every single resident evil game made so far...eh, sad, but I love them.And having seen this movie, I have to say, please do NOT make another one....Not only did they butcher the story in both the former games and movie, they(movie creators) actually managed to make me, someone who played the games plenty for one lifetime, embarrassed. I cannot for the life of me think how ANYone could enjoy the extremely over elaborate fight scenes, the bad music, the complete lack of anything resembling a script, and I would go so far to say the lack of character development, except there weren't any characters.The ONLY things similar with this movie and the series are the names. Nothing else...just wanted to clear that up. I've been thoroughly disappointed with this movie, and while I ask that another not be made, if it is I will go see it, if not out of hopes that it might actually be worth 90 minutes of my already misused time, then just to see what else they can manage to destroy about the series I know and love so much.The only thing that kept me from leaving the theater was the fact that I would stand out to the other movie goers and they would know I in fact was there.This is a movie better left on the shelf, and I will be shaking my head in sadness when I enter a video rental store and see the little rented tag on this movie, knowing that someone, somewhere, just spent 4.50 to effectively kill 90 minutes of their life.It gets a 2....While I can't think of how they could have made it worse, I eagerly await the next riveting edition to find out.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Now the apocalypse begins,"This film is a worthy sequel that already begins to expand the saga further and introduces Alice as the new heroine of the story. Very good action scenes, good special effects and the spectacular design of Nemesis, it is a good movie in several ways and even more so when presenting the beginning of the apocalypse. From here the zombie apocalypse begins to break out and the characters of the games appear. There isn't much else to say, except that Resident Evil: Apocalypse is both a good movie and one of the few sequels that lives up to its predecessors. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much Better Than The First ...,"I, for one, hated the first film. I found only the film's last few minutes to be exhilarating. The first film boasted bad CGI effects, poor make-up effects and it's biggest flaw was that it did not utilize the scenarios that played out in the ultra successful video games. That, however, has been corrected in this slam bang sequel. Non-stop action and the films fast-pace nature helps the viewer forget (or ignore) the film's weaknesses. And the film's weakness is mainly the script written by Paul W.S. Anderson. Weak dialog and a flimsy story are certainly things that may completely annoy a less-forgiving viewer. The film's direction by Alexander Witt is fair but flawed. I, for one, hate the use of slow motion and sped up frames that are consistently used in today's movies. However, with a bigger budget that improved the CGI and makeup, made it possible to make RE: Apocalypse an entertaining way of spending an evening. Just don't over-analyze the film and watch it for what it is. A 'leave your brain at the door' horror/action film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really Bad,"I thought that since the film was going to have a huge mutant/cyborg with a rocket launcher it would be pretty hard to make it suck..... but guess what, they managed. The acting was pretty bad, nemesis is hardly in it, the umbrella heavies seem to be wearing motorbike helmets and the ending was bad and screams ""Resident evil 3, come waste even more of your money!"" There was one or two good points but the rest of the film cancels them out.Also what is Hollywood's problem with europeans, why are they always the bad guys? i can only assume that since the cold wars over they've no one else to paint as evil.What really annoys me is that this will make money regardless of how bad it is.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Guilty Pleasure,"The first Resident Evil is one of my guilty pleasures. I really enjoyed the movie, even with it's bad acting and simple story. Being a fan of the original game, I felt that the movie captured the feeling of the video game and basically that was my entire expectation going into the theatre.The video game started in a mansion where you played as a member of S.T.A.R.S. Either you played as Chris or Jill Valentine. The first movie followed the basic concept of a place where the Umbrella Corporation was conducting genetic experiments that went wrong. While the first film added the character Alice, instead of the game's characters, it was decently filmed and I find myself watching it from time to time. Like I had said, one of my guilty pleasures.The second movie (Apocalypse) basically follows a large portion of the second video game. The second video game you can play as either Chris and Jill again and you have to escape Racoon City while a super creature (nemesis) is tracking you down. The second film takes Alice on this adventure, while adding some interesting supporting members to her group. The second film also brings the original character, Jill Valentine, into the fold. There are quite a few new ideas introduced into the movie that were not in the game storyline, but they are interesting. Apocalypse has decent acting (think popcorn adventure movie, not Oscar), a decent script (except for the last 10 minutes), and a few decent well done horror moments. Apocalypse is better than the original (I know some of you may think that would not take much), and I see it falling under another DVD purchase I find myself watching time and time again.The only disappointment was in the last moments of the movie. The big bad corporating scene was just -- well, it has been done too many times and did not need to be done again. The end scene with Alice is a typical sequel setup that also did not need to be done.Milla Jovovich kicks ass, ala Laura Croft, without trying to act. Something Angelina Jolie tries too hard to do and fails at miserably. Milla plays Alice via the way a male action star would play a Rambo or a super cop. Because of the way Milla approaches Alice, it works.Oded Fahr is the best part of the movie. Fans may remember him from the Mummy series as the Templar Knight. Fahr is a scene stealer and a very pleasant addition to the cast.Sienna Guillery is just there as Jill Valentine. The kick ass character, from the games, takes a back seat to Alice and never is fully developed. Whenever Fahr or Milla are in the scenes, Guillery gets lost in the mix. Guillery is still hot to look at though (same as she was in Troy as Helen) and I had to laugh at the tight (very non-police) uniform that she struts around within.Overall, I enjoyed this film. While I really liked it, I am not sure what anyone else would think. I enjoy these kind of horror/action films: Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead, Army of Darkness, 28 Days, and the Omega Man. If you are a fan of those types of films, I believe you would enjoy Apocalypse.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
the right and wrong's,"first of all Resident evil: apocalypse was a ass-kick movie, the thing i can say on this movie is 1st-its way better than the first one. 2nd-i rate it 8.5 the right stuff that Paul Anderson did: almost all the original characters from the game ""resident evil 3:Nemesis"", the location is in a city which gives a view what is Raccoon City, Anderson added some elements from resident evil:2 and resident evil:outbreak games, overall he made a movie for the people to enjoy the wrong stuff that Anderson did:HE CREATED A NEW CHARACTER THAT MAKES ME THINK WHATS WRONG WITH HIM! ITS LIKE HE DID NOT HAVE GUYS TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GAME(game experts or guys from capcom or the creators of Resident evil itself!!!!!), he altered the ending of the movie because its supposed to be ""jill vs. Nemesis"" not ""alice vs. Nemesis"", he also altered the the place for the final fight because it was done in a helipad that it is supposed to be in the ""dead factory""(in the game), there should be no school in the movie, Dr. Ashford should be Dr. Willaim Burkin,and his daughter ""Angie"" should be Sherry or Shirly(i don't know which is correct), he should combined a movie between resident evil: 2 and 3 so the movie will be quite longer. well thats it",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Still popcorn, still cheesy, still fanservice, still entertaining","Now I can't help but say it. Fanservice is all well and good, but in this work, which I wouldn't dare call a horror movie, there is upskirt footage while running away from zombies and there is a man who is horny for stripper zombies. Why, just why. Apart from that, those who made this movie really know how to push the male audience's buttons. After the first movie, while Milla Jovovich was continuing at full speed, they also added Sienna Guillory.The CGs and creature visuals are much better overall. There is a huge improvement in the fight sequences and choreography. Good but in the cheesy category. Like the first movie, this movie is definitely not horror, it's more action adventure with gore and body horror.Even though new films of the series have been released years apart, efforts have been made to build on the previous film, pave the way for the next film, and provide continuity. Apparently they treated it like a TV series episode rather than a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
How can such good video games spawn a movie this trite?,"Like all big fans of the excellent Resident Evil video game series; I was extremely dismayed and disappointed by the first movie. The characters, the style, the location and even the zombies just WERN'T Resident Evil, and as I went in expecting to see something very much like the games on screen, I came out of the movie feeling very cold. In fact, the only thing I did like about the movie was the ending, and that's where the last movie should have started. This movie, however, does start there; so is it finally the translation that us Resident Evil fans have been hoping for? Errr...no. Once again, the movie makers have failed to capture the game's spirit, which has been completely ditched in favour of several irrelevant and very two-dimensional characters, a very suspect script and action sequences that are only in the film to keep the attention of the less intelligent film fans. The plot basically follows a bunch of characters that find themselves in the middle of the outbreak in Racoon City, and obviously they decide to make their way out of the city to safety. Resident Evil 3's main villain, The Nemesis, is thrown in for good measure.To the movie's credit, it isn't all bad. Certain things, like the city for example, look great and are very reminiscent of the game. Sienna Guillory is another positive factor of the movie, as aside from looking great; she does look very much like Jill Valentine as well. However, the good parts end there as from there on out; the movie basically laughs in the face of the fan base it's trying to attract. Dr Ashford and Nicolai Ginovaeff, for a start, were villains in the games; and I know one thing for sure, The Nemesis would never have helped out the good guys in Resident Evil 3. It is a little known fact that the Resident Evil movie was a rip-off of Aliens; and this movie has decided to take much of it's influence from the underrated Alien: Resurrection. We've got the awful Milla Jovovich stepping into the souped up female role that Sigourney Weaver did much better, and then the whole Alice-Nemesis relationship has been ripped straight out of that movie. That relationship, like all character related aspects of the movie, doesn't work because of the complete lack of emotion in the script. This also makes it hard to care about anything that happens in the movie.While Resident Evil Apocalypse is entertaining in a guilty pleasure sort of a way, even this must be stripped from it's very lacking resume of good points. The film tries too hard to entertain and most of the entertaining elements pop up in the form of another explosion or Milla Jovovich jumping over some scenery and it gets boring very quickly. In my opinion, Resident Evil fans are better just sticking to the games. Leave this.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
BEST ZOMBIE MOVIE SINCE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD,"Resident Evil:Apocolypse****[4 Stars]-Seems like sequels are doing very well this year especially with this and ''Excorsist:The Beginning****[4 Stars]''. I remember Bruce Campbell referring to his movie ''Evil Dead 2**[2 Stars'' as the mother of all sequels, well that is defiantly an understatement because this movie has to be the mother of all sequels especially among zombie movies. Its also what I would refer to as the best zombie movie since ''Return Of The Living Dead****[4 Stars]''. Compared to its predecessor ''Resident Evil***½[3 ½ Stars]'' this one moves at an even faster pace, adds another kickass female heroine, and has an even better ending with more twist and turns. If you thought the first one was fast paced action, think again, this starts right from the Beginning with action every minute and never once takes away from the movie's plot and storyline. As far as the female heroine Milla Jochavich brings on another awesome ''Ellen Ripley'' performance plus another bonus one by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine. If you thought the ending was a big twist from the first one, this one has an ending just as good and makes it even better by packing in even more twist and turns.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something is rotten in the town of Raccon City,"First off let me say I am a horror geek. And add to that a zombie nerd. My fave film of all time is Braindead, and my top 5 include the 4 Romero Dead films.OK now thats over let my tell you of my hate of the trash known as Resident Evil: Apocalypse.Its awful.Fist up the acting, wooden at best, aggravating at its worst. Some scenes play like an amateur porn flick before the sex kicks in.The Story is beyond abysmal, and is simply beyond stupid, it lacks cohesion or any development of plot or characterization.Sound is actually good, well mixed and crisply presented. The low end is perhaps a bit wooden, and the high end too sharp, but the surround is just about perfect.The direction is cookie cutter stuff, with every trade cliché finding its way in somewhere, the framing show a lack of imagination.The editing is crude, with sloppy jump cuts and bad pacing. The film could have been 15-25 minutes shorter and lost nothing in atmosphere. It feel rushed and further weakens an already damaged product.The fx are OK and some are impressive, but mostly they are a sad attempt at bringing life to a corpse of a film that really needed to be buried, and is just stinking up the place.My major irk with the movie is that it isn't scary, or gory, or suspenseful, all the things the game is known for, and things that horror is known for. Instead we get a weak action film so dumb that only the lowliest smacktard could possibly enjoy it (i.e if you like Uwe Boll this is the movie for you).I hate this film for what it should have been.There are worse ways to waste a couple of hours but I cant think of any right now.If you like horror skip this film, it will only annoy you. If you like action, skip it will only disappoint you. If you like film skip it, as it will only astound you at its ineptitude.1 out of 10 only Uwe Boll could make a worse horror film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"More Sci-Fi and Action, But Less Horror for ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse""","After watching the first DVD in my collection box, I excitedly hopped in for the sequel ""Resident Evil"" Apocalypse"". The outbreak worsens as the T-virus invades Raccoon City. New characters enter. New enemies come in. And a greater battle against Umbrella Corporation ensues.The bioweapon ""Nemesis"" is probably the main attraction of the film. He doesn't look disgusting but threatening. Action sequence is grander than the first film. The church scene, the rooftop, and the final fight are well-choreographed. However, it fell short on horror, which is one of the three main genres of the video game franchise that serves as the source material.The film shows how more evil Umbrella can get, and this is scary for the real world. The plot twist is unexpected, and confusing. It's obvious that there's a need for a second sequel.I'm giving the film 8 of 10. Again, I'm looking for sci-fi, action, and horror, but it fell short on the horror genre. However, this is an action-packed film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only for die-hard fans of the game,"""Resident Evil"" was a scary, impressive horror film that was inspired by the famous game. After the T-Virus broke out in the underground lab called The Hive, the Umbrella Corporation tried to cover up its deadly mistake. But it was only the beginning.Milla Jovovich is back as Alice, and she's as stunningly beautiful as ever. She is the only apparent survivor from the incident in the first film, and now she's been tampered with by Umbrella. When she escapes an abandoned hospital, she finds herself in Racoon City, which has been taken over by the virus.In a desperate attempt to conceal the virus, Umbrella has the city blockaded, and Alice must team up with Jill Valentine, a former S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) officer to guide the last small group of survivors out to safety, before nuclear bombs are dropped on the city.Alice has become an unstoppable force of nature, toting guns and other weapons. She's an insanely talented martial arts expert, and it seems she can fight just about anything. With an awesome plot derived straight from the second game, the movie totally misses the mark.The camera work is hideous, especially during the action scenes, you can barely tell what's going on for the frantic editing is too much to bear. Milla is strong again in her performance but other than her and Sienna Guillory as Jill, there's barely any talent to be found in this mess, with weakly made-over monsters that barely pass for zombies and a ludricous pace. This is only for die-hard fans of Resident Evil, other than that consider ""Apocalypse"" a waste of your time.

Resident Evil: Atrocious,"The first film received a very mixed reception on release. People either loved it totally, or despised it, and the criticism levied towards the director (Paul WS Anderson) was, to be truthful, very harsh. I kinda liked it. As a fan of the games and also one of the few fans of Anderson himself, I enjoyed it from start to finish. The ending of the film hinted at the plot for the sequel, and I couldn't wait. Well, the wait is over. The film begins with a quick recap of event so far, telling us that Umbrella were developing genetic and viral weapons in their underground labs beneath Racoon C0ity, but something went wrong. The T Virus was released and the dead began to rise from the dead. Into this walked Alice, and ex-employee of Umbrella, who at the end of the first film awoke to find the whole of Racoon City had been infected. There begins Apocalypse! Alice has been experimented on to give her enhanced abilities, and soon finds herself leading a rag-tag bunch of survivors (including Jill Valentine, one of the most popular characters in the game) to rescue the daughter of Charles Ashford, the creator of the virus. At the same time the Nemesis experiment is released to stop her. Cue action scene after action scene, and a film that just plods along without offering any tension or emotion at all.I was disappointed with the film, not through the story (the concept and script is well woven by Anderson), but through the acting and direction, oh and the effects. This is a film with more ambition than the budget can allow! It is nice to see that the studio is an equal opportunities employer, but having epileptics manning the camera is a tad too much! The term used by Empire this month is 'F**king the Frame' and is a term that defines it perfectly! The camera shakes so much that keeping up with the action is tricky at the best of times, and tension is destroyed. Within the first few minutes a jerky, blurred shot is used to show lumbering zombies and alarm bells rang in my head! 'Are they just covering up some ropey effects and make-up?' The answer is yes, and the shots of the 'big bad' Nemesis attain! Why could they not get a better make-up and effects team! Surely the people who worked on Buffy and Angel were availableeven their effects were better than this 'rubber mask' effect! The overall effect is similar to that other terrible 'big bad' creation, the Spinosaurus in JP3.The acting, aside from Jovovich, is terrible! Maybe it was paying homage to the games where the voice acting is diabolical, or maybe the budget just wouldn't allow them to hire anyone with any talent! If it was intended as homagewell it was a terrible idea as you just can't care for the characters. So, the blame for this very average waste of 1 ½ hours can't be levied at Anderson. He wrote a decent story. The problems here can mainly be put down to the director this time, first timer Christopher Witt, who fails to get any decent results from his cast, and can't really convey a scene well.Overall a film with far too much ambition! Yes, it would be tricky to convey a city in chaos without having a lot of action, but perhaps a bit of tension wouldn't go amiss! Look at Alienslots of beasts attacking, but only a few key action points. Fans will love looking for the links to the games, but that's about it. Go play the games instead!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Unpretentious, fast-paced fun","OK, the script is pretty dire. But this move gives all that it promised - thrills, spills and gore, without the usual poncing around with things like plot or character which tends to undo films with more high-minded aims (28 Days Later springs to mind). It looks great, sounds cool and is wonderfully camp, a tongue in cheek homage to computer gaming fluff. You can't watch a zombie movie in seriousness - the genre was created as a way to satirically represent modern society, not to be judged alongside Merchant Ivory or Federico Fellini. If you loved the games and their cheesiness, watch this film. Don't listen to the critics - trust me, it's a lot of fun!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Crappy sequel.,"I'm a fan of the games who liked the first movie. But man, how I hate this sequel. Everything that made the original so good has been either ruined or ignored here. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE is more a video game than a real movie. 'That's what it's supposed to be' you may say. Well, the problem is that any of the RE games has a better story, better direction and even better acting than this boring mess.RE: APOCALYPSE is basically a series of unexciting and badly shot action scenes loosely joined by a paper-thin story. There is no lack of character development here, if only because there are no characters in this movie, just cardboard cut-outs. The actors do what they can with what they are given, but you never get to care much for any of them. Milla Jovovich looks very hot again, but she seems to be sleep-walking most of the time, in spite of all the action stuff. The rest are more or less serviceable except for Mike Epps, who is deeply annoying as the supposedly funny black token character/comic relief.If you thought Paul W. S. Anderson was a bad director, you are going to miss him here. Alexander Witt's direction is so bad that he makes Michael Bay look like James Cameron. Apparently, he's one of those guys who think that an action movie must be a 90 minute-long video-clip. He keeps using bad post-production slow-motion and awful editing techniques to make sure that you can hardly tell what's going on, specially during the non-stop action scenes. And just in case that's not enough, there are moments when, for instance, tenths of zombies suddenly teleport into an empty room to kill a disposable supporting character.As I said, the plot is basically non-existent, in part because the movie feels very choppy. The (so-called) characters keep showing up in different locations, but we hardly see how or why they got there. We aren't even told how some of them escaped from a church surrounded by hordes of undead. After all, that's not necessary, because the makers of this movie assume that their target audience is made up of people who turn off their brains and become zombies the moment they step into a movie theater. But you know: Suspension of disbelief is one thing; brain damage is something entirely different. The former makes you accept that the dead may walk, the later forcefully feeds you with everything else in this movie.In short: If you liked the original, you'll be disappointed with this sequel (to say the least). Unless, of course, you are one of those guys who only care about hot babes kicking ass and think than people like me are stupid film critic wannabes. If not, see the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake instead. It's the same, but good.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
One for the records in the horror/action category!,"Sometimes you just want to sit back and have fun at the theatre. Resident Evil: Apocalypse isn't going to win any awards at the Oscar's, but why do critics always make it seem like the only movies worth watching are ones with symbolism and deep, hidden meanings? This has got all the ingredients for an awesome horror/action flick (hot chicks kicking zombie ass, explosions, and of course plenty of gore). Milla Jovovich returns to her role as Alice, a former employee of the multi-billion dollar Umbrella corporation. She was altered by Umbrella to be a kind of super-human (she can now run down buildings, jump about 30 feet into the air, and has the strength of twenty men). Fans of the video game will be happy to see Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliviera, characters from the actual game, making their appearance here. The pacing of the movie is nearly perfect, and there's even some much-needed comic relief. But perhaps the greatest achievement of the film is Nemesis, a bioweapon created by Umbrella to hunt and kill S.T.A.R.S. members (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad). He is a monstrosity who can only be challenged by the super-human Alice. As anyone who has played Resident Evil 3 knows, you don't want Nemesis after you. Overall, this game is a huge treat for fans of the Resident Evil video game series, fans of the original Resident Evil movie, or fans of the horror/action genre. Now go see it!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Eh...,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse was...well..interesting. Not necessarily in the good way. Acting was great. Character development for Alice (Milla Jovovich) was great. I have said this before and I will say it again. I do NOT suggest these films to anybody who is a big fan of the games. If you are a fan of the games, keep an open mind and realize that the movies don't really have much to do with the games. RE2 had more continuity to the games then Resident Evil (2002) did.Personal opinion: I preferred Resident Evil (2002) to this movie. It did make a good 'brigde' to Resident Evil: Afterlife because of the lack of in-depth explanation. I have dubbed this movie 'The Bridge to Resident Evil: Afterlife'",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"bad story, dumbing dialogues...just kill everything.","The first episode was bad, but it had a a little story. This is just the continuation, which includes zombies till death, an embarrassingly Milla Jovovich who plays a superwoman with badly dialogues....oh yes, and no story.....actually not really good for a continuation of Resident Evil.The new hopefully star Sienna Guillory didn't convince in her valentine role....one reason, she also had dumb dialogues like Milla. But i think there's not really one actor, who plays OK...but thats my opinion. The feeling of the actors were cramped and false, they aren't ideal for their roles...My vote: 1/10 awful and a not needed movie.D.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Almost As Good As the Original,"This sequel to ""Resident Evil"" begins where the first movie left off. ""Alice"" (Milla Jovovich) has been captured by the Umbrella Corporation and is having experiments done to her while she is mostly unconscious. During this time the Umbrella Corporation sends security personnel back into ""the Hive"" to try to figure out what happened. Upon entering, the security personnel are quickly overwhelmed by the zombies who rapidly enter into the general population of ""Raccoon City"". This causes mass panic as the infection spreads out-of-control. When Alice awakens she finds herself alone in the laboratory and upon exiting it sees the devastation brought upon Raccoon City. At any rate, rather than giving away any surprises I will just say that this film is almost as good as the original. Not only does Milla Jovovich give an awesome performance but so does Sienna Guillory (""Jill Valentine"") and Oded Fehr (""Carolos Olivera""). As a matter of fact, Sienna Guillory could have probably starred in her own right had Milla Jovovich not been available. Likewise, Sandrine Holt (as the television newscaster, ""Terri Morales"") and Mike Epps (""L.J."") did very well in a supporting role. I also liked the performance of Thomas Kretschmann as the bad guy, ""Major Tom Cain"". In short, there is a lot to like about this film. It has good acting, plentiful action and excellent special effects. As such, if a person liked the original then they will probably enjoy this one as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
OH MY ANDERSON F'ED UP,"First time director (Witt) who directed Resident Evil: Apocalypse, made Anderson look a FOOL. This film was shot so much better than the first. Action sequences were good. Story was horrible (granted Anderson wrote it, please somebody take away his DGA/WGA cards... please). RE:A was not what I wanted to see. But it was still a very cleaner looking film. The Jill Valentine character was HORRIBLE. I'm sorry, I played the game, and Jill was no badass, rude, unstoppable character. Her facial expression was the same throughout the entire film and though Anderson wrote some of the worst dialog I have ever heard, well except for AVP, oh wait he wrote that one too, she delivered the bad dialog, well badly. The movie would have been much better if there was no Jill in the mix. That character kinda killed the whole movie for me. Mila on the other hand rocked. She has a very big future in the action genre. I enjoyed the look of the Nemisis, and the zombie dogs looked much better in this one, as did all the CGI work. If you're a fan of the series go see it. It's good mindless entertainment and leaves an intriguing ending th say the least. If part 3 is absent of Anderson it could have some potential. If you're not a fan of the video games, rent 28 days later, Dawn/Day of the dead, hell rent Night of the Demons!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good action as always, but that's all..","After seeing the original Resident Evil, I had great expectations from the second chapter (of a possible trilogy?). after seeing it I can say I quite disappointed. Of course, the movie is well done, and I don't have any complains about the actors and their acting, still - The so well known plot of some innocent citizens locked up in a city full of zombies returns again and again and again (but to be honest, this is the best of all movies with the same plot).While in the first movie you could feel the fear and the thrill, here you will see some nice action parts but no more. A lot of ""bang-bang"" and none of the sophistication from the first movie. This what disappointed me the most.The ending, which I won't tell of course, was a bit of surprising and left many questions opened to what happened in the last 5 minutes of the movie (what led me to the conclusion of making the third, and maybe the final Resident Evil).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Watchable but disappointing sequel to ""Resident Evil"".","After Alice (Milla Jovovich) barely escaping from the hive along with other survivor Matt (Eric Mabuis from the first film), who has been infected. Then a group of scientists from Umbrella Coropartion are playing god on Alice and Matt by increasing their strength and ability to be the perfect solider. When other scientists has re-open the hive to investigate but the infected dogs, monsters and zombies has attacked them and now going above ground to attack any civilians on Raccoon City. While high-profile Scientists or Employees from Umbrella Coporation are escaping the city before the virus affected the whole town.But when Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris)'s daughter Angie (Sophie Vavasseur) finds herself trapped in the city after unexpected accident. Now civilians from Raccoon City are trying to escape from the city but the Umbrella Coporation, especially the man in charge Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann) won't allowed it. After he made sure, his men are blocking all exits from the city. Now ex-cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), her partner (Razaaq Adoti) and an ambitious TV reporter (Sandra Holt) finds themselves stuck in the city, while the living dead are increasing. Alice... now awaking from the Umbrella Medical Building and escaping from it. Now she's tries to escape the city as well.

But the survivors finds themselves chased by all kinds of trouble and including an mutated monster called Nemesis (Matthew G. Taylor), who once was Matt.Directed by the first-time Alexander Witt (Who is a talented second unit director and as well of being an second unit director of photography). Witt shows some flair with action sequences, some decent visual camera work, he manages to have an good cast here but although Witt isn't quite as strong a filmmaker as Paul W.S. Anderson (Which he wrote the script) did on the original. Witt uses too much of slow motion at times, especially when the Zombies shows-up. It seems very unnecessary, it has an very bad jarring feel to it and the sequel is clumsy at times. At least, the actors kept it entertaining for the right or wrong reasons. Since it has its shares of unintentional moments.I have to admit, i hated this sequel. When i first viewed it on DVD back in 2004. I was expecting to be creepy as the original did but i didn't expect to be goofier in this one. I do like the idea in the sequel that the zombies and monsters are running around attacking the city. After just watching it again recently, i do enjoy a bit more than i first seen it. But the sequel is still an mess with an truly flawed third act and it has at least two endings in the feature. But although ""Resident Evil:Apocalyspe"" was an improvement over the second one, despite the characters of Jill and Angie are not in third film.On the Resurrected Edition DVD, this film is a double feature with the original. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Which the surrounds on the sequel are quite impressive at times, especially the Church sequence. On the second disc, there's an additional special features were not on the original 2-Disc DVD Set back in 2004. It would be nice, if the DVD included three running commentaries tracks but they didn't. This sequel is only for die-hard fans of the video game or the first film, although some will admit... this is pretty lame half of the time. Super 35. (***/*****).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Turns out for the best,"Let me first get technical. At first, the flimsy camera work and cheesy effects made me doubt this was going to be a good movie. I'm glad I was proven wrong. After the first 20 minutes, the camera work got smoother and stable, and the effects kept on getting better and better.As for the plot, you get some good insights on Umbrella, and even if the end lends itself towards another sequel, it won't leave you hanging with a bunch of loose ends.Expect a zombie movie with a lot of action. If your typical tastes are light comedies and drama, don't get all worked up to give this movie a bad review. It's for the fans, and it delivers. The movie overall is well put, well worth it, and if you can handle the first twenty minutes, it turns out for the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible sequel,"I can be pretty short about this sequel to 'Resident Evil': it's terrible. I mean, I was able to find some joy in the first film even though it made no sense at all. This one makes no sense at all and misses the ingredients that made the first film watchable. It does contain a fine looking Milla Jovovich and another actress (Sienna Guillory) that makes it easier to watch, sort of telling us this film really is for teenage boys only. Well, the ones older than sixteen since this is an R-rated film. And it's about zombies, by the way.There are good films about zombies, the undead, the living dead. George Romero made them, '28 Days Later' or 'Shaun of the Dead' are recent examples. The original 'Resident Evil' belongs not to this category but at least it had some moments of suspense and tried to give us a story, whether you found it stupid or not. Here there is no suspense, just a little gore, and the story is not really there. The events from 'Resident Evil' were underground in a place called The Hive. After Jovovich survived it was locked forever to keep the virus that turned people into zombies. Why they want to keep it I do not know, but let's not ask questions here. Now they want to reopen The Hive. The Hive by the way, is located in Raccoon City, a city that can only be accessed by one bridge.The Hive opens, the virus is still there, including the zombies, and the virus spreads through the city. Now they quarantine the city and people who are still in it have to save themselves. The Umbrella Corporation, the most powerful corporation in the world, is responsible but will do anything to keep their virus. They have created a secret weapon, codename Nemesis, a creature that seems to be invincible. Now the group that includes Jovovich and Guillory have to survive not only the zombies, but the creature as well. A man can help the group, navigating them with the help of his computer, but they have to save his daughter first. Jovovich has a little secret of her own.I realize I have spend too much on the story since it basically is a group of people walking through a city with zombies popping up from time to time. They are shot in a stylized action sequence and the group continues. No fun here I would say. If you liked the first film or the computer game the film is based on you might find some joy, but you can do so much better. This film offers nothing we have not seen before. Here it is always night therefore the action is hard to follow, making it even less interesting. Don't waste your time on this one is basically all I want to say.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than the original.,"The original Resident Evil movie was a big disappointment for me. I had expected the movie to be more like the video game that I love so much. The makers of the movie did a much better job on this sequel to try to keep it true to the game.The movie takes place after the incident at the Hive. Alice awakens in a lab belonging to the Umbrella Corporation. No one seems to be around, Alice leaves the lab, venturing into Racoon City, only to find that the nightmare is not yet over.This second film introduces Jill Valentine, who was in the video game Resident Evil 2, as well as a few other characters. Being from the Toronto area, it was great to see the city of Toronto used as the backdrop of Racoon City. Numerous landmarks were used, and the destruction of our City Hall was fun to see.Great special effects, lots of action, and a decent storyline put this one above the other video-game movies. It is definitely not going to be up for best picture, but it is a fun time waster. Just leave your brain at the door, and you may find yourself enjoying this entertaining horror/thriller.Looking forward to the third film, if they decide to make it. Hopefully they will return to the mansion that was used in the first game.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Really, really bad film!","There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or money. Do not even give in to curiosity.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jovovich in Tomb Raider mode against Zombies...again,"Okay, one might wonder why I am watching the second part after my negative comment on the first part. The only explanation I can give is quality time with my family and to watch two hot chicks (Guilory and Jovovich) fight zombies. Perhaps I may be somewhat curious to how the story continues.'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is worse than its prequel. There is hardly anything that makes this one different from other viral films. It's filled with clichès and obvious jumps (again most of it is unintentionally funny, or maybe it's not so unintentional). Here the story revolves around two pretty (and smart) women and a couple of idiots against zombies. Of course the ending is also such that another sequel is expected (and it's been released already).In terms of acting, Jovovich performed better in the previous one. Here she's more in Tomb Raider mode (but she does act better than Angelina Jolie did in Tomb Raider). The special effects aren't so bad either. Other than that I find 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' funny too. Now I am curious about the 3rd part and to see how Jovovich continues her Tomb Raider-like war against the zombies...and of course to have a nice time with my family (who seem to enjoy it a lot).",,Anonymous,Horror
A Decent Horror-Action-Thriller,"11 September 2004. The sound effects, the fast paced action, the blur of violence, the plot are provided good exposure in this sequel, sequel. This entertaining horror-plenty of action thriller flick was an above average horror genre with a little for everyone one who likes these movies. There is the tender, emotional rescue, the comedic relief, the unanticipated deaths (so to speak), and twist at the end. This movie captures the titillating show of reveal leg, and kickass martial art moves, the evil scientists, and strong female leads. While the movie suffers from a few plot weaknesses, the fantasy, video nature of this movie allows for some flexibility. The zombie-like creatures seem to fade some in an odd illogical way (for the script's sake)...people seem to survive by luck in some cases or die in other cases (as guess just as in real life). Some of the movie is contrived, some some characters obvious set up for oblivion with recourse to rational sanity. All in all, this movie did its horror and thrills more and bigger and whizzier.

Development of an atmosphere or even worse emotional development of the characters was completely not considered by the makers of the movies, on the other hand they easily sacrificed any piece of story logic for having another cool pose of their main characters. As a result, the story has holes as large as moon craters and a development like the shambling of a drunk. The movie beginning is very artificial and the movie climax very cheesy and wordy. Still, the movie has quite some nice action scenes and over long distances also suspense.I can't really recommend it, the predecessor was a lot more spooky and original.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

pure entertainment - for whoever likes it,"I liked more the original 'Resident Evil'. It was not a masterpiece or a very original film either, but at least the idea was rather new, and seeing Milla Jovovich as the principal action hero fighting armies of zombies created by a scientific experiment gone wrong was refreshing. The problem with 'RE2 - Apocalypse' is that the film turns again around seeing Milla Jovovich as the principal action hero fighting armies of zombies created by a scientific experiment gone wrong, and what was new a couple of years ago looks like a repetition here. Paul Anderson who directed the first film only wrote the script here, leaving the task of directing to somebody else, who could not bring too much life in this second film in what looks will become a long lived series. A sequel must have new elements, keep some surprises to attract the viewers - this is not the case here. Nothing is very wrong, the new cast around Milla is quite OK, but we have seen too many times the same or similar characters in similar situations, and as in many other movies the outcome is just too physical and too expected. So, zombie films and action films fans will get an average product that most of them will probably enjoy because this is what they expected. Fans of good cinema will come out with empty hands. 5 out of 10 on my personal scale.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is amazing and it follows the Sony Playstation games almost exactly. The details and the special effects are spectacular and this is a must see for any of those who love zombie movies. It kicks the crap out of Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days later although those are both good as well. There is something about Milla Jovovich that makes her a great as the part of Alice and Jill is also amazing.

entertaining but too fast paced,"I was surprised that I enjoyed the first resident evil film, despite its soundtrack being off pace and lack of character development. This film starts where it left off with Alice being left in a world of destruction by zombies. I felt that there was too much emphasis on special effect shots and slow mo style matrix type martial arts. Obviously this film appeals to a younger audience, but overdoing it to make it look cook can wreck its appeal. Jill was a good add in but there could have been more engagement amongst the characters in general.

He ruined another franchise,"There's only way to describe this movie- utterly awful. I found myself laughing through the whole thing since what was happening was completely ridiculous. I think they did every possible thing for this movie in the worst way, even the simple things.First of all, the video games were great. They're classics, hense why Resident Evil was remade more than five years after its original release. I'm not an extremely creative person, but it wouldn't be difficult at all, even as an independent movie, to make an adaptation of the game. After all, isn't that what the point of making a Resident Evil movie is? If he wants to go on his own little suck spree with his awful ideas, why doesn't he leave Resident Evil out of it and make a completely different zombie movie?Second of all, there are so many plot holes you're afraid to even wonder thinking you might get stuck with ridiculously abstract thinking (which is the only way to try to explain the things in this movie!). Jill Valentine, who was in the first two Resident Evil games and more, makes her first appearance with no background information. She walks into the police place in skimpy clothing and says, ""Shoot them in the head."" Everyone listens. As the writer has obviously taken the very minimum from the Resident Evil storyline, you can't be left to believe she survived at a mansion in the outskirts of Raccoon City. So she must have had an epiphany when she awoke that morning (please prevent yourself from thinking of any other reason, you will have literally wasted a precious few seconds of your life). Not to mention that Alice somehow knows EVERYTHING about Nemesis (God forbid there be any purposely open-ended questions), Alice makes no sense, dead people in cemeteries somehow manage to get infected while six feet underground, some guy at the end is shot but randomly gets infected WITHOUT being bit, Nemesis and Alice have a Mortal Kombat style (no joke, it beings with some guy yelling ""FIGHT!"" and ending with him saying ""FINISH HIM!"" But it ended with Alice performing a Friendship instead of a Fatality), and for some reason zombies completely ignore important characters when they're making ""dramatic"" speeches.Lastly, the acting and all around film work is completely awful. You'd like to see a zombie bite someone, wouldn't you? But because they had two thousand camera angles and some guy with Parkinson's disease was doing the film editing (in case you don't catch the pun, people with Parkinsons shake uncontrollably). That might also explain why the zombies move all slow, which is cool and freaky, but for some reason they DJ the film and make it go super fast, normal, then slow? This is the way it is for every action scene, as if they're trying to rush the movie so you won't have to sit through more of it. Not like the hand-to-hand fighting scene would be cool if you could see what was happening anyway. The acting is just awful. I don't know about anyone else, but I'd be a little freaked/emotional if everyone in my city was running after me to eat me. Not these people though, they act like they're just as calm as they would be at a photo shoot. Or hell if you saw your best friend get shot or eaten in front of you, that's no reason to show emotion...is it?See this movie if you want a good laugh at how awful it is, or a good cry at how good the video games are and how this writer just ruined your dreams. The movie makes a mockery of everything it can possibly touch, including the scene where someone ""hacks"" into Umbrella by typing into his Vaio- ""open hack.exe"". Not to mention they completely screwed up on doing so many things. People that aren't bit turn into zombies. Windows are broken while driving a Harley through it, and somehow pieced back together and re-broken when the lamest scene I've ever seen in a movie occurs just seconds later. Nuclear missiles can be shot from helicopters and guided through city streets...right? I'd rate this as a 2/10, only allowing for a 2 because I did have a good laugh by the end. If you enjoy dropping empty water bottles onto the ground over and over again, you'll enjoy this movie, but only slightly.",,Anonymous,Horror
A worthy follow up though not quite as good as the first film,"After surviving against the Undead in the first film, Alice finds herself in another battle for survival against the Undead (this time with the help of a couple of soldiers and a journalist). With the whole city on lockdown Alice learns that her only hopes of escape lie with Umbrella Corporation's leading scientist Dr Ashford; whom is prepared to help her and her team escape the city in exchange for the safe return of his daughter.With the same kind of fast-flowing kinetic energy as the first film Apocalypse is a film that is very difficult not to enjoy (if you liked action-orientated cinema). Whilst it does have a similar feel to it than the first film, Apocalypse is broader in scale with Umbrella Corporation having a larger bearing on the story this time around. The downside of moving the same scenario into the city is that it robs the film of the claustrophobia and tension that was abundant in the first film; Apocalypse is more focused on staging big shoot em ups and, as such, never quite involves as much as it should have done. The chemistry between Alice and her team also isn't quite up there with her team chemistry from the first film; there was more of a sense of teamwork and everyone playing their part in the first film which we don't witness here - although this can perhaps be explained by what happened to Alice at the hospital. Still her 'team' here almost felt extraneous and I couldn't help but think 'Would the outcome be any different for Alice had they not been there?' The answer of which would be No.Although Umbrella Corporation have a bigger bearing on the story this time there isn't really a new angle or agenda on offer here; the same big people stepping on the little people in the sense that people are treated as numbers rather than human. In this respect, the story is no great shakes and isn't all that interesting, but this aspect is compensated by the action (which comes very frequently), its short running time and fast pace which means that despite some of its problems Apocalypse rarely has any dull moments.If you liked the first film then the chances are that you will like this film. It doesn't quite have the same tension about it as the original, but it's still a very enjoyable film in its own right.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
much better sequel,"This movie rocks! Non stop action from beginning till end, amazing special effects and Yovovich looks stunning as always. The music works well and the fight scenes are great; there is some cool kung fu fighting going on and they make the actors look like heroes. But there is one thing that i did not really like about this film. The acting of some of the actors was not convincing enough and certain special effects did not amaze me at all; those red monsters in the cathedral were ridiculous. The movie is based on the game which I never played but I am pretty sure that the game fans will love this movie. Yovovich is one of the most beautiful actors/models and in the movie she gives a very close resemblance to the main character in the game. The theme and the plot of the movie is based on infected humans turned to zombies. But I'm really fed up of watching zombie movies this year (Dawn of the dead). This film was only worth for the fight scenes i.e. the whole film, and the actress! ... the rest could have been done a bit better I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well... I liked it!,"I'll start by saying that Resident Evil 2 (or 'Apocalypse' to give it its correct name) wasn't that well received. The first film was (loosely!) based on a computer game and kind of went some way to revitalise the 'zombie' genre (or at least bring the undead back into the mainstream again). However, whereas the original was widely well received by people who like a good B-movie, its second outing was pretty much trashed. And, yes, I can see why – but I still liked it! It carries on nicely from the original after a zombie outbreak occurs in a secret lab complex under a major (fictional) city. Now the virus has been released on the above ground population and the city is basically falling to the numerous walking corpses while the authorities struggle to maintain order. Throw in the only survivor from the first movie (a semi-naked Milla Jovovich) and you have your film.I'll start by listing its – numerous – faults. The cast are wafer thin cardboard cut-outs and every piece of dialogue is by-the-numbers and feels like it's been written by a first year film student. There's no such thing as 'character development' and you'll see every plot point coming. They even bring back the 'zombie dogs' from the first film and sort of rehash the scene again. The villain (yes, there's a human villain as well as the zombies) is – again – your typically badly-written Bond-villain rip-off. Then you have the 'Nemesis' – which is basically a man in a rubber suit pretending to be a monster. Everything here is 'style over substance' – the story (and maybe I should put 'story' in quote marks?) moves from one stylised fight-scene to another. You really will have to leave your brain at the door to get over the gaping holes in the plot which lead up to all the major characters getting together.Yet, despite all that – I confess to actually owning this film on DVD and watching it every few years. I found it quite fresh at the time. I've been a fan of the zombie genre since the seventies and missed them so much that I was quite glad to see a big budget film where you get to see a glimpse of society falling while the zombie outbreak is underway. The trick to getting something out of RE2 is basically lowering your expectations suitably to ignore all its faults. You'll probably have to know what Milla Jovovich's movies are generally like, i.e. superhuman female kicking the hell out of numerous faceless baddies (or zombies in this case). Don't expect too much. It's a complete B-movie where you can wander in and out of the room at will and still know exactly what's going on.I like it, but even if you do really hate it as much as the majority, it's still head and shoulders over every last sequel which follows (and there are a lot of those!).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie sucked,"This is by far the worst zombie movie I have seen in a while. It almost seems as though it was just put together as they were filming without even using a script... things that make no sense were thrown in left and right. Why would already dead people get infected and come out of their graves? I don't get that part at all. horribly unrealistic action moves were used way too much.I rated this movie a 1 I would recommend watching anything else besides this movie. try 28 days later, that was a decent zombie movie I can't imagine how much resident evil 3 is going to suckI don't have anything else to say, goodnight",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
So stale it crumbles,"You know that moment in every action or horror movie when the baddie is just about to kill, maim, bite, or otherwise put the hurt on a sympathetic character, when another, unseen sympathetic character shoots/stabs/whatevers the baddie in JUST the nick of time? ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is an entire film based around just repeating that moment again and again and again. Each time, the director (who's somehow less famous and reputable than Paul W.S. Anderson, if that's conceivable) honestly seems to expect us to react to it, which borders on insulting. While it's not the worst movie of the year (""Day After Tomorrow"" and ""AvP"" have it beat, while ""Chronicles of Riddick"" has it just about even), it's easily the most repetitive, predictable and stale--pretty much every shot or sequence you see is blatantly ripped off from some other movie.If there is a redeeming quality to this movie, it's the nice assortment of surprisingly subtle visual references to the classic ""Resident Evil 2"" video game, on which it is loosely based. Unfortunately, the movie seems to have abandoned that great game's penchant for eerie atmospheric thrills in favor of constant, ridiculous action. Making an action movie out of ""Resident Evil 2,"" a game firmly routed in the cinematic traditions of horror, is akin to making a horror movie out of ""Virtua Fighter""--it's just the wrong idea.Though they may draw similar audiences, horror and action actually aren't all that compatible, and nothing drives that point home like sitting through this movie. It sacrifices scares for explosions, atmosphere for flashy edits, and human fear for superhuman kung fu heroics. The constant use of the aforementioned just-in-time device is an attempt to artificially inject some real fear and tension, but it fails because of its predictability.I'd compare this to the first ""Resident Evil"" film if I could remember anything about it besides Milla's brief nudity. This film, thankfully, seems destined to fade from memory just as quickly--leaving only fleeting glimpse of Milla's goodies behind.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not As Good As The First One, But Its Still One Hell Of A Ride","Sure it has its flaws but you have to admit its still a fun movie to watch! Milla's acting hasn't improved but with the addition of Sienna performance is brilliant and in my opinion the only person who could play Jill Valentine. The licker's look really good compared to them in the first film but that doesn't make it better. The story is stupid and at places boring. The scare factor has dropped but the action factor has improved. This is more resident evil than the first one but it isn't as well polished. So over all this is a very Friday night movie but it isn't the first one, you cant watch this film over and over and over again but hey if its cheep its well worth a look.Its Well worth a look at 6/10 or ***.

Not a bad sequel and certainly watchable but still with lots of flaws in it.,"This is not a bad movie, especially considering that's a sequel of an already not so great movie. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a good mix of horror, action and science-fiction elements but still makes some odd choices with its story.Biggest problem with the movie is that it has too many separate story lines with many different characters that don't really have anything to do with each other. In fact, in the first halve of the story the main character Alice, played by Milla Jovovich, is hardly used in the movie. The movie tries to follow too many characters, it doesn't make the movie confusing but it does make this movie a bit odd and uneasy to watch at times. The movie doesn't always flow and despite its potential the story makes some odd choices.Again the movie has some good action and as a Zombie movie it also certainly isn't a bad movie but still the movie has an awful B-movie feeling over it at times. The actors (I really like Thomas Kretschmann as an actor but he was terribly miscast in this movie and simply didn't fit the part) and their dialog is horrible and the movie has some at times horrible editing and use of slow-motion. It also again 'borrows' too many elements from other more successful movies. It isn't exactly the most original movie to watch. Still there are some good elements in the movie, such as with the Nemisis character, that is one big cool villain with some serious heavy weaponry.A different director and writer would had certainly done some good to this movie. The movie had quite some potential but it isn't used to the max and there had been made some odd choices with the movie its story.Still I say; Bring on part three!6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
But is it Resident Evil?,"Like the original games and the first movie, this has the lurching zombies and a population infected by a powerful and recklessly insensitive megacorp. It has loads of firearms, comic-book action sequences, and characters in contemporary clothing that are just distinctive enough to look like comic hero costumes. It also has homages to previous horror films.Every other Resident Evil game and the original movie has presented new stories that take advantage of the setting, situation and themes without disrupting the continuity, proving that it could have been done for this movie. This movie deviates from the canons by reinventing characters and running roughshod over the established story lines.Was this necessary? Viewers who've been following the story before this installment will find the contradictions distracting. Audiences new to the series could've been given a good story without revealing or revising what had been served up before. Is it such a bad idea to give them just enough to leave them wanting if you still have games to sell? Resident Evil was rich with mysteries to be explained, new territory to be explored, but instead of cultivating the franchise this movie ham-handedly grabbed for the quick buck.Alice and Jill were easy on the eyes and very powerful action figures, far too good at surviving to be good survival horror figures. Superhuman kung-fu masters aren't exactly beating the odds as they engage in battles that you know they'll win before they begin. Ho hum. No suspense. No menace. Even the monster is just another action figure in latex. I wasn't surprised to find Jill Valentine likable and interesting because I never cared for her in the previous Resident Evils. With that great a character discrepancy between the game and movie, I'm pleased to see no adaptation of the characters I actually did like (geniune thanks to Emily Bergl for dropping out.)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A waste of time and money that leaves you irritated,"I went into Resident Evil: Apocalypse with a keen sense of hope. The trailers, although never showing much, seemed to be innovative. It looked as though a good video game adaption flick would hit the theaters. I admit, I do enjoy the Resident Evil video games. However, I would like to point out that I am writing this as unbiased as possible. This movie blew me away. I was astonished. The fact that something so terribly put together somehow was greenlit by a production company, the fact that someone in a suit thought that this film was worth giving the go-ahead, it just shocks me. Let me tell you why I cannot stand this film. First of all, the plot is so transparent, it might as well be made of glass. The 'foreshadowing' is incredibly obvious, keeping you off the edge of your seat (not a good thing for a movie regarded as a Sci-Fi Thriller/Action - maybe a Drama or Romantic Comedy...). Although the concept of the Resident Evil series is unrealistic, this film has a plot that brings unrealism to an entirely different level. The overall impossibility of the plot is enough to keep you from getting into the 'cinematic illusion'. As for the characters and acting... Most actors involved in this movie just committed Career suicide. It shows their complete lack of aptitude. The worst part was that most characters had fake accents that were so poorly done, and accents are normally given to characters to add dimension. This took dimension away, and made me care less and less about their characters. We're treated to slaughtered British, French, Russian, and German accents. There was one hope for this movie: The Computer Graphics. And they were terrible. Perhaps I'm spoiled off Star Wars graphics, but if you are going to put CG in a movie, at least do a good job about it. This movie was not worth $7.50 at my local cineplex. But if you don't believe me, find out for yourself.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best out of the series!,"After watching the first, I thought that this sequel would be worse but to my surprise, this sequel is actually betterbut not by much. The story is more-or-less the same as the first one (we need to get to point A to B by this time, fighting zombies along the way) but it's a little more stronger. The action sequences and explosions were good to watch but in some of the scenes felt like it was there to impress thirteen-year-old teenagers to keep their attention. I also noticed it follows the games a lot more in Apocalypse than it does with Resident Evil which is a plus since Resident Evil hardly followed any of the games. Gamers will be glad to see Nemesis, zombie dogs and Jill Valentine return on-screen and will also be glad that the design and make-up for Nemesis was superbly done. Yet again, Milla Jovovich was spot-on as bad-ass Alice as was Sienna Guillory who played as Jill Valentine and Mike Epps who added a little humour to this zombie action movie as L.J. The characters were done well but they wasn't done well enough that you would care about what happened to them.The visual effects were done quite good and the action scenes were executed very well, especially the scenes in the church and the graveyard which showed great camera-work and special effects. The music wasn't very memorable and didn't fit some of the scenes well like the last movie although the theme tune was good.The ending in this movie, for me, isn't much of an improvement from the last but it's good enough for a mediocre movie series. The start, middle and end felt like it was going at an average pace which is a good thing.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

There isn't a single second in the movie when something isn't happening on the screen, and yet it's mind-numbingly boring from beginning to end.

Quick Blurb,"Saw an advanced screening tonight of the movie. Without going into too much detail. I thought it was fantastic and far superior to the first one.

You'll just have to see it for yourself though ^_-). The film felt much more for the most part like an RE game then the first one did, the action was great, the story was fine. Overall a solid *** to **** action/horror film (that is to say I compared it with other films in that genre instead of movies in general).

I'd go see it again and I plan to get it on DVD when it comes out. I've read a lot of negative stuff about the director but I don't think many people could have done it much better.

He just filmed what Paul sent to him. Anyone can do that. Paul's touch on the RE series in his first movie was mind blowing. I and every other person in the cinema gasped, and enjoyed the whole thing. After waiting 2 painful years for the sequel, it was released. I went to the premiere here and i loved it. It made me jump, it sucked me in. It even gave me the feel of RE. Which isn't just creaky doors and footsteps off in the distance, its a group of characters fighting against zombies. That just screams action. Sure the acting is cheesy, but that can be ignored with Milla being as sexy as she is. Seriously people, just take one step back from the whole RE game thing, and watch it for a movie. Its awesome.

Resident Evil: Suckolaypse,"I had the displeasure of picking this DVD up on sale and watching it a few days later. I loved the first Resident Evil and thought it did well for a video game to big screen adaption. (A genre not known for producing block busters by any means!) In a nutshell, this movie sucked donkey balls. Apparently they decided to have this guy named Alexander Witt direct the movie. His name should actually be changed to Alexander Wittless or at least they could have attributed the credit to Alan Smithee. The direction was terrible at best and the first half of the movie was extremely choppy, with little regard to defining any characters, and featured some of the lamest action scenes that I've seen in a long time.The movie starts off with the town of Raccoon City being quarantined due to all of the zombies escaping from the Hive facility. (Where the zombies came from was shown in the original.) Milla Jovovich is back as Alice and we find that the T-Virus has managed to merge with her body making her extremely powerful. (Does this sound like Alien: Resurrection by any chance?) Her mission? Survive in the ruins of Raccoon City and try to find a way to contain the virus all while avoiding a beast named Nemesis who is hunting her. Alice doesn't do it alone in this one as she soons recruits a small gang of moronic characters to help in her quest. (One of the dumbest scenes where she crashes through a church window on a motorcycle for no apparent reason.) After a flashy opening we are left with a weak story, laughable dialogue, acting only William Shatner could be proud of, dumb music video like action sequences, and a climactic confrontation with a creature that looks like a mix between the Toxic Avenger and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. Actually, that last comment isn't being fair to the Toxic Avenger as most Troma movies are more entertaining than this bloated piece of *****. I kept asking myself: Come on, this movie isn't really taking itself seriously is it? Is this supposed to be a spoof? Is this some ""fan cut"" of the movie or something?

the high budget for the movie did not merit the low quality of the film,"i am reading all these reviews of how good the movie actually was but i do not agree this time wondering if half of you were paid by the movie company to say it was good.so this time it seems as I'm on the side of the nay sayers. the general idea for the film leads you to believe that it would be good ,but I'm sorry to say that it wasn't .the way the movie unfolded was like a bad elementary school play , you sit there watching it, not actually getting into it n scene by scene it just continues n then it ends very anti-climactic too. leaving you wondering wat crap you just watched . it was ridiculous, it could have been much better, in fact i want my money back . the movie moved along too quickly, it was too short and lacked any mystery element as to what was going to happen next,it didn't keep you on your toes and it didn't even leave a good bridge for another possible sequel.i see this franchise being as terrible as the last few batman movies. i don't know people i thought that the nemesis element would enrichen the movie but it provided nothing . fine it was cool at first encounter but it wasn't nearly that menacing . omar epps was funny though . i can also say that the fighting wasn't bad too. there's a lot of things i would have changed in the movie personally. n i can name them if anyone wants to challenge me to that, as i imagine that those of you who liked it will say I'm stupid for not liking it .im just saying that there was way more to expect from this movie. there should have been more creepy scenes that were menacingly quiet followed by a surprising n heart pounding zombie attack . the movie concept was good just the direction they took it in n the way they did it was bad. it matters the way you do things n this was not the way to do things. it wasn't even download worthy for those who want to pirate the film , don't waste your time on it unless someone buys you a ticket to see it .",,Anonymous,Horror

An action packed guilty pleasure,"This is truly a guilty pleasure. Whereas the original was an actual good movie, well to me anyways. This is pure trash but it's so enjoyable. Milla Jovovich (Fifth Element) is back in mega kick ass mode along with Sienna Guilroy (Love, Actually), sexy Mike Epps (Hangover), Oded Fehr (The Mummy) and gorgeous Zack Ward (Freddy vs. Jason) amongst others. Picking up right after the events of the previous film Alice awakens in a distressed Racoon City overrunning with all forms of the undead. Slowly she builds up her powers leading up to a battle with Nemesis a.k.a. Matt (Eric Mabius- Welcome to the Dollhouse) and a killer finale. The movie is fun and funny thanks mostly to Mike Epps. The movie unfortunately looks a little cheap because of its ambition and limited budget but its effective nonetheless. There's no real scares here but the action and stunt work are impressive. To the films detriment its main problem is the amateur, sloppy direction from first time director Alexander Witt. Despite the criticisms the movie succeeds exactly where it sets its low expectations at, its mere popcorn entertainment.Budget: $43m

Outdated and empty,"It is ok, just ok. Looks quite outdated: clumsy acting scenes, and filming sometimes(but good frames). It has some drive, but the plot is boring and kinda stupid. Better than the first movie, but not that better to rate it higher.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you're looking for non-stop action, look no further.","Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the movie event of the season for me. I went into this baby with mixed expectations however. Point in fact, this is the sequel to the surprise gem that was Resident Evil. I have been looking forward to part 2 since seeing the closing frame of that film. My explosive anticipation has been silenced somewhat in the past few weeks, with all the negative output from advance reviews and what not. Still, nothing short of a million dollars would keep me away from the theater tonight. After the credits rolled, I felt numb; I couldn't believe that all of the time spent waiting for this movie had come to an end, an end which quite frankly, I wasn't sure how I felt about.Let's break RE:A down. The plot was almost non existent, which kinda sucks being that the original was founded on a - dare i say it - engaging plot. We got likable characters with a certain depth to them, enough for us to hope for their survival. This film threw in a bunch of ""cool"" new characters without so much of a mention as to where they're coming from (yes I'm talking about you Jill Valentine). Being an avid fan of the games, I was hoping to find at least some reference to Jill's experience in the mansion. I let it slid, I figured I knew her background so no use in wasting time right? Well I will tell you this much, there was NEVER a dull moment in RE:A. This is probably the most action packed movie you will see all year, if not the last 5 years. Each scene finds the protagonists in a new environment with one of the myriad threats presented along the way. I had expected a more action centric movie as compared to the first, but jeez, this movie was so over the top I found it impossible not to enjoy.One of the highlights of Resident Evil was Milla Jovovich, who once again owns the screen. While her character lacks the dialogue and sass she had in the first movie, she partakes in more action scenes than any other character. Her performance was mostly in facial expressions and an intimidation factor highly elevated from the original. Basically, Alice is one badass mother****er, an attitude Milla conveyed to a tee. Sienna Guilleroy was satisfying in her 2-dimensional role as Jill Valentine. She played it cool and her outfit was classic. No one else in the movie really stuck out acting wise, although the little girl was a nice form of continuity with the first.Here was my BIGGEST problem with Resident Evil: Apocalypse: the directing. Alexander Witt must be a schizophrenic (sp?) because this movie felt like it had three different directors. First, there was the MTV style quick cuts which are becoming all too popular in big Hollywood action movies as of late. Also appearing were a couple of cool 90s action movie shots in which all the action is clear from a bitchin angle, like shot behind Alice in the church watching the explosion. Finally the b-horro film director had to get his say, adding (many) effective jump scenes and crooked angles. The guy just couldn't make up his mind; my eyes rolled each time the MTV style was featured, something which happened too much for my taste. I think Paul Anderson would've done a much better job.I am still collecting my thoughts on this movie. It was such a big thing for me, I couldn't possibly decide a solid grade after a single viewing. I did like a lot of what I saw, exclaimed ""holy sh*t"" a lot, and even jumped out of my seat on much more occasions than I was expecting. I'm going to recommend this movie to fans of the original and to all action fans; you should not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent,"Had some good surprises and some good 'little guy' heroes parts. I'd say certainly worth a store rental, but not sure that it's worthy of a full fare price at the theaters. It seemed like it had the ideas right but was just barely missing that edge to make it a really good thriller/ horror flick about gene warfare gone batty. Perhaps they covered more of that in Res1...still seemed like they could have delved into the belly of the beast a bit more...like giving someone on the outside a conscience.I thought the Zombies were a bit lame. Not menacing as a group - though there were certain close-ups that worked well. They just looked like sorta badly made up bicycle accident victims that were poorly directed. What's frightening about an opponent that travels at 1/4 speed? Right up there with dolls that can take down an adult, ya know? When the action did get heated it seemed like there were too many cuts - no flow to the fight scenes.Don't look to close or expect there to be much logic in the plot line. Entertaining, but not as entertaining as Van Helsing on any level.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weak action film,"Resident Evil was an enjoyable Zombie blasting piece of cheese. Now we are faced with the Sequel apocalypse and it really isn't up to scratch. The action sequences may be well constructed and the lighting throughout is perfect, but apart from that its a confused and thin adventure. The story involves a good many Zombies and a rather unimpresssive super villain so you can imagine its pretty predictable. Milla Jovovich reprises her role from the original and to be honest I cant remember anybody elses face. The acting is rather atrocious with Milla Jovovich simply doing a bad Angelina Jolie impression. The rest of the cast are feeble acting talents and that little girl is simply annoying. There are several attempts at jokes throughout the film but none really wash. The worst of them involve Zombie prostitutes. There is nothing scary about the film either. The first had a couple of chilling points but this film, is a wash with mild peril and no gore to speak of. When it comes to these kinds of sequels its always best to save the money and this movie doesn't change that point of fact.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Certainly Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse is the best in the series,"Certainly Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse is the best in the series.

The cast is not bad, and sometimes there is acting. It is a pity that Paul Anderson in the future only ruined the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slightly worse than the previous one,"This movie wasn't bad, but it feels completely irrelevant to the overall story. Honestly, you could summarize it in a single paragraph without missing much. There's barely anything significant that moves the plot forward. Perhaps the film's main focus was to show off Alice's newfound powers with a ""Wow, look how strong she is now"" kind of vibe.The highlight of the movie is Alice fighting Nemesis in hand-to-hand combat as equals, showcasing how she's fully mastering the virus inside her. She's exceptional at both ranged and close-quarters combat, and while it's entertaining to watch, that's really all the film offers.This sequel feels more like a downgrade - not terrible, but far from making any significant progress in the series. It comes across almost like a spin-off that's just there to show cool fights and action sequences without much substance. That being said, Jill Valentine was an excellent addition to the movie. She brought a fresh presence that worked well with the overall atmosphere.In the end, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a decent follow-up with some fun action, but it lacks depth and purpose, making it feel more like filler than a proper continuation.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Uh...this movie sucked pretty badly...,"My brother bought this film for Christmas, and even though I tried watching it with an unbiased opinion, even though I'm a big Resident Evil fan and big video game junkie...let me tell you..this movie sucks. In fact, it REALLY SUCKS. Why the hell does Paul Anderson still have a job? Why was he allowed to have a job? Has he even heard of the words ""character development"" or ""plot""? If you never played the RE game before, and you try to watch this film, you will not know what the blazes is going on. There is NO character development. Zip. Zilch. Nada. There is also no plot. Oh...go rescue the scientist's daughter? The one who reminds of that other little hell spawn Newt from the Alien films? Yeah, I'm developing a REAL emotional attachment there, Paul. Jill Valentine? She looks like the epitome of every 14 year-old's deepest fantasy. To top that off, she has no emotion whatsoever. I'm sure Sienna Guillory was committed to making her on-screen persona as true to life as her video-game companion, a woman that dresses incredibly racy and has no facial expressions...champ job! Also, the fight scenes were incredibly lame. I mean what the hell was that duel between Alice and Nemesis all about? It looked like something out of a bad 70's kung-fu movie. To all the people who said this is a good film, you are in the MINORITY. Look up that word when you have a chance. This movie sucked, plain and simple.Bottom Line: Go to your video store and rent a GOOD zombie movie, like the original and remake versions of Dawn Of The Dead, or anything George Romero made, or even 28 Days Later...the possibilities are endless!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brainless Fun,"Let me preface by saying I enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie and I also enjoyed the game. They were pure scary zombie fun for me, with cool special effects and make-up. If you did not like the first movie, than please don't see the second because it is much more gratuitous in it's violence and gore. Which is just what I expected!So I liked this second film. It's made for those with an extreme short attention span, and the action is beyond quick. There is truly nonstop violence and gore - and I'm not complaining. Occasionally I like those kind of films, and this one delivers.The best part for me is Nemesis - he looks cartoonish but he's pure fun to watch. Again the true star is Jovovich and they make her as cool as ever which I also can't help but like. I thought the make-up and and over-the-top explosions were actually an asset to the film as that is exactly what I had wanted when I went to see it.Want brainless movie fun?

This Movie sucks like Ben Affleck in Pearl Harbor,"When I finished this movie I thought to myself, who made this movie? They totally made Resident Evil into Fat Albert. It seriously had no feeling of the game. I am a HUGE fan of the games. I thought it was cool to have Nemesis in the movie, but they took advantage of it.They forgot about the zombies when they introduced Nemesis. They should really make a movie actually based on one of the games. To me, the first movie was way better. They made Jill Valentine into a bad ass but in the game she is not even like that. I am just glad Uwe Boll didn't do it. Then the movie would have received a 1. I think they should still make movies based on games but they should make them better. Like Mortal Kombat. I liked that movie it actually felt like the game. Thanx for reading this and listening to my opinions.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

About what you would expect.,"Fine, mindless summer entertainment. Never mind that it must have taken two rolls of duct tape to keep the other female lead's top from popping off about three minutes into the flick (and the guns in the garters made it seem like they were trying to so hard to make her Lara Croft it must have been causing them physical pain). The paper-thin plot was just enough to keep you expecting zombies to jump out from every dark spot. The acting was just good enough to not be distracting (with the exception of some ridiculously bad Russian accents - they had a trio of Russian guards there for no reason whatsoever).Anyway, if you show up expecting to see the next Shindler's List, please don't post your whining here because you got exactly what you deserved.

Resident Evil: Rubbishalypse,"I'd like to start by saying, I didn't like the first Resident Evil, but I saw potential in the sequel, as we'd be out of that bunker and into the real world, so i liked it enough to see the sequel. And although i would say I did enjoy this one more, I'd still say it was bad.""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is bad on so many levels, but I'd like to start on the good points and end on a negative (I'm in one of those moods).The best part is that it keeps you entertained, in the first half I was rolling my eyes a bit, thinking that it was terrible, but the second half did wake me up a little bit, there's plenty of action and some edge-of-your-seat moments, however this can be undermined by how daft the story is.That's the only good part really, that it was entertaining and enjoyable, arguably the most important factor for a film as well, however I did watch ""Martyrs"" for the fourth time the other night and is quite a contrast to this. Masterpiece to meh.Now for the bad points :(. There's a lot of them, so get ya cataracts ready! Firstly, the story was a mish mash like in the first one. This whole business of some annoying engilshman finding his daughter was cliché, his accent got on my nerves, as did his daughter's and I'm English myself! There is little to no character development, no one is likable. When someone dies you don't feel anything, in fact you're egging them on to croak! This is where films such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""28 Days Later"" succeed as zombie films. They aren't big budget, high concept films and so they don't just blow the budget on blowing things up for the sake of it. They concentrate on the characters, people who you care about, making them emotionally driven films. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" doesn't build on characters. That's a negative in my book.The directing and editing was appalling as well! I couldn't believe what I was seeing, whenever anyone shoots a zombie the cameras all over the place flicking back and forth so that you completely miss what was on screen! It really is awful on the editing side.The acting was bad, the girls just seemed to be there in the male gaze and times have moved on! I'm a male myself, but I just think it's plain sexist to make an attractive female waltz around wearing little to leave to the imagination! We should get past Mulvey's male gaze! In the end Alice ends up fighting bad guys with a towel wrapped around her! Why not go the full hog and have her shooting people naked! Well, it wouldn't be withing Barthes striptease theory then would it? I know I sound like an old man when I say this (I'm actually 16 :S) but I didn't like the use of CGI, the bit in the church was terrible! And a lot of the time it just thought it was too cool by trying too hard. Let's have a man jump out of a helicopter shooting zombies with cool music in slow motion. It's trying too hard and it just isn't ""cool"". Don't get me wrong, sometimes it was quite ""cool"" but most of the time they tried too hard.In the end ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" plays out more as an action movie rather than a horror film. Leave the zombies to my Romero. There was plenty of shooting, but no blood. I like to see my zombie films gory and scary. Believe or not however, I did actually enjoy some parts. I don't think I'd be the only person who rolled my eyes at some ridiculous B-movie machine gun wielding monster in a leather jacket. Was I?",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

twice,"I hired out a copy of RE:A recently, mainly because it has the German Actor Thomas Kretschmann in it, he was very good in ""Stalingrad"", ""Untergang,"" Downfall in the United States, and he was also in Blade 2, and the Pianist as a German officer, like Stalingrad. he's one of the few European born actors to have a career on the screen in Hollywood, even if he does play villains, b/c he's German? Besides that the film was worth watching, twice, and that's about it. The production team focused on making the film seem as though it could happen in reality. Ironically, the film was shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada during the outbreak of SARS, which caused the entire city to be quarantined, very much like the film ""Raccoon City"". The production team attempted to borrow from the game, as much as possible while still having a plot beyond a simple Duke Nukem style shoot em up. I have not played the game version, and probably still will not play it. Given the current trend for Super-Heroine films with a slightly film Noir feel, it is only a matter of time before BloodRayne gets on the big screen with either Franka Potente or Michelle Rodriguez as Agent Rayne. Back to RE:A do listen to the commentary and explore the special features, it does not make the film worth purchasing, but it does amuse, which is all this film is intended to do.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The good, the bad, the 'Dear God in Heaven, why do my eyes burn?!?!'","Oh yes, my brothers. Prepare yourself for a destructive ride like nothing you've ever experienced before. And I'm not talking about the dizzying, set-destructive fight scenes or the glorious fireballs erupting across Raccoon City. I'm talking about the 3rd Degree burns, the horrible temporary blindness, and reoccurring heartburn this movie has gifted me with.Usually it's just the hard liqueur coursing through my veins that makes me want to hurt cute things, but tonight it's both the booze and the fact that I'm $7.50 less drunk, and an hour and a half older because of 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' You see, when I go into a movie, I expect things. Things like, oh I don't know... plot, coherent scene structure, oh and a side of enjoyment.OK, enough of my random whining. Down to the meat of this rancid corpse of a movie. It was nothing like the original. That can be expected, but when the original formula went so well (styling, action flow, pacing, and the great music), you shouldn't change things. The new action sequences were way too fast, to jumpy and all-in-all just incomprehensible.The zombies were as unpredictable as a crack junkie with nothing but a rubber chicken to his name and the will to use it. They freakin' appeared and disappeared as if Sigfried, Roy, Stephen Hawking and the entire cast of Diff'rent Strokes were on the sidelines, messin' with all of Raccoon City. Maybe I'm just too much of a Romero-Zombie fan, but I think that an entire city block of zombies shouldn't pop in to eat one person and then wander off 'aimlessly' in less than 4 seconds. Oh, and what about the graveyard full of zombies that clawed their way out of the ground in unison? This isn't 'Return of the Living Dead,' man. There was no set up or explanation for that, dude. I thought that in order to become a freakin' zombie, you had to be infected with the T-virus... What, did they claw their way from inside the Hive or something? ""Hey, man, let's get out of this hive thing and go eat some brains. There's the door right there."" ""No dude... I've got a better idea. Hope you brought your shovel."" When they popped up, I half expected Jacko to pop in and lead them in a synchronized dance to the rap stylings of the late, great Vincent Price. OK, I'm running out of room here. One last thing: The fight scene between Nemesis and Milla... Whoa. I didn't know life could hurt this bad. Evil Boss Man: ""We created you two in a lab, man. Isn't that cool? Well, instead of keeping the both of you as an unbeatable pair of killing machines... We're gonna' make you fight each other..."" Milla: (looks to Nemesis and throws a wild stance) ""Now we must kung-fu fight!"" The icing on the freakin' cake was the ""Finish Him"" line from the boss man. I was reaching for my portable arc-welder just to keep my mouth shut long enough so I wouldn't scream out ""Give 'im the pit, Kitana!! What are you waiting for? FORWARD DOWN FORWARD X, CHICK!!""

I was disappointed that a movie with lots of potential was let down by many corny scenes..well at least some comic relief was there..But still I'm expecting a sequel to this movie and wish that was handled better than the first one. Was the director over-excited while filming the action sequences, i bet he wd have got confused while filming them and editing them in such a away that it will be cool only for people who have the capability to visualize lots of things fast.

Excellent Action: 7/10,"Exciting fun ride throughout. It's action with a touch of horror, crafted to its finest. Make no mistake - this is hardly frightening or dramatic. Instead, it is heart-pounding entertainment like a Terminator movie. There's no time to think. You're not even going to be graced with occasional ruminations over Spider Man's ""there's a hero in all of us."" Instead, RE's scene to scene action will spin you through a wild mob of zombies, a perilous graveyard, burning car wrecks, a hopeful helicopter pad, streets of retreating police, a K-9 unit (Yay!), people clawing at a prison city wall, an empty-looking schoolyard,... all the while with guns a'blazin', people a'runnin', and zombies a'chasin'. The film only allows a pause of silence for the classic slow-motion whizzing bullets, a bizarre car crash, and moments before yet another infected creature attacks. Action.If you're the hopelessly logical, then this film is not for you. Your mind will inevitably wander through thoughts like if STARS knew about headshots, why didn't they bother giving the Racoon City Police a hint? Or, hmm...those zombies sure are slow on the ground; funny how they were just racing up the steps a minute ago. Don't bother. Give the brain a two-hour break, sit back, and enjoy.--- My complaints? It's OK for action movies to have an ultra-powerful hero, but why god-like? There's no tension and danger when god's around. Fortunately, the characters have a habit of splitting up.

You ruined Resident evil,"The game is great because you follow a single characters attempt for survival. The character is not a superhero (Alice), but is a human and therefore we relate to her feelings more. The film annoyed me because we follow several characters at once. I would of much preferred to follow the journey of perhaps 2 characters, to bring back the essential survival element.The zombies were unbelievably crap. They clearly targeted this game at young teens (who would rather watch gory, sick and disturbing zombies anyway). Another indication of this was the cheesy rock music and 'kick ass' scenes.If they had actually tried to make this film frigging scary, it would of been so much more successful. And why did they desert the creepy mansions? The settings in the games were so important in making it scary, which was completely ignored in the films.Imagine being in the cinema, watching this bloke/girl walking around in this big twisted mansion, encountering or hearing these foul zombies. Well use your imagination, I'm sure those that have played the game kinda know what i mean.It had potential. It could of been the scariest thing ever. Instead it was a purely made to make money and the director blew the chance to turn a fantastic game into a cool film. He probably didn't even play the game. Idiot.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A script doctor and a different editor away from badazzness...,"So let's face it: the first Resident Evil film was OKAY at best. Mildly entertaining, but ultimately empty and horribly written like all Paul W.S. Anderson films. But it made back its money and then some. Sequel time :PTo be honest, I was expecting this to be the worst sequel since Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (another sequel Anderson handed off). That's NOT the case. If you're not expecting Hamlet, and are just looking for a good popcorn flick, RE: Apocalypse delivers in spades. This is one of the only video game adaptations in recent memory that's managed to take itself seriously and succeed (mostly.) I'm happy to report that this flick isn't for kids...it's an honest to god R rated zombiefest, and the violence, action, AND gore are kicked up a notch beyond Anderson's first yawn of a zombie flick. And ya know, it also has a surprisingly decent sense of humor- something MASSIVELY lacking in the first RE. Mike Epps's one liner as he runs over a zombie policeman is an absolute CLASSIC! (you'll know it when your hear it). Upon closer examination, this massive scale zombie apocalypse owes more to 80's and 90's action adventures than to anything of recent memory...(Milla's got the Sarah Connor bit DOWN PAT, hehe) and it's a good deal of fun. Beautiful lighting and camera work (when the editor isn't busy turning it into quick cut mulch), a BUTTLOAD of action (the best I've seen in recent years), and of course, superhotties. I'm happy to report the soda depletes and popcorn rests easy in my stomach. Lots of fun to be had.So what's wrong with it? More than a few things, naturally. Paul Anderson's script, for one. It's sufficient, I'll give it that (perhaps even moreso than AVP.) But a script doctor could have fixed a few leaks in the plot and dialogue...really polished and delivered on some of those bigger moments. The main grip however, is the EDITING....UGH!!!! I'm actually considering contacting the editor of this film and verbally ripping him a new orifice. The editing managed to butcher 75% of what could have been the best action since the original Matrix. I've never seen so much rapid fire editing in my life, and for a person that appreciates SEEING his action (yes, SEEING is a major part of a movie), this movie steps all over the viewer's attention span. It's like a hypodermic injection of ADD, I swear. Also, the direction at times was amateurish (what can be expected from an AD though), resulting in some awkward moments here and there. More than anything though, I can't get over the hyper-MTV editing. It ruined what could have been the best scifi action film in years. ARE ANY STUDIO EXECS LISTENING?!?! RECUT THE ACTION SEQUENCES, YOU MORONS! YOU HAVE A GEM HERE! OK. I'm relaxed. But seriously...as an editor, it pains me to see this kind of garbage editing. It's a copout. If I could get my hands on the source footage, I'd whip the action back into shape.All in all? It's kinda like a windchill factor- it seems a lot cooler than it really is. First time you see it, it'll feel like a 3 star action flick. Without that initial breeze though...it's gonna drop down several notches upon further viewings. The editing will make it annoying to watch, and the plot/dialogue are gonna start to unravel quicker than Steven Sommers's career post Van Helsing. Do yourself a favor- bring some popcorn, pack up a one hitter, and leave your brain at the door...you'll have a lot of fun, even if you didn't enjoy the first film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really bad!,"Wrong, wrong, wrong!!! Hollywood you are doing it all wrong again. This isn't a proper suspense-movie. New characters are thrown in this movie every minute, they mention there name only once, then they instantly get killed and are already forgotten a second later. The only two characters the viewer could possibly care about are Alice and Jill Valentine. And the Jill character is hardly developed and enters the film without the right introduction.Now every good filmmaker knows that building the suspense during the film will give maximal impact at the end. Obviously these guys don't know. Already the first two minutes I see zombies running down the street killing of people. Cops pumping 200 rounds of ammunition into the zombies bodies and there are explosions everywhere.And what is the deal with all those curse words. Don't they have any idea that kids will watch this trash to. I thought Hollywood made all audience movies these days. A PG-13 rating would give us a movie just as bad as the R rating gave us.But the real problem with this movie is the editing. This is by far the worst editing I have ever seen in a film. The scene at the graveyard where Alice and her mates get harassed by zombies who come out of the ground is horrendous. The fight scene here is about a one-frame cut. The camera constantly moves real fast, and you can't recognize any moves or any of the characters who are executing them. But if you thought that this scene was bad just wait for the fight between the Nemesis and Alice. Boy what were the director, cameraman and editor thinking here. Probably 'I get paid anyway so what the hell.'Admitting that I saw a 'making of' on TV before I went to the theatre, you might think they warned me enough to avoid this porker. But no I was stupid enough to pay 10 hard earned Euros. To keep you from making the same mistake, I will give you some words of advice:This movie is a complete waste of money and time. Roger Ebert wrote: 'I you meet anybody who likes this movie, don't let them date your children'. I couldn't agree more. The first Resident Evil wasn't a masterpiece, but compared to this joke it could have been a multiple Oscar winner. Avoid this one at all cost except if you are contemplating suicide!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
You will jump out of your seat when you watch this movie,"This is a sequel to the 2002 movie where the dead become the living undead in a search for fresh meat. The Umbrella Corp opens their underground research lab 'the hive,' and they unfortunately let the virus escape into Raccoon City. The plague moves rapidly, and soon everyone is infected. Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakens in the Umbrella Corp's lab connected to tubes. They have been experimenting with the virus, and it has mutated inside Alice's body giving her extraordinary powers. Alice leaves the lab and begins to kill the undead as she goes through the city. Alice rescues a group of survivors who are holed-up inside a church. They must leave the church and get out of the city, but the Umbrella Corp has sealed it. Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared Harris), an Umbrella Corporation scientist, will help Alice and the others escape the city if they find his daughter Angie (Sophie Vavaseur). The Umbrella Corporation sends in their secret weapon code-name Nemesis to see how good he is as a weapon. Nemesis wipes out the Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.) team. Nemesis's next target is Alice. The movie will scare you and make you jump out of your seat several times. The action and fight scenes are very well done.

"Watchable Sequel, RE 4 life","Rewritten on: 10.9.06As far as sequels go, RE: Apocalypse does not quite live up to its predecessor but definitely makes the effort to tell a story in an exciting way. I may sound rather ignorant saying this, but I do consider action a rather safe genre. Remember that this is not a horror-film nor really a zombie-film but an action film...with zombies.Where the plot may be lacking it rather well mirrors that of the games. The main-reason I like this movie is the characters. The over-all look of the film is also something I enjoyed though it wasn't quite as impressive as the cold visual appearance of the first film. Musically the film unfortunately did not have the same level of electronic ominous presence as the first.One of my favorite elements in this film is Nememsis. He has a bizarrely demanding presence. I also thought it was kinda cute how they tied up the loose end from the last film with him.While it is nowhere as good as its predecessor the film is definitely watchable, its stunts and visual effects work brilliantly and the movie assures that the viewer will never have a dull moment.Hardcore RE fans however, don't bother.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good portration of Racoon City.,"I felt like the forte of the movie was the environment setting throughout the whole movie, especially while the main characters walk the soulless streets full with zombies. It reminded me of the game much more than the first movie, also letting us to see The Nemesis for the first time, even tho they made him a lot Terminator like, which I did not like. Anyway, a decent movie resembling the games which caught the gaming world by surprise in the late 90's.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a little weaker than the first, but fun","Another efficient little thriller based on the Resident Evil games. This one isn't quite as fast and focused as the last, but it's got a number of very good moments in it that get your attention and it does have a good pace and good performances, to the extent one can be said to perform in a movie that is almost entirely about running around shooting things.Some people complained that the first movie wasn't much like the games. I would say this movie is a little more like the games, at least in places, and I think that's part of the problem. Games are structured in a very meandering way in which you just wander around exploring and fighting and occasionally get a little exposition, which is why I never considered the complaints about the first movie not being enough like the video games valid.Still, I had a good time. I'm giving this movie the same score as the first, even though I didn't think it was quite as good, perhaps just because I'm just in a mellow and generous frame of mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I love it when girls take the lead and can kick just as much ass (maybe even more than the boys) its so awesome!! This movie takes off right after the first one and basically whats happened is the virus has gotten out into Raccon city and our favorite ass-kicking heroine Alice is back with a few new faces including Sienna Guillory who plays Jill Valentine another kick-ass girl, Oded Ferh who plays Carlos Olivera,and Mike Epps who plays L.J.

Please replace Alexander Witt for RE3...,"The story of this movie was good overall. That said, Alexander Witt is NOT a very good movie director, and this is the fall down for this film.Action sequence are filmed in a choppy slow-motion way with angle change every 2 seconds and close-up that are extremely annoying. You get the impression of watching «Blair Witch»...Music-wise, this movie miss Marylin Mason big time. The sound effect and the music in the first RE was real good and tied everything together. Here, in RE2, it's a trown together kind of sound track.... Does not fit with the movie and does not follow the first one.BUT... The actors are doing a great job. Super Alice is still the best but I can see Jill taking more space in RE3 (if it's done!). Nemesis was a real let down, mind controled by Umbrella, he is nothing more than a killing puppet. I fear the same thing will happen to Alice in RE3.All in all, a nice movie. Not better than the first one.

Awfully Cheesy,"I must say that I will not be terribly upset if Paul Anderson never writes another movie so long as I live. The screenplay was incredibly cheesy!!! The characters often explained what was going on through dialogue rather than expressing what was happening through action. It was also very vague about explaining what was going on in the storyline. On the upside, the movie had a good Director of Photography. They did a great job of acheiving the right look and mood of Resident Evil. Also, I thought that the part of Jill Valentine was very well casted, she looked a lot like Jill. However, they really should have gone into why Jill knew so much about the Zombies already and explain her backstory, because it sort of leaves a blank space for non-fans of the game.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Post Modern Masterpiece!  So Well Done!,"This film was fantastic! From a technical level, as good looking a film as I have ever seen. The editing and pacing is breathless. The sound design was coming from everywhere in the theater. Relentless action. As exciting a film experience I've had since 1986's ""Aliens"". But also as much loopy zombie fun as 1985's ""Life Force"". A true new modern classic and dare I say it, One of the best films of 2004. Milla Jovovich running lost in a deserted city as every pay telephone on the street starts to ring is a new classic moment in modern cinema. Man, the majority of the film critics miss the boat on this one.Hope George Romero's up coming ""Land of the Dead"" packs the same kinetic style as this trippy flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a very good movie,"I normally love sequels and love movies based on video games or comics when they are done right. They should be able to get continuing viewers as well as new viewers involved with the story and up to speed quickly then move ahead. This movie does neither of those.The movie starts out pretty good but then it becomes very confusing, very quickly. Characters are introduced with no explanation and often with no rationale. Jill Valentine is a character who seems to have been introduced solely to give another sexy woman a reason to strut around in a very skimpy dress (not that I am complaining). I gathered she was an off duty cop but why would she strap her guns on and put on her boots but not take time to put on a shirt or pants? Wouldn't that shoulder holster start to chafe bare shoulders? How did she know to immediately start shooting zombies in the head? Maybe there was something in the original but I sure don't remember it or remember her character.Alice is yet another example of the movie makers trying to find ways to put her in skimpy outfits then trying to come up with a reason. They did not try very hard to get a reason. She is shown nearly nude or nude more times than is necessary (again, not that I am complaining - though I will admit that her nude is not as good as skimpy clothed in the right clothes..).The camera work also distracted more than added to the movie. I do not understand the overwhelming desire of so many directors to shoot with handhelds and use jerky pictures. It makes me dizzy and almost always just confuses the scene. If confusion were the real desire, maybe it would be okay but when you have paid for lots of special effects, you want the audience to see them I would assume.Overall, the film is mostly a few thoughts that are pieced together with the flimsiest of threads. There is no explanation for why Raccoon City has a wall all the way around it. The end of the movie is an obvious attempt to set up another sequel but that is a sequel I hope is never made if they cannot do a better job than this one.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a must see, for all fans of the game","I love this movie, it might turn out to be a blockbuster hit. but if you are not a fan of the game ""resident evil"", or didn't see part one, you might get it. it's action pack, just like the game, that you might find yourself yelling at the screen. we also see the return of Jill, ( she was missing from resident evil 1, although she is in the first installment of the game) there is a lot of locations, and scenes that will be familiar to gaming fan, which I find refreshing, considering some movies base on video game have little to nothing to do with the game, nor characters ( RE: Final fantasy).Milla Jovovich turn in a stella performance as alice, and newbie Sienna Guillory,( love actually) was great in her role as Jill and Oded Fehr ( mummy, and mummy return) was great as always. so if you want to go see a action movie with great special effect, this is the movie for you.",,Anonymous,Horror
Schlock classic,"I really wasn't expecting this film to be up to much, especially after the godawful atrocity that was the original ""Resident Evil"". However, there was a glimmer of hope on the horizon (some great preview shots of Sienna Guillory as Jill, and a new director onboard), so I went into this with fairly low expectations, hoping for some fairly enjoyable shlock if nothing else. What was so surprising was how well the film delivered on this and became my favourite ""guilty pleasure"" movie of 2004.I won't bore you with another recap of the storyline (it doesn't really matter all that much to be honest, and it's been retreaded a thousand times in other user comments, so check it out there if you must). All you need to know is that is basically tries to shoehorn in the plot of the RE3 game into the foundations set by the end of the first movie, with game stalwarts, Jill, Carlos and Nikolai joining the fray in the fight against the Nemesis and the de rigeur zombie outbreak courtesy of those nice chaps at Umbrella.Looking at this objectively, it's a fairly low-grade piece of entertainment, but somehow it managed to hit pretty much all the right buttons and leave me exiting the cinema with that ""OMFG!"" feeling. The opening scenes with the outbreak and the subsequent last-stand of the defense forces was beautifully handled, and matches the feel of the original RE3 intro very well, with some nice tense firefights to start things off. Action sequences as a whole are well-handled, and the film zips along at such a breakneck pace you're seldom left bored. Milla performs fairly well, as does Oded Fehr as Carlos, but the real standout is relative big-screen newcomer Sienna Guillory as Jill, who perfectly personifies the game chara's ass-kicking persona and steals every single scene she's in with ease. From the first thirty seconds she's on screen, you want more of her, and the film doesn't disappoint. I'm a huge fan of the games, and after seeing this film I simply couldn't imagine anyone else in the role.RE:Apocalypse improves on the original in every way that matters, so much so that I'd recommend you avoid it entirely and skip straight to this (there's a handy recap in the intro anyway). Where the original shied away from the more ""adult"" nature of the games, this is much more full-blooded, with just the right amount of blood and profanity without descending into overkill. Headshots are back, the zombies are meaner, and it takes a lot more than one pesky licker to put these guys at bay.Okay, it's not without it's weaknesses either. Towards the end the fight scenes seem to degrade into quickfire editing without any actual content, just blurs of arms and legs at a hundred cuts per second. Also, there's possibly one denouement too many at the end, no spoilers here but let's just say I'd have ended it at the finale of the chopper scene. But these are fairly small concerns, I'd still recommend it heartily to anyone looking for a good night's no-brainer entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Let down by disappointing action,"I was really looking forward to Resident Evil: Apocalypse after enjoying the first film, but was left a little disappointed.There were definitely positives to this film. I thought the story was decent, and that they've opened up a lot of interesting threads for the sequels. I love the fact that we never really know what's going on with the Umbrella Corporation, and this element of mystery is very appealing.Milla Jovovich was great, and the supporting cast were a little more interesting than the first film I thought (although still quite weak).What really lets this film down is the action! There were so many cuts it was just criminal. I don't think there was more than 2 seconds of continuous footage in any of the action sections. The editor must have been very busy with this one, which was such a disappointment. There were glimpses of some good action, but the choppy cuts just completely ruined it.Overall not a bad movie but the action is pretty poor. Considering this is an action horror, this is pretty unforgivable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Terribly overdone and melodramatic, but superbly uncut fun","Where 'Apocalypse' fails, it delivers. I heard someone suggest a 'PG-13' would be favourable as a marketing suggestion, but thank god, that was shoved aside. This is uncut, and because of that, this delivers. Though this may be pretty terrible by and large, it is huge fun to watch. The action sequences deliver incredibly.With no real motive but to get the zombies and humans fighting, the action starts unrealistically but manages to hold the attention. On occasion, this manages to be cool, though the flaws are so unbelievably obvious it seems credit to the director to even pretend they're not there. To much detail is unnecessary, and will probably prove notice to how bad this is.And though the script is simply silly Mike Epps is great to add comedy to the supposedly 'scary' backup. Some of the characters decisions are so utterly ridiculously unexplained it turns into unintentional comedy. The characters have no motives: they're doing the script, nothing more. Oh well.It still manages to be pretty stylish though, but never scary. It is, despite it's constant violence, hardly gory. But it is violent.Forgotten, overdone, melodramatic, terribly scripted... yet curiously enticing.**/ out of **** (2 and a half out of 4)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Worth the Loonies I spent to see it,"I saw this movie just the other week. this film unlike the first had a high entertainment value. this edition of the resident evil series is filmed in the streets as opposed to the underground Hive in the 1st installment. Some people have made mention of the lack of character development in the movie, however i do not believe that the goal of this film was to have you engrossed in character development. Milla suits her role just fine, especially in her b-day suit. Apocalypse is a very dark movie with more blue lights then sunlight. the action is non-stop, and the black guy provides comic relief. more appealing characters are in the movie and the setting of downtown Toronto leads for endless possibilities to occur.Other then the lack of character development, the other weakness is the camera movement during the fight scenes, sometimes you can't see what the hell is going on. ironically the zombies are not the most evil enemy in the movie, neither is Nemisis, but it is the real humans who run the Umbrella co. these guys are truly hateable who u would love to see die a terrible death. throughout the movie, there is a sense all all impending doom if the characters don't escape. this puts you on the edge of your seat even more. the movie is filled with spectacular stunts and ends with a Bang! hang on to your seats, this will probably be the best big screen/popcorn movie of the year. 100% pure fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Baseless... but worth renting.,"I read many times in several reviews that fans of the game series would love this film. I can't see why. One cannot create that 'survival horror' environment into such films (don't bring '28 days later' in comparison) and thus one, a fan of the games or not, should watch this film keeping no presumptions in mind. I was disappointed in doing that.The prequel had a provocative ending, giving rise to several interesting possible ideas in my mind, thanks to the fact that I'm an avid fan of the games myself. But little could I predict about this noisy, baseless, cheap action extravaganza. There are only characters taken from the game, nothing else. The premise was good, but the results aren't. Introduction of Nemesis could have been avoided, because he is simply wasted here. Most of the action sequences come suddenly, without any link to the story. And to tell the truth, there is no 'story' involved, just an excuse.Milla Jovovich is not as spicy as she was in the first movie. Sienna Guillory as Jill is good. Perhaps she is one thing that perfectly matches with the game. The other characters are not worth mentioning. There are some good moments in the film, like the ending, or the incident in the school, but all over I think the first one was better. The movie leaves a chance for a third part, I am not sure if that's a good thing for us.The bottomline: watching it in a theatre is inadvisable. The DVD should come out soon. Rent and watch.

Tons of digital techniques (Matrix-influenced), the shadow of latest zombies-cinema (Dawn Of The Dead, 28 Days Later), and a story nobody really cares about (or did you?). Everything en RS2 is just an alibi to show us the athletic condition of Miss Jovovich and their ""partners in crime"".It may look entertaining for the first 20 minutes or so, but that's all. However, I didn't expect that much of a video game-based movie, so it hasn't disappointed me. Resident Evil gives you exactly what you expect: action, explosions, blood, and scary creatures.

Don't waste your time on this laughably bad zombie sequel.,"Rating: * (out of *****)The sequel to Resident Evil capitalises on the rebirth of the zombie genre that's been evident this year in the Dawn Of The Dead remake and Shaun Of The Dead. The difference is, this one's purely about blowing the creatures up, with the help of a special being.When I watched this film in the cinema, there was no need for the projectionist to show the end credits. Does that, alone, explain how laughably bad this film was?Well, truth be told, the film has its potentially redeeming facets. Both Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory look really fit (now there's a definite plus for teenage fanboys), and Mike Epps provides very rare comic relief. But these are hardly reasons to buy a cinema ticket for this.Everything in Resident Evil: Apocalypse has Hollywood written all over it. Look at the dodging of bullets and the jumping through windows that most modern films have been making fun of. If I knew for one second that the director and screenwriter weren't taking this seriously, I may have given it an extra star. But nearly all of the laughs I got from this were from laughing at the bad dialogue and the cartoonish violence. And before I forget, the bad guy's German. (Yeah, what's new?)It's fine for the plot to be contrived and make no sense. It's another to be having little or no fun when watching. At least I can claim to have enjoyed parts of the Tuxedo. I suppose that this may be some people's cup of tea, purely for Milla Jovovich and the violence, but in my opinion this is a brain-dead video game masquerading as a film. Not recommended.",,Anonymous,Horror
Level Of Reality.,"First of all, the film is not THAT bad like all the people say, I can't say it was definitely worth to watch but it was definitely watchable. The plot, acting were fine to me, and I thought Sienna Guillory, who is the actor of Jill Valentine was freaking' hot and fit the film just fine!However, like everybody say this film got some problem, which can be concluded as ""level of reality"".The first, the Umbrella Co. shut down the big gate, which is only way to escape, and let all the residents in the Racoon City become zombies, and the government didn't even notice it? AND their cover-up for this massacre is atomic bomb!? They said they would tell the rest of the world it was explosion of the nu-clear plant, but huge amount of the residents who watched freaking zombies were already left, so what about them? capture and kill them too? if it's so, why did Umbrella Co. let the people go through the gate in the first place? that was just ludicrous.And second, about the Nemesis, people made this film should have created him by CG because he looks absolutely stupid. The film was made in 2004 and the Nemesis looks like only he came from 1970's cheap fantasy movie. I don't know what to say, his texture of skin? that was looks so unreal and stupid I just don't understand why they could make very realistic zombies and awesome CG of Lickers, and they made Nemesis's costume which looks like made by 5 years old. that was absolutely one of the main reason a lot of people hate the film.I can't state all of problem because its too many, but like I said in the first paragraph, the movie was not that bad, especially the plot was decent enough to watch.

Night Time in the City,"Milla Jovovich is back as Alice in this pedestrian sequel to a pedestrian original.

You know the drill: lots of killing, outlandish, excessive special effects, lots of high kicks and stand offs between Nemesis and Alice, Diogenes holding a lantern looking for a real actor and coming up short, and the thinnest, most threadbare plot imaginable. I didn't like Resident Evil uno, and I found dos to be void of any of the few merits the first one was able to extol. At least in the first one, director Paul Anderson was able to create some menace and mood - as if a real threat was going on. This director, Alexander Witt, fails to achieve that. This film is loaded with clichés from the opening scene to the very end. I again will say that it has a nice look to it but is void of any, and I mean any, real substance whatsoever.

"Good grief, what a mess...","Even being a huge fan of zombie movies and the first 2 Resident Evil games, I found this film confusing and boring. I really think it is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I found it hard to believe grown adults had produced something so bad.My main problem was the sheer number of characters we are expected to keep track of given their limited screen time, and the fact that the first half of the film skips around all over the place. We had Jill Valentine, her partner (can't remember his name), some reporter woman (cant remember her name either), some stereotypical wise cracking black gangster and a building full of STARS members . Then there was the Umbrella soldiers with European sounding names (3 of them I think), Alice, the Nemesis, The evil boss (complete with bad German accent), The mad professor and his daughter. most of these characters are running around Racoon City, trying to find the mad professors daughter in order to bargain a safe route out (or hinder the efforts of those that are). There is no sort of character development to at least clue us in on their backgrounds or motivation, let alone even care when they get killed!Another problem I had was that the zombies (which should be the main point of the film) seem almost peripheral - there is no sense of horror or dread in any of the zombie scenes.The plot is so rushed and patchy that all we are left with are a collection of clichéd action set-pieces that could have been from any John woo inspired action film from the last few years. The story simply exists as a device to join these set pieces together.Truly appalling. Watch it at your own risk.1 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the worst films I've ever seen.,"I guess it's pretty clear that this film was put together as an action movie - so it's perhaps harsh to criticise other elements of it's shockingly bad execution.

I'm pretty tolerant when watching movies, and will endure even the worst film in order to get the straight story, but RE-Apocalypse is the CLOSEST I've ever come to turning the DVD player off midway through, which is of course, an unspeakable crime, reserved for only the worst films known to man!

"A superb movie, the best movie I have ever seen",You are thrust into the action right away as people fight for survival against the undead in Racoon City and it all looks really good.

Really Resident Evil?,"Wasn't Resident Evil supposed to be a Horror movie? Wheel, the game was/is/will be horror. But this movie is more an action comedy than a horror movie. Why comedy? I tell you why!Before the film really starts, we see Jill Valentine getting her Video game cloths on and heading to the R.P.D. - Many zombies are kept here and nobody knows what to do. except Jill. Bang, Bang, Bang - ""They're infected."" And the poor music in the background....Shame on them. And why does it have to be always hard rock or metal or crap like this.When Mr. Ashford gets informed that he has to leave, you'll hear him speak the first time (""You do what you have to do, I do what I have to do"") - His voice is f***ed up!The man who leads the Umbrella operation is obviously German or Russian or something like that. His English is weird. ""Nemesis is now fully activated"" :D:D:D:DWhen Alice crashes into the church and kills the Lickers...well, just watch the scene. Funny as hell.LJ (the black guy) - He is really funny. Not unwanted funny like the scenes before. I mean really funny. Good acting. But in the wrong movie. Better put him in the sequel of ""Soulplane"".At the end, Nemesis and Alice fight together...The rest is good action and a bit of Resident Evil. I think, Christophe Gans should have done this movie.Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mixed genre,"A contiuation of resident evil. This movie captures the complete sci-fi horror complex with a unique style. Milla Jovovich is superb at playing the aggravated, distressed, as* kicking heroine. Teaming up with Sienna Guillory (Jill Valentine), they make a thrilling duo fighting against the virus threat. The stunts were mind blowing as Alice (Jovovich)crashes through a church window dodging every piece of glass in a slalom.With funny, outgoing characters such as L.J (Mike epps) Bringing humour to this oustounding sequel. With quotes such as 'My sh!t is custom' and 'Ive got this bitch', Resident evil includes at least one aspect of every genre (accept romance)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
More like the games but still somewhat iffy...,"Following on directly from the first film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse follows Alice as she tries to escape Raccoon City along with a group of Raccoon police and Umbrella's own special forces. However, a spanner is thrown in the works when they are asked to rescue the T-Virus creator's daughter, in exchange for safe passage out of the city. This proves to be easier said than done, as the city is rapidly filling with zombies, mutants and a new terrifying and seemigly unstoppable foe... not to mention the city will soon be nuked to erase all evidence of Umbrella's mis-deeds. Best get a move on!Despite it's obvious low budget, the original Resi film was watchable but, at least in terms of faithfulness, left a lot to be desired. They obviously took some of that feedback on board, as this film seems to pretty much be Resident Evil 3: Nemesis - the movie. We have Jill (played pretty well by Sienna Guillory), Carlos and Nicholai... along with a bunch of new characters that share some common traits with game characters. And of course Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, although her character doesn't have as much focus here as in the first film (you can tell this wasn't directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, although he did write it).This film clearly had a bigger budget than the first, with huge city locations, some pretty epic stunts, CGI that isn't completely terrible... even the Nemesis looks half decent (it certainly looks a lot better than in the recent Resi 3 Remake game, that's for sure!) Sadly, the dialogue and performances seem a bit stiff and... b-movie esq, for lack of a better term - although that does kinda fit with the tone. Even the story isn't half bad despite basically just being Escape From New York but worse.I remember critics and fans hating this even more than the first, but personally I think it's alright. It focuses more on being like the games, actually features some familiar characters and enemies, has some entertaining action scenes and effects that are a definite step above its predecessor. Oh, and a bunch of zombie kids rip apart a young woman. You don't see that every day!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A sad, poorly made sequel","They had a hit with the first movie! It was actually good! But did they decided to build off the tension and intrigue: No! RE2 proved to be another in the long line of tired sequels, a killshot to the head and to the hearts of those that liked the original. Maybe Paul W.S. Anderson should have directed this movie (of then again, maybe not: AVP stunk). The energy, the darkness, the distinct flavor of the first film were no where to be seen, for instead, they were replaced with random action sequences and useless dialogue.That was just one of the many downfalls of the entire movie. It was all action, no suspense. It was completely contradictory to the first movie, even if it is following the games scripts more closely than ever. However, cannibalization of a lot of good ideas shouldn't be set aside to help bolster the street cred with those that play the game. In all, this movie needed a major overhaul, and no one seems to be up to the task to keep this franchise moving.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has more of the spirit of the video game than did the first movie.,"This movie was a bit of a surprise to me. I thought it would be a pretty decent flick worthy of passing some time, instead I find one of the better action movies I have seen all year. I am one of the few who liked the first one, but this one is much better. I just thought it was more like the game itself without taking itself to seriously or getting to campy. You are thrust into the action right away as people fight for survival against the undead in Racoon City and it all looks really good. Most impressive is the lack of rampant cgi effects or cgi monsters. I do believe the one's with the tongues are the only totally cgi monsters in the movie. The nemesis monster is done completely with makeup it seems and makes me think maybe they could have made a Hulk using the same technique.

"Oooooooooooooooh, it's just sooooooooooo bad...","This film is just so poor, and what is disappointing is that it had so much potential. Like many other commentators have noted, it is true that the cinematography is good - it has been executed expensively by people who know what they are doing. The script not only lets the film own, but is the hole that the the film falls ungracefully into. The movie makers obviously wanted a sequel, but had no idea of how to create one along the imaginative lines of the first film. What happens to the sequel, is that it falls into 'Dawn of the Dead' territory, and desperately does not know how to get out of it, bar repeating various scenes from the first film in mildly varying forms. The continuing masculinsation of the female characters is tedious - although the fight scenes are great. Milla continuously pops up at perfectly the right time with the key equipment - be it a motorbike or a cigarette. This film is so far removed from reality that it disappears up its own removed rear, without ever truly capturing the imagination which a fantasy feature simply has to do.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great action horror film,this movie was great but it had it's confusing parts. the director did a great job of mixing horror with a lot of action. the Actors in this movie had a hard time delivering their thought process whenever there was talking (there wasn't much talking)they said there line with bad acting . that was the only flaw in this spectacular movie. in the next movie (if they make one)I think they should cast better actors. the script was also written good the story line was great I think they should show more Zombies though. the little girl in the movie did a spectacular job she was cute and smart.

The best of the lot,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse takes place immediately after the escape from the Red Queen in the previous movie. Alice wakes up on a medical bed attached to IV bags and electrodes - she's obviously been experimented on by the Umbrella Corp.Alice finds herself in the abandoned streets of Racoon City as shown by the conveniently blowing newspapers that inform us the T virus infection made its way out of the mansion and there's an outbreak in Racoon city.At the same time, Jill Valentine is preparing to leave the city. The conveniently placed newspaper clippings of her failed mission to alert the world of what Umbrella was doing in the mansion are shown. She is now a disgraced former S. T. A. R. S officer with a whole lot of ""I told you so!"" to be said for another day. Her escape is delayed indefinitely by the barriers Umbrella Corp has erected around the contaminated city.The movie borrows heavily from the video games (RE: 1, 2, 3, and Code Veronica) which is why the low rating from myself and many other reviewers. As far as a stand-alone movie, it's just okay. If you align the game and movie timelines, Alice is treking through Racoon city around the time Leon and Claire are uncovering the G-Virus in RPD and where Jill (instead of Alice) should be be playing cat and mouse with Nemesis.If you're a fan of the video games (or plan to play the old ones or the new remakes) and loved playing as Chris, Jill, Leon and Claire, you'll cringe as you watch Alice take credit for everything that they ever did in the games while the movie versions of your favorite characters (and villains) are sacrificed to prop Alice up as the undisputed champion of Racoon City.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not as bad as people say.,"Well after reading about 35,000 complaints about Resident Evil Apocalypse I was expecting a total stinker just as I was expecting going into the first movie but thankfully yet again I was wrong and really enjoyed it.It's no masterpiece but then again no Zombie flick is imo (even the original Dawn of the Dead is a very over rated movie imo) and what were the critics expecting?, an Oscar winner or something?, come on be real it's a Zombie flick not a period drama.If You are looking for a deep plot with awesome character development then stay away, if on the other hand You are just looking for 90 minutes of pure action then this is the movie for You, My only real complaint was the ending with annoyed Me for some reason but other then that a solid 7/10 from Me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A let down.,"I have played several Resident Evil games, Resident evil 4 being my favorite. This movie was entertaining to watch because it was so non stop, but it did absolutely no justice to the games. The atmosphere, acting and cinematics don't compare.They took you away from the resident evil franchise, gave you a female character and several other people you don't know, and just made an action movie, with poor acting for the most part.Resident Evil has always been, At least two main characters who are usually in abandoned castles, trains, or houses with a slow pace and a strong suspense that something could burst out, come alive or swarm you in groups. Where as this movie was basically, too many extra's who were given make up to look like they are gray, with maybe a hole in there head, or a gash....who just flail around as they slowly walk up to you. I did not like how they portrayed the undead. They were too human, and too cheesy.I think they could of really done a better job at making this movie a scary thriller like resident evil was supposed to be, rather then a non stop action movie with too many swear words. I feel like Hollywood got ahold of a great franchise and turned into something cheap and overdone.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Now that left me wanting more and more is what I got out of Resident evil Apocalypse. And at the end of that movie it left me wanting more why because I had so many ?s at the end and i hope some of u will tell me like since Matt(Nemesis) also has the T-Virus in him can he still be alive next ? Why did Alice doctor let her go at the end?. Now as for you fans who want to see Chris, Claire, Wesker etc. just wait until the next film.

"My name is Alice, and I remember Everything!","The Ubrella Crporation created a virus that reactivates dead cells and brings people to life or what you could call life. Alice(Milla Jovivich) finds herself in a hospital of a Raccon City which has been totally infected with the virus and is the habitat for an army of walking zombies. She must fight with others to escape not only the zombies but The Umbrella Corporation's cover up and a super-zombie called Nemesis.Althoug the movie was not very well made, it was still very entertaining. I really didn't see any artistic value with the way it was made but I did find the story(based from the games) very interesting and the special effects to be very well done. I don't understand how zombies could come out of the ground when you have to be bitten to be infected though! The Nemesis also looked extremely lame and I could do without the corny writing but besides all of those really cheesy parts, the movie would have earned a recommendation. Overall, just take the movie for what it is and you could very well be entertained or you could just be disappointed. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I do not recommend this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not my Raccoon City,"Out of the six Paul W S Anderson films this was the one that felt the closest to the video games. In particular it takes elements from Resident Evil 3 and as a fan it's neat to see things like Jill Valentine wearing her video game outfit and especially Nemesis who looks pretty darn cool. Despite these little fan service bits the movie suffers cuz all of the attention is given to Alice who is such an uninteresting character with zero personality. She survives anything, hardly ever gets hurt, and worst of all steals Jill's spotlight. Jill always needs saving from her and being a fan of the games it really annoys me. All for the sake of Anderson to make his wife look good. Nemesis is pretty underutilized as well. In the games he's an intimidating stalker and a horrifying threat but here he's a mindless puppet that isn't scary at the slightest & watching him get beat up by Alice is laughable. There's also just little to no Horror in the movie and your just left watching uninteresting action scenes with atrocious editing, repetitive shots of glass breaking and concrete collapsing, & supporting characters that survive almost anything thrown at them. While you do feel the bigger scale and larger budget in this compared to the last movie it doesn't matter. It's still a generic action flick that doesn't represent anything I like about the games at all. I used to say this was the best out of the six films but after a rewatch wow was I wrong!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great Sequel, Get the German Version if you can","Great sequel, though i did only watch the German extended edition i got over ebay. Extended by over 5 min's, what a difference, more gore, more consistent editing, better story flow. It continues the story from the first film and sets up brilliantly for Resident Evil: Extinction. The atmosphere is spot on, its moody, there is so much action it is almost exhausting. In either case i enjoyed the German version much better than the western cut. There is not much really left to say, only that this trilogy is going strait onto the cult shelf, its all about chicks, guns and monsters. It doesn't waste its time trying to patronize us, just simple fun with likable characters, and great lines. Pure trash fun.Recommendation: Get the German cut!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another for the pantheon,"There is a long list of movies that rode on the back of successful computer games, all the way to the box office. This is a pantheon that includes such illustrios titles as ""Wing Commander"", ""Super Mario Bros."" and ""Street Fighter"". This movie suits this list perfectly. I saw the first Resident Evil movie and was delighted to see a film credible in it's own right. I also saw the second... and that's about all I can say.Ignoring the game link, there was also the hurdle of the first film. Not many sequels successfully stand next to their parent, and this one was inferior by a long shot. Fans of the game will enjoy this film. It has acceptable portions of zombies, bullets, women and comedy. It is short of plot, but we don't all look for that in zombie movies now do we! For those that demand credibility, the power of the mighty umbrella corperation is ridiculous to the max and, having consulted my associate, a specialist in the field of combat, the payload of the nuclear weapon used was nowhere near man enough to clear the city!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun.,"Picking up immediately where Resident Evil left off, Apocalypse sees Umbrella Corporation employee turned zombie ass-kicker Alice (Milla Jovovich) waking up to discover that the 'T-Virus', which can reanimate dead cells, has spread from underground facility The Hive to the surface, transforming much of the population of Raccoon City into ravenous zombies. With the quarantined city scheduled to be nuked, Alice's only chance for survival is to join a small group of survivors in a mission to locate the daughter of a top Umbrella scientist, a job made even harder with Project Nemesis, a massive mutant toting a mini-gun, loose on the streets...Sometimes it's so hard to find the right words to convey my feelings about a film that it takes me as long to write my review as it took to watch the bloody thing in the first place. That's one reason why I love the Resident Evil films: they're such pure, mindless, popcorn entertainment that I don't have to struggle when it comes to typing up my thoughts. In Apocalypse, there's tons of zombies, which equals fun. There's Milla Jovovich looking fit and shooting big guns, which equals fun, plus we get a second babe in the form of sexy cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory). And there's mutants and blood and explosions and kung fu and zombie dogs and scary stuff and cool effects, all of which means even more fun.See... that was easy peasy—no need for me to even use the thesaurus!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The infection is spreading,"The first movie Resident Evil (2002) that was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson was ok, though it did have potential to be good, it got too generic and needed to improve on its effects, performances, and editing; I am a fan of the Resident Evil games, so with the sequel I hoped it would improve on the previous film, especially since this sequel is not directed by Paul W. S. Anderson like the first. The second movie Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) has ok performances, occasionally some subtle uses of CGI with the practical effects, it is more action focused, and it has editing issues and cinematography problems when it came to the action scenes; this did have some entertaining moments occasionally and unintentionally funny moments because they look over the top in a way, but I will also say this film has similarities to the third game in the series, up to having the mutant antagonist Nemesis involved that I did think was not that badly handled when he is shown.We have Alice again played ok by Milla Jovovich who must get out of Raccoon City before Umbrella decides to bomb it because of the T-Virus spreading around from person to person, but she does not have that much of a character arc or any sort of feeling that she has developed as a character; she went from person now knowing about herself, to her being like a strong action hero fighting off zombies and mutated creatures. A main character from the games put into this film is Jill Valentine played ok by Sienna Guillory, who looks like the character from the games but is not given much characterization that explains who she is, why she works for S. T. A. R. S, and why she decides to work with Alice on escaping; she was introduced out of nowhere, and she does not do much, except save Alice when she gets into a situation. Lastly, any other characters are disposable people to get killed off by zombies or mutated monsters, except for two other characters that are from the third game that help Alice, but they do not do much and give little to nothing that could make you care about them.The antagonist is mainly the Umbrella Corporation with them quarantining Raccoon City and only saving scientists or researchers they need because of the T-Virus infection spreading around, but also sending the creature Nemesis to take down Alice or any other S. T. A. R. S soldiers that are left in Raccoon City; what was at least impressive was Nemesis and how he acted when attacking the main characters, with him being close to how he acts in the game and looking cool with the practical effects. The action sequences can be a little over the top with there being cuts that can occasionally make it hard to tell what is currently happening, along with mediocre CGI for the mutated monsters, despite some like Nemesis having practical effects; there are also quite a few times where the editing could have been better, moments that needed to be given more details, and lots of flashbacks to the previous film that can get annoying by how much they repeat themselves.The sequel Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) has ok performances, occasional uses of CGI with the practical effects, it is more action focused, and it had editing issues and cinematography problems when it came to the action scenes; this did have some entertaining moments occasionally and unintentionally funny moments because they look over the top in a way, but you might like the similarities it has to the third game in the series, like the use of Nemesis in the film. Lastly, I will say that I did like the references to the third game in this, but it did not feel like a horror survival movie anymore, much like the fifth and sixth installment in the video game series, unlike the first film where it did try to keep that focus; if you enjoyed the first film, then you might like this one, because this movie is not good, but it is not necessarily terrible either.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better then the 1st,"Resident Evil 2 was much better then the 1st(I think). There is a better plot, a lot more fighting, and there was some funny parts in the movie too. Unlike the 1st movie there is more things happening and more people. If you play the game you will see some scenes from the game are in the movie, you might like that, I know I do. I think they spent more time making the 2nd movie for the resident evil game fans, but even if you don't play the games I think you will enjoy the movie and understand what is happening more then the 1st movie. I didn't get to see the movie in theaters but I wish I did. I love the resident evil games, and I think this movie was great.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It all should have ended here,The first Resident Evil movie was controversial for a number of reasons mostly due to the game franchises fans not happy with the direction taken for the movie myself included but seeing how it made money at the box office a sequel was inevitable fans had hope for it with the cast of characters being closer to the game but sadly it wasted them and kept the new character Alice as the movies focus.Sadly this movie went further away from what fans wanted so much so that after this movie the rest would end up being made up of action and zombie movie tropes with Resident Evil as it's name but that's as close as they ever got to the game franchise.Admittedly this is a good action movie with zombies and it is action packed and gun heavy with plenty of blood and fight scenes which does entertain for an hour and a half.I recommend watching this movie if your in the mood to turn your brain off for a while and watch a good action movie that doesn't require to much thought just a fun hour and a half of guns and zombies.,5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Complete rip-off 28 days later,The only difference between the two films is that one is pretty awful the other is amazing. One thing that is bad about it is that it's one of those poor American horror films. For instance they use guns all the time instead of DIY Tools. The DIY tools are much more realistic. One stupid thing is that one on one fights with zombies. Good in video games but stupid in films. I always taught the games story line was stupid. And thanks to the film it proved that i am right. What's the point on having a single company turning an entire city into a zombie infested city without the government knowing. Also it's a company with an entire army. The story also makes no sense.Besides a few scenes to give you a little thrill nothing in the film will stop you from yawning and complaining. Hopefully future films off video games would be better or unleast the cast and crew can make a better attempt.,3.0,Anonymous,Horror

I was just as equally shocked as my friends when we saw the THREE lickers rather than the one. And that Milla did all of her own stunts.......wow.

"Oh, good lord...  The first movie had a lot of entertainment value (even if it completely ignored the source material), but ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" just stinks.","You ever been in a friendship or relationship that has so many ups and downs, you can barely think straight? One day everything will be fine, but the next, there's some sort of meltdown and it all goes hell... before suddenly getting better again?That's what the ""Resident Evil"" film franchise feels like to me. It's like a volatile relationship with someone that I probably shouldn't be spending my time with, but I like them just enough for some strange reason that I continue to spend time with them. Much as this film franchise keeps alternating between dopey fun (the first and third entries, for example) and outright awfulness (This entry...), yet even though I know I could be doing much better things with my time, I keep watching.""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a 2004 follow-up to Paul W.S. Anderson's first film. Directed by Alexander Witt (from a script by Anderson, who also produces), this is a prime example of a heinously messy, amateurish sequel that suffers not only a wonky script, but truly amateurish direction that just makes everything fall flat.We follow Alice (Milla Jovovovich) once again, this time as she navigates the quarantined and zombie-infested Raccoon City with a motley crew of survivors, attempting to find the daughter of a top-Umbrella employee, as part of a barter agreement to be set free. However, unbeknownst to her, a new threat in the form of the ""Nemesis Program"" has been unleashed onto the city, and she will have to face this horrible creature (as well as corrupt Umbrella employees) in order to survive.The acting this time is a lot more mixed. Some of the performances are great. Jovovich is a blast as Alice, this time with almost super- human powers following the experiments done on her. She's a fun female action-hero and is one of the strengths of the thus-far five entries in the series. Oded Fehr is also a blast as a comrade of Alice, a commando formerly employed by Umbrella. And Jared Harris as an Umbrella employee whose daughter is lost in the city gives probably the best performance in a good parental figure. However, performances by the likes of Sienna Guillory (as a disgraced police officer named Jill Valentine), Mike Epps (as a wise-cracking comic-relief character) and Thomas Kretschmann (as one of the most generic villains I've ever seen) all give pretty bland performances and drag the film down quite a bit.The production and the script are where the film really falls apart, though. And they are very, very messy.First of all, I need to address Alexander Witt's direction. Witt has proved himself a very capable, talented man, generally as a second- unit cinematography and second-unit director. However, here he displays that his experience did not help him obtain a strong enough visual sensibility to help a major production. (At least at the time of its release) This film is one of the most identity-less, bland productions I've ever seen. I'd even dare to say soulless at times. Frankly, Witt's aesthetic choices (in everything from composition to style) feel amateur, akin more to a first-year film student than an experienced filmmaker. I don't know how, but he managed to take so many cool action set-pieces and some interesting creatures, and make them boring. Outside of one cool sequence where the ""Nemesis"" creature is awakened in a Frankenstein-like laboratory, the direction just sort of... sucked.The script by Anderson is also very problematic. From a rushed pace, to a very poor structure, this is essentially a film about people walking from point A to point B over and over again, with some goofy action and bad dialog thrown in. I also take issue with how the film treated its one major minority character, turning him into a stereotypical one- liner spouting goof-ball.The rest of the production is decidedly a lot worse this time around as well. The production design is far less inspired, and even laugh-out loud hysterical at times. (Pay attention to the plethora of computer monitors throughout the film- they are the fakest-looking and most over- the-top blatant displays I've ever seen.) The costume design is also quite cheesy, making the characters look like Saturday-morning cartoons. And the music is a lot less polished this time as well.Honestly, after being surprised by how enjoyable the first film was (even though it completely changed the story from the source material video-game, which I found upsetting) in a ""dumb fun"" kind of way, I was shocked by how horribly this film compared.This is just a stinker all around. It's poorly directed, poorly written and despite having a few good performances, generally poorly acted. Thankfully, I am pleased to report that the third film managed to up the ante and more than made up for this mess.But as it stands, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" gets a poor 3 out of 10 from me. The only reason to watch it is if you want to watch the entire series without missing an entry.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Anderson resumes failure,"After the first Resident Evil film, it was inevitable because of the low budget that a sequel was in the works. Whereas the first film was a prequel of sorts to the first game, this one is (I think) a story about Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Again, departing from the story of the games is an interesting choice, but when the source material is just so much better than what Anderson can come up with, you have to ask, why does he continue to do it? He can't write a script, or direct an action scene without stealing from something else - the way he keeps himself original is through terrible editing, I guess.I give Anderson credit for at least putting some characters from the games onto the big screen. These include Jill, Carlos, Nicholai, the Nemesis himself, and a few others. Though of course, these characters are the same in name only, and stray far from what they were and should have been. Jill is now cocky and soulless, who can't take care of herself without the return of Alice, aka superwoman. Carlos does nothing important, and Nicholai, who was such a badass villain in the games, dies pathetically to a single zombie dog. Ugh.Now, onto the Nemesis itself. The monster looked pretty good and I was happy that they kept him mostly as an elaborate costume rather than CGI. In the games, Nemesis was nearly invincible, only dying after sustaining massive damage from a giant RAIL GUN. (SPOILERS -Needless to say, Nemesis doesn't live up to his real strength, and dies in the worst fight sequence I have ever seen. You can guess who it's against.) END OF SPOILERS.The film is badly paced, badly written, badly directed, badly acted, and it laughs in the face of all fans of the series. Paul W.S. Anderson resumes his failure, and he will continue to do so. As long as the people in charge at Hollywood fail to realize that a video game turned to film has real potential, other than slightly-better-than B-grade cinema, the video game movie will be forever wasted.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent action - horror sequel in the Resident Evil franchise almost good as the original Apocalypse kicks ass,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) is an excellent sequel that follows the roots to the first film. This one and the first one are the best films in the franchise, it is not so good as the first one but it is close. I love this film to death and it is the last good film that I love. This time Resident Evil is directed by Alexander Witt and this was his first film he directed and his only film he ever directed. He works more on Camera and Electrical Department before he went and directed this movie. I can say Alexander Witt was awesome, he knew what was he doing and he did a really excellent job directing this movie and he directed perfectly. Milla Jovovich did return as fierce Alice and she is fabulous as always and Paul W.S. Anderson also returned as writer and producer. We have now a new cast Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr and no one returns from the first movie. Apocalypse I love as a guilty pleasure because there were some things I did like about it: The girl who played Jill (Sienna Guillory) was pretty good with what she had to do. Oded Fehr as Carlos was awesome probably the biggest bad ass in the film series. Also the zombies in the city were cool because it reminded me of Resident evil 2.Plot: Alice (Milla Jovovich), who struggles to find out what the Umbrella corporation has done to her as she leads survivors in an escape from a Raccoon City infested with the dead. Directed by Alexander Witt, the film features several characters from the video game series including Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), Nicholai Ginovaeff (Zack Ward), and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr).After narrowly escaping the horrors of the underground Hive facility, Alice (Milla Jovovich) is quickly thrust back into a war raging above ground between the living and the Undead. As the city is locked down under quarantine, Alice joins a small band of elite soldiers, led by Valentine (Sienna Guillory, Love, Actually) and Carlos (Oded Fehr, The Mummy Returns), enlisted to rescue the missing daughter of Dr. Ashford, the creator of the mutating T-virus. Its a heart-pounding race against time as the group faces off against hordes of blood- thirsty zombies, stealthy Lickers, mutant canines and the most sinister foe yet. Written and produced by the visionary director of Resident Evil, Paul W. S. Anderson (Alien Vs. Predator) and directed by Alexander Witt, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a superior sci-fi suspense sequel.All three Resident Evils are wonderful pieces of work. They aren't just like every other zombie movie, they really have plots. And they are really suspenseful and just plain awesome. Rocket launchers, guns, zombies, villains trying to destroy the world. This movie rocks so much its not funny the action is just perfect not to gory not to weak its a perfect movie, this film is a great zombie film with exceptional graphics and fight scenes. There isn't many trilogy's that can say they didn't become over rated and less entertaining as time went on, this trilogy and film is amazing.Resident Evil is a thrill ride with some really intense action. Fans of the game should like the costuming work done with Jill and how the monster makeup made the Nemesis look just like he does in the game. It had some of the best action I've seen in a long time.The most in this film that I love is the dark scenes, the film is filmed at night, which I love that. I love the action in the church when Jill Valentine and a group of survivors are fighting those giant zombie monsters and Alice jumps with a motorcycle trough the window and she drove's right in front of zombie monster, jumps off the motorcycle makes a back flip from off of the motorcycle and landed, posted up and pulled out her guns and blew the zombie and the motorcycle up! If that isn't a bad ass or what. I don't know what to tell you. Alice raises her dual two-tone Heckler & Koch MP5Ks and fires them on a zombie monster.I love that this film is a rescue mission on a little girl Angie Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur) which Alice with Jill and Carols is coming to school to rescue her and escape from Raccoon City before it is destroyed by a nuclear missile.Overall: I love this film to death, It is almost as good as the first one, just the original will always be the best one! 10 out of 10 this excellent action horror sequel gets, I had a lot of fun and a blast watching this film. I love the bad ass song The End of Heartache by Killswitch Engage and Vermillion by Slipknot those two movies kicks ass.Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a 2004 apocalyptic fiction action horror film directed by Alexander Witt, from a screenplay written by producer Paul W.

"Too fast, too furious","As time goes by, everyone becomes wiser, or at least the saying says so. These sequels, always such intricate matters! Especially if you think you're a smart bastard and don't bother appreciating the work of others, who actually facilitated you're ""creation"". Most will probably agree that Anderson is a terrible screenwriter, lacking creativity and originality. But when you give up on a film to wreck another, I can't but ask myself how that looks in the eyes of a professional. It doesn't look too good in my eyes. Actually it proves lack of interest. I guess all have their priorities, don't they?RE:Apocalypse is a film like few other: little to nothing dialogue, zero character development, endless fight scenes. But is that really bad? It definitely isn't great, however, if you take into account the intention of the creators, you have to agree it fulfills its purposes, but not its potential. I regret that no one bothered to add some depth to the movie because it would've rocked, especially if there had been some time to breathe without hearing a few bullets swoop by. A bit of mystery and a bit of suspense, would've made this here creation a real killer. Sadly, though, P.A doesn't bother that much and simply relies on other people and films to do the job for him.SpoilerWhat is even worse, is the way he chose to prepare us for a sequel. I have to admit, it was one of the worst endings I've ever seen and it didn't even nearly equal the cliff hanger of the first film. All that I can hope is that Anderson will somehow miraculously step down from this project, or at least leave the script to someone else. If I were to compare Apocalypse with the original title, I'd be content to say it's a teeny, tiny bit better. RE loses because of the little details which make the movie rather annoying at a second viewing. Actually, it loses because it's very sloppy.End of SpoilerThen there is also this Alexander Witt. He does a decent job for a first timer, but he just doesn't succeed in blowing you away. His attitude towards the audience doesn't involve the viewer enough, and even though this is where that screen writing issue pops up, I still believe Witt could've done more about it. I also think I have to agree with some other people: there's little to no visual eye candy, something Anderson is pretty good at.I feel I have the obligation to mention that I am a big fan of the games (which kind of means I'm totally against this ""Resident Evil"" that has reached the cinema screens). I've even read Romero's script (which isn't that great, but I suppose it would've summoned in one film that which Anderson spreads over this possible trilogy - or whatever it will end up being), expecting RE:Apocalypse to be just more than its predecessor was. I suppose I should be satisfied, but I'm only half satisfied, because it could've been so much more! But, hey, couldn't life have always been so much more?",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining,"A Movie that entertains . . .? Isn't that what a movie is suppose to do? Well that's exactly what this movie does. Others may complain about the lack of award winning movie elements, but I feel this movie was not designed to win awards. Honestly there are not too many elements in this movie to comment on, though it does not fail to entertain an audience. For people who have already turned their back on this movie from the critical over analyses by the other viewers, keep this in mind. The movie comes from the world of gaming. In games impossible chain of events tend to happen out of the blue. This movie is not limited to ""real world"" applications, so crazy things will and can happen. Just sit back and enjoy this movie. It's not based on real events, at least not from the ""real world"", it's based on the ""gaming world"".

Greatest Horror/Action Flick of the modern era....,">>Greatest Horror/Action Flick of the modern era....<<I just saw RE Apocalypse and let me tell you that if you give this movie anything below 10 you should be shot or mutated into someone better.

Milla is a goddess playing Alice and the decision to include game-based characters such as Jill, Carlos and Nicholai couldn't have come at a better time. All action freaks Resident Evil fans or not will be overwhelmed. The movie's music is better than the first one plus there's NEMESIS and he looks exactlty like the mean MF from the game.....This movie rocks from beginning to end.

Lack of substance.,"I can understand why people like this movie, but the thing is that it carries a name, they should respect the genre or name it otherwise. Resident evil should be survival horror, intense in gore, and despair situations. Instead they turned into a Hollywood megaproduction Action saturated movie. Resident evil main characters should be always on the run saving each bullet as if it was the last one, with the only goal in their minds is to survive the blood thirsty zombies. No Miniguns, no Roketlauncher, no genetically engeneered hero, no choppers, no atomic bombs! Or...at least....don't call it Resident Evil.... because it insults its fans.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The perfect movie.,"Resident evil apocalypse is an excellent movie. it contains enough violence and at the same time it has that little humor that a good movie needs, for example a malicious comments. Resident evil apocalypse is an excellent and well made mix between a really scary horror movie and an exploding action movie. Resident evil apocalypse is the goddamn best movie i've ever seen, it's the perfect movie for a video gaming teenager like me:D. The only negative whit this movie is that all the characters from the games isn't correctly made, like Nicholai, he is a large man shooting zombies whit a soft-air gun. One more of the bad things, is that this movie aren't based directly on any of the games, instead the director has taken some pieces from 2 or 3 resident evil games.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
pretty dang bad,"Others have already explained how bad the plot is. But on top of that, I seem to be one of the few people who thought the acting was absolutely horrible. Sure, the actors had lousy dialog to work with, but Sienna Guillory was particularly unbelievable as a badass cop, not just from the delivery of her lines, but in her body language and poise. I don't mind having hot chicks play action leads, but at least make it believable, like Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton or even Milla Jovovich. Actresses who know how to carry themselves with poise and confidence and make every single motion with a high degree of intent behind it. Guillory gives us the mannerisms and trappings of a tough cop without any of the inner presence, and she moves around like a little girl pretending to be a cop. Fail. Complete fail. Just because a woman is pretty and has a nice rack doesn't mean they can act. Oded Fehr didn't fare much better, coming across as way over-the-top. But Epps was decent, as was the little girl.The plot was also a joke. The original made good use of multiple players with motives that were hard to discern. This one makes it pretty clear off the bat who the good guys and bad guys were, and what the goal would be, and events unfold fairly predictably without much of anything new.The action sequences were okay, albeit nothing special or memorable. Nowhere near as good as ""The Matrix"" but not as bad as, say, Joel Schumacher films. And the climactic fight was a bit problematic, given that your bad guy is wearing this ridiculously bulky costume that is clearly not suited for hand-to-hand combat. And the characters aren't developed well enough for you to feel much suspense during any of the action sequences, but they're entertaining enough.All in all, not worth paying money for. Not even for a rental.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great sequel! Way more action packed!,"The sequel to ""Resident Evil"" has come! It makes you be more in the movie than watching it. Milla Jovovich returns as the deadly Alice. She's even more enhanced. Which is some I liked for her to be. This movie didn't bore me at all. And that freak that Alice fought is the cross of ""Alien"" and Chatter Cenobite of ""Hellraiser"". There was nothing to miss, even though some of the scenes moved faster than usual. However, the more you watch the movie, the better you'll understand it. The credit goes to Capcom games most definitely. They always make great games, and Screen Gems didn't let the audience down either. There were more zombies than usual but that doesn't matter, it made the movie more interesting. And I liked the part where Alice nearly put the guy's eye out with his own pen. Shows the meaning, ""Get the point?"" The news teams were complete idiots, they're giving praise to the evil corporation, and not the journalist. For shame. They'll learn the hard way next time, if there is one. If I was in this movie, I would join Alice, armed to the teeth! Rating 4 out of 5 stars!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I still say they should've sticked with Romero's version,"I've seen this recently and I must say it was a bit of an improvement but not that good, because was too much action and face-paced thriller than horror, at least they put a few lickers, and perhaps the only things I found worthwhile in this movie is that it had some characters similar to the ones in the game, it had Nemesis(except he also had a chain-gun), and it had Jill Valentinte, Carlos, Nikolai, but Ashford was a bit different. And at least Nemesis was almost the same as he was in the game, but my complaints are also that Nemesis was a bit of the hero at the end and that other STARS members like Chris, Barry, Rebecca, Brad, and Wesker weren't in it, and there weren't enough monsters and they didn't deliver enough fear. But overall it was okay as a sequel but lousy as an adaption and horror.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
RESIDENT PRAISE!,Resident Evil Apocalypse rocks! Anyone walking out of this film and not saying that had no business watching the movie to begin with. The dynamite sequel features Milla Jovovich in a kick ass performance as Alice. Picking up right where the last one left off. Racoon City has been destroyed by the T virus and it'sa effects as it was mistakenly let loose from the contaminated Hive. The now infamous Umbrella Corporation quarantines the city locking a few survivors and it's deadly inhabitants with them. Amongst the characters are game idols Jill valentine played brilliantly by Sienna Guilroy and The mummy's Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera. The film also features the Nemesis. if you have no idea of what I'm referring too you have no business seeing this film.

Major Disappointment,"RESIDENT EVIL was an engrossing, intelligent thriller with a solid story and likable characters. Lots of twists and turns, with the story constantly taking you to unexpected places and some really dynamic and original special efx. Much more than I ever expected from a movie based on a video game.R.E. APOCALYPSE is an exercise in style over substance. More proof that digital editing plus digital efx equal digitized boredom. I watched this with two friends, and twenty minutes into it we all concluded that it was a huge pointless waste of time.Horror films are not expected to be Shakespearean drama at its best, but you should care about the characters enough to get sucked into their journey and enjoy a vicarious, and hopefully cathartic, experience for your money.This movie was EMPTY. Soulless. The action scenes were a mess of crappy swoosh pans. There was not one drop of genuine suspense or danger. Zero character development, except for the embarrassingly racist ""Uncle Buckwheat"" character who proclaims (with anachronistic glee) at one point, ""I usually drive a Cadillac.""Rarely have I been so fully and painfully aware of wasting precious minutes of my life as when sitting through this snoozefest, hopefully waiting for it to show some semblance of intelligent story development. Instead I got lame snatches of ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Mortal Kombat"" (right down to Lara Croft's costume, weaponry and personal style), ""Robocop"", and other movies and comic book imagery.The visual efx were flashy and impressive. Sadly, the only thing they conveyed was how much money must have been wasted on this garbage. I can only hope that the lovely and talented Ms. Jovovich banked some serious scratch for whoring herself in this turkey.The only positive which came from watching this movie is that we all agreed to take note of who wrote and directed it, to studiously avoid their efforts in the future.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
S.T.A.R.S ( only five sadly.),"Compared to the first film, Apocalpse does nothing different except taking the viewers out onto the streets of Racoon city. Fans of the video games will be glad at the arrival of Jill Valentine and even more so the creation of nemesis. But taking these two characters sway from it all, Apocalspe still gives fans plenty of moments to click their fingers and remember exactly where they have seen the current action on screen before in the games. Sadly though, as a follow up, proceeding with the immediate events after the pandemic outbreak being released from the hive, the film just doesn't do enough to bring you into the story.The problems mirror the ones in the first film: Poor characters, terrible action and a loutish villain. Likewise with the lasers and opening of the first, Apocalypse can boast at delivering some cool moments like the havoc being caused from Nemesis' turret, ( just hearing him grunt the words 'stars' was enough to make me smile)and the chaos surrounding the city; yes, Racoon city makes for a better atmosphere than the underground hive.So overall, the film suffers the same problems that can be found in the first film. It gives fans nostalgic glasses to wear but to sum things up, it's an average film for the ones who want to watch an horror/action",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Insanely awesome movie!,"I thought this movie was amazing and entertaining. It had non-stop action and a few cool twists to it.

I couldn't disagree more. I was obsessed with all of the Resident Evil games and thought they put a great amount of the game into the movie. I would have been so bored sitting through both Resident Evil flicks knowing everything that was going to happen next. That would not be very entertaining or interesting.

"OK, but disappointing (NO SERIOUS SPOILERS)","As a huge fan of the Resident Evil video-game series, i expected a lot out of the first resident evil movie, of course, only to be disappointed. The story didn't have anything to do with resident evil except from the mansion, and the lab (which was certainly not a complex named ""the hive"".) The zombie action was extremely boring, and the zombies just looked stupid, and as the gamers know, resident evil is all about the zombies. OK, since this is APOCALYPSE i wont talk more about the original movie..OK. After being terribly disappointed by this movie, which i would say suits best for young teens who just told their friends that they just saw a great movie named Scream3, i heard rumors of a new resident evil movie. I searched google for pictures and found a couple of Jill Valentine. I found a few, and was not disappointed. Se looked just like the main character of the Resident Evil3: Nemesis video game. Soon i saw the trailer, COOL!! Nemesis!! i had to watch this movie. I couldn't wait: Raccoon city, zombie hordes, Jill Valentine, NEMESIS... wow, yet another disappointment. This movie WORKS as a brainless action horror, but if you are a huge fan of the games, or have seen a few monster-action movies before, you are gonna be really bored. Nemesis is like a doll, except from when hes walking. He ain't got a personality and is only using a ""minigun"" until a cheesy fighting scene at the end, with Alice, yes! Alice! Later in the movie she enters the scene matrix style and saves Jill and the others, shooting like a terminator. Shes obviously now a super-lady, programmed to ruin the movie, kick Jill aside and use kicks and macho comments instead of guns. Pretty much ruining the movie. Now its not even survival anymore, its catwoman in a zombie infested city, kicking every things ass... And the bad-guy from the game, is now a good guy, with the same name.. like that matters to fans.But as i mentioned, if u haven't enjoyed the games, you will probably survive(unless you used up the last of your money on this). But if you want GOOD zombie action without wall-running and super-kicks, you should watch George Romeros zombie series, and the remake of dawn of the dead...yes i know i write cheesy ;) but I'm not English",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I Really Liked This Movie ... Not the Best, But I Liked It","Go figure, I first saw this movie on 9 / 11 ... what an omen ! Anyway, onto the movie. Here is what I liked about this movie. There are some elements to the game that they put into the movie, such as the shootout during the outbreak between the Raccoon City Police Department and the U.B.C.S. vs the Zombies. It was a great action sequence. The scares were pretty good. Mike Epps made the movie more fun for me ! My favorite line ""Shoulda told' me you got bit, mother f***er. I'm all hanging with you and s**t !"" Here's what I didn't like about the movie. When it comes to characters, the movie really didn't follow the game much. For instance, (now I am not being a sexist) Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) isn't supposed to be all that tough, Carlos Oliviera (Oded Fehr) is supposed to be a cocky ""ladies' man,"" Nicholai (Zack Ward) is supposed to be a bad guy, and Nemesis (coulda been bigger) was specifically created to destroy only S.T.A.R.S. members. And speaking of S.T.A.R.S., there aren't supposed to be THAT many S.T.A.R.S. members.Overall, this was a really great film (can't wait for Part 3), though it would've been better if they followed the game a little more.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bit of a step down from the original but still good,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse has excellent action and more characters from Capcom's beloved franchise. This action is bigger, the girls are hotter, and they are more zombies.

String music just doesn't go well with killing zombies I guess.Besides the music(which I can get past), bad acting(which I can also get past), it's a damn good mindless action flick.

What DID happen to originality?,"Resident Evil Apocalypse is many things. Pick a profanity, the choice is yours.But from a more 'creative' perspective, Resident Evil Apocalypse is the sequel to a film based on a video game franchise based on a film series based on monsters based on humans.But that's what we like to see - rehashes, only bigger and louder and faster, with bigger explosions, louder guns, and faster women.I could rant all day about video-game-to-screen conversions, the most fundamental point being: in video game, the narrative is merely a backdrop for the gameplay - whereas in film, the narrative is paramount.The story of Resident Evil was cack, but we didn't really take note at the time, busy as we were blatting our way through legions of the undead and solving stupid puzzles. On the silver screen however, the story is right out there in all it's nonsensical glory, only now the characters are sassy clichés, the zombies badly framed, and the once-terrifying Nemesis a rubbery, scary-as-kittens parody of his former self.Still, you can't go wrong with a huge budget and an already-eager fanbase of teenage boys waiting to spend their cash to see zombies, tits and explosions.But then, if there was no money in bastardising good ideas until every shred of intelligence and originality has been sucked away, we wouldn't have fast food.Or Big Brother.",,Anonymous,Horror
Alexander Witt's Filmography Doesn't Lie,"Don't believe the hype. The facts don't lie-- this movie was buried in September for a reason, and with an Assistant Cinematographer at the helm of a multi-million dollar franchise. What could go wrong?I won't go into it here-- click on his name-- but there is nothing in this guy's past to indicate he has even marginal directing talent, let alone something with a budget this size. And it shows. ""RE:A"" lacks character, any kind of dramatic arc, and the action sequences are shot in that choppy, what-just-happened blur that I thought went out with the Reagan Administration. Also on that list, the Wacky Token Minority. Where ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a step forward for the action horror movie, ""RE:A"" is a leap backward of such incredible crap-taking proportions, it should have its own Olympic Event.I've never met Alexander Witt, but based on this pile of garbage he actually thinks is a film, we can deduce the following facts about him: ONE, he has never directed a film before. Even without the IMDb, this is obvious. Characters show up and disappear for no reason, the living AND the dead disappear from the story after the first 10 minutes, 30-second side-scenes of cross-town events are inserted at random into a large action sequence, and every sequence in the movie is shot from 12 angles and edited together at random. TWO, he has no taste in music. I'm no huge Slipknot fan, but at least it fit the first movie. The sequel is all ""dramatic score"" and only two metal songs to speak of, both of which kind of lay there like old people having sex. Yawn. Oh, and THREE... Alexander Witt must REALLY be Paul Anderson's b*tch, or else how did Anderson look at this film, as a producer, and say ""Oh yes, we should release THAT.""In all likelihood, Anderson cranked out this script in a weekend, then threw it at Witt on his way out the door to make the Only-Slightly-Better (which isn't saying much) ""Alien vs. Predator."" The only difference I can pinpoint is that ""AvP"" had production values. In ""RE:A,"" everyone who isn't the Production Designer should erase this one from their resume, and fast.Where the first film had a plot, a purpose (escape the Hive, find out who Alice is), this film just kind of wanders, like the living dead. I think 30 minutes in, some characters are told to rescue a girl from the city, but that takes all of 5 minutes, then we're back to wandering again. For your action fix, rent anything else. For your Milla fix, well... she's naked in this one, but not as naked as the first one. Which sums it up, really-- if your sequel is worse than the original, the franchise dies. So now Anderson has killed the Predator, Alien, AND Resident Evil franchises in less than a month. Dude, maybe it's time you made up with the guy who wrote Mortal Kombat Part One?",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much Better,"OK, I'm not going to explain the story add any spoilers or whatever.Resident Evil is the massive game Franchise from ""Capcom"" It is one of my personal favourites, i was so excited hearing about the first Resident Evil movie.When i saw it i felt that the whole Resident Evil Franchise got screwed over. I know Game to movie tie in suck, i mean look at Super Mario Bros or Tomb Raider, those films suck. Of course the first Resident Evil movie had to follow this bi-law It's like the unwritten rule of Game to Movie But Resident Evil:Apocalypse really did appeal. I thought it was awesome and Did Resident Evil justice My favourite Characters from Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, had made it onto the big screen playing alongside the ever so hot Milla Jovovich.The story is actually getting interesting but the shame is that most of the main characters from the games arn't in it. Albert Wesker is most important but he is still absent. Hopefully Afterlife will bring more of the characters from the Game world into the Movie.I do think it deserves a 10 because of the awesome stunts and action, also the costume design on the Nemesis was right on the money. Hopefully afterlife will prove even better than Apocalypse.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watching the first movie 'Resident Evil' is a pre-requisite for watching 'Apocalypse',"Outline (The brief story is for those who haven't seen the first movie, without which they might not understand the second one):In the end of the first movie Resident Evil, we see only two survivors out of the T-virus tragedy at Umbrella Corporation's hi-tech 'Hive' research facility, one of them being Alice (Milla Jovovich). For those who have not seen the first movie, the Hive is the secret underground research facility of the Umbrella Corporation, the world's most powerful commercial organization that specializes in high-end genetic research and mutation. The two survivors have been tested and have been genetically altered to gain superhuman strengths. One of them is Alice, and the other is an armed killing machine, the Nemesis.By the beginning of Apocalypse, we see that the dangerous T-virus that induces people become Zombies is out in the open in Raccoon city. The umbrella corporation loses no time in unlawfully quarantining people and leaving them to the mercy of the T-virus that spreads through zombie bites. What follows then, is a series of mindless adventures.Comment:The movie seems to be a desperate attempt to revive the success of the movie Resident Evil that had raked in a hundred million dollars. A viewer who has previously not seen the first movie would rather feel like running away from the movie hall in the middle of the movie. However, as the movie approaches the end, it gains a little better sense.One of the most seemingly realistic things projected by the film include the dangers of overtly powerful corporations that can threaten the future lives of people with their genetic experiments.Milla Jovovich's performance is purely action oriented and is exponentially better than the earlier movie (thanks to her character 'Alice' becoming genetically powerful). The other performances are just around the average performance that you would see in a usual Hollywood sci-fi thriller.Bottomline: If possible, please leave your brains outside the theatre entrance. Else, you might become a T-virus carrier Zombie ;)",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice action pack but less interesting,"Similar in science-fiction and horror themes as the first RE, but soooo much better in a way as an action-genre movie. It reminds the first part, but develops the plot a bit farther now that everybody's out (including the disease so remarkable in these movies) from the Umbrella corp. labs.Otherways, a lot in common with other classic scifi-action movies like the Terminator or/and zombie-movie genre. The only thing I dislike in this movie is the way it is directed, like the director had lost his slightest ""sense"" of filming. The scenes are developed quite typically and the story goes on slightly boringly (but there's enough action to make us forget the details) and keep the film interesting.Compared to the first part of series this is somewhat less notorious from its main plot but more ""entertaining"" in a way like most follow ups. Naturally, that's because it is probably made with more money, more effects, more acting, in short, more of everything. Fundamental question still remains... will anybody walk out from the theater alive?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It may be based on a video game...,"but I find the story line exciting. The sequel begins with a little back story of how the first movie ended. Then it picks up with Alice walking the streets of Raccoon City. I don't follow the video game, so I don't know if this film is following the game story line, but I liked where the movie headed. Alice meets up with another hot bad *ss chick, Jill Valentine, and some STARS members as they fight to find a way out. They are given an offer by one of the Umbrella's scientists- if they find his daughter, they can escape on a helicopter.During this time, Umbrella activates the Nemesis project, who turned out to be really cool. Nemesis is the guy from the last movie who's been turned into a monster. The monster makeup looked cool. My only complaint is the movie needed more Nemesis footage. The two fights between him and Alice were kick *ss. Who knew Milla could be so tough! And the ending just left me wanting more. Now there needs to be a third sequel. I want to know what happens when an evolutionized Alice leaves the city.FINAL VERDICT: If you like horror and especially if you liked the first film, then this is a must see. It may be a B-type film, but it's fast paced, and has cool fights, and a bad guy you want to hate.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
What I think,"Resident Evil: ApocalypsePicking up where resident evil left off.Alice wakes up in the raccoon city hospital only to find the city is infected by the T- Virus. The city in chaos by the legions of undead residents of raccoon city, infected by the T- virus from the hive.she forms a loose relationship with some of the survivors and battle's her way through the city trying to locate a Doctors daughter who's hiding in the school. in exchange he will get them out of the city alive. also finding herself has been ""enhanced"" to be stronger, faster, smarter and with more endurance. She also confronts the monster ""nemesis"" developed by the umbrella corporation. I thought the movie was very action packed but felt that they would get a clue as to how to drive off the undead by shooting them in the head instead of the body. The movie, to me, showed just how bad and ruthless the umbrella corporation was really is by shutting the gate and then nuking the city to cover all trace and having a cover story about a nuclear reactor melt down. I believe there will be another movie in the works to see what further enhancements the umbrella corporation has made to Alice.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disjointed and boring,"I quite liked the first RE-movie (6/10). I also enjoyed playing Resident Evil 3 upon which this movie seems to be very loosely based. So, while I didn't expect very much (because of the reviews) I still expected to be at least somewhat entertained for 90 minutes. Problem is: I wasn't entertained for 90 minutes. I wasn't entertained at all.The main problem with the movie is that there are no characters. Sure, there are people in the movie, but we don't get to know them. They're just there, running about, shooting zombies, acting cool. I couldn't care less about what happened to these mannequins. Another problem is the disjointed narrative. It takes way to long to get the main ""characters"" together, and before they manage to do that the movie is very boring. This is because, as I said, it feels disjointed and episodic. Yet another problem is the acting. Most of these people couldn't act to save their lives.It's probably unfair to compare it to other recent zombie flicks such as 28 Days Later, Shaun of the Dead and the remake of Dawn of the Dead. All of these movies I like a lot. But they're not only action movies, they are as much dramas or comedies with a bit of horror in the mix. I guess the only movie I can fairly compare RE: Apocalypse to is the first RE movie. The comparison is sure to be unfavourable. As mentioned, I actually liked that movie.RE: Apocalypse is sadly a disjointed and boring mess. (2/10)",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hands down, the WORST movie EVER","I think I'm about three fifths of the way through this discombobulated, mish-mash of a sci-fi/schlock jock escapade into stupidity...I have seriously never seen a movie make such little sense. Perhaps because it's based on a video game that itself is based on some bizarre pedophiliac, masturbatory death orgy of zombies and sex. My favorite part is how every time a zombie is shown, the action gets all slo-mo to disguise the fact that the makeup team behind this movie couldn't paint a clown for a 6 year olds birthday party. Dialogue: Total crap Action: Let's just blow everything up and show computers Story line: Is there one? That 'Nemesis' thing is the only halfway decent character in the whole pile of horse pucky... and he's hotter than that disgustingly putrid looking girl who carries around her camera hoping for an Emmy. And how stereotypical for the ""funny urban black guy"" to be all zany and wacky and, somehow, still humorous in light of an entire city gone retarded. But hey, I blame it all on my wonderful fiancé who thought that RE and RE2 for $25 at Best buy was a DEAL...she likes 'strong female characters.' Yes they are strong. But speaking of stereotypical, why are they also beautiful, big breasted and white? This movie sucks.",,Anonymous,Horror
"oh, wow, an action flick, except there is no flick","This is so absurd in terms of storyline or sense or continuity that I am not even gonna bother...I had to induce myself into such an aggressive suspense of disbelief that I almost believed I had already left the theatre...There is nothing, absolutely nothing here except for some action for action's sake- and as such it gets tired really fast. Action is hard to top off or even climax if the story itself does not support it, and here a story/plot is the ultimate luxury, while the action starts way too soon. Spare me the grief and BUILD UP to it! I can be tricked into watching pointless ""sci-fi"" action, but this is just insulting...Milla Jovovich is always fun to watch, especially in a very short skirt and especially that violent, but I was seriously fidgeting after 20min and that big turd of the ""NEmesis"" monster was just a waste of good makeup.what a bummer- I kinda dug the first one, I had big hopes for the possibilities...",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deserves nothing less...,"This movie deserves nothing less than a 10. The people who put this movie together, took the Resident Evil saga (in which every game was an fragment), and created a complete movie. In every single Resident Evil game, you were automatically the underdog. The camera angles weren't very likable, and neither was the hand to hand combat or the voice acting. Example of bad voice acting: ""Jill...don't open that door!""  Resident Evil Director's cut. In the first movie, Alice was a force to be reckoned with, and now the undead have a more evolved Alice to deal with. The first movie took place in the Hive, whereas this movie takes place in many parts of Raccoon City. All in all, I'd prefer this movie over the first one any day. If you love the undead from the RE games, if you love fear, or if you just love Milla Jovovich, I recommend that you check this movie out!

'Evil' indeed,"What an appropriate subtitle, as the fact that this movie debuted at #1 and made almost $24 million in its first weekend of release is a sure sign that the end of the world is near.

Anderson jettisoned it for an unoriginal and boring zombie-fest. Anderson isn't directing this time, but he still holds a stake in this terrible film as the screenwriter.

Perfectly tailored to the movies.,"The movie was excellent. I hear a lot of newbies saying that the movies wee stupid and that they were nothing like the game. I disagree in full. In fact, I bet the ones who complained are the ones who always talk through the movie and toss popcorn like immature children.I have every Resident Evil book, every Resident Evil game, every Resident Evil action figure. I know RE inside and out. How can people say the first movie was irrelevant, when the books and games never went that far back, yet?CAPCOM has made it clear that they wanted to focus on what the books and games did not show, giving us a more broad view of what happened instead of making us relive games we already had beaten 5 times each.Somebody said something about ""What is up with he gargoyles coming to life?"" Well, friend, that was a ""Licker"" from RE2 and RE3. It was merely sitting next to gargoyles.Jill on th side? Why do people complain of this? There are many points of view in RE. Jill was not the only person to experience it. We know her entire story, why the heck do we want to see the same stuff, this time in a movie? This movie showed the behind the scenes, so to speak. It showed what the games could not fill in; without getting to be too long of a game.To those who dog the movie, you are ignorant of the games and the storyline. The story and time lines were perfect in both movies. Think I am full of it? Then read the books and play the games in sequence according to time line of the story.....you will then see that the movies were objective, efficient, and perfectly tailored.One more thing: Umbrella was trying to create the perfect biological weapon. They did it when they altered Alice, and failed with Nemesis. He is strong, but can not blend in with a crowd if need be.",,Anonymous,Horror

More resident than resident evil :-P,"1st off ... whats wrong with people ... if you don't like watching zombiemovie then DON'T WATCH A ZOMBIEMOVIE!!!Anyway - This is an absolute masterpiece. It truly brings on the spirit from the hardcore, badass marines vs. the apparently innocent and pureharded civilians - which of course (without spoiling it too much for u :-P) dosn't exactly turn out that way. The whole idea of making a movie over the games, sounded like a - well really hard thing to do well when they started making the first movie - and there was a few things in the first movie that could have made it better but hay ... as long as the sequel is basically the next chapter (almost like in LotR), its OK. Great movie.Now to the bad stuff... 1. The nemesis monster is not the greatest monster ever... i personally thought it to be a little too ... well ... small and stiff in its movement. - but its minigun makes up for most of that :-P but seriously ... that suit looks like its borrowed from some 90's B-horror-movie's props. 2. ...

Twice as good as the first!  2 out of 10!,"Mike Epps as LJ is very entertaining and his character provides a few moments of comic relief. His presence in this movie thus makes it twice as good as the first one and sadly is the only good thing I can say about it.What's not to like? Plenty. Many of the action sequences seem to have been directed by Michael Bay on a big dose of meth and a six-pack of Jolt. The result: a mostly indistinguishable blur of images. My guess is that this technique negates the need for having to spend money on the required special effects needed for clear footage.Meanwhile, in regards to the acting, I would have wished that some of the scenes were blurred out so I could not see such pathetic performances. I wonder if the actors involved were ever surprised that an emotionless take was deemed acceptable by the director. So sad that in a zombie movie, the undead emote more than most of the main characters.Finally, the matter that annoys me most about this film is the completely ridiculous scenes defying all logic. For example, people out run bullets and missiles, deliver more damage with punches and kicks than massive gunfire, and in one scene are even saved from an explosion by a PLASTIC garbage bin!An almost complete waste of time and an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Zombie films are not exactly my forte, but I find them very interesting, nonetheless. It combines the genres of triller and action to make a interesting film. The cast includes Milla Jovovich, returning from the first film, as Alice. She creates a sense of feminine power with her character. Sienna Guillory appears as Jill Valentine, from the game series. Oded Fehr plays Carlos Olivera, also from the game series. I believe that if you enjoyed the first Resident Evil, then you will like this one as well.

Boring.

Certainly not bargain basement awful like ""House of the Dead"" but not even a decent rental for a Tuesday night at home. Better to rent a George A.

Worst Horror Movie EVER,"This ""film"" officially supplants House of the Dead as the worst horror movie of all time. Sure, there has been some low-budget, straight-to-video junk, but I cut them some slack due to budgetary constraints. RE2 obviously has no shortage of money, so it has no excuse for being such a piece of garbage.Those who think Paul Anderson is such a hack director should realize how competent he is comparing the first RE to this hatchet job by first-time director Alexander Witt. He has no clue how to direct action, as everything is done with quick cuts and shaky camera work, as if he doesn't want us to see how bad the action is (he succeeds). He also obviously is no zombie fan, as he takes the soul out of the movie by minimizing the zombie content in favor of guns, kung fu, and every other bad Hollywood action movie cliché out there. What zombie footage there is is nullified by bad camera work and an ultra-annoying slow motion/strobing effect that obscures the zombies. Plus, there isn't even a lot of gore. The general story idea is OK, but it takes some stupid turns, and the dialogue sounds like it was written by a 8 year old. People who make movies based on video games need to realize that the two genres are different; movies require more substance than games. I've haven't played the RE games much, so I don't know how much is included in this movie, but you don't have to throw in every over-the-top element from the game. I don't care about zombie dogs (I overlooked it in the first movie) or all of the characters, who are in fact ridiculous caricatures (what's with the Lara Croft chick?). And who wants to see a zombie with a rocket launcher??? I love zombie movies, but I'd prefer to have no more made than to have any more like this one. I wouldn't even call it a zombie movie (barely even a horror movie); just a standard action movie made for 10 year olds with ADD that just happens to have some zombies.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

It really seemed like the story was just some filler that they had to put in between dead people attacking Milla. The plot holes were glaring and worst of all the acting was terrible, especially Sienna Guillory who just was not believable in her role.

WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!?!?!?!,"My basic thoughts on the film are as follows: As a zombie/action movie, it's decent and entertaining; however, it still lacks severely when compared to the awesome Dawn of the Dead remake.

If you like the Resident Evil games, please try and forget that, since it will only make you hurt. Severely. Characters are completely changed. Why even keep the names?

Worth the Money,"I work at a movie theater. I usually don't pay for movies unless they only get them at the Galleria (such as foreign or independent films). Well due to recent theater openings in our area, we didn't get RE2. I payed to see the movie because not only did I enjoy the first one, but I love the games. The movie was awesome. Sure, the acting was less than wonderful with some of the characters but I mean Jill was in the movie! An Ashford was in the movie! All of the monsters were in the movie (minus the hunters and spiders). Nemesis even said his line from the game! There were so many connections to the game, that I was blown away. This movie is definitely for the gamers!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Way overlong zombie fighting, weak scripting and acting, and other problems make this sequel fail","I have never played any ""Resident Evil"" games, and didn't see the first movie based on the video game series until last month, over seven years after its theatrical run. I could see how cheesy and immature it was, but with all the adrenaline, it still left me reasonably satisfied. That might not be the case if I were to watch it again, but much of it was a guilty pleasure for me with one viewing. If I hadn't liked it at all, I obviously wouldn't have bothered watching this sequel, but I was impressed enough with the original to be interested in seeing this one. However, I was not too pleased with ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", as I found it not only cheesy, but also not very entertaining. It basically has all the flaws of its predecessor plus more.After Alice wakes up in the hospital and leaves the building, she discovers that the virus which infected the people in the Hive (Umbrella Corporation's underground facility), and turned them into flesh-eating zombies, has escaped and made it to the surface! Raccoon City is now flooded with these monsters, the kind Alice was previously forced to fight underground, and the city has been closed off under quarantine! Alice has been used for genetic experimentation, and as a result, she has new superpowers, which will come in handy in this infected city. A group of Umbrella soldiers who have not yet been infected find themselves having to take on many members of the Undead and creatures known as Lickers, and just as it looks hopeless during a battle in the church, Alice comes and rescues them. She joins the group, and all of them must fight many enemies in order to have any chance of escaping Raccoon City!This sequel contains some unimpressive acting and dialogue, as well as underdeveloped characters. All the same can be said about its predecessor, but here, it gets worse. So much of the film seems like one big monster fighting scene, and watching it reminded me a lot of ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" in that regard. Even though I haven't seen that film in a few years, I clearly remember that a lot of it, probably most of it, is like one big scene! Now, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" isn't quite as horribly tedious as that ""Speed"" sequel (I think I've yet to see another film that actually is), but the non-stop monster fighting here is still a big problem. It doesn't help that this first ""Resident Evil"" sequel skips around too fast, and the slow motion effects, among other things, are also cheesy. At least I found a lot of adrenaline in the first film, which is more than I can say about ""Apocalypse"". There are SOME exciting moments here, but certainly not enough.The first installment in the ""Resident Evil"" movie franchise is hated by many, and I could understand why after seeing it, but since I found that movie so exciting, I couldn't join the haters. When I rented this sequel, I thought maybe it would be a lot like its predecessor, cheesy but certainly not boring, but it turns out I was wrong. It could have easily turned out to be slightly inferior to the original, as sequels usually are, but to me, it turned out to be worse than that. For most of the film, I think I had a puzzled look on my face. Basically, I think the main problems here are that 2004's ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is even more ridiculous than its 2002 predecessor, and it's certainly not very well written. Also, unlike the first film, Paul W.S. Anderson wrote this one but didn't direct it, and Alexander Witt's direction just might have been another factor. Mindless action is common in modern blockbusters, and it can sometimes be entertaining, but unfortunately, this is one of the cases where it's not.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
If in to Resident Evil... Check this movie out!,"I have never been a huge fan of the games. I have tried playing many of them but the controls and camera angles always turned me away. Isaw the first movie and I enjoyed it, but didn't think that it was all that great. I got asked at the last minute to see the second one and I said ""Why not"".Let me tell you that I was glad I went. The movie has been given bad reviews from critics, but they only like movies that no one has ever heard of.(Not all of them) Apocalypse is one of the most fun movies I have seen in a while. After not being that impressed by Spidy 2 I thought the year was pretty much over for good movies. Now I am not saying that Resident Evil 2 is an awesome movie but it had everything that would want in a horror/action movie. The movie made me jump once or twice, it was funny as hell, the action was awesome, and it had some hot chicks in it. Sienna Guillory was really good and I think see is really attractive with that color hair. I thought the cast did a great job and the story was good enough for that type of movie. It made me want go and buy the games just so I can play them. I can get used to the cameras and controls. Anyway, definitely go check this movie out. You will not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Man, what a crapfest","I'm a big fan of the resident evil games, and i feel that a great injustice has been done to them by both movies. I saw the first. it sucked. I saw the previews for the sequel and thought ""this looks kind of cool."" nope. it wasn't. The acting was terrible, the storyline was incredibly dumb, the fight scenes were OK, but not impressive enough to pull this movie out of its cesspool. The only cool part was the black guy. he was funny, they should've just made it a comedy starring him. That would've been the tits.

Great Movie,"I thought this movie was great. Everything about it was great, really. The acting was superb, given the video game dialog they had to say. The directing was amazing when you think of how the last story ended off they didn't spin it into a whole different direction. The summary stayed true to the video game for the most part and the C.G.I didn't look fake or stupid. I thought it was great how they introduced Jill Valentine though I was upset they didn't say more about why she was suspended from the S.T.A.R.S in the first place. All in all I would encourage anyone to go and see this movie. It had action and gore and a great story that unfolds as you watch and enjoy.",,Anonymous,Horror
Pure crap,"After seeing the movie i can't really find one single good thing about. Well, except that Milla is pretty sexy but that won't save the movie. I thought RE1 was pretty good, because it was pretty nice filmed, and edited. However after reading some comments here about RE2 my expectation were low. Even so, i'm almost surprised how bad it was. Everything in the movie was totally predictable, from single scenes to whole plot. Other then that it was poorly shot and edited, with fast upclose action moves, so fast you never actually see them because they couldn't have pulled it off otherwise. Also i'm sick and tired of the ""Booo!!"" from zombies and monsters...they don't have any effect! And still they always succeed being dead silent and hidden and suddenly they are all there screaming in the next camera cut...whats that all about?1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lackluster Blockbuster,"For the second part, ""Resident Evil"" has something in store for You... Loads more of action and gore, and even less story. What was okay, is improved, what was lacking, is in even further decline. But, nonetheless, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" doesn't mess around none, and does what it came here to do, shoot and kick and cut, with Alice in front.The sequel picks up just about where the predecessor left it - Alice wakes up in the Raccoon City hospital and founds out the whole area has been overrun by walking meat. She must escape before Umbrella corp. drops a clear-it-all nuclear bomb on Raccoon City, and gathers her team along the way. Synopsis says it all already, literally sums up the movie from start to end. So you better believe the only selling points are action, visuals and Alice. Beyond the synopsis is a cliché city-in-ruins survival romp, or call it what You will, but it is an all-around familiar beast. At least the cast's decent, now joined by Sienna Guillory, Thomas Kretschmann and Jared Harris, even if their characters serve only singular functions... There are also two Russian soldiers working for Umbrella Corp. for some reaosn, Nicholai and Yuri. Milla Jovovich later said she was disappointed in this sequel, because *studio* wanted more action and flair. Well, they got it.The second installment in this problematic franchise is one that feels quite overstuffed and disjointed - it's faster paced and reasonably more action-packed than the first part, but at the cost of feeling more episodic and even less atmospheric. Some awesome, some decent and some cheesy action sequences are delivered, but all of them are in love/hate relationship with appearing plausible. Now, I don't know if they worked for people then, but all the ill-timed frame-drop slow-mos really didn't do it for me, and all those scenes are almost exclusively with the infected.""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a straight-up blockbuster, a little out-dated, a little shallow, a little gory, a little fun, a little boring. If memory serves, the next two chapters should be a bit better... My rating: 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
RE2: Apocalypse,"I thought this movie was magnificent. It focused on how Umbrella dealt with the infection in it's sick way. It focused on why the T-Virus was created and who created it and who it was created for. It was gored action packed. Plus the fact that most of the actors did most of their own stunts is amazing and well appreciated and respected. It is also the first movie in history to have a helicopter gun used by the Nemisis. I believe this is an excellent movie and fully recommend it to all horror sci-fi fans. I feel all resident evil gamers,like myself, will be pleased with the outcome of this movie as they were with the first movie. The ending is open-ended, which I think is great cause it again leaves us with all sorts of questions, which leads on to RE:3.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's as bad as I thought it would be.,"As one of the few fans of the original, I was disappointed to see the announcement of part 2 of Resident Evil. With the open ending of part 1, it was to be expected, but if you've seen the ending of part 1, you can almost guess part 2 is going to be bad. In part 2, Raccoon City suffered from a massive T-Virus infection and zombies are everywhere. The city is being quarantined, and the armed forces inside are being overwhelmed. There's one way out of the city: A young girl is trapped somewhere inside, and her father wants her out. As a member of Umbrella, he will make sure that whoever rescues his daughter gets an escort out of the city.Milla got beefed up with more moves this movie, which is very disappointing. I don't like it when there's some godlike character running through a world killing zombies with her bare hands.All in all, this movie lacks mystery. It's just pure action. Zombies get gunned down every second, and the movie lived up to my expectations: It's as bad as I thought it would be.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

A previous (apparently flawed) version of president-zombies escapes the lab and decides to run for the presidential post on its own.The lab is furious and to take the rebel out of the race they send a zombie supermodel who must derail his campaign by using persuasion, treachery or... love.After getting attached to each other in a zombie love the rebel persuades the model to break free from the lab and help him win the race. In a tight election he becomes the new president... The country is saved with a victory of the good.Viewers are allowed to suspect that she is the real one sent by the lab to rule the country as the First Lady.Evil wins because it is more sophisticated than the true love.President Evil 2 =============== The greedy biotech lab (see President Evil 1) has become a greedy multi-billion dollar corporation. Zombie presidents have risen to importance in many countries and companies. The world is ruled by biotech monsters who make no errors in business or politics. Their only not-so-good feature is extreme cruelty and hate of human beings.A ""competitor"" biotech firm decides to end this unfair game. They create a zombie ""man"" who must turn it around.

But however hard he tries, their numbers only seem to increaseAt the President's Thanksgiving dinner he meets the head of the greedy biotech giant. Believing he is a zombie, the protagonist is unable to answer his enemy's riddle. The surprise help comes from the evil zombie First Lady. Puzzled at the no-hate attitude, the protagonist presents her with another riddle and gets an answer only a human would give. Enlightened, he recognizes she is a human and so is he.Why would a human assist zombies in rising to almost absolute power? 'I made her do it', the biotech godfather says looking at the smiles of the protagonist and his newly-found love.

The whole thing was filled with explosions,it was mind numbing. 3. Why the heck was Jill Valentine wearing that ridiculous outfit? No explanation was ever given. 4. The guy playing the computer programmer was unbelievably irritating. I have no idea why he was cast in this role. 5.

One woman leaps over a car long ways, leaps on top of a car, and then leaps fifty feet in the air. I warned you it was goofy.The zombies also defy Science. We could almost accept old time zombies being brainless, but now these new ones have incredible motor skills. Where from? Again, more goofball crap.A few likable characters keep this from being a total bomb. Clearly not a good movie, however.

It's not a disappointment if your expectations are low.,"First off, I didn't mind the first one, even though I wished that it had more blood and gore in it. Don't expect any more in this installment. I didn't like the twist that they have given the RE storyline with alice being infected and given matrix like powers. It seems like when there is a female lead in this types of movies, they are so over-the-top in their toughness it seems too unbelievable and makes them less sympathetic and likable characters. Jill Valentine and Alice fit right into this category well. Overall, the movie is what you can expect from a video game based movie and has not improved from the first one.

Milla Jovovich was still wonderful as alice. But I thought that Sienna Guillory just didn't fit her part. She was too skinny, and didn't look half as tuff as she acted. She is very pretty and all, but that just didn't do it for me. She acted almost too tuff. I mean, what girl (cop) runs around in a corset to fight the living dead? That was what got me the most.

Dawn Of The Dead Lite In An Inferior Sequel,"As a big fan of the first movie I am somewhat taken aback by the terrible plotting and execution of this film. Frankly, ""Apocalypse"" was a big disappointment. However, it has enough cool action sequences, special effects, and Milla in yet another gams-revealing outfit with sexy fetish boots to be worth a rental.The movie takes place immediately after (and a little before) the ending of Resident Evil. The T-virus quickly spreads throughout Raccoon City and only handfuls of unlucky non-zombie citizenry remain. The Umbrella Company & their evil henchmen are more fleshed out in this movie, fronted by a blonde, Aryan man with a German accent (infer what you like) with no regard for human life. We are also introduced to a new kick-ass gammy heroine, cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory, who in comparison gives us a whole new appreciation of Milla Jovovich), T-virus creator Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris, who deserves soooo much better), and jive-talking' 70s throwback L.J. (Mike Epps). Acting across the board is quite wooden, with Milla giving the most heartfelt, textured performance (which says a lot).The strength of the first movie was The Mission, which provided a strong narrative line that kept you riveted to the action until the end of the movie. In contrast, the plot for ""Apocalypse"" is a mess, going off on a dozen different tangents and never giving you a chance to feel attached to any character other than Alice. Another thing about Resident Evil Uno that I liked was the way things didn't neatly work out for the characters, and how they and us had to accept some harsh realities. ""Apocalypse"" has inexplicable saves, coincidences, and total candy-coated cliché situations that infuriated me--it reminded me in no small way of an Irwin Allen disaster movie from the 70s. And the miserable ending seemed tacked-on and particularly stupid.Special effects and zombie gore are decent but quite watered-down in comparison with a Dawn of the Dead (either version) or 28 Days Later. The most memorable zombies are in the school scene and the pair of topless hookers. The hulking Nemesis monster looks ridiculous with guns and a missile launcher--it's like giving The Hulk an Uzi. The score is decent and sounds quite similar to Don Davis's work on The Matrix, but I longed for the minimalist yet creepy sounds of Marilyn Manson's work on the first movie.Overall an unmemorable sequel that you'll begin to forget almost as soon as the end credits roll--unlike the first film, from which I continue to remember scenes like the infamous ""laser hall"" and Rain Ocampo's valiant struggle against her own doom.And remember kiddies--when the dead walk the Earth, take that shortcut through the graveyard!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Who doesn't love action,"How can you not love the action in a movie like this. Of course this movie does seem to cater to the testosterone pumped males in the audience, but I see nothing wrong with it. Speaking from the point of view of not having ever played the game that much, I probably miss out on many little errors and what nots. But I spoke with some friends who played the game and they told me that they would get flashbacks all throughout the movie. No surprise the plot line is just a continuation of the first movie. In classic sequel style there are more zombies and there are meaner and bigger zombies. And of course the movie ends nice and open ended leaving the door wide open for another follow up. Seeing as how the amount of action increased from the first to the second. I can't wait for them to make a third.

"""Valentine!""","In this sequel to 2002's ""Resident Evil"" Milla Jovovich returns as Alice and joined by Sienna Guillory (The Time Machine) as Jill Valentine, which we all know as the petite cop that becomes stronger throughout the first game. She is not anything, but strong in this flick. I never notice Jill Valentine worn such an inappropriate wardrobe in the game she was always in her uniform, but in this movie she looks like she'll fit in on the corner with all the other prostitutes.I really don't want to ruin the movie for you, but since this has nothing to do with the rest of the plot I'll tell you. Jill walks into her police station and shoots ""Zombies"" in the head (Nobody knows these people are the undead yet) and all her boss has to say is ""Valentine!"". She gives him a small speech about they're not alive and she goes on shooting as he walks away. Wait, she'll be arrested on the spot no matter what she said in that situation.Anyways, Mike Epps (Next Friday, Bait) joins the cast, (yes I said Mike Epps) as the token black guy, I mean L.J. and of course Nemesis is in it, but he even lacks something, maybe like realism and/or loyalty to the video games.In my opinion, stay away from the whole Resident Evil series, it's nothing but a waste of time and money. Even if Leon shows up, they'll find away to mess his character up, so what's the point? If you do end up watching this, don't expect much.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worse than anticipated after reading IMDb comments.,"Was it just where I watched it, or was the volume cranked up for this particular film?? I could literally feel the base reverberate inside me.To be honest this was pretty bad, and for me that's saying something as I can usually watch anything...The way the film looked and felt, it seemed like a TV movie.As a lot of people have said already, the actions scenes were shot way too quick and too close.. The acting was pretty bad and over the top. There was no psychological tension in the way the film tried to scare you, it was just with sudden loud(where i watched it, VERY LOUD) noises with sudden extreme close ups. I could list every point what made this film bad, but I'm gonna be writing too much as it is... One point comes to mind, the STARS (referred to ""as the best"" by the Umbrella lady) sniper sitting on the roof drinking beer, acting like a complete redneck, this is the best? And the rest like running round like headless chickens..The first RE, I thought was not bad but still very watchable. I cant see how people thought this was better than the first one unless they are very young and or true fans of the game..As a film, which it is, it was pretty pss poor..So far I cant believe how they've messed up 2 greatly anticipated Sci-Fi movies this year, AVP and RE2..

It was SO not better than the first!,"Just saw RE: Apocalypse today. I don't play the game and I'm not a particular fan of zombie flicks - I watched it to see Milla Jovovich. She looked incredible in the first RE film. This sequel was, in most cases, a big disappointment. Yes, the story structure was better than in the first movie, but essentially just as insubstantial, if not more so. This is mindless action, with scenes incredibly quickly cut in order to disguise the lack of both real choreographic ability and good-looking martial arts moves. Jill Valentine was a bad Lara Croft imitation (complete with the blue-green top piece), whose only function was to be upstaged by Alice. This is a really bad movie, a major reason for which being that it was wildly underlit, so we couldn't really see what was going on - a flaw that many bad low-budget and over-commercial movies have. More seriously, we couldn't see Milla's face very well. *Sigh!* Now THAT's a crime!There were one or two cool scenes in the movie, but that doesn't do much to redeem it. This movie gets from me a rating of 4 out of 10.Incidentally, one of the cool scenes is at the end, when Milla looks into the surveillance camera wearing that crimson lipstick... Whoa! In fact, what this movie mainly failed to do, IMO, was to feature Milla's face more prominently. It should have built its entire shooting style around that great face, as, to an extent, the first movie actually did.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good fun for horrer fans,Re2 is far better then the first film in so many ways firstly it has got a far faster pace to it with the entrance of Alice being very entertaining and their is a lot more zombie busting from every character and it shows a great different to certain characters as the scene withs Milla Jovavich are like zombie Kung Fu action while the other scenes with the umbrella soldiers show some entertaining gun play.Secondly it is a lot closer to the games with characters like Jill and Nemesis finally making an appear.Thirdly the acting is far better with the likes of Milla Jovavich making a great effort.The film is not without it flaws as their is not much of a plot and at time it can feel very stupid.The ending is a totally disappointment and is very confusing but once you overlook its flaws you will find a pretty decent film to enjoy.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
What happened?,"Paul W. S. Anderson flushes another film down the can... For the first half of the movie it seemed like it had a chance, though if you've never played the game you would really be lost by some of the new cast, such as Jill Valentine. A few newspaper clippings and suddenly she is an expert on infected people. How does she know about the virus, she has no real background story unless you have played the game. Even so she was never involved in the previous film yet she already is aware of the outbreak. Now Nemesis was the biggest disappointment of all, the make up effects lacked so much detail, he was the biggest, bulkiest, and lamest enemy. Unlike in the game he is very slow and dramatic, not at all frightening. A good opening, a bad corny enemy, cheap ploys from the game which serve no purpose to the story. I found the movie lacking in such a high degree, that i would rather watch Return of the Living Dead rather than Resident Evil: Apocalypse. At least Return of the Living Dead was a comedy horror that i could laugh at. Gaps, plot holes, and bad creature effects make this movie, my suggestion wait until it comes to a Dollar theater at least then you would not have had to over pay for this failure.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Best Action, Science Fiction, Horror Movie Of The Year","Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the best movie I've seen this year. It's a non-stop movie from start to finish. The movie take place where the first one ended which is good because it combines the first movie to the second which explains the first one better of how everything got started in the first place with the research of the T-virus. This movie had a lot more action, comedy, and heart stopping scary scenes where you know something is about to happen but you don't. Resident Evil even had as some one said in the theater it's that scary girl from the first movie, but this time she was real and go figure she was the first with the T-virus developed by her father to make her walk because it does reanimate dead cells. The movie also had good fight scenes with the two main nemesis the guy that started mutating at the end of the first one and Alice.

Did anyone else notice the swapping from day to night while Milla was wandering the cathedral?Other than the fact that it was awful, I'd say this movie has a shot at breaking some records.

This film centers around Alice, the former head of security for Umbrella corporation, the corporation that is the biggest for anything in the world.It seems that Umbrella, with their many areas of marketing, decided to test a new form of biological warfare, which killed many people, with the exception of the not exactly staying dead... With this, Alice was a survivor of this heinous disease, and set out to kill the evil dead, but while she did, more infected people came about killing more people, and with this, armed survivors had set out to get out from the city chock full of the evil dead, lest they get destroyed with the undead populace when it gets ""wiped clean""All in all, this is a very good movie!

RE1 was a much better movie,"Not sure what they were thinking here, but the story was very lame and the acting was very stiff. The story basically consisted of trying to find the daughter of a Umbrella Co. Scientist and the test launch of the Nemesis project. The Nemesis Project was the genetic tinkering they did with the 2 survivors from RE1. The whole problem with this is that they did not explain much about the whole project. Also, the Jill Valentine actress was very stiff and the black guy that got whacked by Nemesis was stupid. The movie did make me jump a few times, but overall I was very disappointed, as I liked the first movie a lot. It just seemed to have way many more interesting action scenes and a 100% better ending. I don't think they could really end this movie all that well because they had a bad story to build up to a climax. Oh well, I 'd like to say they should end the RE series now, but maybe they'll do better next time. Until then, save your money and rent it in 2 months because this movie won't be out for very long.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Screwball, poorly executed, but still a comedy","I planned to jump from the Golden Bridge today but went to see Resident Evil this morning instead. Bad choice. You know, I've always been in love with the motion picture magic so I said, nothing could be worst than my failed life. O, how wrong I was and oh, how grateful I'm to realize that am living a dream in comparison to the constant, stupid, incoherent nightmare of that guy who did it...It took great deal of courage, unbelievable stupidity of the money people to give a bundle for such moronic script and complete lack of respect for the public to make such garbage. Some Umbrella, not from Singin' in the Rain, is an Evil Empire that mess up the world, the world goes berserk, people are eating people, blah blah blah. You know what the movie is all about  nothing.Only when one blessed soul in the movie theater started to laugh out loud I realized that this is the comedy. Screwball, very poorly executed, but still a comedy. If you try to take any single part of that cretinoid so called movie serious you'll be bored to death.Hope 'Nemesis' of this waste makers would visit them in the dreams.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bit too far . . .,"Usually people go into films with preconceived expectations, and when those expectations are not met that person is disappointed. I went into Resident Evil: Apocalypse with lots of expectations, every one of them was met, and part of me is still pretty disappointed. I enjoyed the film, knowing before hand what it was and the mindsets it was made for, but this was a case where I would have been overjoyed if Alexander Witt proved me wrong and went for something more.My biggest complaint involves the writing and direction surrounding the Alice character (nothing against Milla, herself, or her performance.) So many camera moves, editing choices, scenarios, and ill-conceived action cues came across as cheap gimmicks to pander to mindless fans and elevate Alice to a larger than life, superhuman, camp comic-book level that just did not feel a part of the Resident Evil world.Sure, making one of the main characters genetically enhanced levels the playing field against the hoards of infected zombies and monsters, but the beauty of the Resident Evil games was the fact that you played on Umbrella's turf with a very distinct disadvantage, and there we had a real reason to worry that the characters might not survive. Then again, this film isn't made for those appreciative of a challenge; this film was made for the people buying the strategy guide and downloading walkthroughs since designer's have taken out cheat codes enabling God Mode. 'I won.' Congratulations, I'm still not impressed.I praised Paul Anderson for excluding the game characters in the original film. I for one realize Raccoon City has enough people in it that we can focus on different people within the Resident Evil world (hell, Resident Evil 2 on the Playstation followed new characters.) I've played the games, and I never had any interest in watching a scene for scene, character for character, non-interactive remake. If I wanted to see Chris or Wesker or Leon, I'd play the games.The inclusion of game trademark characters has also killed suspense for the film. Is anything significant going to happen to RE's precious 'master of unlocking' on screen? Answer: No on two accounts. 1, Capcom won't let it happen, and 2, the obsessive fans will whine so loud and long we'll never hear the end of it. As a part of the audience, how am I supposed to be worried about the characters in this film when I know beyond all doubts that nothing will happen to them in the end? The games have suspense because Leon, Claire, Jill, and Chris can die at any time. 'Game over man! Game over!'If you're going to include a trademark character, don't pander to obsessive fanboys and show them doing nothing but kick butt without getting a scratch (or the obligatory 3 hits that don't even phase the good guys). Go ahead and kill off the trademarks and let the audience know that anything can happen to anyone. Then they'll really have reason to be worried about the characters that they care for. I mean really, in a film like this the game-characters won't even get a story arc. So why bother inserting game characters?Final set of irritations: the endless reminders that this is based on a video game, reminders that all but halt the on screen action just to reassure the fans who need it spelled out to them that this is, indeed, based on the game. I do like and appreciate nods to the Resident Evil games when done right. I loved hearing Jill say, 'We can run around them (the zombies); they're slow.' I loved hearing sound effects from the game, or when Jill went off on her own in the church to investigate and stumbled across a set that reminded me of an early scene in the first game. Throwbacks to the game are perfectly fine, but this film wants to advertise them, wink at the audience, wave and get your attention then point at 85 percent of the game elements (Jill's outfit, the Umbrella logo everywhere). Then it's just obnoxious. (Thank God they didn't recite the 'master of unlocking' dialogue from the game.)Anyway, praises for the film  though Alexander Witt's direction bothered me, I do think the film shows some promise for him. There's a mixed bag of nice touches and not so slick moves combined in an 'eh' way. Overall the film felt a bit shallow, like someone who's learned to play the notes but not the music. Apocalypse is a pretty decent start, granted, maybe Witt will learn the underlying music and soul of his craft.Sienna Guillory notably stood out in my mind. As much as I did not like the idea of Jill appearing in this film, it was interesting to see someone suit up in the characters wardrobe, look and move like the game character, and finally give a personality to that generic polygon creation we were introduced to in the games years ago.Overall, the film delivers exactly what someone should expect from the next generation of MTV action flicks based on a video game. It could have been much better, but it was just meant to please and entertain on the level of the lowest common denominator like just about any horror/action flick these days . . .",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first...,"Unfortunately, for me I am a Resident Evil nerd, housing all the games and the books! The original RE was good but not on a video game level. What I mean is, if someone never played Resident Evil I wouldn't tell them to see the original to understand why its so popular. It would appear that the creators of the movie were not gunning to make the first RE anything like the game but, just the idea so people could get a feel for the storyline. Regardless of this it was still a good movie. Its sequel Resident Evil: Apocalypse in my opinion totally surpassed the first just because it WAS video game based. To me if your going to remake something esp. a video game it should be true to form and as ACCURATE as possible. For example, people who aren't die hard RE fans wouldn't know that yes, Sienna Guillory did look like Jill Valentine, however, Jill's hair was sandy brown not black. Jill didn't smoke, and she definitely didn't have ""Im a tough b*tch and I'm in charge"" attitude. Even in the 3rd game where Jill has been through this situation already she was never arrogant. I think they portrayed Jill that way and I didn't care to much for it. I know its Hollywood and things change for movies sake, but come on, you couldn't find a bottle of light brown hair dye? As for Carlos and Nicholai. Nicholai was in his fifties and Carlos was in his early twenties. Oded Fehr was to old to play the part of Carlos and Zack Ward to young to be Nicholai. Again I know that its a movie but this are little things that they could have gotten right.Even though Alice (Milla) has absolutely no relation to the game what-so-ever her character brought so much to RE as a movie. Giving you a back story that definitely ""fits"" into the game world as a possibility allowing Alice to head the storyline. I love Milla and think she does an excellent job in both movies. If anything see this movie to watch Milla Kick A**! She definitely fits as a strong, powerful woman, but still feminine. They couldn't have casted anyone better for the part.The biggest thing about this movie that would have MADE it for gamers was the ""Nemesis"" Any one who knows RE games immediately recognized this terror! They depicted the Nemesis to a T! It was incredible to learn it was an actual person in a costume! Everything from head to toe was absolutely perfect! They did an amazing job on Nemesis! Perfect! Overall, this one definitely went above and beyond the original. Mabe I just feel that way because this was the type of RE remake I was waiting for. Although I have to be honest. I would love to see them remake the 1st game! As accurate to the game as possible. Then, I would wowed! Bottom Line: See it, you won't be disappointed!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great movie!,"I thought this was a very good movie! The action was fast paced, despite the slow moving zombies! Milla is one undead-ass kicking machine! The ending provided a VERY unique twist for the possible next chapter of the saga (Alice turns bad?).I also like the introduction of ""The Red Queen"" incarnate, Angela Ashford (hey, on the game she has a twin brother Alfred, right? Maybe that'll be expanded on in the next movie). I liked Jill Valentine being brought into the fold as well, and the actress who plays her is SMOKING HOT!!! Mike Epps was hilarious as usual.The one REALLY cheesy part, however, was the familiar ""STARS"" being uttered from the Nemisis. But, as far as I'm concerned, it DEFINITELY worth the price of admission! I'm already waiting eagerly for the next movie!! BRAVO!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An insult to its predecessor and the audience,"I used to believe that Paul W.S. Anderson was not getting a fair break from the Hollywood studio system. It's an easy belief to support, given that every film he has made so far has been hacked apart by the MPAA or a film studio acting upon MPAA orders. This evening, however, I witnessed a film so indescribably awful that not only do I believe my mother's pet silky terrier can puke up a better script, it has erased any respect I might have one had for Paul Anderson.The MPAA's R rating is quite meaningless, and that studios cut their film in order to get it is a telling sign of what is wrong with Hollywood today. In Australia, Resident Evil: Apocalypse was passed with the very softcore M rating, and this attempt at a film is a mild M at that. The atmosphere of the first film is absent, and the violence is so toned down that it resembles one of those Modified For Television cuts that were so reviled here in the 1980s.I now know why they changed the name from Nemesis to Apocalypse. There was once a belief that the Nemesis name is cursed, given that the Star Trek film with the same secondary title tried to compete with a Lord Of The Rings film and failed miserably. I have a funny feeling that Capcom saw the script, imagined what it would look like on film, and quietly asked that it not be associated with their excellent video game. The Nemesis in this film isn't so much an unstoppable killing machine as he is a drooling idiot in need of a friend. The Hunters/Lickers also take a beating here, too, having been confused with Speedy Gonzales.The cinematography and editing in this film are beyond a joke, too. Like all incompetent directors, Alexander Witt rarely keeps his camera still for more than a few seconds at a time. During the hand-to-hand fight scenes, the extraneous camera movement is enough to make me fight off the urge to vomit. I doubt I am the only one, and it certainly makes me glad that I don't have epilepsy. Contrast this with the stable, well-angled shots of the original. Better yet, watch the fight scene with the Nemesis, then contrast it with the shot of Alice putting her foot in the final zombie dog's head during the original. The camera-shaking fad has outlived its welcome by a major factor. Then there's the editing. In the original fast-paced action sequences were mixed in with slow, languid sequences that helped set up an atmosphere.That's another thing basically lacking from this sequel. Atmosphere. As there is rarely a shot or sequence that lasts more than two minutes due to the incoherent editing, none of the characters are given enough background to seem even slightly human. Anderson spent some time explaining the skills that his characters were meant to have, so it seemed natural when they made use of them. In Witt's film, characters constantly display abilities or skills that the audience was never made privy to before. Constantly-repeated, blurred, obscure footage of doctors injecting a character with their virus do not count.The worst part, after all these insults to the viewer, is the ending in which we're set up for another sequel. After the dog barf that was served up in the other 85 minutes of this film, to spend another five suggesting that there's going to be more is like a punch in the eye. They should have ditched their plans for a sequel and instead filmed another half-hour of footage for this one. An extra half-hour of exposition or setup would have saved this accident from being a total write-off.I gave Resident Evil: Apocalypse a one out of ten. The MPAA is constantly moaning about how piracy is eating into their profits, and yet they continue to make garbage like this. Seeing an organisation that controls billions of dollars worth of assets in this kind of denial is really sad to observe.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simply awful.,"I liked the first Resident Evil movie. Okay so it didn't really stick to the games, but it was a good movie... if a lil' pointless. There was only one thing that pissed me off about it and that was the lack of zombies.I thought they'd sort this out in the sequel, I mean, c'mon, that's the main point to the games: ZOMBIES! But no, there were even less zombies this time 'round. Instead, we have the Nemesis. This guy looked so damn class in Resident Evil 3 (the game that is), and they've recreated him here exactly how he looked in the game. This may please fans, but you just can't take this thing seriously. He just looks... uh... funny, like something from a Power Rangers episode.But that doesn't matter, 'cause the Nemesis is only in the movie for about 3 and a half seconds. The rest of the time is spent showing Alice kicking stuff, jumping through windows and flicking cigarettes at stuff. I thought that this movie would be a great 'leave your brain at the door' kinda action movie, but no, it's DUMBER than that.There is no point to the movie at all. Nothing happens. The gang just walk through the most dangerous places they can find for an hour. THAT'S IT!Every action movie staple you can think of is here too. This movie plays like one of those action movie parodies... except... this is all straight faced. It's hilarious, but not in a good way. Don't even get me started on the token black guy.If you've seen your fair share of action movies, you'll hate this. It offers NOTHING new, NOTHING AT ALL! Instead it's just a random mess of recycled action scenes from other movies. You've seen this before a million times, trust me.While watching the movie, I just had this image of some Hollywood big-wig handing a 10 year old a few million dollars and saying ""Hey kid, wanna make a movie"", then he leaves the kid to do whatever the Hell he wants.POINTLESS, UTTERLY POINTLESS.",,Anonymous,Horror
re2,"this movie was excellent storyline was very good cant stop watching the movie sienna guillory was probably the most sexiest girl playing Jill Valentine.It contained more better graphically pictures and this time it was based on the city , raccoon city. Overall i rate this film 10/10 it was superb. It took nearly 1 year to make the film so you can see they spent a lot of time and money to make the viewers like the movie and i think they have succeeded in that.

Well done guys i hope there's another resident evil coming out soon:)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first one,"I must confess; I am a huge ""Resident Evil"" fan. I got hooked on the games first, saw the first movie & got the DVD. Now, with ""Apocalypse"", the video-game-to-movie genre has (IMHO) reached its' zenith. ""Alice"", the heroine of the first movie, awakes to find Raccon City swarming with zombies (and more), while the REMFs at Umbrella Corp. coldly observe the chaos from afar, calculating the money they can make with the T-Virus.We finally meet the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad), most notably Jill Valentine, who is sporting a blue tube top and black miniskirt--straight out of ""Resident Evil 3: Nemesis""! Oh, and speaking of the Nemesis, he's here, too; what was left of Matt from the first movie has been transformed into a hulking bruiser who carries a rocket launcher *and* a Gatling gun! Oddly enough, the movie sort of humanizes the Nemesis near the end (you'll see).Overall, this was a very good movie, much better than the first one, with an ending that sets up (hopefully) another sequel! OTOH, once you've used up ""Apocalypse"" in the title, where do you go from there? I hope we'll find out! My rating: 8/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mish mash that ran out of steam,"As with the last Resident Evil, this is what I can only describe as a salvage movie. I guess they followed a menu that went something like this:1. Start with a really basic script 2. Take all sorts of characters, sets and situations from other movies and stick them in where you can 3. Add some R-rated sex scenes for good measureLets see if any movie buffs can spot more than I did: Lara Croft (easy one), Barbarella (scene in school ), Dawn of the dead (take your pick), Equilibrium (the guards), Starship Troopers (must have used the same water healing container thing), Hellraiser + Terminator (kill 2 birds with one stone), Scanners (easy one again), James Bond (tower walkdown), Omega Man (crash) after that I got bored thinking about it.The worst thing, apart from the mediocre acting, the disjointed story-line, and the half-baked direction (to name but a few) was how they tried to stretch it out to fill the time. I would say half way through making the movie they probably realized they couldn't fill more than 60minutes with this junk and what about a sequel? So they spliced in another 15 painful minutes or so of totally disjointed story-line so they could leave the ending open.Best thing about this movie, Sienna Guillory. She can come arrest me anytime. Grrrrrrrrr!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I wouldn't even DOWNLOAD this movie.,"I remember walking out of the original 'Resident Evil' pleasantly buzzing but at the same time wishing, just a little bit, that a few more aspects of the video game it was based on were present in the film. For what it was Paul W.S. Anderson, the very same person who all but raped both the Alien and Predator movie franchises not too long ago, managed to craft a nifty little zombie horror film that catered to fans of the game series and was still perfectly accessible to the average Joe. The editing was tight, the scares were plentiful, and the action was well staged. It's main failing, as in any overly-stylish mish-mash of blood and guts, was its dialogue, which was stilted, shiftless, and generally silly. But that was okay-it was fun anyway!In 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', first time director Alexander Witt gets the big chair while Mr. Anderson takes a step back, putting himself instead in a producer's role as well as writing the movie's script. Yep, that's right! The primary weakness of the first film is the foundation upon which a completely green director is to turn a film into a franchise. Ultimately, then, I can't really blame Mr. Witt for the miserably stupid movie that he's made; rather I prefer to praise him for the one star he did earn, instead of killing him for the remaining 3 he missed out on. The fact is I would not even download this movie. It was neither worth my money, nor especially my time.The set-up is simple. You've seen it before in a million other, better films. A town is filled with zombies and a few characters need to escape. Fewer will actually succeed. In this case, we have Milla Jovovich's character Alice, sole survivor from the first film, walking around barefoot in nothing but a hospital gown, eventually meeting up with another vaguely interesting group of characters. Among these is Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), the primary heroine from the games and who is given absolutely no set up or back-story or even much for clothing, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), a mercenary for the dastardly Umbrella corporation on a special mission to do something that never gets explained, and a pimp named LJ played by Mike Epps who is there for the racial slang and stereotypes that only a sassy, loud-mouthed pimp can provide. Meanwhile an extremely well armed, leather clad super-zombie called the Nemesis hunts our heroes with a chain gun and a rocket-launcher.All of these factors worked in the video game (Resident Evil 3's subtitle is 'Nemesis'), but that's the problem: video games are perfectly justified in creating ludicrous ways to threaten the player-as long as it's fun, it will rarely if ever be questioned. Movies have the extra burden of plausibility.The first movie was half-way believable, so therefore this movie should be, right? So why do we get a movie where armies of undead, from whom a single bite will un-kill you, are completely ineffective against kung-fu? I like kung-fu in my movies just as much as the next guy and I freely admit that kung-fu and zombies are a combination I had yet to be exposed to, but this is just ridiculous! And if the dead are coming back to life by the legion then why, oh WHY, are they taking a shortcut through a graveyard?! While we're at it, why doesn't anyone think to shoot the Nemesis in his unarmored head? Oh and how did that motorcycle ramp end up behind that stained glass window?Let's take a look at the teeny-tiny bright side. There are a few funny lines, including a particularly funny reference to the Grand Theft Auto, or GTA, series of games. The special effects are solid and that's always nice.There are some nice superhero moments here and there and some of the stunts are cool to watch. The camp value is running overtime as well, so this will probably be a good film to invite your friends over for a few beers with. Otherwise it's just loud, violent, and stupid.All said, this movie is as brash and silly as any film could possibly dare to be. The fact that it comes from a decent pedigree in both video games and in its prequel is only a further slap in the face to both art forms. Paul W.S. Anderson is by no means a talented director. He is mediocre and occasionally lucky at best, but for once I think I wish his hand was a bit more prevalent to this movie. I hated this film. Maybe after a lot of alcohol I could be convinced otherwise but until then I want both my time and my money back.1 star (out of 4).",,Anonymous,Horror
By the numbers video game adaption,"This movie follows a very straight line. There are a series of setups, quick character development, and then, bang bang bang. The film follows a true video game formula, with ever increasing difficulty facing the heroes .The film has great atmosphere, great sound and great special effects, but unfortunately, it does not make up for the lack of plot devices.Unlike movies derived from comic books or heavily influenced by them, this film has absolutely no plot devices, it is by the numbers. Kill a bad creature, then kill a hundred of them, and then face a worse creature. Move to next board, where you face a hundred of the worse creatures, and then get introduced to another character, who meets the next level in depravity.This film lacks all intelligence - you can take a thirty minute bathroom break and not miss anything, except for violence and gore. Very similar to watching a hardcore gamer play through a video game.If you think this review is too cynical, whatever. Watch ""Aliens"" to see how a film can be a horror/action flick, and still have meaningful character development, have subplots and other interesting twists.Do you want to see a REAL horror flick? Check out ""Darkness"", 2002. Want to see an ENTERTAINING zombie flick? Check out ""Sean of the Dead"", 2003. Want to see an INTELLIGENT action flick, featuring Milla Jovivich?

Very Entertaining,"This movie is great. I am a RE fan I've played the core RE games and I for one did not and do not want to see a movie thats Just like the game. RE Apocalyspe as with the RE1 have many of the game elements but they have been switched around and moved all over the place. This is a good idea that way you don't know what will happen every scenes. There are parts in the movie that are not explained but like in the first one they will probably have a 3rd installment that would explain some of it. The mercenaries weren't explained in the film and the S.T.A.R.S team had a shallow explanation. Some of the dialogue was PG-13 for an R film. The strong use of women in the lead parts was too much for me but its a great money making move.The finer points of the film was the nonstop action, The comic relief was great,and the zombies where kind set aside as secondary threats. I love the Nemis he was right on the money. The licker's were sad compared to the first film. The K-9's were much more fun in this film. The gore was notched up a bit but wasn't suspenseful like the slicing dice scenes in the first film, that was great, all in all this film was a ten.

Derp,"Dumber and more annoying than the first one, Alice now has mental powers, can walk down walls and has x-ray vision, so she can calculate the exact moment in which she crashes down a church with a bike right over two enemies. The cast is as disposable as the one in the first movie, the direction less obsessed with matrix gimmicks, but equally easy to forget. The plot is still as interesting as counting cracks in a wall: citizens trying to escape zombie infested city, yes, Paul WS Anderson once more makes zombies boring. Talk about having the magic touch of dullness.Anything else to know? There's a token black guy providing comic relief, a sassy female reporter (and surprisingly this is not a Van Damme movie) and bad guys with British accents. Every minute that passes feels dumber and more boring. If you are done with puberty there's no way you could be enjoying this. There are amateur films in youtube about zombies with more creativity than this derivation of a dozen of better zombie movies. Also Paul, i know Milla is hot, and your wife and everything, but she's about as good at acting as you are directing and writing.

Disappointing Evil,"This sequel was a different type of movie than the first. At no time was I ever scared of the walking dead. In the previous film the focus was placed more on these zombies. In this version we saw these creatures in masses and their details was not captured. What the director focused on more was on the action shots, some of which I actually did enjoy. A few effects were very nice and had that 'ooh ahh' factor, which is the only reason one might opt to see this movie at the theater. Other than that I don't recommend spending those $9. The story was very predictable and worse had many cheesy lines. Of course that is to be expected in an action film, which is what the movie ended up being. I suppose it more closely relates to its game originator, but if that's what we wanted we are better off playing the actual game.",,Anonymous,Horror

I'm not some film snob that will only patronize artsy and independent cinema (though I probably should after seeing this smoking load). I enjoy a good visceral escape like the next person. In fact, I love the original Predator very much and that really doesn't have any substance to speak of.That being said, if you want a good action movie experience and are one of those poor folks who can excuse a terrible flick by saying, ""Yeah it was bad, but the special effects were awesome!"", then by all means, GO! You'll likely love the film and give blowing reviews on every message board from here to the end of the internet. However, if you are someone who looks at the schmuck and wants to slap him in the back of head for saying something so stupid, then take my advice and skip this one. The characters are terrible, the plot is horrendous and dashes the logic of even the first RE, and it's filled with way too many EXTREME moments for it's own good. From rappelling cops with guns, to heroines who can smash through glass without getting cut, RE:A just says to heck with reality and goes on without a second thought.

"Whoa, MUST SEE THIS AGAIN!!!","I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil series, I've played and beaten them all, so I have at least some knowledge to the plots of the game. I saw this movie, and I enjoyed every bit of it, I admit that some of camera jerking got on my nerves, but enjoyable nonetheless. Why would anyone see this movie if we knew exactly what it was about? I'm glad they added some things in that weren't in the original games. Jill was most definitely my favorite character. What's great about the Resident Evil series is that females can actually fight and defend themselves rather than being lead around by a macho dude. Alice and Jill kick ass, seriously. If you're sitting there nitpicking every little bloody detail, then go ahead and hate this movie. For those of you who'll shut up and enjoy it, you'll love it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
VERY disappointing,"Well, mark off yet another franchise ruined. This movie was disturbing, but not in the horror movie sense. No, it was disturbing because of how similar it felt to House of the Dead, quite possibly the lowest grade zombie movie made in the last 10 years. The really sad part is, House of the Dead had more horror in it than Resident Evil 2 did! This movie was practically gore-less, no doubt to keep the ratings low to attract the cash kiddies.Like HOTD, Resident Evil 2 feels like the director ran around Toronto with the cast, going ""ok, a grave yard, this will be a cool place to film"". It felt scriptless, like it was made up on the spot. While some may thing that this would lend a little spontonaity to what might otherwise be a formulaic movie, they'd be wrong. All the lack of direction added was a boat load of cheap one-liners, bad dialogue, and the worst attempts at European accents I've ever heard. It felt like the director simply came up with ideas on the spot; anything he thought was cool he'd add it, regardless of it not fitting at all. ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if Alice drove a motorcycle through the stain glass window to get into the church!"". This sort of stuff isn't mindless entertainment, I'm a big fan of mindless, but this was just idiotic.The whole movie plays out like a music video, with fast edits, and machine gun cuts. HOTD also pulled this trick numerous times. Both films even share a similar flashback sequence where they show all the previous events in the film strobing to the drum beat in the background music.All in all, I think this movie REALLY lost the scope of the first film. The first Resident Evil, like the game, was a ""survival horror"". It featured people trapped inside an enclosed space with deadly zombies and mutants. In RE2, the whole scope is broadened too far, making it feel more like Escape From New York rather than a survival horror.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was a disappointment,"I've seen first movie, which was great, and personally I don't think the sequel is half as good. It's not even the same genre. It was too much Tomb Raider-like, and that doesn't suit the movie at all, especially after watching Dawn of the dead. After the GREAT music of the first movie, Apocalypse doesn't have at least one catchy theme. It's full of clichés, (such as bullet-time effect) that were use a million times. The characters are ridiculous... It seems the creators wanted to create an epic movie that turned out to be Tomb raider 3In a bad way. Even Mila's outfit is almost identical to Angelina Jolie's in TR, Overall I rated it 3. If you liked the first one do yourself a favor and don't ruin the illusion.",,Anonymous,Horror
Far better than the dismal original,"I was appalled by the first Resident Evil film. As a big fan of the games it was based on I hoped for something which tied in with it. Indeed, George Romero agreed with this philosophy and coined a script featuring recognisable characters from the franchise, and a similar setting. This script got him fired and the final movie bore pretty much no resemblance to the games bar the locale of Raccoon City and the name of the Umbrella Corporation. If alienating the fans wasn't bad enough, the actual quality of the picture was quite dismal, and though it was successful on the name, the film content left the majority of neutral viewers fairly apathetic, and actual fans mildly annoyed. Bearing this in mind, the sequel would have to rectify a lot of the mistakes the first one made, and contrive something far better than the original.They succeeded admirably.Apocalypse picks up exactly where the original left off, with Milla Jovovich's Alice staggering out of some kind of Umbrella medical installation to be greeted by the chaos of the town of Raccoon City under the state of emergency the outbreak of T-Virus has left it in.However, Umbrella have plans to use the situation to their advantage by way of the Nemesis program, and endeavour to test their bio weapons within the carnage.Meanwhile the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) members are still in Raccoon City and trying to escape, but after Nemesis slaughters a crew of them, it is left to the few remaining ones to try and escape. They are flanked by Alice who doesn't feel quite herself any more...Resident Evil Apocalypse succeeds on the vast majority of levels the original feebly capitulated at. Firstly, and very importantly, there are far more references to the actual games in evidence. Carlos Oliveira, Jill Valentine, Nemesis, an Ashford reference; there are more than enough superficial homages to the games to satisfy the connoisseurs. Moreover, the 'feel' of the movie is vastly more akin to the games. Rather than the slightly sci-fi sanitised original which felt a million miles from the games, this one gets the scenarios and general ambiance closer to what purists wanted. Also in evidence here is the fact it's a mix of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis video games. Jill has her Nemesis outfit on, Carlos from 3 is here, the underground lab from 2 is featured. There are plenty of game links to satisfy. Sure, there are some slight modifications to the game plot, with certain details quite different, but you don't find yourself holding such facts against the film.Secondly, and crucially, the actual movie itself outside of being faithful to anything is a genuinely enjoyable tale. Sure, it's hardly realistic, with plenty of gravity-defying stunts and absurd moments of combat, but it demands you suspend your disbelief for the duration and assuming your compliance you'll get a kick out of the action and explosions et al.Then we have Alexander Witt's far more engaging direction compared to Paul Anderson's drab attempt in the first movie. Witt achieves an engaging ride here, always making each scene buzz with life. Never a dull moment in this one.The cinematography is more than competent as well, with some great aerial shots and some effective street scenes. You feel part of the action at all times, and you're certainly never bored. Set layout is especially good, so good you actually don't notice it.Finally the acting. OK, that's always going to be a weakness here, but besides the corny accents and overdose of cheesy dialogue the actors do a decent job of getting on with proceedings. Hell, they even manage to look like they're enjoying themselves.But this film is not about acting; clearly the narrative is centre stage. And as a result of a reasonable script, good direction, and close ties to the game, Resident Evil Apocalypse manages on every level its predecessor failed at.If you're a fan, highly recommended. If you're not, you will probably still get a blast out of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The popcorn was really good,"Let it be noted I am a player of the games and one of the people out there that thought the first R.E. movie was okay. Oh and I love Zombie movies! I could not get into this movie though I really wanted to love it.Story wise there is not a lot here but that I could have gotten by with given some wild action, some gore and a lot of zombie crunching. The special effects seem pretty decent as far as action shots mostly involving the character Alice (Milla Jovovich) trying to out bad the Terminator. But most of the Zombie shots are intentionally kept quick or blurry (did we spend all our money on BOOM effects and not save any for make up?). The Lickers are okay as far as CG goes but don't really satisfy. To give credit though the Nemesis outfit is pretty cool looking.The best sequence in the movie is probably the first meeting of Alice and Nemesis. Actually liked the way this was choreographed to some extent. Fun scene. But this movie really seemed to lack this focus anywhere else and at best was an excuse to have some good popcorn. Not horrible but not all it could have / should have been.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disgrace to the Resident Evil storyline,"The original Resident Evil film was an excellent horror film - sexy, scary, pulse pounding, and a refreshing breathe of life to the horror film industry.Resident Evil Apocalypse was downright shameful. Nothing new, nothing exciting, and above all nothing scary. The Nemesis character was wasted in a few short scenes, too many subplots, and too much ""evil corporate shenanigans"". Where was the edge of my seat suspense the first one created so well? This film looked more like two Hollywood-Hotties dressed up in skimpy outfits shooting large weapons and doing some heavy ass kicking of the undead - just to sell tickets to horny teenage boys.The first film had a grim ending that could have opened up a killer sequel........the only thing this sequel did was kill my wallet by $7.50.(well actually $22.00 if you include my fiancé's ticket plus refreshments - but you get the point!)",,Anonymous,Horror
Not a Resident Evil movie,"This movie was one of the worst ever. All of the Resident Evil movies should have never existed at all. It has nothing to do with the original titles in the game where it supposed to be based.

great movie - better than the first!,"This movie consistently flowed better along its story lines than the first installment did. First of all, you've got to remember that it's an action movie - and a sci-fi action movie at that - so there's going to be some pieces that everyone would change. Especially the people who have played the video games. For one example - the Nemesis, should have been bigger, but again, it's a fantasy movie. As with all fantasy movies, you've got your small selection of cheesy lines, but overall, the movie was great - better than its predecessor. Milla did a fantastic job and they had a great supporting cast. I will definitely look forward to RE3, as long as Anderson directs that one as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Mediocre action film, so-so horror/sci-fi film, poor film","Loud and nasty; those are the two most appropriate synonyms I can think of to describe this film, which most likely won't be going down with either of the ""Dawn of the Dead"" movies, ""28 Days Later,"" or any of the ""Return of the Living Dead"" pictures as a hallmark of zombie/rampaging virus victim movie-making.Virtually devoid of plot, RE:A opts, instead of the more sophisticated, unsettling approach of any of George Romero or his successors' works, to give us 99% action and 1% dialogue, a poorly constructed ratio if there ever was one. The film is full of jump cuts, with captions and on-screen images implying sequences which would've been devoid of action and all talk had they been included. Those unfamiliar with the games will be left virtually clueless as to what's going on as the time line jumps between hours and days during the first quarter or so of the relatively brief film (about an hour and a half, according to my watch). This is a game-to-film transition gone very, very bad; it would be time much more well spent to actually play the game. The movie comes across as a Cliff Notes version of watching someone else play Resident Evil: Nemesis, except using live actors instead of CGI.In a city of the undead, the human element is nil, and oft times the question comes up why we're even watching these people; Milla Jovovich is the only character even really remotely root able for, and the only reason for that is that she's a familiar face. Characters quickly come and go in rapid succession, getting killed minutes (and in one instance, seconds) after we find out their name, with no explanation as to who they are or why they're doing what they're doing. In a quarantined city about to be destroyed, there's only one motivation: Get out. This could've been played on similarly to the way Night of the Living Dead played on a similar situation, but every character aside from Alice has the same thought process, reactions, and attitudes, and are differentiated only by their physical appearance and dialect/slang (for some reason, Racoon City, apparently in Illinois according to the globe at the end, has equal parts population British, French, Russian, and American citizens). Had the director/producer/writers decided to include any dialogue in place of the unending action, and had that dialogue been well written, this is a film that could've had some potential maybe not as a great horror flick, but at least as a good auctioneer. Instead, from beginning to end we're subjected to computer graphics, CGI sequences, and virtually un-ending stretches of poor camera work and amplified gunfire as the undead are dispatched in poorly lit, badly focused environments that barely gives the viewer time to try and understand what they just saw.What little speaking and character we're left with is divided evenly into clichés (the cold hearted business executive, the steely soldier, the tough woman cop, the token funny black guy, the token tough black guy, the mindless, unstoppable killing machine) and cliché ridden dialogue (an evil corporation/the government causes disaster because of greed and immorality; aforementioned steely executive has innocent people killed by steely soldiers; a pseudo-pimp drives around in a Cadillac shouting obscenities at white people; a brainwashed monster remembers love and relents). It comes as no surprise that one of the people responsible for this is Paul W. S. Anderson, who gave us the ""inspired"" House of the Dead, which opted to include images from a 1980s arcade game in lieu of actual footage. Anderson seems to like zombies and guns, but otherwise has no grasp on any sort of movie-making mechanics. He doesn't give the viewer a reason to care for the people getting killed, or even explain why they're getting killed, in some parts; early on in the movie, characters are confronted in a church by giant, apparently zombified lizards, who attack with enormous tongues and climb down walls. But as the film demonstrates, the virus causing zombification doesn't create anything, it simply reanimates dead cells, leaving us to question what these things were exactly, and where did they come from? Nowhere in the ""living"" world are there six foot tall, ten foot long reptiles that can snap a human neck by wrapping its tongue around one. The entire film follows this err in logic and lack of creative input, right up to the convoluted last five minutes of the film, wherein we're all but given the announcement that there will be no resolution, only the promise of a third film.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Top notch entertainment,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I quite liked the original, but knew they could improve on it and in this sequel they have.Events centre around Racoon city being quarantined after the T-virus is leaked into the atmosphere causing everyone to mutate into zombies and the like. A small group of survivors are assigned the task of retrieving Dr Ashford's daughter (the guy who invented the T-virus) who is trapped in the city. However, umbrella are hellbent on killing everyone in order to contain the outbreak and they deploy their top-secret bio-weapon NEMESIS into the disease ridden city. Cue lots of action scenes all held together by a decent storyline.Sienna Guillory is taste and plays the Jill Valentine character well and Milla Jovovich returns in the lead role and is pleasing on the eye too.

you didn't like it? play the game then!,"Okay, when I heard about the first part, I heard that none of the characters in the game were going to appear, and a lot of fans complained about it, and I must say, I'm a die hard fan of RE and I didn't felt that way, because if either Chris, Jill, or other character appeared i knew that they couldn't die. So i was very happy with this.The first one was more like the first game of RE: atmospheric, creepy and with good horror, I liked it very much, and when I learned that Nemesis was the theme of the sequel I was anxious to see it.Now I have seen it, and it applied the same ""rules"", while the first and (a little) the second were horror games, the third, ""Nemesis"" was more like a action game, no horror, no suspense, just action. I'm not saying I didn't liked the game, in fact, it's in my top ten of my list, but somehow I knew the second RE was going to be like the third game, and let me say, I wasn't disappointed, it was like seeing the game, the action, and Jill, who kept me drooling the entire movie, was a very good addition. So, if you want to see the same story, same characters, the same thing, then play the game! If you want to see something different, watch this, you'll be pleased :)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A formulaic clone of the original with more explosions.,"First off I must say that I am rather disappointed in IMDb for catergorizing this movie as Horror and Thriller, which it most certainly is neither. However, it also lists it as Action and Sci-Fi which it definitely is.If you loved the first movie, you will probably be quite entertained by this action-packed sequel, though if you were like me and were hoping for something a little more true to the video game on which it was based you will certainly be disappointed. Really the only similarities to the game that I could find where the use of familiar names such as Umbrella Corp, Racoon City, STARS, etc. The plot progression in RE2 is even more contrived than that of RE1 and I found most of the action scenes to be way over-the-top.Although there are plenty of walking-dead in this movie I would hardly consider it a ""zombie flick"". What's missing here is any semblance of horror or suspense. Really the only suspense comes from when characters inadvertently sneak up on each other and suddenly grab their shoulder from behind. I would think with everyone being on edge and ready to shoot at anything that moves, you would want to be a little more subtle in getting your teammates attention. I am also baffled by how many times someone gets bitten. Everyone in the movie is well aware that if you get bitten by one of them, you will turn into one of them, yet no one seems to be wearing any protection against that sort of thing.I feel guilty for putting so much money forth to see this type of cinematic crap (It cost me $15 after ticket, food and drink to see a matinée showing!), further provoking them to blow even more money on huge explosions and big-budget effects on an inevitable third installment.If you are a fan of big budget, highly implausible action movies such as Blade or Van Helsing then by all means drop $10-$20 and go see this. If you are a fan of zombie flicks, it is still not worth the bother, go rent Shaun of the Dead instead. If you are a fan of Suspense, Thriller, Horror movies then go see something else---anything else!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The only good thing about the movie is they Blow up Toronto,"Hummmm, What can I say about this movie, I expected a good action movie with good story line, but, none of it ever happened. I almost walked out after the church scene where these ""things"" come to attack, I did not get where they came from or why they where there! It was as like the director wanted to insert some actions and inserted another movie in the middle of his movie, it just did not make any sense to me.It was obvious that this was filmed in Toronto Canada, You see a few land marks, like the Bank of Montreal building, City Hall, etc.. I tried to see the CN tower but never did (maybe I was yawning).The only great thing about the movie is they Blow up Toronto with a Nuke at the end and all the Zombie like Torontonians die. The acting for the Zombies actually reminded me of the people that live in Toronto, they walk around just like that in real life!! Especially when the leafs lose.. hahaha...

The rest of the movie was almost unwatchable. On another note, I don't see how African Americans don't get offended by being portrayed by cliché's like Mike Epps who was horribly unfunny and just tried to make the movie ghetto. Again, this movie could have been great because the first one was really good but they ruined everything. The whole movie felt rushed and put together real sloppy(camera, plot, character development, etc.). You also get to hear a lot of horrible fake accents and again the acting is so, so bad.

Better than the First One.,"First let me be honest, at first I was kind of scared with the Resident Evil films, I mean with all of them, I saw the trailers but I was never brave enough to go and see them until I played Resident Evil 4, which I totally enjoyed, after this I decided that I was going to watch the films. Resident Evil: Apocalypse was the first one I watched before the first and before the third, and I think It was better this way because thanks to Resident Evil 4 I knew the story of Raccoon City, the incident, the outbreak, which are detailed in this film. Therefore as soon as I started watching this film I was familiar with the story.Now lets go into the film. I liked it better than the first one which I watch after seeing this one. This film has more action, better effects, good acting, and it was a more suspenseful. I liked better the plot in this film, it was more exiting and this film is at least more related to the game having Nemesis, Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliveira, Raccoon City, the first one was only related because it had the T-Virus, and Zombies. Overall this film has better effects, a better plot, more horror, it kept me there interested from beginning to end, I always watch it on TV when I have a chance. Better than the first one and it is worth watching, it is really cool. The only thing that could be better is the adaptation of the characters from the game, they had to get actors that looked more like the characters or at least make the actors they have look more like the characters, but regardless of this it still is a great film. 8/10. Do not be scared to watch it, especially if you played the games.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best zombie movie since Dawn of the Dead,"If you felt the first ""Resident Evil"" movie didn't quite capture the atmosphere of the original game, you can sleep a little easier now. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" has EVERYTHING: from dark, creepy graveyards, a Gothic cathedral and classic lorries in an ""Escape from New York""- style deserted city to a cigarette smoking Jill Valentine and half naked hooker zombies. Although this sequel clearly had a much bigger budget than the original film, director Alexander Witt has kept it credible and didn't use digital technology to bombard your senses and keep your mind of the lack of a decent storyline. Rather than making you feel like you're watching a computer- made movie where nothing seems real, the special effects help create a desolate and panicky atmosphere with credible characters who struggle to survive in a city that's infested with their undead compatriots, partially decayed K-9s and other creepy lifeforms. The scene where one survivor has to go up against a class of elementary school zombies is just terrifying. Unlike the director of the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, Witt and producer/ script writer Paul W.S. Anderson have opted not to follow in the footsteps of the fast- moving ""28 Days Later"" zombies, but has clearly been inspired not only by George Romero's view of walking corpses, but also by his opinion of our western society. The real evil in this movie is not the zombies or even the killer mutant Nemesis (who looks and sounds like he has just stepped out of the original game and into this movie), but a Big Brother- style multinational that puts itself above the law and has no respect whatsoever for morale, decency or anything human. Even if you've never played the video game, didn't like the first ""Resident Evil"" movie or don't care for a lot of high tech military action in a horror film, I'd still highly recommend you take the time to watch this one. If you liked both the 1978 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Aliens"", you're going to love ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". Besides, if internationally acclaimed Milla Jovovich agreed to add it to her résumé of, among others, ""the Fifth Element"", ""the Messenger: the Story of Jean of Arc"" and ""the Million Dollar Hotel"", it has to be good!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The infection is spreading faster than anyone could have anticipated.,"I have to admit I loved the first film. It was one of the few films that I thought best represented the video game that it accompanied. Milla was perfectly cast as the lead and the non-linear structure of the film allowed us to see the who, what, where, when, and why of the events. There was just the right amount of terror, the right amount of action, and a whole bunch of originality. I wish, I really wish that I could say the same about it sequel. As the credits rolled and we were brought back up to speed from the last events that occurred in the original only to discover that a new director had decided to helm this project and was obviously handed more money and forced to follow the footsteps of Hollywood. Everything from the original was lost and discarded as a mainstream horror film with maybe zombies (couldn't tell due to the blurry nature of which they ran) moved in to take its place. More money was on the table with, in this case, meant more explosions and less story. A disgrace to the name of both the video game and the original film came in several ways with this inferior sequel, mainly horrible acting, clichéd characters, a recycled plot, and especially with a amateurish, craft sale created monster known as the Nemesis.To begin the characters were very disrespectful to the original. I remember hearing of this sequel and hoping they would build more on Milla character, giving her more to work with and more past stories of her time at the Umbrella Corporation. I was a hopeful viewer who wished for more deeply rooted characters with many layers, but found the Hollywood cliché instead. The entire character known as LJ could have been eliminated with the greatest of ease and without any remorse. His lines were the epitome of every other zombie film created while trying to bring his own game references into a franchise that was doing well on its own (the GTA line nearly took my rage over the top). Like any good supporter of films and video games, I don't mind when they bring in more characters from the series, but let us know who they are first. There was no introduction to Valentine for those less familiar with the series other than she knows how to shoot zombies and she was disbarred from the force (see the writing on the wall). This goes the same for Carlos, who just wandered through his part without really contributing anything worth while, and Nicholai, whom I always considered another villain of the series. Oh well, I guess when tons of Hollywood cash is being thrown in your direction, you can just go crazy with creativity and forget the basis of your film. Yet again, who am I to say? Milla was the only one worth watching in this entire film, and even her character seemed to be turning to cardboard by the end. It was a sad change of events for the Resident Evil group.The bad acting was the only trouble with this film, the horrible script allowed the Hollywood character and plot clichés to pour in like the flood gates had been opened. The wise cracking character that always has something to say and obscure pop culture references that try to gain a couple laughs from the audience was present. The no-nonsense female cop that has a strange past, but finds out that she has the heart of gold. The corporation boss that is willing to kill everyone for the sake of science and proves that he has no heart what so ever. Finally, there is the large overbearing monster that was nothing more than table scraps of every other Hollywood big budget horror movie, which discovers the true meaning of Christmas. YUK. Could director Alexander Witt either not do his homework or just try for once to build upon the original instead of slicing and dicing. Not just the characters were cliché, but also the story. Lines were replaced with explosions and CGI. Gore replaced the sci-fi element and 1984 Big Brother moments were just the mother load. Seriously, I would love to know what happened.I would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen. For any of you that did not, I question your sanity. The reality, if that is what you want to call it, the creative imagination of the original was lost when Nemesis made his screen debut. It was sloppy and cheap. Definitely not something for Witt to be proud of.Overall, this was not a crowning achievement for the series. The themes were jumbled mess of save humanity and science is bad. Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless. I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept. Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.Grade: ** out of *****",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible Movie,"I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game franchise and I thought this movie was horrible. I think that the writer/director of the first movie did a great job of bringing the story to the big screen. Video game inspired movies are not the easiest to do, just look at Street Fighter, House of the Dead, etc. I think it was a HUGE mistake to have a different director helm this film. To be honest, I don't think it would have helped this film much if Paul Anderson had directed it either since he wrote an incredibly stupid script with incomprehensible plot. I know this is a movie about zombies, but can we please have a little bit of realism and logic here. Can we at least keep our story consistent? We understand that the T-virus reanimates dead cells and that it is protean, it can be borne through the air, etc but how is it that the dead buried in the cemetery are reanimated? From what I understand, there was six feet of soil and various man-made implements(such as a coffin) separating those dead people from the T-virus. Unlike in the first movie, the air had not been infected with the virus or everyone alive would have gotten it too.It is an interesting stunt to have Alice running down the side of a building, but let's answer the question of how in the heck she got up there in the first place. How about the brilliant disappearing zombies. A hoard of zombies will be somewhere in one instant and then gone the next and vice versa. How are they walking about the city for long periods of time with out seeing even one zombie? What happened to that large group of people in the beginning who was turned back into the city at the beginning of the movie? Why would you split up in a building full of zombies? How did Alice know that the people barricaded up in the church needed help? Why would she crash through the window leaving it open for zombies to get in? Why? Why? Why? I could go on and on, but I think the ultimate question is...Why did this movie suck???I likes the multiple sets, I liked the additional action, I liked the use of characters from the game. I even appreciated the comic relief that Mike Epps provided, but the movie was a dudd overall. I gave it 4/10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident evil: apocalypse(2004),"Following the success of the 2002 adaptation from video game to film that was 'Resident Evil', comes its tantalizingly-trailered sequel, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. I have to say, I was entranced by the trailer of this film. I seriously thought that this film had the potential to rise above 'Mortal Kombat' (1995) and 'Resident Evil' as the best cinematic event to spawn from a video game. 'Apocalypse' doesn't do everything wrong, but it certainly doesn't do everything right.Let's start with a brief synopsis. Firstly, this film picks up literally days after the first drops us off. 'Apocalypse' opens with a rehashed explanation of what we learned about the two main characters in the original, Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Matt Addison (Eric Mabius). Again, we are told that this Umbrella Corporation is an international super-power and that Alice is (or more accurately was) the head of security in an underground research facility dubbed ""The Hive"", which harbored research and specimens pertaining to biological weaponry. After that, we are treated to the scientists who wheeled Addison away at the closure of 'Evil', opening the zombie-infested annals of ""The Hive"". Immediately before the audience 'knows' what happens (its pretty obvious and is given away in the final shots of the first 'RE') we transition into a militaristic evacuation of important personnel associated with Umbrella Corp. After a few assorted events that do (and simultaneously do not) move the plot line (a 'do not' being the lead-scientist asking how bad the situation is). After this, we are introduced to nearly a half-dozen other characters, including a renegade police officer (Sienna Guillory), the remaining members of an elite task force (Oded Fehr, Zack Ward), a VERY stereotypical Black man (Mike Epps) and a hulking creature (which, if you paid attention to the first 'RE', you would be aware of its appearance) that totes both a rocket-launcher and a hand-held chain gun named the ""Nemesis"".As far as performances go, the aforementioned actors and actresses do well with the material that they are given. Guillory has Helen of Troy (not from the film 'Troy') on her resume, as Jovovich has Joan of Arc, Fehr has the mummy hunter, Ardeth Bay from the 'Mummy' series and Epps is credible in several comedies. There is no real emotion in the script, so the viewers really can't ask for any emotion from the actors (sadly true).That is where 'Apocalypse' stumbles, and in many places, falls on it's face.The plot is paper thin with nearly no real complications for the audience until the last ten minutes (which is a near-complete turn around from the original, which actually evoked SOME thought from the audience). It is basically unleash zombies on the city and shoot 'em up. The small sub-plots really vary from little to no relevance in the story whatsoever. It is pretty predictable that there is some kind of 'oh no, my friend was bitten and eventually, I'll have to kill him just before he bites me' situation, and the big action/set pieces are blatantly set up. The characters are thinner than the plot, with their arcs being straighter than a steel arrow. Alice begins the movie as an ass-kicking femme fatal, and finishes the film being...oh, you guessed it, an ass-kicking femme fatal. Jill Valentine (Guillory) is another one of these masculinely tough females, although sans Alice's super powers. The only real life that is brought to the script is through the epitome of black stereotypes, played by Mike Epps. It was sadly ironic, however that my favorite bit of 'Apocalypse' involved a reference to another video game franchise.Again, 'RE: Apocalypse' is not completely bad. Although few, it has its moments. Mike Epps has his funny lines and his one encounter with the Nemesis brought laughs from the entire audience, which was something needed in the film. The Nemesis was done well a majority of the time (although there is a bit where the big oaf crashes through a wall and h",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only IMDb Bottom 100 # 1 satisfies me,"In order to write this comment, I scanned the film by fast forwarding to remember, did not watch it again, but still you can't imagine how it was agonizing. Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins with a bad opening scene that everything is explained in a scratchy way and we see pictures from the previous movie. As some people say, yes, mostly the scenes that zombies appear are very odd, so frustrating, it is not slow motion, it is not digital camera, I don't know what it is, but it is not entertaining for sure. Zombies do not walk very slowly and they are not fast like the zombie movies called next generation zombie movies. I cannot tell anything more! The whole movie is almost non stop action, but every action scene is extremely tasteless and sometimes too showy, so if you ask me no entertainment, I don't know whether there is such a word or not, but this movie is anti fun in most parts. Moreover, a heavy rock music in every action scene, helicopter sounds, walkie talkie sounds that's what the director understand from stylish film. Set designs are too superficial. There is a terrible looking and very ridiculous monster called Nemesis (wow! Nemesis is in the movie! people say) who can say only S.T.A.R.S. Even stop motion King Kong in 1933 was much more impressive than this. The plot is nothing, uninteresting. A high school student who plays the game would write a much much more better script, I am seriously sure. In a scene, the monster and Alice fight each other, but they are in a kind of tournament!! However, every bad has its worse, it gets more and more ridiculous, tasteless. This movie is the zombie version of Battlefield Earth to me, so the end of the world!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
So sad it hurts,"(Excuse me if my English's at bit rusty)I saw ""the Grand opening"" of Resident Evil :Apocalypse. There wasn't much Grand about it...I'm a fan of the videogames, actually me and my friends loved the first game so much that we almost cried every time we had too turn it of. I also enjoyed the first movie. Most of it was true too the games and the story wasn't that bad. It's the best video game-based movie ever made at least. With this in mind I went too RE:Apocalypse with hope in my heart. This was gonna be a good movie I said to my self. And I saw it...I saw it and refused too admit that the movie was bad. Actually it was terrible but I just couldn't admit it to my self. Until the next morning. This movie REALLY stinks!! The story's a mess, the characters unpersonal, the zombiescnes too few and the irritating onliners too many. What really bugs me of is Nemesis. Nemesis should not have computersight a lá Terminator, he shouldn't let anyone who's in his way survive and he should not I repeat NOT ally with ANYBODY AT ANY TIME! Nemesis should be a senseless killingmachine, nothing more nothing less.Now, the movie may have some fun parts and some eye candy action scenes(most of them filmed as if the cameraman had a epilepsy attack while jumping on a trampoline) so if you're never have played the game you might enjoy it. The special effects has improved a bit too but still they aren't anything extraordinary. But if you're a Resident Evil thinking that this movie may be OK because it's based on the game...abandon that thought now.Too sum things up. If you see Resident Evil: Apocalypse as a braindead actionmovie, you might enjoy it and see it again. If you see Reasident Evil:Apocalypse as a fan of the games, bring a bucket and tissues. You're gonna barf and cry so much it hurts. I did.",,Anonymous,Horror
Boring.  Like watching a video game over someone's shoulder.,"I went to see this movie because I was attending a friend's weekly movie outing. That's two hours I wish I had back.It's like watching a video game over someone's shoulder.There are editing gaffs, zero depth characters, boring affect, ""surprises"" and ""thrills"" that are telegraphed far ahead of time. The plotting was not tight, the set up for a sequel (either movie or video game) was clumsy and overlong.If you're going to make up a city, don't be so obvious about the filming in Toronto.And talk about idiot plots, did *nobody* in Raccoon City have a long distance telephone, an internet connection, or even a ham radio?",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Error,"Strange that they say Chernobyl is in Russia - In reality it's in the Ukraine where Milla Jovovich was born (Kiev) Kiev is 100km south of Chernobyl.I enjoyed the film - but I do not play games so know nothing of the RE series.The ending was a bit obvious with the reference to the next film in the series (to be made in 2006) - great.The only negative comments I would make are: 1. in the blurriness of some of the action scenes - when you try to watch frame-by-frame there's nothing to see. 2. at the end when she is regaining her memory it looks like a re-run of ""The Fifth Element""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
<sigh>,"Well, i never expected a master piece, but i did hope for a Van Helsing-esque brainless (and bad) but enjoyable film. Sadly it delivers on neither fronts. The only reason i can see why people enjoyed this film is because they may have mental problems or be 5 years old. Seriously there is little to no merit i can give this film. The Alien franchise was ripped off ridiculously, the direction was sloppy, characters weren't developed, plot was poor, ending absurd. I'l admit i haven't played games really at all so wont comment on their portrayal in the film. The token black guy did make me laugh, if only he wasn't a walking cliché. Nemesis looked silly, from what i've seen of him the game he looks cool, here, he didn't. Another thing, the characters are the most stupid you'll ever see. EVER.""dont worry, we'll be safe in this graveyard, i cant see any undead anywhere..... oh wait, no, they're everywhere""Thats how bad it was, they went to a graveyard expecting safety. Also, for some reason they gave Alice super powers (why?) and Nemesis found his heart and it was all sooo stupid. Don't pay money to see this film. I am glad i saw it just because of the video games, without them this would be nothing",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Directer probably thought Milla Jovovich would make big bucks, instead she ruined everything","When Resident Evil the Movie was first released in 2002, we were wowed by probably the most successful game to movie adaption ever, even thought all the characters were original and ""The Hive"" was a new feature,But In this movie when you try to combine Milla Jovovich's character Alice with a loosely based plot from Resident Evil 3:Nemesis, disaster strikes, I think the movie would have been a whole lot better WITHOUT HER, c-mon a superhuman hero and Zombie movies don't mix.Another thing being as a fan of the Resident Evil game series, I was extremely disappointed in how the Nemesis character was portrayed, in the game he's an unstopable killing machine, in the Movie he's a bit of a puppy, I was also hoping to see the Hunters as well, they didn't comeThere is one thing they can do to save the movie: Re-release it with a plot more tied into RE2 and 3, and also get rid of Alice",,Anonymous,Horror
Much worse than the first one,"Where the first ""Resident Evil"" did quite well in capturing the look and feel of the video games while also managing to score as a surprisingly good horror film, this second one fails in all points. Nothing is left of those creepy tunnels of the hive or the scare of zombies in the dark. Instead all is replaced by a whole city. Wisely used, this setting would work as well as the first one. Instead, the director uses it as a huge playground for stunt and demolition displays of the most uninspired kind. He really likes to break glass and blow stuff up. And he likes the female characters doing stupid and pointless matrix-like martial arts. Another point for criticism is the way this movie ist cut. Very often, the cuts are lightning-fast, jump around locations and would suit a music video much more than a horror movie. The same applies to the frequently used way to show moving zombies. It is a strobe-like visual effect that results in staccato movement of the zombies. For many visual and action elements of the movie, the director doesn't use own ideas, but seems to have watched quite a lot of action movies with similar content an tries to copy as best he can. Not much success here. Reading this, you might ask yourself: O.k., there are flaws in craftsmanship, but is there at least an interesting or in any way innovative story to it? Well, no.Enough bashing now. So what is the recipe of the whole thing? Take the Resident Evil concept, strip it down to only the action parts of it, make up a generic story, stuff in two scanty-dressed heroines and a rubber monster, stir well and blow everything up. Done. If this works for you, you will be entertained. For me it didn't.Rating: 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Obsolutely the best on out of the RE trilogy!,"I was so disappointed by the first RE movie when it came out. The first RE movie was a good film, but as die-hard RE fan, it's just disappointing to see they dropped the feeling from the game series and made it to an average zombie film.They definitely changed the attitude after hearing feedback from the first one and made a great integration of innovation and ideas from the game into RE:A.And not only that, they've also found the trend of how RE story goes in the games (like the super-human power Wesker got in RE:codeX game) and made it part of the main storyline of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Upsetting,"With Resident Evil 2 being just about the best game ever, and the first resident evil being just about average, i thought that maybe, just maybe, this film might have provided some entertainment. Unfortunately, all it managed to do was shatter all of my wonderful memories of the classic playstation experience. So I'll keep this brief as it is just too painful.The direction of this film can be explained in no other way than just plain irritating. Aimed at people with an attention span of roughly less than a second, the film never manages to stick with one shot long enough for you to actually take in anything, and the fight scenes are so jerkily shot that you have to simply take an educated guess that its the zombies who are getting beaten up. Awful dialogue is combined cleverly with worse acting to achieve a spectacularly terrible spectacle. To cap things off, Jill Valentine (an absolute legend from the games) is pathetically underwritten almost to the point of obscurity. Seeing her in that famous little blue top partially compensated though.Maybe not up (or down) to the horrific computer game-to-movie standards set by Mortal Kombat, but Resident Evil:Apocalypse still managed to annoy, bore and upset me in equal measures. 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
resident evil 2 covers RE3,"despite its follower (extinction) this film actually covers majority of the video game (RE3:N) it takes place in glorious raccoon city. the nemesis has joined the party, but you can clearly tell that the film makers threw in their own ingredients for the story. the nemesis was only created to see how ""strong"" Alice is. the nemesis only sticks to his true nature (from the game) when he is first introduced as he is blowing away the STARS members, then he is just an obstacle that Alice must over come. i wasn't very fond of the ""boss"" battle, who is stronger, Alice or Nemesis.good-stuck to the game, included Jill valentine and nemesis. nemesis looked great but purpose was altered bad-the zombie attacks seemed unorganized. it was like the film makers said, lets throw in a bunch here, there. don't get me wrong, yea its ""zombie flick"" but extinction felt more like a video game (crows first, super zombies second, then boss battle) in apocalypse, the zombies seemed as if no one cared when they arrived. nemesis boss battle (alive vs nemesis) was dumb-who is stronger? i wanted an actual creature to mutate (like the licker or Dr. Isaacs from the other films) summary-its enjoyable, its there, i enjoyed extinction better (despite it didn't stick to any of the games)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terminator goes zombie,"I didn't care much for either RE movies. Its like the directors only are inspired by the action part of the game and not the brilliantly creepy atmosphere that I loved so much. Where is the part where our heroes walks alone in a giant scary mansion trying to survive all kinds of horrors, like they do in the first 3 games? NOWHERE!!! Its like the style of both movies are inspired by the fourth and least creepy game, ""Codename Veronica"" , with the exception of the Terminator like mutant zombie in RE:Apocalypse, that obviously is taken from the third game ""Nemesis"", and with success. It looks much like the mutant in the game and he also acts the same way.But what i find really annoying, especially with RE:Apocalypse, is the marvel comic action that the movies are packed with. I didn't get the feeling, while playing the games, that the heroes were SUPER heroes, but i certainly do that when I'm watching the movies. It takes out all the suspense and horror (which leave only action) when Jovovich fires a one-liner, while hanging in the air kicking 5 zombies to ""death"" at the same time. And the worst part is, that ALL heroes in RE:Apocalypse are like that. Its just as scary to look at as watching ""X-men"". Jovovichs arrival in the church says all that i feel about especially this sequel. Laughable and ridiculous.Now i can only look forward to the cinema versions of ""Silent Hill"" and ""Fatal Frame"" and hope that they wont be ruined as much as Resident Evil was.I'm sure that when the second sequel to Resident Evil comes up i wouldn't be surprised if Jovovich learns how to fly... Yikes!I gave it 3 out of 10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good film.,"beautiful film. Very good of action. Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head.",,Anonymous,Horror
What a shame.,"I really liked the first one, but they seem to have gotten it all wrong on this one.The story does not really have a clear structure but is very predictable anyway. Additionally, most of the characters are pretty flat and the attempts they made to discuss a bit of ethics or morality failed terribly. While in the first RE they had some ambiguous characters on the verge between good and evil who develop during the movie, the division between good and bad is extremely simple and profane in RE-A. They couldn't keep up the frightening atmosphere which was just so great in the first part but tried to go with some slow-mo pictures which merely remind of some really cheap B movie. And to top it off, a lot of elements are clearly stolen from other movies, without really being references.Milla Jovovich is great again, but everything else in this movie just spoils the opportunity to enjoy her performance.All that one can hope for is that there will be no further sequel, although one has to fear this could happen someday. Which finally at least gives one scaring aspect to this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
It wasn't bad at all.,"I really liked the movie. I don't think it was geared toward all audiences, but mainly for those that truly follow the game and can truly enjoy the inner plot of the movie. The only thing that bothered me a bit, but was still OK, was that Nemesis helped out in the end. In the game Nemesis was a bad-a who didn't take any crap. I love some of the inner sequencing that gave homage to the games like RE: Code Veronica. The scene towards the end when Alice is running from a helicopter and the helicopter is shooting at her is from RE: CV. It's awesome. In the game, which the character running the scene is Claire, does the same type of scene and the ending of the scene in both the game and movie is alike. They get stopped by security, drop the gun, catch it halfway down and fire at them. I hope they make a third. If they do, I'm there.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
