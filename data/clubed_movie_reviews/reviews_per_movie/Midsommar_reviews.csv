Good and bad,"Since I'm swedish I found this really funny and absurd, the wierd traditions were obviously inspired from The Wickerman more than the actual swedish tradition, Midsommar. I'm also really glad I watched it in my home and not at the cinema with other people, because there were scenes I laughed at and I didn't want to laugh at scenes with others, becuase it wasn't really funny. I coudn't help laughing, but at the same time feel really uncomfortable. I enjoyed this movie a lot, every scene made me intrigued and dumbfounded.

How can something so f-ed up be so beautiful,"It is worth saying upfront that MidSommar should be a very divisive movie. If you tend to watch mostly popular movies or standard horror films, Midsommar is not for you.
Which explains the amount of 1 out of 10 reviews here on IMDb, despite an overall 7.1 rating.But if you don't mind a slow building narrative with tension, innovative cinematography and plenty of look-away gore, then you might be able to appreciate just how unique Midsommar really is.Briefly - MidSommar shows us a group of friends going on what seems like an idyllic trip to the Midsummer festival in a village in Northern Sweden. But that quickly turns into a harrowing display of Pagan rituals and ceremonies.The movie is long because it's not afraid to take its time explaining the background of the characters (the group of friends and particularly the young woman in which it focuses). So from the start you can feel that this will be a different experience from most horror films.But the movie really takes off once they arrive in Sweden. And it goes a long way to explain why Ari Aster is being so buzzed as a new director. Some of the shots shown are, at least in my book, completely outside the norm. And early on help you involve in the world of the film, and in the experience of the main characters.In the terms of cinematography, it is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. And that becomes an even more impressive achievement because of its contrast with the horrid gore images displayed throughout the movie.The grass's green, the floral arrangements, the group dances, everything really paints a picturesque image of the Midsommar festivities. Despite all the unexpected events the characters are witnessing, that sense is kept all throughout 2h30 of film.All of the imagery helped me, as a viewer, to truly feel in the perspective of the characters. Walking into the festival, hopeful, experience the shock of everything that happens in front of them.I felt I too went on that trip with the characters, and I was shocked again and again together with them. It stuck with me for hours on end after watching. Which is one the best complements I can make to the work of a director in my view.Truly recommended it if you are up to watching a different yet aesthetically beautiful piece of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie was a trip,"I'm not sure how but the movie had me on edge the entire time. You have to enjoy cinematography to really enjoy this. I left the movie like I just came down from a high. The whole thing felt like a bad trip afterwards, I was pleased and not at the same time but I think that's how we're meant to feel.

Too weird for me...,"This is really weird stuff. Not real horror, but more of a psychological mindbender.The bad: it doesnt really get scary or thrilling. It gets weird allright.The good: decent acting in a incredibly weird mindbending script.Not suited for casual viewers.",,Anonymous,Horror
"A surreal, but pretty awesome trip.","Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved. The second half is very trippy, and we delve into the world of pagan ritual and bizarre rights, which makes The Whicker Man look like a tea party.The main leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, were terrific. Pugh had impressed previously in The Little Drummer Girl, it was obvious she was destined for big things, she played Dani with a real sense of torment, very impressive. The cast had a realism, it was refreshing not to watch a cast that look set for a Dior catwalk.It won't be for everyone, and I must point out that some scenes are painfully long, needlessly. Some amazing special effects.Violence and nudity, but neither are gratuitous or simply for shock. A few laughs, several times the cinema erupted in laughter.Very good. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wtf did I just watch?,"Looking at the end credits right now and the only frase that comes to mind, is ""what the actual crap?!"" This is easily one of the most disturbing movies I've seen. Yet it is impossible to look away, and almost kind of soothing in a way.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Operatic Catharsis On Emotional Dependency,"""I have always felt held. By a family... a real family. Do you feel held?""One of the most universal and innately human desires is a sense of belonging. The human brain is not meant to be alone; we are evolved to be a part of something. Belonging fundamentally allows us to form our own sense of identity, establish social connections through community, and provides us with love, attention, security, and purpose. Perhaps more importantly, a lack of belonging is when we begin to lose sense of ourselves and who we are. This loss of touch with who we are when the world around us suddenly disappears... this slight loss of footing, dip in reality, always feeling somewhat displaced and perpetually unsettled... this encapsulates the mood of Ari Aster's Midsommar.Aster has delivered a psychedelic genre-defying horror fable that wins its audience by creeping into our darkest corners of angst, longing, and loneliness. At its core, the film is about a young woman who copes with crippling anxiety rooted in a desperate and fearful need for love as she comes to terms with the end of a relationship. It's about anxiety, fear of abandonment, and moving on. It is a meditation on human belonging; an operatic catharsis played on the strings of emotional dependency; a journey both inward and outward, to finally let go of something that was never meant to be.Midsommar is not a mystery or suspense movie. It unveils itself unapologetically, as if the filmmaker has no intention of hiding anything from us in the first place (the entire movie is visually depicted almost constantly in the background on walls or tapestries). Yet the film establishes its own rhythm and pacing. As the characters embark on a mushroom trip and grow weightless and spacey, so do we get entranced by the beautiful Swedish settings and sounds--at times indistinguishable from flutes being played by characters on-screen, and at other times, woven with a spell-binding aural hypnosis (listen to ""Attestupan"" without falling into a meditative trip).Like Hereditary before it, the casting is exceptional. Florence Pugh portrays and embodies isolation and anxiety so effectively that the ideas feel nearly concrete. Her part as Dani demands an incredible range and her commitment to the role is apparent. Her character has an air of desperation to her. A perfect casting for a lonely soul. Jack Reynor, a critical piece to this opera as the unlikeable and detached boyfriend, also delivers in a solid performance that leaves us conflicted, or at the very least, challenged.If Satan and Cannibal Corpse got together to shoot Blue Valentine in Sweden, I'd imagine it would be something like Midsommar. Aster taps into a dark and vulnerable place--he opens the door to chests you may have locked away and have had no intention of coming back to. If you've gone through a break-up recently, it may resonate even stronger. It's uncomfortable, unpleasant, but ultimately, cathartic.The director goes on to describe the film as almost a perverse wish-fulfillment fantasy. You see what you want to see. The inclusion of this overarching idea bears a universal relevance to how we can behave in the midst of the most toxic relationships. Entering the ethereal fog of HÃ¥rga perhaps a metaphor for willfully indulging in our clouded judgment to escape our fears.If Hereditary was a thematic exploration of inescapable fate, Midsommar is a tighter, more centered thematic reflection on emotional dependence. The thought given to the characters and script and the details within the various shots, symbols, and sounds will all surely leave many viewers coming back for more.Plan to watch it twice, if for nothing else, to drink the tea again.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not for everyone,"Let me first say, this is not a ""bad"" movie. It utilizes creative camera work and cinematography to add to the narrative. But I personally still didn't like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn't appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"'You can check out any time you like, But you can never leave!' (Hotel California)","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library, not my wife's type of movie.This was made by the same writer/director that brought us ""Hereditary"" a year earlier, I like this one much more. It is confusing much of the time but when it is all over you realize it is a fable of sorts for the lead character, Dani, to come to some resolution from the loss of her family and coming to terms with her dud of a boyfriend.Look up the entire lyrics of 'Hotel California' by The Eagles, with this movie in mind you can find many parallels.I already was a Florence Pugh fan from her roles in Lady MacBeth (2016) and Fighting With My Family (2019). Here she is Dani who tragically loses her sister and parents, in grief accompanies her boyfriend and three other guys to Sweden in late June to witness, and ultimately participate in, a ritualistic Pagan festival. But it also goes deeper, to the core of the group's beliefs. By the end Dani achieves resolution, the other four are not so fortunate.This is a really strange movie once they get to Sweden, there is very explicit and gory violence, there is a big non-erotic sex scene with a number of nude characters. Everything is designed to shock the senses of the viewer. I would not like to see movies like this on a regular basis but as a one-off experience I found it a totally worthwhile 2 1/2 hours.",,Anonymous,Horror

Pros and Cons. You decide!,"Let me give objective pros and cons, and then I will present my personal opinion:Pros:1- Good story. Don't expect something original anyway.2- Good ending, but it really depends how do you understand it.3- Good cinematography.4- Good acting specifically Florence Pugh.5- Good building of tension and suspense.Cons:1- It is really too lengthy. Scenes pass too slowly. Expect to get bored several times in the movie.2- Most of the time is wasted on marginal details, while the most important scenes are passed quickly.3- Very stupid behaviors of some characters who are supposed to be smarter. This is frustrating in the movie.4- A main character who can significantly enrich the movie died early. This makes most of the remaining of the movie revolve about poor repetitive ideas.Now my personal opinion. If the movie is shortened to only 90 minutes, and postpones the first dying character to the end scenes, I can rate this movie easily with 8 or 9 points. But getting bored several times in the movie with a lot of repetitive ideas, this will decrease my rating to 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Summer time,"Let's get right into it. The movie will divide viewers. Actually some might not even read what I'm typing right now, dismissing or liking my review just based on the score I gave it. I'm not complaining or trying to get your attention. I gave this a 10/10, something that many would consider sacred (like how some people view trees or other things). But I think the movie deserves it. And while I watched the theatrical version in cinemas, I did watch the Directors Cut the other day too to get a complete picture - no pun intended.Now I know that pacing will be an issue for some - this takes its time and those expecting horror or their version of horror, will have quite a few issues with the movie. Especially in the long version (almost 3 hours). But the framing, the pictures you get are worth it. I would argue that if you ask Ari, why he chose that or this angle, why he lingered on that shot, why he used special effects that are subtle and almost not unnoticeable ... he will be able to answer them. He probably won't, letting you decipher and decide what you just watched, but he had a plan. He really knows his stuff.Now that doesn't mean that you will like the movie. Just because it is made with love and care and attention to every detail, does not make it invincible. It is a taste thing - what do you like to watch in movies. Subtle horror, that is also a drama? Nods to classics like Wicker Man? Will you hate this because to heighten things it takes creative liberty? I don't know if the sun thing (allegedly some claim it is positioned wrong geographically) is a mistake or actually another detail, to make this even more eerie. The costumes may not be traditional, but what the village people do, hopefully isn't traditional either ... if you get hung up on those things, you would be missing the bigger picture. This is not here to critisize or make fun of swedish traditions. This is here to entertain and to hold the viewers suspense - edge of the seat kind of stuff.So yes this isn't your regular horror movie and it is better for it. And while there is not much violence in it (on screen), the occasional outbursts are really spiking! This is not for the faint hearted or the easily offended ... be aware and have the strong stomach to get through it. This is beautiful and horrifying at the same time and really demands to be seen many times - every time you do, you will discover something new!

A Mesmerizing and Gorgeous 140 min Slow Burn Behemoth,"Good: Hands down the production and cinematography are amazing and truly comes to life over the course of the film to emphasize the film's purpose/themes. The cast overall is great, each one playing their role respectively whether it is an outsider or a cult member, especially Florence Pugh who goes through a lot over the course of the film.Bad: The film moves relatively at a great pace until near the 3rd act and then takes its time to craft its ending and at times dragged and started to get stale. There are so many clues/culture traditions learned through brief images of paintings and drawings in the community. Although this serves great for analysis and more viewings as a first watch it is a lot to comprehend and can be confusing near the end if you do not remember some of the drawings. It goes without saying that the characters do not make the smartest of decisions and there are quite a few horror cliches.Overall: The film triumphs in creating a beautiful yet disturbing atmosphere in broad daylight. There are powerful performances filled with emotions. However, the run-time goes a little past its run time and an ending that was not the most satisfying. Although I'll be back for more viewings to see the easter eggs and hidden clues, I personally prefer ""Hereditary"" over this one.3.5/5*Pro-Tip look at the painting/drawings from right to left

Weak plot tries to compensate with shock & gore,"The movie starts out promising and with the interesting backdrop of a Swedish pagan cults. However, it succeeds only in shocking with horrifying imagery of bursting heads/faces and other violence that serves only to hide the fact that this movie is bad at everything else.
The character development is extremely bad. We are supposed to care about the main character so the writers came up with a shocking and sad beginning. But we still dont develop much sympathy because the main character (yes I already forgot the name) acts unreasonably and there are no real moments where we get close to her.
The plot is extremely foreseeable. Without wanting to spoil much, all characters from the group going to Sweden have happen exactly what you'd expect to happen to them. There is no finesse in story-telling at all and instead cheap attempts at foreshadowing end up as just another horror-movie cliche.
The camera work is OK but often too bright and sometimes turns for no reason. It is an attempt of foreshadowing or setting the atmosphere but it is lost on me.All in all, this movie might be for you if you like to be shocked by violence in a novel setting.

Don't listen to the negative reviewers for this one.,"First of all I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention to the negative reviewers on here. Normally I tend to listen more to the negative than the positive reviewers as often there are alot of fake positive reviews from people involved in a movie. But in this case the high rating it got from more then 100000 voters made me watch it, and I can't say I regret it. The cinematography is great, the acting is pretty good, and the story is captivating. I'm normally not a big fan of long movies, and in this case I even watched the director's cut that is 30 minutes longer, and never did I get a boring feeling. For that the story is too suspenseful, there is an evil dark ambiance to it that wants you to watch more. Movies about cults are most of the time interesting to watch as those people have a complete different lifestyle to ours, and mostly because they're deranged and/or brainwashed. Watching crazy people act weird, isn't that entertainment? To me it is for sure. Ari Aster did a very good job with this movie, that slow building tension all a long is brilliant.

"I was hard on this film the first time around during the Rona Virus lockdown, it's really good.","First time around this movie pissed me off, the fact he was going to dump her then everything happens, he decides to go to Sweden with her when he should have said no, and then all their friends just go as well?

They were all wimps who couldn't figure a way out or kick some butt when things started to get weird and being a guy who would figure a way out as would my friends ha ha, it's a hard pill to swallow watching them go down, you dont even care really.

Didn't do it for me,"'Midsommar' (2019)Opening thoughts: It took me a long time to get round to watching 'Midsommar', due to not having time or the opportunity to watch it easily. Have always appreciated the genre it fits in, where there are many great films, and Florence Pugh showed a lot of promise seeing her for the first time in 'Little Women'. That it was also directed by the director responsible for the very good 'Hereditary' intrigued me too. The premise was one of those could have gone either way ones, it was advertised bizarrely and the critical reception was very polarising, particularly from those that didn't like it.After seeing 'Midsommar', count me in as somebody who didn't care for it. It is not an awful film and there are things done right, including an intriguing start, but the second half was a bizarre and tedious mess, so this viewer is this case more understanding of those who didn't like the film than liked. This has absolutely nothing to do with not understanding what 'Midsommar' was going to be or going for, quite the opposite, the issue is that it doesn't achieve its aims very well at all.Good things: 'Midsommar' does have good things. It is a very well made film visually, with photography that is both dreamlike and nightmarish in all the necessary places. The scenery is also absolutely beautiful, while also with a suitably ominous atmosphere. Did think too that the film started off well, with an unsettling opening that was creepy and suspenseful. The sacrifice scene was similarly suitably horrifying, with it being the scariest (and goriest) the film got.Regarding the acting, to me it was quite good considering what was given to them (which actually come to think of it wasn't much). Pugh anchors the film beautifully in a compellingly tortured lead performance.Bad things: However, there are also a lot of drawbacks. Most of the characters are incredibly thinly sketched and behave annoyingly and/or illogically. Pugh has the only character that has any development or who is interesting. Some friends thought that Will Poulter's character had the most personality, to me actually he was annoying and his presence jarred with the rest of the atmosphere. The direction did have some slickness but got very slack and muddled later on the more weird the second half became.The script has nothing memorable, is very stilted and can fall into self-indulgence. The story and pacing are the weakest aspects of 'Midsommar'. The story starts off with great atmosphere and intrigue, but post the sacrifice scene any creepiness and sense of horror pretty much completely goes. Meaning that the second half is incredibly long winded, this out increasingly (at times non-existent) and is bizarre to the point of near-incoherence. Especially the dragged out and truly daft climax that ends on an abrupt, incomplete feeling note and one of the silliest and most unintentionally funny sex scenes in recent years.Some of the intended creepy behaviours of the cult were potentially unnerving and sounded it on paper but were under-explored and/or left as loose ends or implied. A much shorter length definitely would have helped the pacing and atmosphere, the film is overlong and could have easily been trimmed by 25-30 minutes which would have tightened the pace. Which would have been achieved if scenes were made shorter and if motivations went into more detail.Closing thoughts: Overall, underwhelming.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Midsommar,"I've previously seen Hereditary and it was one of the best movies in 2018 so seeing this movie from Ari Aster, my expectations were high. Although I have to say it is not on the same level, it is still a pretty good psychological horror. The cinematography is so gorgeous which makes it all so much more contrasting and horrific. The sound is always spot on but Florence Pugh was the true heart of this movie. She has such a wide range of emotions, is subtle when has to be subtle but makes a big perfect scene when she has too. Demonstrating all her skills, she'll go far in the industry! Still think she should've been nominated for this role instead of Little Women but I guess the important thing is that she's nominated. The screenplay is fantastic, setting up the movie in a suspenseful way. It didn't feel slow-paced to me, more like medium-paced, if that's a thing, since it always had something to grab my attention, Truly recommend it you go see it and like ""he"" says, try to keep an open mind about it!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yeah nothing beats a bizzare and crazy rituals to make you sane.If youre expecting horror and monsters or supernatural, keep going.

Ari Aster back at it again,"I believe that even after just his second feature Ari Aster's name will be synonymous with bizarre/polarizing/dreadful cinema; his name might even become an adjective/verb or a categorization for film altogether (Lynchian, for instance).This movie kind of left about the same impression Hereditary left me with after the first view. After my first viewing of Hereditary I felt that it was just good, after a few more viewings and analyses, I now consider it a genius take on trauma and grief. I have a feeling this is what I'm going to come to realize from Midsommar. It was definitely insane with surreal imagery, but I honestly wish there was more backstory to Dani and her family; if there was more of a fleshed out concept about Dani and her family I feel like the movie would've have a more circular conclusion. But now knowing the kind of filmmaker Aster is shaping up to be, I don't think closure is what he aims for at all, leaving just enough to the imagination to push your buttons even further.Florence Pugh humanizes the surreal scenes with her presence. She's a great anchor for the plot.Definitely going to be taking another look at this.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ambitious but Overlong,"First off, anyone who planned to see this movie
should go in with an open mind. It's a movie going experience that is very difficult to describe. Ari Aster film delivers on being very disturbing and gruesome but suffers from major pacing issues.The good: the cinematography, acting, colors and music are nearly flawless. It is one of the most technically stunning films you will see. The music makes the film all the more unsettling at times and the camera shots can linger for so long it begins to make you nervous. The acting is solid specifically from Pugh. Will Poulter is funny at times and intentionally annoying as almost all his characters are. If you were expecting hereditary part 2, you may want to reconsider.While this film just gets crazier and crazier as it goes, it can be hard to forget that this story is Dani's and that's where you will find what this movie is truly about. It's about an unstable relationship that decays and eventually explodes and forces a new cycle of self-discovery. You will probably need to read articles or watch videos on this movie when you come out like I did.Now on to the issues. This movie is long. And I enjoy long movies. Hereditary was perfectly paced but there are numerous scenes in this movie that could be trimmed down or cut. People will say it adds to the movie as a whole but some don't. Also, there are supposed to be some genuinely unsettling scenes but almost everyone in the theater burst out laughing. Nudity can be a hard thing to take seriously when it's showed like this, but I understand that some pagan rituals actually do that, so i understand where it's coming from. While the climax is far from as unforgettable as hereditary, the story does come full circle and will leave you with an unsettling final shot.Overall, Aster's sophomore film doesn't reach the heights of hereditary, but still provides much of what people loved about that movie. You will most likely walk out of the theater thinking wtf did I just watch, but that's the point. It's a film that requires multiple viewings and some research to truly appreciate.

Trying to achieve shock value but ultimately fails.,"We have seen this film before in the form of The Wicker Man 1973. That film was unique, informative and shared a story of depravity in the name of paganism. It's was a shocking film because it built up a certain momentum and although characters where clearly disturbed, we as an audience still felt empathy and tried to embrace their unorthodox approach to life. The final act of The Wicker Man is shocking and the last few scenes can really stir up some serious nausea. Midsommar tries to replicate that feeling of utter disarray but falls flat and becomes predictable. Character development could have been used more. I did enjoy one or two major scenes and I thought they really got the claustrophobic intensity down to a tee. Some scenes tried to pull off the shock factor but anyone watching will probably just think to laugh to throw off their awkwardness or people may just think it's just a tad bit silly over all. It doesn't really come across horrific as I'm guessing it intended. The main actress is good, you can really see how immerse she becomes within the role of a foreigner trapped in a inescapable world.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Self-indulgent, pretentious piece of garbage","This is basically a hipster version of ""Wicker Man"", only overly long, pretentious and with highly unlikable characters.Don't look for any hidden meanings, it's all pretty much on the nose, but it's dealt with a lot of pretense and utterly boring. Of course it's celebrated by half-intellectual wannabe film critics, a true product of our time.Now, I wouldn't say that it's incompetently made, though. It has some nice shots, maybe even an interesting premise, but it ultimately fails by being unable to draw you in and by having an astounding upside-down moral view on things. I was appalled at how this film handles the evualuation of its characters' actions, the implausible reactions and the overall conclusion.

A very long and bad trip,"Didn't expect anything from this movie, but it failed to delivery even the slightest bit. The characters are unrelatable and unsympathetic, so you don't really care if they live or not. The singing, dancing, moaning really puts you off the suspense path, so the movie doesn't even feel scary, just a bit disturbing and popping the question ""why the hell am I wasting my time on this?""",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not a normal horror! No spoilers.,"If you're idea of a good horror is based around slashers, jump scares and bad acting, then you will HATE this movie. Its not for you. It's deep, detailed and a slow burn journey to a satisfying (yet haunting) finale.If, like me, you think the most horrifying thing in the world is mankind, then you'll love it!Midsommar draws its genre of a ""horror"" movie by highlighting the twisted, selfish, depravity of the human psyche. It depicts the absolute horrors we as mankind are capable of and not only choose, but religiously plan to execute for ""the greater good"". The most terrifying part? This type of story is based on historical fact! Ritualistic human sacrifices can be seen in ancient cultures all over the world from Pagan to Mayan.The script is limited, but I believe this is by choice. Sometimes actions speak louder than words; and sometimes the words left unspoken say the most.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and Florence Pughs performance is (as always) excellent!Overall, I'd recommend this. But I'm not a fan of slasher movies or ghost stories.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beautiful but lacking reason,"There are heavy echoes of 'The Wicker Man' in 'Midsommar', whose ordinary protagonists are drawn into a strange rural community which practices a re-imagining of traditional folk rituals, upotian and sinister at the same time. The aesthetics of the community are beautifully realised, and the film also suggests some interesting (though never fully developed) ideas about cult behaviour. What's lacking (and where it differs from its distinguished predecessor) is the complete absence of how and why, nor is there any sense that any of the community members holds anything less than 100% belief. It's might seem a strange comment on a horror movie, but I would have preferred a little more sociology and economics.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sadly Disappointing,"Maybe I need some more time to think about it, but as of right now I am very disappointed in this film. I didn't hate it, I loved the cinematography, shot composition, and Florence Pugh's performance was pretty fantastic. Some of the other actors were good and some others were not so good. I love Ari Aster and his direction, and I loved his previous film Hereditary, which makes this one even more disappointing. I thought it was pretty repetitive and boring, there were a lot of scenes I felt could've been cut, and it probably would've been better. Also, I thought the film was quite pretentious and self indulgent. This was one of my most anticipated films of the year and I wish I could've liked it more.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great entry into the ""Folk Horror"" subgenre","Not sure what all of these bad reviews are for....probably written by people who have never appreciated films like the original Wicker Man. Very stylish, beautifully shot and very well done. It has some truly haunting imagery...anyone who says this isn't horror has a very narrow definition and pedestrian expectations. Suspenseful and makes you think about the nature of relationships as well as the power or religious belief over the human mind. Could also fall under the ""breakup movie"" and ""revenge film"" subgenres. One of my favorite more recent Horror/ Suspense/ Thrillers. There is a lot of black humor laced throughout and I found it intentionally funny at times (so buzz off: people commenting that there were laughs in the theater). The psychedelic episodes were enough to give anyone who has experienced hallucinogenic drugs a flashback. Only criticism is, like most (if not all) films of this nature, it relies on characters making poor decisions in order to advance the plot. But that is the nature of many a Horror film and you could argue those bad decisions and judgments are the crux of films like this. Comes across like a beautiful, folky, waking nightmare. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
a sunny nightmare,"Greetings again from the darkness. Summer movies are traditionally tentpoles and teen flicks ... big budget action movies and those aimed at an audience that are on a 3 month reprieve from school. We are quickly learning that rising star filmmaker Ari Aster cares little for tradition. Well at least he seems to thrive on twisting tradition and spinning off in an unusual direction. His feature film debut was last year's mega-hit HEREDITARY, a horror film which was noted in most every critics association Top 10 list for 2018.HEREDITARY was filled with darkness and dread, and Mr. Aster's second film begins with a similar setting: it's a dark and cold night as Dani (Florence Pugh, LADY MACBETH) frantically searches for her bi-polar sister through emails and phone calls. During her search, we realize that her relationship with boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor, SING STREET) is a bit strained. The brilliant pre-credit sequence results in a horrific tragedy striking Dani's family. Christian does his best to offer support, but he's a typically weasel of a man who feels more at ease hanging out with his grad school buddies than providing love and compassion to his needy girlfriend ... and he's not man enough to tell her, despite the urging of his friends.An awkward group conversation leads Dani to accept an invitation to go on the boys' trip to Sweden. The purpose of the trip is twofold: to participate in a 9 day long village festival held every 90 years and for Josh (William Jackson Harper, ""The Good Place"") to work on his thesis. The other guys in the group are Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) whose family in Sweden is hosting the festival, and Mark (Will Poulter, THE REVENANT) who provides much of the comic relief thanks to his overall cluelessness about pretty much everything related to graceful societal interactions.And with that set-up comes one of the most deranged, unsettling and bizarre movie experiences this year (or most any year) is likely to bring. Try to picture a Folk Horror Comedy Fairy Tale Break-up Pagan Cult film, which at any given time reminds of MOTHER!, THE WICKER MAN, THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE VILLAGE, SUSPIRIA, and a handful of other cinematic oddities we've seen over the years. It is quite likely the sunniest horror film you've ever seen. And that's a literal description ... like the production could have been solar-powered. Most of it is filmed outside during Sweden's Midnight Sun - constant sunshine accompanied by mostly bright white skin and even brighter white cotton costumes (embroidered as if meant for Woodstock). The daylight messes with your senses and expectations. Bad things are supposed to happen in the dark, not in broad daylight enveloped by picturesque wonders of nature. Although the opening is cold, dark and punctuated with tragedy, the rest is so bright, it almost blinds you to the atrocities on screen.So without giving away anything, here's what we are in for: a welcome to Sweden mushroom trip, a Waco joke, a caged bear, a sacred tree, a Powerball game you hope to lose, and flowers and trees that seem to breathe. We also are reminded not to forget the birthday of our significant other, living to age 72 is not really rewarded in this commune, and no one should ever dance till they drop - even to be named the Queen of May. Of course, as with most horror films, it's easy to sit back as viewers and question the decision-making of the characters, but it's not like they realize they are in a horror film ... at least not until it's too late!Ms. Pugh (who reminds of another talented young actress, Haley Lu Richardson) is terrific here. Her character experiences shock, personal grief, a strained relationship, hallucinations, and a shot at revenge. The excellent music from Bobby Krlic, better known as The Haxan Cloak, is a mix of compositions and songs that create the mood for each character and scene. I was so shell-shocked at the end, that I'm unable to confirm that the version of ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)"" is that of The Walker Brothers (Scott Walker died earlier this year) or that of another band. Director Aster's second film proves the exaggerated and diverse spectrum of what constitutes a horror film, and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski's disorienting camera work perfectly complements a rare cinematic blend of frightening and funny. The cheery faces and pastoral beauty very nearly distract us from what might be the ugliest break-up movie ever.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rubbish,"Don't waste your time.I don't know how anyone would enjoy this movie.Makes no sense.Probably the worst movie I've seen.When I watched it, it had a 9.2 rating so expected it to be amazing.Might be more enjoyable if the rating sat around 5 so you could manage your expectations.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A surrealistic look at what it means to hurt the ones you should care for,"First and foremost, let me start off by saying that this film will definitely not be for everyone. Most people who see this film will more than likely not understand what it's saying, which is fine. That's part of the beauty of cinema, it's subjective. And people are entitled to their own opinions.In my personal experience with this film, Midsommar effected me greatly. The first time I saw it I found it bizarre and grandiose, surreal and visceral. The kind of film that is saying something, but not so loudly that it overwhelms you with it's themes. In fact, it more so invites you to discover what it's saying. And it says a lot. I saw the film 3 times in theaters and I feel like I still haven't grasped entirely what the film means because much of it is very ambiguous. Ari Aster is smart in the regard that he knows what we don't see is much more terrifying than what we do. With that being said, I don't know if I would necessarily categorize this film as a horror movie. It's more of a psychological drama with elements of horror. But genre is merely a pigeonhole that we place films in based on how they make us feel. Regardless of genre, Mr. Aster has made a supremely effective look at a victim's complicated response to those who have hurt her.Visually, this film is a feast for the eyes. I don't think I've seen a better looking film in 2019 (besides The Lighthouse but in an entirely different fashion). It's use of color and lighting pretty much engulfs the viewer in this strange world that our protagonists have entered. It's some of the finest cinematography I've seen all year. The camerawork is very seamless and vast, as if painting a picture for us. Revealing things through use of imagery is no small task, but Aster and his cinematographer, Pawel Pogorzelski, pull this task off almost flawlessly (which is why I recommend multiple viewings of this film. It has a lot to say through its use of imagery. I'm sure there are some things I still haven't noticed and I've seen the film about 5 times now). This is awards-worthy work from this cinematographer, and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves.The costume and set design also thoroughly impress, with the small commune appearing to be a world uncorrupted by the outside. We're meant to be fascinated and fearful of this place and the design of the buildings and structures as well as the way they're presented evoke these responses effortlessly. It makes us wonder what's going on behind the walls of the sacred temples that appear so strange to us.The script for the film is also impressive, though I will say it is definitely not to the magnitude of what Aster did with Hereditary. But Hereditary is entirely different monster altogether. That film was what I would call claustrophobic. This film is vast and wide. Sparking our curiosity while also simultaneously alerting us that a certain danger lurks just beneath the bright exterior. One critic commented that this film is staged more like an opera than a horror film, and I wholeheartedly agree. This is a very well written film but instead of assaulting us with its themes it asks us to look for them ourselves. To interpret them in our own way, which is one of my favorite things about this film (though I can understand why some audiences will be turned off by this).Now let me get to my favorite aspect of any film: the acting. I'll start off first with the woman at the center of it all, Miss Florence Pugh. I've been watching her ever since I saw her impressive debut in 2016's Lady Macbeth, where she delivered one of the most unnerving performances I've ever seen given by an actress. Here she delivers one of the most vivid performances of the year. In every scene she's in in this film, she is open and vulnerable. As if she has no where that she can hide what she's feeling. And in a way, she doesn't. She's a fountain of emotion, sometimes bursting with an energy that fills the entire screen. It's a mesmerizing performance that allows her to put her full range on display. The supporting players are also very good, with Will Poulter in particular being a standout for providing much needed comic relief (making this film actually surprisingly hilarious at times). Jack Reynor also holds his own as the manipulative boyfriend who doesn't know when to leave well enough alone. Vilhelm Blomgren as their native Swedish friend, also impresses, his performance being sympathetic while also being entirely enigmatic. And William Jackson Harper (of Good Place fame) gives only what I can call a driven performance, advancing the plot towards the insane finale that we all know is coming.Some people have said that they have found the film tedious and with a few plot holes and I can see why. Some things are left ambiguous, but not outright unanswered. And I think that's the point. It's all part of what your interpretation is.Regardless of it's flaws, Midsommar is a complex study on grief and trauma. It will effect many viewers (some more than others), and will more than likely be a film that will be talked about years from now as a cinematic phenomenon that people will always be entranced by (similar to Kubrick's The Shining). And though it's not outright scary, it will unnerve you. Which is almost better than being scared.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is the second film by Ari Aster I watched and it seems like he revels in his prowess of creating distastefully violent and gratuitous misery. IT DOES NOT LEAD TO ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR!

Underwhelmed,"I loved hereditary, and had very high hopes for midsommar. Unfortunately, by the end of the film it was a slog to get through. Let me also add that if you liked ""Mandy"" you will probably love this film.The start of the film was very promising, and in true fashion, the dialog, performances and camera work were exceptional. The opening lasts approximately 30 minutes and sets up the concept of the film, this is usually the hardest part for a horror (not really sure what category to put this film in as it is unique) film to do well, and I think Midsommar does a pretty good job.The mid-section is very slow and does a phenomenal job at building anticipation. Many will hate how slow it is, and others will appreciate it. There are sequences that show the hallucinogenic effects of drugs (imho) the most accurately to date.So why did I give this film a 6/10? Where do I think it went wrong? Well, I don't believe it did go ""wrong"" as such, rather it just stayed at the same level, and the ending felt like a disappointment. It was incredibly clear (intentionally) where the story was going, so the fact it took so long to get there, and only there was a let down.Best things about Midsommar.
Camera work
Authentic, immersive writing & acting (Florence Pugh was excellent)
Accurate drug simulation.Cons.
Slow pace without a crescendo.
Lack of character development.
Un-immersive character motivations (this plagues the film constantly and was very distracting due to slow pace).I would rate this film 6.5/10 and would consider it a once-watch only film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A brilliant piece of cinema,"If you like Saw, or slasher movies, don't bother with this, it's a slow burn, it's beautiful to watch, breathtakingly shot, and is sinister as hell. A lot of haters must have expected something else, it is a story of extreme loss and sadness, thrust into a increasingly disturbing folk ritual. Yes, you can predict something bad is going to happen, that's the point, so how can you say it's predictable? Isn't that what you expect? None of that takes away from how the story flows, once things turn weird, you know you're in for a wicked ride.

Interesting,"A group comprised of three friends and one of their girlfriends goes to Sweden to witness and take part in a pagan ritual that is celebrated once every 90 years. As the ritual progresses we see the American visitors coming under duress and having terrible things happen to them. That is the movie in a nutshell. I watched this for a couple of reasons. I love Florence Pugh. I think she is as talented an actor as she is beautiful. I had also heard some very good things about the movie. This has been marketed as a horror movie, and my friends, this it is not. I would say that there are some tense moments that would make this a thriller/drama. There is little here in the way of suspense as you can pretty much forecast the fate of the outsiders. I feel that they were going for a better, updated version of the wicker man and they did accomplish both, but with less drama. This is still a good movie with some interesting story points. I would probably not watch it again and would definitely not call it a horror movie.

You might like the movie if you're the sort of person who watches 3 hour youtube videos of ""oddly satisfying"" patterns, because nearly every shot is done with some sort of symmetry or weird effects.It takes SO LONG to get to the point, the first time anything mildly interesting happens is a full hour in, then there's another solid hour of nothing until the 15 minute conclusion.I just can't get over how many people have raved about this piece of garbage. The characters are bland, unlikeable, and uninteresting. The entire plot is so slow burning that they probably could have filmed grass growing and it would have been more thrilling.Everyone talks about how it's ""unsettling"" or ""psychologically terrifying,"" ok, maybe the last 5 minutes, but the rest is just a bunch of cult people drinking mushrooms and screaming together. It's not unsettling so much as it is annoying. Constant repetitive music, samey scenes that all play out the same way.I can't believe I sat through this garbage. I didn't pay anything and I still want my money back.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent horror film about a cult,"This is generally a disturbing film. Some people say it was funny perhaps because they were uncomfortable with some scenes yet so many people were offended or hated it. So my guess is the movie made people uncomfortable. Again, it was a disturbing film which many horror films are not these days. I welcomed Ari's latest effort as horror is becoming non-horrific lately with so many tropes that the genre is lacking these days. The 1 star reviewers ignore the story telling, ignore any of the characters, ignore the symbolism that exists through the entire story, and ignore the creepiness of some of the sociopathic members. You should rewatch it just to see how evil their foreign friend actually is. It is atleast a 4 or 5 star minimum. I say this is a thinkers horror film because i had to rewatch twice. Although the movie is gory it doesn't glorify the actions of the cult members. You get the feeling the cults are indeed the abnormalities we know they are and it's a visceral feeling to see them carry out their rituals. Cults can be argued as the anti-thesis of progress/freedom and how they possess the means to attract people is just as baffling. Well Midsommar offered a glimpse into the cult via codependency and loss. Add in charming sociopathy who tell people what they like to hear and we have some poor people who get lead into horror and loss of freedom/love. As a cult film this is atleast 8. Also, The wicker man comparisons need to stop. How many posession movies are there and how many times need they be compared? Cult horror is a sub-genre like zombie films are also a sub-genre. This is an excellent film about the horrors of a cult for modern times. I really think Ari is becoming a true master of horror. He leaves many viewers disturbed but also with warnings and lessons about what evil really is. He does not glorify horror..rather he reveals

Unforgettable,"I'm not one of those people who thinks every horror film should be 80-90 minutes. There are too many brilliant horror films that have pushed (or exceeded) that 2 hour mark so I can't say that's a wise barometer of a film's quality. However, Midsommar could stand a few trims here and there to tighten things up.The issue with Midsommar is this - we've all seen movies like this before. We know what's going to happen, yet the characters don't, so we spend an awfully long time waiting for the inevitable as we have to see ancient cult rituals carried out in real time. It can make for an exhausting watch.It's not the story that Midsommar is telling that's interesting, but the way that it's telling it. With its focus on a toxic relationship between Dani and Christian, it colors a familiar story with something altogether different and unique.When Midsommar really hits its stride, though, it's off and running and better than just about any other horror film in recent memory. Ari Aster has rounded up another phenomenal cast just like with Hereditary and the film is drenched in dread from the first frame all the way to the unforgettable final frame.It's, without a doubt, worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ari Aster's follow up to Hereditary has been described as both a 'Wizard of Oz for perverts', exposing the rotten heart of western civilisation, and a bad trip comedy (the hallucinations the characters experience while tripping on magic mushrooms are some of the most realistic ever portrayed on film).

"Long Winded, Pretentious, but Not Mindless Horror Flick","The movie beginns very slow and that's the speed over the whole playtime. When some young people travel to a nativ cult in sweden, they have no clue whats waiting for them. It's a story about a fictional teutonic cult that celebrate a nativ cult ritual, which happens to occur every 90 years. Beginning with some drug intoxication, many people may guess where it ends. This is a very bright and friedly atmosphered horror movie, which becomes bloody, and visually clearly gory in several scenes. The story slowly developes and progresses over the whole playtime. The characters slide into the story deeper and deeper and that's not only because of the acting, the technical aspects of that movie allow the audience, to easily glide into the storyflow. There are many strong visual scenes, that match with a hypnotic score. So the hole movie slows the audience down while telling the story. It didn't really feel like 2 hours and 27 minutes, because I was so slowed down myself.I wouldn't call it a real new invention of the horror gere. There are some pretty good horror movies that formerly were made in Scandinavia. 'Midsommar' is not really an excellent movie, but also not mediocre. I've seen a bunch of compareable movies before. 'The Wicker Man' from 70's dealt with such a scenario close to 46 years earlier. All in all I like the atmosphere, so it's a recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Midsommar (2019),"Hereditary was one of my favorite films of last year. it was such a unique and unsettling film. If anything, it showed that Ari Aster was a force on his directorial debut. We all wondered what as next. Midsommar quickly became my most hyped film of the summer and I vowed to see it as soon as it comes out. Midsommar is exactly what I wanted it to be and more. This will be a polarizing film, I feel but I already know that I want to rewatch it because it is truly a mesmerizing experience.The film is about a group of friends who travel to Sweden for a celebration that occurs every 90 years. The protagonist (played by Florence Pugh), recently experienced a traumatic loss and goes on this trip with her boyfriend in hopes of repairing their very distant relationship. Everything seems beautiful and serene at first but the group soon realize that this festival is not normal at all and the bizarre cult-like events are actually a lot more dangerous than they seem.Ari Aster shows that he is already an expert in filmmaking. This film is a very loose horror as a lot of it is comedic, abstract, visual, and more unsettling than scary. Its perfect that way and shows the range Aster has. The lighting, setting, and cinematography in this film are absolutely stellar. It is an absolutely beautiful looking picture. Someone else who really shows range is Florence Pugh. From playing Lady Macbeth, to a WWE wrestler, to a girl going through an absolutely traumatic experience.A lot of this film is humorous. Its hard not to burst out laughing at the uncomfortably bizarre sequence of events in this film. The pagan like rituals in this film are just so engorging to behold and you just want to know more and more at the mythos behind this cult. The film is so unique in its nature but the creativity and imagery flow through, much like with Hereditary.This is pure unhinged ambition from Aster. He takes the reigns off from what he did with Hereditary and explores a beautifully terrifying event with people who are darker than they seem. The film is a slow burn but its fun to just stare at every frame and behold the transpiring of absolute madness. Its an absolute psychedelic trip from start to finish.

The experience will be unforgettable from start to finish; so much unsettling subject matter and bits that beg you asking wtf is happening!

Nightmare under the Swedish Sun,"Midsommar is a lean and mean take on ""The Wicker Man"", and true to the original story, the visitors are doomed, the inhabitants are evil-doers , and the surroundings are surreal. The fact that Midsommars main cast are in danger from nearly the moment they step foot near the Swedish commune, is impressive, as the films director Ari Aster drops much of the artistic trappings of his last film ""Heredity "", and in return paints a collage of hallucinogenic upheaval, with evil underpinnings. The commune undermines the protagonists fears and desires, to disastrous effect.Unfortunately, it's predictable. The film goes to great lengths to not be typical horror, with many of the kills taking place offscreen, lessening the impact. Finally, none of the characters act especially smart given their circumstances, which cheapens the experience somewhat.All in all, a very enjoyable film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Complex emotions that leave you awestruck,"This is a type of movie that has it's audience in extremes. You either love it and can't stop talking about how beautiful the movie is or you absolutely hate it and think that people who do like it need to get into a mental institution. The movie starts with a plot which leads to what happens next, it might seems unnecessary or time consuming but it's extremely vital to understand and appreciate the ending. The movie deals with complex relations and the need for the two main characters Dani and Christian to stay in their unwanted relationship. Christian is somewhat an antogonist in the movie. The beautiful scenery , breathtaking cinematography is 10/10 no doubts. My only problem was that some important key events weren't explained any further(that just adds on to the eerie nature of the film since it leaves you with a lot to think about). Dark things happen in the movie while everything that surrounds those events seem so beautiful, spiritual and light. Amazing contrast! What makes this movie brilliant for some is something that makes it terrible for others, which is just the understanding of emotions and the ending. Nothing can make someone like this movie if they don't, it's just one of those impossible strong opinions. And there's no way to say that someone whose thinking about watching it would like it or not. It's a masterpiece by Ari aster. A lot of people watch midsommar after watching hereditary (aster's) expecting similar stuff but do not be fooled by that. While hereditary can be categorised under horror midsommar can't, this is not your movie if you're looking for another hereditary experience. It's just one of those movies that you can get so deep into and realise new things EVERYTIME you talk about it. Do not watch it if you can't handle some amount of gore. And DEFINITELY don't watch it when your mind is not ready to process all that's going to happen. I loved this movie, it takes time to appreciate it since from the second you watch it all you can do is think about it and the more you think about it, read others opinions (not the ones who didnt give it time to get to them) the more you have an opinion of the film and the more you start understanding it; it all leads to you just loving the experience and emotions that you felt .",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
master of making me feel uncomfortable,"The awesome thing about the director is that he is the master of making me feel uncomfortable. I mean truly really it's almost astonishin How good he is at it. And how beautiful He can make the most terrifying things.And how the horror slowly sneaks in on the my skin in the little details in flowers and butts just amazing.The way the movie shows what happened to vulnerable people when they don't have good support systems around them. It's just marvelous how shows could end up joining a cult.The movie is showed beautifully in the Swedish countryside which is actually Hungarian countryside when it was filmed, but beside the point it looks marvelous, clothes looks so creepy, because they are looking so nice and wide and pure and that just makes it uncomfortable to look at.The movie was amazing it got under my skin, but nice special effects and the main girl the torment was interestingly sad.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Midsommar: A Visually Stunning and Psychologically Intense Horror Experience,"""Midsommar,"" directed by Ari Aster, is a visually stunning and psychologically intense horror film that takes the audience on a surreal journey into a disturbing pagan cult. The film follows a group of friends who travel to a remote Swedish village to attend a midsummer festival, only to find themselves trapped in a nightmarish and increasingly violent ritual.One of the most striking aspects of ""Midsommar"" is its visual presentation. The film is beautifully shot, with lush cinematography that captures the eerie beauty of the Swedish countryside and the vivid rituals of the cult. The use of light and color is particularly effective, creating a sense of unease and otherworldliness that permeates the entire film.The performances in ""Midsommar"" are also exceptional. Florence Pugh delivers a standout performance as the grief-stricken protagonist, Dani, effectively conveying her character's complex emotions and inner turmoil. Jack Reynor also impresses as Dani's emotionally distant boyfriend, Christian, bringing depth to a character who could easily have been one-dimensional.Another positive aspect of ""Midsommar"" is its exploration of complex themes such as grief, trauma, and the nature of relationships. The film delves into the darker aspects of human nature, challenging the audience to confront uncomfortable truths about themselves and society as a whole.However, ""Midsommar"" is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find the film's slow pacing and deliberate, almost dreamlike narrative style off-putting. Additionally, the film's graphic and disturbing imagery may be too intense for some viewers, particularly those sensitive to violence and gore.In terms of technical aspects, ""Midsommar"" is expertly crafted. The film's sound design is particularly effective, with a haunting score that enhances the film's eerie atmosphere. The production design is also top-notch, with intricate sets and costumes that bring the world of the cult to life.In conclusion, ""Midsommar"" is a visually stunning and thematically rich horror film that pushes the boundaries of the genre. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, particularly due to its graphic content and slow pacing, it is a thought-provoking and immersive experience that lingers long after the credits roll.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible,"This is the worst, most boring movie I have ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Polarizing; yet, well executed","This film is even more polarizing than Hereditary. I understand why it's very off-putting to some, but many people will find another great film from Ari Aster.I understood the film even better once I heard it's an analogy of a breakup. It just also happens to be a very, very creepy and disturbing film with a hell of an ending, if you ask me. It's not that the ending has never been done before; it's that Aster executes it in a way that gets under your skin. Very brilliantly done.I found myself thinking about it a lot afterward. Even had a bit of trouble sleeping that night. It puts you into another world, a world of pure evil. Very much in the same ""world"" as Hereditary, where there is an absence of anything pure and holy, an absence of joy, and absence of goodness. Hey, it's a horror film. Isn't that what we want?If hell exists, this is very much what I would imagine it would be like. Visually, you might at first think what you're seeing is beautiful, but you slowly start to realize you're not in paradise. It's the opposite.Not quite as good as Hereditary, but very memorable nonetheless.Ari Aster is a genius. I'm sorry if you disagree. I think he's truly a master at his craft.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A nice try to refresh the genre,"""Midsommar,"" directed by Ari Aster, is a film that manages to encapsulate the essence of daylight horror, turning what is typically considered safe and serene-the bright, pastoral landscapes of Sweden-into a canvas for a deeply unsettling narrative. Having watched this film, I find myself caught between admiration for its craft and discomfort from its thematic explorations.The movie follows a young American couple, Dani and Christian, whose relationship is on the brink of collapse. They, along with their friends, are invited to a midsummer festival in a remote Swedish village, which at first appears to be a peaceful and idyllic retreat. However, as the festival progresses, the community's ancient traditions reveal themselves to be disturbing and violently perverse.One of the film's strongest points is its use of broad daylight to evoke horror. Unlike traditional horror films that rely on darkness to create suspense, ""Midsommar"" proves that the light of day can be equally, if not more, terrifying. The cinematography is breathtaking, offering visuals that are both dreamlike and nightmarish. The juxtaposition of the film's beautiful scenery with its horrifying events enhances the sense of unease and dread.The performances, particularly Florence Pugh's portrayal of Dani, are exceptional. Pugh captures the complexity of her character's emotional journey with profound depth, making the audience's investment in her fate all the more intense. The film's exploration of grief, relationships, and the human desire for belonging is compelling and thought-provoking.However, ""Midsommar"" is not without its weaknesses. Its deliberate pacing and lengthy runtime may test the patience of some viewers, particularly those accustomed to more conventional horror fare. Additionally, while the film's climax is visually spectacular and thematically fitting, some may find it over-the-top or even absurd, detracting from the otherwise meticulously built tension.Ari Aster's willingness to subvert genre expectations and explore horror through a unique lens is admirable, making ""Midsommar"" a standout film. It's a divisive piece of cinema-some may find it a masterpiece of modern horror, while others might see it as pretentious or unnecessarily grotesque. Regardless, ""Midsommar"" is an unforgettable experience that pushes the boundaries of the horror genre, inviting viewers to bask in its daylight nightmare.In conclusion, ""Midsommar"" is a film that excels in its visual storytelling, strong performances, and its audacious reimagining of horror. Its slow burn and thematic density might not cater to everyone's tastes, but for those willing to embrace its peculiarities, it offers a richly rewarding cinematic experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not for fans of 'The Nun',"There's not's much to say for people who are giving this 1-star ratings, other than there's no accounting for taste. If you prefer horror that spoon-feeds you an abundance of the unnatural and grotesque, then you'll be better served by other films.Midsommar is a powerhouse of unsettling storytelling. In a genre that relies on pitch black rooms and camera angles that obscure the jump scare coming around the corner, it instead thrusts the entire movie into bright sunlight. It doesn't need an unending stream of unexpected scares, because seeing them coming from a mile away actually works *better* and forces the viewer to sit helpless as they know (at least part of) what's coming. In a movie so intentionally contradictory, the moments lacking ambiguity feel obviously deceitful and put us on edge for the fate of the characters.As others have mentioned, the cinematography is outstanding. Dialogue feels very grounded, and the performances of the leads, especially Florence Pugh, are excellent. In addition, MY GOD the soundtrack - The Haxan Cloak (Bobby Krlic) deserves all the praise for his mix of atmospheric pieces mixed with bright, cheerful pieces when appropriate.This is not an obvious film. It treats its audience with respect and puts things in plain view while hiding its lies in plain sight. I would not go into this if you are in the mood for traditional horror - but I would gladly recommend it to any movie lover who simply wants to see a well-made film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Shocking descent into madness,"If you've watched Ari Aster's Heteditary, you have a fair idea how he approaches his art. His latest features more slow burn horror, as twenty-something Dani suffers a severe trauma when her sister and parents are found dead; her boyfriend Christian invites her along with his friends, who are writing their thesis while traveling to a remote Swedish village - home to fellow student Pelle. Aster loves building tension, and he does so repeatedly, continually raising expectations that something just isn't right, including a rather effective tracking shot where their world is literally ""turned upside down."" There is gore to match some of the toughest slasher flicks, and lots of symbolism and cultural history packed into this feature, for those who might enjoy. It felt about thirty minutes too long for what it was trying to accomplish, and diluted it's payoff in the process. Horror fans may find themselves checking their watch a few times. It's smartly made, but lacks a central performance on the level of Heteditary's Toni Collette; but Midsommar remains an interesting and original picture that is sure to get people talking.

Midsommar a Miss,"What would you think a movie involving white clothes and head wreaths would be about? If you said creepy pagan rituals then you're right.Unfortunately, Midsommar was about what I thought it'd be about. Pagan rituals. Were the rituals more extreme than--let's say--Wicker Man? Yes. But extreme wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for truly different. Truly scary. This movie wasn't scary it was just disturbing. There were ugly nude bodies, some gore, and overall disturbing ceremonies but it was still a pagan ritual movie.But it was also slow. Exasperatingly slow. Slower than a constipated sloth. There were too many silent mood-setting shots. I've been programmed to know that silent shots in scary movies are for build-up. It's upon the movie maker to deliver on that build up. I can't count how many slow-moving shots in this movie were building up to nothing. I get it. You can't have something ghastly happen every time or it will become mundane. But not at all?When these five friends went to Sweden for a getaway and decided to stop off in some remote village for their nine-day festival you knew something was gonna go down. But did it have to move so slowly and drag on forever? Did the scenes have to last so long? Between crying, moaning, singing, dancing, and panting they added so many nerve-wracking noises. Yeah, they made the movie more disturbing and also more annoying.I remained patient throughout the entire film only to NOT be rewarded for my patience. As I suffered through the main character's neurosis and moping I couldn't help but think, ""There better be gold at the end of this rainbow."" I hate to say it, there was no gold... nor silver, nor copper, or any precious metal. It was just a fire being fed with two and a half hours of my precious time.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not a Burn Just a Fizzle,Let's get the obvious out of the way. Ari Aster's potential to become a top tier director is once again in display here. The cinematography is on point. The camera work is stellar. The film's narrative is well executed . . . Until the second half.Once the film passes the hour mark it becomes a slave to the tropes that it so valiantly tried to steer clear from earlier. This results in an obvious and less impactful ending; diluting the emotional response it sought from its audience.Overall it's worth the watch - with your significant other for the memes - but do not expect something at the level of Hereditary.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The pursuit of happiness,I went into this movie expecting nothing. The first 10 minutes made my skin crawl and I knew that the rest was going to be interesting and maybe lead to something good. It got disturbing. VERY DISTURBING. I anticipated everything that was going to happen and I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The anticipation felt normal with all the foreshadowing Ari gives us. Yet it was the weirdest thing I have ever seen but yet I feel like I enjoyed it. I have never felt so terrible about a film and yet think it was good. I don't know if that makes sense but if you watch it you might feel the same way. I can tell you it looks amazing though. The story and just everything that happens I am so confused and indifferent about that it just baffles me. Do I like this movie or not. The reason I'm giving it a good rating is that because immediately after I thought that was just god awful but as I thought about it it just brought chills all through my body. That's the point right? Go see this movie and maybe you will understand how I feel. No movie has made me felt this way.

"Impeccable art direction, but problematic script","""Midssomar"" brings with it an incredible look, constant tension and discomfort, and great technicalities, but it misses a lot in its script, promising young Ari Aster's second film is below its first feature but adds a fuller cinematic experience.The film presents a problem, its script, which does not know where to focus or even what to tell, with a course of the lost plot, not knowing where to walk and poor plot and rhythm choices, a completely unnecessary first act that could have solved in 5 minutes, leaving for the ""main plot"", although this does not seem to exist here, a attention deficit counted on not knowing where to focus and diverse are the characters without narrative function, not to mention the various arcs and cores that are open and never completed, this may even be purposeful and work in many movies, but it doesn't work here.If the script presents problems, technically the film is exquisite, with a contrast to the usual horror photography, very clear and beautiful, an amazing scenery composition and great costumes, the art direction deserves merit here, from the make-up. even the choreography is spectacular in many ways, even the sound mixing is great, just like the soundtrack that blends a modern and classic rhythm.Ari Aster has a meritorious direction, the director directs his film well, he knows how to create the mood and the tension well, with a camera that can be caustrophobic even with open angles and great cuts, dry and vicerais, besides the already commenting and wonderful scenery composition, but the script's attention deficit slips a little in the direction as well, as the director gets lost in his own created world and gets very excited with the camera in hand, there are many unnecessary contemplations and techniques that do not In keeping with the rest of the film, Ari had some great ideas for his second film, but he had a lot of execution problems, it is undeniable that the young director has talent, but his excitement in wanting to demonstrate this ends up damaging his film.The Cast is very good, although some characters have no narrative function, the actors play their roles, even Will Poulter as comic relief is fine, not to mention all the scary and great members of the Swedish village, but the big highlight really stands for Florence, the little-known British actress gives a show of her own and gives herself completely to her role, ranging from despair to drama, to fear and acceptance.Ari's second film has several merits, but it also has problems, mainly of execution and lack of clarity in its focus, sometimes in the direction, but mainly in the script, with an unnecessary first act and a script that cannot decide which story tell, but we have a dazzling art direction and a direction that, despite the detours, is extremely uncomfortable, often causing nuisance, which is good for a horror movie. The goal of being daunting in daylight works primarily at the beginning, once we get used to it it loses strength. ""Midssomar"" is being loved or hated, I think it's a good movie, nothing more than that, but if I had to choose between loving and hating, I'd rather love. It is also important for the viewer to embark on the long wave to feel its tension and despair, otherwise it will be a long, boring and tiring trip.

"Not for everyone, but definitely unique","So I am not big on ""horror"" movies, but this film felt different to me. There are several reasons for that. First, the film took its time - by the time these characters got to Sweden, you knew who they were, who they were becoming, and what fears they needed to face. There is a ton of stillness here, and it works. Second, while there were some fairly gruesome moments, the story focused less on making you jump and more on building an increasingly bizarre and creepy world. Third, Florence Pugh absolutely blew me away. Would I watch it again? Hard pass. But this film wanted to be more than just another scary movie, and it mostly succeeded.

Once in a lifetime,"There are some wierd beliefs about that have filtered down through the ages and some are explored in this movie.
The pace seems a little slow at first but it is about right, gently luring you into what seems to be a curious observation of an old society before exposing you to something you feel you weren't expecting but actually you were. As the story progresses you know things aren't as they should be and it is this hook that keeps you intrigued. Even when you know what's going to happen, you feel compelled to watch.
If you watch closely, at one point you are made aware of what is and going to happen. With this in mind, the tapestry of lives both intrinsic and external to the community of Midsommar, are forever intertwined and weaved by a good story teller.
If you've seen Hereditary then you have some idea of the director's ways. Both Hereditary and Midsommar stay with you, lingering in daydreams and dreams, of which I'm undecided if it's a good thing or not.
The end is reminiscent of other films but it can be forgiven as it is a natural conclusion, even though quite chilling.

A Cinematic Feast of Haunting Beauty and Unsettling Brilliance,"Ari Aster's sophomore film, ""Midsommar,"" is a visually stunning and psychologically intense cinematic experience that captivates audiences with its mesmerizing shots, intricate sequence plans, compelling plot construction, exceptional cast, and the brilliant direction by Aster himself.Visual Brilliance:
""Midsommar"" is a visual feast that immerses the audience in the surreal and otherworldly atmosphere of a Swedish midsummer festival. The film's cinematography, led by Pawel Pogorzelski, is nothing short of spectacular. The breathtaking shots of the idyllic Scandinavian landscapes, coupled with the meticulous attention to detail in the festival rituals, create a hauntingly beautiful and immersive world that is both alluring and disconcerting.Intricate Sequence Plans:
Aster demonstrates a keen eye for detail in the film's sequence plans, utilizing long takes to build tension and capture the unfolding horror. The camera work seamlessly guides the audience through the emotionally charged narrative, enhancing the overall impact of the story. The use of wide shots during the festival scenes and tight close-ups during moments of emotional intensity showcases Aster's mastery in visual storytelling.Compelling Plot Construction:
The narrative of ""Midsommar"" is a psychological rollercoaster that explores grief, relationships, and the human psyche in the context of a seemingly idyllic pagan commune. Aster skillfully weaves a tale that is both horrifying and thought-provoking, employing symbolism and allegory to enhance the layers of the story. The gradual unraveling of the characters and the escalating tension create an unsettling atmosphere that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats until the final frame.Exceptional Cast:
The cast of ""Midsommar"" delivers outstanding performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. Florence Pugh's portrayal of Dani, the grieving protagonist, is particularly noteworthy, as she skillfully navigates the complex emotional landscape of her character. Jack Reynor, Will Poulter, and the rest of the ensemble cast contribute to the film's overall success, creating a convincing and engaging group dynamic that adds to the film's impact.Brilliant Direction by Ari Aster:
Aster's directorial prowess shines through in ""Midsommar."" His ability to craft a narrative that is both visually striking and emotionally resonant demonstrates a rare talent in the horror genre. Aster's attention to detail, nuanced storytelling, and ability to elicit genuine performances from his cast solidify his position as a visionary director in contemporary cinema.In conclusion, ""Midsommar"" is a cinematic achievement that transcends the horror genre, offering a thought-provoking and visually stunning experience. Ari Aster's direction, coupled with exceptional performances and striking cinematography, establishes ""Midsommar"" as a modern masterpiece that lingers in the viewer's mind long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Takes An Awfully Long Time To Get To Where It's Going,"I have nothing against longer films. I really don't. If it's a story that needs to be told in over 2 hours, I'm all for it. Unfortunately, Midsommar is under the impression that it has a bigger, deeper story to tell that it really does and that hurts the film. The odds are, if you've seen more than a handful of horror movies in your day, you'll know where Midsommar is going within the first 30 minutes of the movie.Granted, this isn't always a bad thing. Entire franchises (such as the Friday the 13th series) have been founded on the principal of ""let's give them what they expect with a little something different."" The difference is - these movies know they're not exactly high art and keep things short and sweet before the audience has the chance to catch on that what they're offering up isn't anything terribly new or interesting.Midsommar starts off well with a solid 1st act in which Dani (a terrific Florence Pugh) still grieving over an incident that robbed her of her entire family. She weasels her way into a Sweden trip with her boyfriend, Christian, and his friends so that they can check out a strange cult-y commune. Once they arrive, they start to get the feeling that things aren't quite right with the people there. Well, I shouldn't say it happens immediately.In Midsommar's most drawn out act, the audience catches on that this cult is iffy as the lead characters take another 40/50 minutes to figure it out. That said, once the film really gets going, it's great, but it seems like so much time is wasted on silly things (who cares if two friends are trying to do a thesis on the same subject and why do we need to see every single cult ritual in full?)Ari Aster still has a knack for creating unbearably dark, depressing, and dread-filled horror out of thin air and it's a genuine gift. Hereditary at least had it's old dark house to generate tension, but Midsommar is perhaps the brightest film of the year, so there's nowhere for the terror to hide. In some ways, it's an even greater feat that he managed to create so much apprehension out of otherwise beautiful, scenic views.All in all, it's an interesting, if frustrating viewing experience. It's recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The kind of horror that gives your mind a workout,"On the heels of the deeply disturbing 'Hereditary,' Ari Aster returns with the equally unsettling Nordic nightmare that is 2019's 'Midsommar.'Graphic. Gruesome. Trippy. Twisted. All adjectives that can be used to describe this film. The events that unfold throughout can be interpreted in many different ways, but at the center of everything is a fractured relationship between the two young American twentysomethings - Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor). Unfortunately, the fragile bond that ties them together is not much of a match for the centuries-old barbaric rituals that take place during their summer adventure in a remote village in northern Sweden.Seeing how the relationship between Dani and Christian weathers the storm during their stay on this compound is something that doesn't really register until after the credits roll. 'Midsommar' messes with your mind and makes you question how things got to the way they end up. How much of the storyline is impacted by outside factors, and how much of it originates from within? This is a question that is up for much debate.But among the drug-fueled highs and the depressing lows of 'Midsommar' is the frighteningly beautiful fantasyland in which the film is set. The natural wonder of the Swedish (or Utahan) landscape sets an incredibly stark contrast from the horrors carried out by those who inhabit the area, and the incredible cinematography warps things even further. Maybe it's the midnight sun, maybe it's the use of color. Perhaps it's the use of sound (or lack thereof). Whatever it is, it reaches out and grabs you, and doesn't let go.Before you are finally able to move on from the final 15 minutes of 'Midsommar,' you wonder why you just sat through it. But the more you think about it, the more you recognize the metaphors and themes woven into the script, the use of foreshadowing and visual cues. The film is heavy, yes, but in a weird way it's like abstract art. Some love it, many hate it, and others are still trying to figure it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genius exploration of human horror and female rage,"There are so many complex themes in this movie I don't know where to start.But I will tell you why I like this so much, and what I appreciate in a movie in general.One thing that got me from the beginning, was the complexity of each character. They were all amazing, you could write a book about each character and I am referring to all of them, especially the cult members.Another thing I really enjoyed was the team of female, rage and female horror. It was so interesting to watch and some scenes really stuck with me a for long time.Also, the feeling of dread and confusion is very well portrayed, because even at the beginning when you don't know what to expect you can still sense that something is off and can't really put your finger on it but it's there.I really recommend this movie I think it's genius. I think he's one of the best movies I've ever watched.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Slow burn, Unlikeable characters, and no resolution","As I was watching this I commented several times on the cinematography itself. But even so, I was starved for some sort of narrative. Not to mention, the pacing of the film is so agonizingly slow, I could have walked out of the room at any time and returned to see there had been no progression in the story itself. The characters are all unlikeable, and two dimensional. The protagonist's trauma from the beginning of the film is never addressed again and doesn't contribute anything at all to what little story there was. The film was basically a perfect example of things happening slowly with no climax or resolution but they get away with it because the director decides to put in trippy elements that make no sense to fake the audience out with a false ""deeper meaning"". It's lazy writing, and so much of the violence and nudity was a cheap shot to keep the audience uncomfortable but it was so overused, and abused that they can hardly take these ""unsettling"" elements seriously.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very poorly advertised as something it isn't; will be sure to frustrate and impress in equal measure,"Much like his feature debut,Hereditary (2018), as well as such recent films asThe Witch (2015)andIt Comes at Night (2017), writer/directorAri Aster's Midsommar has been well received by critics but not so much by audiences. And, really, it's not hard to see why; all four films were promoted as horrors when they weren't, drawing in audiences who were disappointed that they didn't get what they were expecting. Midsommar is, at best, a thriller, and even that's pushing it. Whereas Hereditary was a study of grief, it undeniably had horror elements, but in Midsommar, apart from one brief moment involving somebody wearing somebody else's skin (don't ask), there's little resembling a horror trope. What it does have in abundance, however, is dread, and as with Hereditary, it's primarily an allegory built on a foundation of generic tropes. Whereas Hereditary dealt with the lengths one may go to shut off emotional pain, Midsommar is more interested in what happens when the initial pain of bereavement starts to wear off, especially when the only person one feels one can turn to isn't exactly sympathetic to one's situation. Aster himself has called it a ""breakup movie"", and it's hard to argue against this. And whilst the characters are underwritten, and the film is painfully predictable (especially if you're familiar withThe Wicker Man (1973)), it's beautifully crafted, brilliantly shot almost entirely in glaring sunlight, and vastly ambitious. And much likeUs (2019), it avoids the sophomore slump without necessarily knocking it out of the park.The film begins as Dani (a superbFlorence Pugh) learns her bipolar sister has killed their parents and subsequently committed suicide. Already emotionally fragile and prone to anxiety attacks even before their deaths, Dani turns for support to her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor), an anthropology student struggling to find a topic for his PhD. Christian has wanted to break things off with Dani for some time, as he finds her overly needy, and had been trying to work up to ending the relationship prior to her family dying. The following summer, Dani learns that Christian and fellow students Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter) have been invited by Swedish student Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) to his ancestral pagan commune in HÃ¥rga, where a midsummer celebration that only occurs once every ninety years will be taking place. Dani is upset that Christian didn't tell her about the trip, and to placate her, he invites her to come, never imagining she will say yes. But she does. And it doesn't take long, for the visitors to learn that something isn't right in the commune.As Aster has said, Midsommar is really a breakup movie, with Christian as a classic manipulator. For example, after Dani learns about the trip, she's understandably upset that he didn't tell her, but in the space of a couple of minutes he manipulates her into apologising to him. The core of the story is her slowly coming to realise that he isn't the man she thought he was, and in a weird way, it's a variation on the female revenge genre. In this sense, it's primarily an allegory for the process of a young woman's emotional/spiritual awakening. Indeed, one could take this even further if one reads the character names as symbolic; Dani's surname is Ardor, but she's denied love, and in the paganism of the commune, she's offered something she can't get from a self-serving Christian(ity).Aesthetically, the film looks terrific. Whereas the US scenes are dark and confined, taking place in small poorly lit rooms with the characters wearing drab costumes, once the film shifts to Sweden, the visual design changes completely.Henrik Svensson's production design emphasises an open-plan vastness with unlimited space to move, but few places to hide;Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography drenches everything in glaring sunlight; andAndrea Flesch's costume design focuses on brilliant white. Indeed, the attention to detail in the presentation of the commune is immensely impressive; the long middle act doesn't really feature much in the way of narrative incident, but it does a fine job of creating a milieu that feels authentic and lived-in.There are also some nice individual moments. For example, the choral singing with which the film begins is harshly interrupted by a telephone ringing, suggesting the clash between tradition and modernity; Dani's hysterical crying upon learning of her family's deaths blends withThe Haxan Cloak's discordant music; a superb single-take shot takes Dani from heading to her apartment bathroom to entering the bathroom of an airplane; a high altitude shot showing a car travelling along a country road is imbued with malevolent undercurrent as the car passes under the camera, but rather than turning around to pick the vehicle up on the reverse angle, the camera follows the car by turning downwards, ending up upside-down.In terms of the narrative design, somewhat unusually, the film wears its predictability on its sleeve, with many of the major narrative beats not only foreshadowed but literally shown to the audience prior to occurring in the story, whether it be the mural that opens the film or the illustrations seen on the walls all over the commune. With that in mind, anyone who has seen any folk horror will be able to predict much of what happens. Even if you're only familiar with The Wicker Man, you'll still be able to take a decent stab at how things turn out.As for the acting, much as Hereditary wasToni Collette's, Midsommar belongs entirely to Florence Pugh. For most of the film, she's on the precipice of a nervous breakdown, with her performance redolent ofShelley DuvallinThe Shining (1980). This is easily her best and most layered performance thus far, especially the gamut of contradictory emotions she runs in the insane last 20 minutes. Elsewhere, the performances are all fine, but the actors aren't helped by the script. As Christian, Jack Reynor is the least convincing academic ever put on screen, although he does do a decent job of getting the audience to loathe his passive-aggressive persona. Will Poulter plays Mark as the kind of ignorant sex-crazed loudmouth that seems to only exist in the movies. As Josh, William Jackson Harper barely registers, whilst Vilhelm Blomgren's Pelle is so obviously untrustworthy that it pushes suspension of disbelief to breaking point.As this might suggest, one of the biggest problems with the film is the underwritten characters. Additionally, Dani and Christian's relationship is demarcated along stereotypical lines - the emotional female whose need for support becomes overwhelming and the thoughtless bro who is more interested in hanging out with the boys. Another issue is that even aside from the character of Pelle, the film pushes suspension of disbelief too far. There are multiple moments when the goings-on should prompt the visitors to leave immediately, but they repeatedly accept the most ridiculous of situations based upon the most tenuous of explanations. Indeed, in a lot of ways, they're no different from the idiots who get picked off one-by-one in so many cheap slasher films.Additionally, as already mentioned, there are few surprises here. Aster is obviously a big fan of folk horror, but he allows reverence to the tropes supersede narrative inventiveness, leading to predictability. Also, as in Hereditary, the explanation for what's going on isn't anywhere near as interesting as the ambiguity preceding it.That said, however, I did enjoy Midsommar. Aesthetically impressive, and built on a terrific central performance, it could be cited as an example of a filmmaker whose ambitions outweigh his abilities, but ultimately, Aster's mastery of tone sees him through. The script could use some work, no doubt, but the ominous sense of dread is palpable throughout and is brilliantly handled, whilst the depiction of the death throes of a toxic relationship is as penetrating and emotionally honest as any ostensible relationship drama. Unnerving and audacious, Midsommar is an exceptionally confident piece of filmmaking, if not necessarily an exceptional piece of filmmaking.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Magnificent camera work recalls Kubrick,"For the last two months I've been doing the Marvel marathon, 20 movies so far. They're almost all worth watching if in the mood, but the lack of stillness in the camera, the constant cuts, quick quips, punchathons and artificial visuals get tiring after a while.Midsommar is a fine antidote: the camera is beautifully still or slow. Editing-cuts are far less frequent, allowing more time to sink into an image. The compositioning of images is masterful: photography-like. Indeed, Kubrick-like (who was initially a photographer).We also get an impactful soundtrack, excellent acting especially from the lead, good script & screenplay with plenty of quality dialogue-free sections, effectively spare FX with realistic psychedelic 'breathing' visuals, and a riveting foreboding atmosphere.There's also very weird humour, which actually made me & my lady laugh out loud a few times....tho' I imagine others might just find it weird.The film slightly drags in the final third (I watched the theatrical cut) and some of the character reactions will have you questioning its realism. The plot itself is fairly predictable...we've seen such films before. These are nitpicks as we also get a handful of strong memorable scenes.I initially gave it an 8/10, last few days have found myself rewatching some scenes...very strong film-making! Feels like it deserves a 9, a worthy tribute to 1973's The Wicker Man.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ummmmm wow,"One of the weirdest movies I've ever watched. I laughed out loud multiple times, not at something funny, but because I was asking myself, what am I watching? Many times this will result in a movie I loath. Every once in a while, it's just the right kind of weird. It maybe went overboard a few times, but the movie was good enough not to lose me.This is an extremely well-made movie. Directing and cinematography are fantastic. The performance by Florence Pugh is PHENOMENAL. There is one scene where you could hear her reaction without seeing her face, and I could feel what she was feeling deep in my bones. I'm so impressed. And this movie is filled with scenes and images I have never seen or could possibly imagine. Tons of memorable moments.EDIT: I'd been meaning to watch the director's cut, so I jumped at the chance when I found out they were releasing it in IMAX for one night only. The movie as a whole is just as good and weird as I remembered. But this time around, I felt the runtime much more with the additional 23 minutes. Even though there are some good additions, I personally will choose the theatrical cut for repeat viewings.(2 viewings, 2/23/2020, IMAX 6/20/2024)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

If Natural Born Killers had been filmed at Woodstock...,"Midsommer is the second feature length film written and directed by Ari Aster. If you're a fan of his first film Hereditary, I highly suggest watching Midsommer. Expect to see vague similarities and an overall running theme; however, be ready for a completely different feel than the more blatant horror of Hereditary.Midsommer gives the feel of an unending trip gone terribly bad. I honestly haven't felt so anxious watching a movie since I saw Requiem for a Dream. Nevertheless, as weird and bizarre as the film is... I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. It's almost like poking a sore and having it hurt, yet wanting to poke it more and more. I realize that it seems like i'm rambling and maybe none of this makes sense to the reader; however, it is my best attempt at explaining what I just saw without giving away any details.I highly suggest going into the film without having any background. DO NOT READ ANYTHING REVEALING WHAT ITS ABOUT! Just grab some snacks and popcorn and get ready for a 2 1/2 hour weird ride.The film itself is beautifully shot and brimming with color, light, and beautiful scene scapes. I thought the acting was phenomenal, especially that of Jack Reynor who plays Christian in the film. Florence Pugh also brought a level of acting to the film that could definitely be considered award winning.I gave the film a 7 out of 10 not because of any flaws with the film, but just the fact that it was 2 1/2 hours long. A small amount of the film seemed to be drawn out a bit and I believe the same effect could have been achieved in a shorter amount of time.

Relationship Horror,"Writer/director Ari Aster really has a thing for dysfunctional family dynamics. ""Hereditary"" basically gave us the family from hell, and ""Midsommar"" gives us more of the same. At the center of this horror movie is a couple whose relationship is limping along -- he pretty much won't break up with her because of some recent traumatic events involving a murder/suicide in her family and the guilt he would feel at leaving her. Not the makings of a great romance. It's no wonder then that both find themselves allured, though in different ways, to a psycho hippy community while traveling in Sweden. He's wanted sexually for some mumbo jumbo rituals while she enjoys being embraced by one big damn family, no matter how bonkers they may be.Aster is an effective filmmaker and knows how to put together images that will unsettle and linger in the viewer's mind for a while. But this movie is too long and too lugubriously paced to be as effective as it might otherwise be. Florence Pugh is really good in the film's first half, but by the end she's so zonked out and hysterical that her performance grows tiresome. It's not really her fault -- it's just that there's far too much movie for her to have to fill.People who like a hard ""R"" rating will get their money's worth, but much of what gives the film its ""R"" rating comes off as silly.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disturbingly good...!!!,"Ari Aster unravels this psychological horror film taking the audience on a twisted journey into a disturbing cult. With a runtime of 147 minutes, this movie is not for the faint of heart.One of the standout aspects of MIDSOMMAR is its visually stunning cinematography. The film takes a bright paintout of sunlight throughout, which creates a stark contrast to the dark and unsettling events that unfold. The detailing in the set design and costumes further immerses the audience in the unique unsettling atmosphere of the village.Florence Pugh delivers a captivating portrayal of Dani, capturing the character's vulnerability and gradual descent into madness. Jack Reynor as Christian also delivers a strong performance, effectively portraying his character's selfishness and moral ambiguity.Ari Aster's direction is masterful, as he expertly builds tension and creates an overwhelming sense of dread. The pacing of the film is deliberate, allowing the audience to fully absorb the disturbing events as they unfold. The use of symbolism and foreshadowing adds depth to the narrative, making MIDSOMMAR a thought-provoking and unsettling experience.The horror elements of MIDSOMMAR are not reliant on jump scares or gore. Instead, the film relies on psychological terror and a constant sense of unease. The rituals and traditions of the village are depicted in a disturbingly realistic manner, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.While MIDSOMMAR is undoubtedly a visually striking and well-crafted film, it may not be everyones cup of tea...Additionally, the slow pacing of the film may test the patience of some viewers.Overall ""MIDSOMMAR"" is a chilling and thought-provoking horror film that offers a unique and unsettling experience,which may not appeal to all audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Had more potential,"The main feeling I had after seeing this was that of disorientation. There's a whole lot of mushrooms being taken in this film, and in that regard it at least succeeds in making you feel like you took a bad trip. Also, the fact that this was very pretty to look at, makes for an unsettling experience.However, I have to say I was disappointed at the lack of horror (or that ""sinking"" feeling one has after seeing a good horror). While I understand everything that happened plot-wise, I'm not completely sure what the film was trying to say. It felt like they threw a bunch of ideas at the wall hoping one would stick, when none of them really did. For all the buildup, the story ended up being predictable and flat.This might be a bit spoilery: Cults are not inherently ""scary"", and neither is deformity or deformed people... which disturbingly feels exploited here just for shock value. Gore and face-bashing is not scary, just off putting and gross. Toxic relationships and co-dependency might be horrific, but with that setup you could predict where the plot was going from a mile away, so nothing ends up being much of a surprise.I can't help but compare this to Hereditary, which was a very effective horror flick, but don't go into this expecting more of the same. It's slow and meandering and lacking in some much-needed horror elements. It was memorable though, and I will continue to see more Ari Aster films because they're interesting.

A Perfect Score!,I love this movie. It's fantastic. Great story about co-dependency and PTSD and gas lighting and cheating and good and evil and bullying and narcism and everything good and bad about the human spirit. The writing is beyond fantastic. I don't understand how anyone could not love this movie. It is a thinking persons movie. It is a masterpiece. It's one of these movies I always have to explain to everyone else who for some reason do not get it. It's plain and right there in front of you - you just have to pay attention! So pay attention and watch this masterpiece.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"weird, not everyone would like it","I personally thought it was quite interesting and i like how it keeps getting weirder and weirder but i do understand why some people wouldn't like it and would think it's boring, certainly if you're more into violent and gory films. If you're more of a psychological horror ( it's not really a horror it's quite hard to put a word to it really) sort of person you might like it. It can be a bit slow and lose people which i get but i think the scenery in it and the gradual rise in weirdness makes up for it. I'm not sure i would recommend it, but i would say if you're into that stuff go for it. It is very long though which is a downside, and it's not as though it's very entertaining to make up for the length.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Strange goings on in a remote Swedish community,"Dani his having relationship problems with her boyfriend Christian who has failed to mention that he is going to Sweden with friends for the summer to visit the home village of one of the friends. Following a family tragedy Dani invites herself on to the trip. When they arrive in Sweden they head to the remote community and find the locals preparing for a special Midsummer festival that only takes place once every ninety years. They aren't the only outsiders present; a young English couple had been invited by another villager. At first nothing feels too strange; then the visitors witness a shocking ceremony that leaves some of them wanting to leave. Those who stay gradually learn more about the community... however they don't learn just how the festival is to end until it is too late.This is a hard film to categorise; there are clearly horror tropes but for most of the run time little is happening. I didn't find it boring though. Rather than being scary I found it to be unsettling; the anticipation of something bad happening was more effective than when it did happen for the most part. There are some gruesome scenes but less than one might expect. While this may be a less disturbing film I couldn't help but be reminded of the 1970's classic 'The Wicker Man'; hardly surprising as the themes are so similar. The cast is impressive; especially Florence Pugh who is brilliant as Dani. Most of the film is set in a single location and that location looks really gorgeous as well as being somewhat ominous due to its apparent remoteness. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody, I'm sure many will hate it, I however really enjoyed it and despite its length and slow pace was never bored... I'd certainly recommend checking it out.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not what I hoped it would be,"I thought Hereditary was great and I really wanted to like Midsommar but I found it quite predictable. If you are a horror fan or even just read the synopsis you can see where the film is going from about 15 minutes in, that's ok if the plot has some twist or unpredictable elements but unfortunately it basically plays out like you expect.The film has some good moments and starts off with similar themes of grief and loss that Hereditary had which was expertly done again here. There is also quite a lot of humour (mainly from Will Poulter) which was done well. When the group goes to Sweden there are a few moments of horror and definitely a feeling that something is not right (which you expect from reading the synopsis) but way too much of the ceremonies, chanting and communal wailing which I ended up getting a bit bored with and wanting more to happen. I have no problem with long films building an atmosphere of dread but they honestly could have shaved 30 minutes off the run time and the film would have been no different.As the film progresses towards the end there is one bizarre elongated sex scene that had people laughing out loud in the cinema I was in. Although there is lots of general weirdness and strange cult practices which does convey a sense of uneasiness I don't think there was enough of a feeling of genuine dread or horror. I kept thinking the slow build up would lead to some really horrendous scenes towards the end and some unpredictable ending but for me there was nothing particularly shocking or scary towards the end.

Think Donnie Darko, The Wicker Man, Hereditary. Then give this movie a shot. I really enjoyed the subtle clues to the plot that the director gave.

Perfect in every single way.,"Midsommar is a 2019 horror film directed by Ari Aster (Hereditary) and stars Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor as a dysfunctional couple who travel to Sweden to visit the Midsommar festival. This festival, located in a quaint Swedish village quickly turns into an unsettling and violent holiday, hosted by a pagan cult.It's very hard to achieve a perfect 10/10 score from me. The film has to be perfect in every aspect, both technically, and story-wise. Midsommar is a perfect film. Every single act, every single scene, every single shot... is perfect. I watched this film for my second time last night, yet this time I watched the director's cut, still perfect. But just what makes this film so good?The film stays clear of horror cliches. No lazy jump scares and no stupid exposition to keep the plot going, just a genuine film, that is written brilliantly by Ari Aster. The film has clear inspiration from other horror films, which seems to be a common criticism among the audience members, but why should that be a criticism? The film is still original, yes it takes some plot devices from other films, and yes some shots/scenes may be inspired, but why does that matter? Every film has inspirations, every film will have occasions where it may not be original. Besides the point, Midsommar takes these inspirations and just improves on them.Florence Pugh's performance is the best of this year. No argument. She is stunning. One of the best modern actresses today. She is outstanding in what may be the greatest horror film performance of all time. The rest of the class is just phenomenal. Will Poulter manages to bring humour into such a horrific, eerie story, and Jack Reynor really makes his and Florence Pugh's character's relationship so alive.The film's cinematography was also, the best of this year. So gorgeous, and how almost this whole film is shot in natural light, and during day time, is genius. The film leaves me in dismay and shock, despite it being a horror film, shot in the daytime. I loved the use of natural light, and the cinematography again is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Each shot gives me a sense of discomfort and manages to unsettle me. So damn creative as well. Goddamnit just thinking about the cinematography makes me want to cry of happiness.The score is the best of this year easily. Bobby Krlic creates a score that incorporates elements of Swedish folk music that proves to be horrifically hopeless. The score somehow stands out to the already unbelievable film. Take a listen to the score. Please. The score is so soothing, so delightful, yet behind such a disgustingly gory and disturbing film.The film's story is fantastic. A great narrative, with deeper meaning. I loved watching this film a second time. I could interpret the film any way I wanted to. The movie is a slow burn, much like Ari Aster's previous work Hereditary (2018). I slowly watched everything go to crap, and I loved it. The film is a perfect cult movie. Watch it.

A straight slasher movie about a Swedish Cult!,"Rating: 7The title is the best summary I can put up for the movie. I cannot describe this movie in a better sense for I myself couldn't understand the motive behind it. After producing a movie like Hereditary, I believe Aster failed to shine on this one. The only reason I am giving it a 7 is because of it's outstanding visuals. I like art-movies which have beautiful visuals and this does not sway from the trend. The theme of the film also revolves around manipulation. It shows how cults tend to manipulate the weak by seducing them in showing the world their way.The Good - The cinematography and the acting. I appreciate the visuals, the vividness and the brilliant acting put up by Florence Pugh. I also like the fact how some scenes turn out to be outright hilarious, disturbing and sad.The Bad - Although Pugh's acting was great her character was whining at every moment in the film. I don't know whether to sympathize with the character or just be depressed by it. The movie involves grotesque rituals which will either be comical or disturbing to you.I could find symbolism in the movie and I wouldn't point it out as I would like for you to see it. The movie is for the people who appreciate experimental, art-movies. If you want to watch a horror movie for jumpscares, this movie is not for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

What an outstanding script; the characters are thought-through and have depth, the disorientation and sense of dread develop at a flawless pace, and our protagonist actually makes a painful and cathartic journey rarely seen in the genre. All of this is approached with a bright and colorful visual style, unusual and fresh and disorienting to the audience as the circumstances are to the characters.

best original horror concept in a long time,"If you're looking for jump scares or gore, this film has little to none of either and may not keep your attention. It is a sort of surreal, art house horror that dives into the psyche and plays with the emotions of the viewers. From the first few minutes to the last i was incredibly uncomfortable but never lost interest in what was coming next. Some parts are slow and some are predictable but neither of those things took away from the film somehow. The parts that were slow were painful in a way that the viewer feels anxious, confused, and fearful for long extended periods of time which make the horrifying things happening to the characters seem all the more real and the parts that you could predict were no less shocking than if you couldn't have seen them coming at all. The imagery and cinematography was beautifully done. Great shots, and seeing floral colors and white dresses juxtaposed with the dark subject matter made me just as uneasy as everything else.There have been a lot of remakes this year that have been great but this is the first original concept I've seen in a while that I truly thought was brilliant. I left the theatre feeling almost traumatized in a way but haven't stopped thinking about the film since which I'm not sure is what a lot of people are looking for but is how I feel true horror should make you feel.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good idea that goes off track,"A somewhat interesting idea that goes off track. This is the kind of thriller/horror film that requires a good deal of suspension of disbelief. In the US, a college student with Swedish background invites three of his male friends and one female to travel with him to Sweden for a special ethnic celebration. Before they leave, we see a lot of background about the young woman (very well acted by Florence Pugh). She's very troubled and has recently, tragically lost her family. Much of what she sees in Sweden will trigger painful memories for her. *No Real Spoilers* here, but just to say that the very elaborate ceremony they witness is nothing like what they might have expected. The main issue is that a few of the important plot points are inconsistent with the nature of the religious group as presented early on. Based on what we see and know, why would certain things happen? The ceremony is set in an isolated location, but the visitors, and a couple of other attendees, are not local and it would seem someone would eventually be asking about them. In one particularly shocking scene near the end, one might well ask: ''what was the point of that?' This film is beautifully planned out in terms of space and especially in terms of color. The young actors are all just fine, with a couple of awkward moments excepted. Not recommended for the squeamish, but it's certainly something different.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Close to being really good,"I thought that the beginning was slow, maybe deliberately, but it didn't quite get the effect the filmmaker was trying to achieve, in the sense that watching people for one hour arguing did not make us invested in the slightest in the characters, there were other methods that could have been used. The twist, although expected, in the midpoint was pretty good- my only problem was that the characters kept talking about how crazy that twist was for twenty minutes afterward until you didn't think it was that crazy. The second half was definitely superior, but it never reached the heart pounding dread that you would have wanted it to. It was close enough to that point where you were interested, but far enough where you never really felt bad when a someone died or were scared for the main characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Even long, with unnecessary subplots (the doctoral theses rivalry) and underutilized supporting characters, ""Midsommar"" differentiates itself by bringing many symbolisms","Unashamedly drinking from the source of folk horror, a genre that includes the seminal ""The Wicker Man"", ""The Stigma of Satan"" and ""The Witch Hunter"", the film draws disquiet from the deliberate ways of the festival's organizer-participants, who , with their white clothes, long hugs and looks full of ulterior motives, can often be seen in strange actions in the background in several frames, subtly keeping the audience always uncomfortable - something highlighted by the long shots and slow camera movements. Meanwhile, Bobby Krlic's (read: The Haxan Cloak) dissonant score reflects the chaos hidden by the light and calm surface of the place, which is also suggested by the dizzying shot that inverts the characters' world when the car they occupy approaches its destination. Once again playing with reflections and the duality they symbolize, the filmmaker this time allows himself greater freedom by investing in a more varied color palette that crosses his own arc, starting in the dark environment with sad tones inhabited by Dani (until the sun rays that often become visible thanks to suspended particles - or smoke - seem melancholic) until culminating in a small explosion of colors at the climax that flirts with Technicolor by bringing life to Nature that the locals see as the central axis of the community. Not surprisingly, from the beginning, the protagonist sees, when under the action of hallucinogens, the grass becoming part of her own body - and, later, an elaborate wreath of flowers includes one that pulses as if breathing.Aster builds a protective network between himself and the images, between the images and the public. Very evoking the tone of Stanley Kubrick (from ""The Shining, 1980"" and the class of John Carpenter (from ""The Thing, 1982""), the director demonstrates that he has absolute control in each scene. In this way, understanding the power of each question prescribed in the script, the director invests in the construction of space. This purposeful separation between creator and work ends up removing the dramatic power and solidifying the estrangement. In this sense, close-ups are practically absent, demonstrating a concern with diverting a probable identification of the public towards the main character and deposit this feeling of recognition in the atmosphere, in the tension. In this way, events like the one that traumatizes Dani during the opening are treated with the intention of causing sensations, in the search for a suffering not of empathy, but precisely of horror on the part of the viewer. The shots that never go beyond the Americans and the slow motion in the revelation of the fateful initial episode, for example, lead to an emotional shock that is as immersive as it is unpleasant. At this point, curiosity sets in; a need to know so as not to get close again; and a fundamental desire for life in terror: to understand fears, traumas and pain to the point of rationalizing them and being able to reverse them.With this base, ""Midsommar"" reaches its most delicate and painful theme: loneliness. While Dani is presented as the personification of an isolation caused by external agents - the harsh death of her family, her boyfriend lacking the courage to end the relationship, the offer of friendship out of pity... -, it is this same concept that demonstrates how much the non-belonging, the pain of not feeling part of the world, makes one seek affection and acceptance in the most desperate conditions. Still, Aster abuses the distance, sharing the character's suffering and pulverizing it (the suffering) throughout the film's almost two-and-a-half-hour duration. Dani's distress and anguish become the film's keynote. Her screams of despair -at the end of said opening -seem to echo until the final scene, when the idea of starting over can start to make sense. And in that sense, all the bitterness, agony and tightness are translated by Pugh with incredible talent. The actress solidifies what is perceptible through her eyes - like when she wants to demonstrate that everything is okay even though she is internally destroyed - and goes to emotional catharsis in torturous anxiety attacks with a naturalness that, in itself, is frightening. She (Pugh), by the way, is mainly responsible for highlighting the script's explicit desire to reduce supporting characters (including her cowardly boyfriend). This is due to the fact that, in the end, it was not Christian (Jack Reynor), Josh (William Jackson Harper), Mark (Will Poulter) and Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) who actually diminished, but she who loomed large.Unlike ""Hereditary"", here the proposal is more visible. Although there are symbols that require further research - the paintings on display, the meaning of the runes, the Ruben oracle (Levente PuczkÃ³-Smith) ... -, the intention of this set to symbolize the end of Dani and Christian's relationship and the discoveries about his true character are explicit (the lack of sincerity and trust, for example, justified in conversations between friends and in the mating sequence). And there is the bear, which symbolizes in some beliefs as the awakening of your true nature, cruel and rude; and the contrast between light (life) and night (death) already exposed in the frame that opens the film. The discomfort grows in this proposal to evoke otherness at almost every moment for a good part of the duration, intimidating with its two and a half hours. Customs are represented in scenes of long silence, or through the peculiar illustrations that adorn the village's houses and stables. The elaborate production design carries the paints in vivid colors, which under a purposefully overexposed photography, creates yet another paradox with the main character's dark interior, which sometimes overrides the external beauty. That is, of course, until ""Midsommar"" takes on its more traditional horror aspects.By far, Ari Aster's greatest merit in ""Midsommar"" is building an atmosphere of paranoia and strangeness that is almost close to perfection. Whether it's working on Dani's movement with a group of friends and her own boyfriend upon arriving at a house, traveling in a car on a road in which the camera turns 180 degrees or in the very well-constructed transition from a dream to a sequence shot Inside the community room, the director creates, together with the precious help of the soundtrack of cutting violins composed by the British musician The Haxan Cloak and the sound team, a scenario in which the viewer is left aimless, after all, the foundations of that universe always sound misleading. In the first few minutes, for example, ""Midsommar"" raises doubts about Dani's possible instability by suggesting an exaggerated and possessive person or whether her concerns about her boyfriend and family are credible. This classic element of horror, however, does not come for free, after all, the script observes the sexist components in this observation by placing elements of an abusive and derogatory relationship between Christian and his own friends regarding the character of Florence Pugh, in addition to our own as society by always evaluating a woman's problems as hysteria. Ari Aster, however, becomes even more acidic and provocative the moment the characters arrive at the Swedish village. Here, ""Midsommar"" gradually exposes the hypocrisies of religious dogmas and the evils of fanaticism taken to the extreme. It all starts with the gentle and peaceful approach taken by missionaries, who take advantage of a person's emotional weaknesses to attract new believers, as happens with Dani after the loss of her parents and the turbulent situation in her relationship with Christian. From then on, the spiral of madness only increases through sacrifices in the name of a God filled with a lot of blood, the rigid structure of society, intolerance towards other beliefs, the death of innocent people in the name of protecting that people, among others.Despite the inevitable comparison with ""The Wicker Man"", a cult horror film directed by Robin Hardy in 1973, and the atmosphere of horror created by the director, it is possible to see a certain irony in ""Midsommar"" similar to that seen in ""Divino Amor"", by Gabriel Mascaro. The deformed religious leader, for example, guides everyone with colorful scribbles in a book similar to the Bible, as well as the incomprehensible roars and grunts of the rituals make everything even more sense. The presence of young guests from the USA, sitting at the table in informal clothes while everyone is wearing white as in the 15th century, only amplifies the anachronism of this universe. This all culminates in the fantastic final sequence in which screams dominate the scene, generating anguished and nervous laughter from the audience.With a slightly excessive length (20 minutes less would fit perfectly), unnecessary subplots (the doctoral theses rivalry) and underutilized supporting characters (poor Will Poulter), ""Midsommar"" may not even be perfect, however, it turns out to be another great example of recent horror. With many symbolisms, an impeccable art direction, which participates in the story, narrative resources that provide a distressing and distressing suspense, strong images that impress with their violence, Midsommar becomes one of the main psychological horrors of the new genre cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Beautiful Madness,"Unlike any horror film you've seen in recent years, Midsommar is beautiful, disturbing, and uncomfortable throughout. As we accompany our protagonists on their journey to the countryside of Sweden, the peaceful and serene setting the film establishes is slowly corrupted. Piece by piece the angelic facade the film creates slowly deteriorates. As an audience we feel this unnerving tension develop through the minor changes in the behavior of the Swedish hosts. It creates a world which seems almost like a dream, but is grounded by the relatability of the protagonists and the empathy we as an audience seek to feel. With its strange rituals and nonsensical customs, Midsommar truly is an experience which is best explained only through watching the film. Midsommar doesn't try to scare you, but rather leave you unsettled with its countless memorable shots that will stay with you once you leave the theater. So rather than continue to explain, do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful cultish nightmareIf you enjoy arthouse films, this is a horror movie you won't want to skip.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yes!,"With this second film, the directorAri Asterbecomes a specialist of films that strongly disturb the audience via subtly-glaucous atmospheres.While Dani (Florence Pugh) comes out of a particularly tragic event, her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) will propose to her, while they were in a phase of rupture, to accompany him to a nine-day festival that takes place once every 90 years, around the summer solstice, in an isolated Swedish village. The trip was suggested by his friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) a native from the said village. The two other friends, Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter), are also part of the trip. But what begins as a carefree holiday will quickly take a far more ominous and disturbing turn, the villagers being all members of the same sect with radical and even barbaric traditions.Even if the script is radically different,Midsommar (2019)looks a bit likeThe Shining (1980)with its slow but ineluctable descent into hell. 7/8 of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror

"Swedish Meatballs, Breakups, and a really bad trip","After walking out of a late night screening of this movie I felt something I had not felt from a film in a long time, genuinely disturbed. Ari Aster's work in this film is simply stunning. From the beginning you are hit over the head with a gut punch, and the film isn't quick to relent. The themes in this movie are heavy: suicide, grief, bad relationships, and violence. Where Midsommar excels is in its ability to draw you into its world. The commune community in Sweden is so well portrayed and executed you begin to understand its language. Like the protagonist Dani, by the end of the film you ""feel like you can speak Swedish"" in that the symbolism of the commune all lines up nicely.This is a ethereal film in every sense. Cameras shake and pan in unusual ways. Transitions are creative but not repetitive. The violence and sex in the film is both shocking and uncensored. The result is a movie that clearly has a vision and purpose and hits the ideas its trying to convey effectively.The cinematography and production design are Oscar worthy. Truly the world created here is so believable and well done that alone is worth the price of admission.Why this movie is a 9 instead of a 10 for me is that I felt it was a touch too long and could have cut a character or two. Some of the auxiliary doesn't serve that much of a purpose in the greater story of the film.That being said, I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers, horror, drama, and character drama. It is a reminder that the human spirit is weird, disturbing at times, and tragically chaotic. Nature is naturally violent, and as is said in the film ""nature is effortlessly in balance"" and human beings are part of that balance.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The couple along with other friends travel to Northern Europe to visit a rural hometown's fabled Swedish mid-summer festival. There a community practicing bizarre pagan sexual rites . What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult with several details in the movie are depictions of actual Swedish folk customs and old beliefs. Let the festivities begin !.A terrifying fiction about a grieving girl who's haunted by an unfortunate tragedy , as she takes a vacation to forget a tragic accident and then happens a lot of disturbing occurrences, including suspense , intrigue , turns , a lot of twisted incidents , at the same time charged with tension , threatening deeds , unflinching depictions of graphic violence and high level staging which the viewer could really enjoy . This extraordinary and harrowing film from Ari Laster , is considered to be one of the finest horror films made in the 2000s.

Very persuasively and intelligent script written by director Ari Aster himself . The flick was inspired by actual Swedish folk customs and most serious historians consider the story a reflection of the Icelandic medieval tradition of depicting Swedes as barbarous on account of them converting to Christianity a century later than Iceland.

One bad trip.,"'Midsommar (2019)' takes a very long time to get to a very predictable and, frankly, uninteresting point. It's just so slow and, honestly, boring. There's nothing all that engaging about the story, and perhaps its most - or, maybe, only - intriguing thematic aspect is reserved until the very end - the final shot, even. This seems to be as spur-of-the-moment for the film as the decision that leads to it does for the central character. The general theming of the feature isn't all that strong or cohesive and its events don't act as an 'allegory' for the theme, either. This leads to an aimless vibe, a sense of almost making things up as they go along. This creates some issues when everything starts tying together, especially in terms of overall motivation. I mean, some things in here just aren't believable. Plus there's no actual mystery driving the plot, so there's never any tension or suspense. I will say that one sequence is properly horrifying, punctuated by gruesome imagery not for the faint of heart, but it stands as the sole example of something that comes close to getting under your skin and, as such, feels sort of out of place, in a way. It's also brushed off quite quickly, despite being revisited a few times. Still, the film isn't scary. It's not disturbing, either. Most of the 'horror' just comes from the unfamiliarity of the situation - that being a foreign festival presented as a long-held, normalised tradition - from an outside perspective. On top of that, you don't care about the characters - who often make odd, audience-distancing decisions - enough to be affected when things inevitably take a darker turn. That's a bit of an issue. Obviously, the piece is well made, no-one's debating that. It has an effective, if slightly obnoxious, score and makes some distinct visual choices. However, technical competence cannot make up for narrative failure. The opposite of this seems to be the erroneous basis for most of the movie's somehow glowing reviews. Of course, if you really like it, then you like it and that's good for you. I'm just saying that there comes a point where you have to stop awarding, essentially, participation points to well-made but empty fare; most pictures are at least competently constructed and even those that aren't can be enjoyable - or more enjoyable than something like this, at least. The film isn't engaging, entertaining or even close to terrifying, despite its undeniable technical competence. Also, the influences of 'The Wicker Man (1973)' are unmistakable - it actually has quite a bit in common with 'The Wicker Man (2006)', as well. Look, horror doesn't have to scare, as such, but it should do something. This doesn't really do anything and it takes a very long time to do it, too. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Every time I go to Sweden,"In Finland our midsummer celebration includes a kokko, which is a large pile of wood and sometimes other junk that is then set on fire. Once when I was a kid I was visiting Sweden at midsummer and there was this pole that was covered with flowers and plants. I asked when is it going to be burnt down but I was told that it's not going to happen. People were just dancing around the pole and nothing happened. It was so boring and I couldn't understand where's all the action.I think the fact that I have some sort of familiarity with the nordic traditions made it easier to like this film. Many people complain how extremely disturbing it is but I was quite right at home with it. Of course I wouldn't want to be in a situation like in the film but hey, who wants to be in a horror movie anyway? Another thing is that I have a lot of interest towards weird religious movements so I found the topic very fascinating.The cinematography and also the sound design were great. Like fresh air after all the clones of The Conjuring and such unimaginative and loud jump-scare marathons. The main characters seemed interesting at first but maybe didn't develop enough. In general I felt like the beginning and buildup was the best. Then again towards the end it became more psychedelic and weird which was cool too but lost some of the momentum of the plot.Overall I think this was one of the better horror/thriller/weird movies I have seen from recent years. Maybe a bit ""style over substance"" but I'm ok with that kind of thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

What just happened to me?,"As many already suggested, go into this knowing as little as possible. This movie will not be for everyone. It is not a scary movie cut from today's typical cloth. It reminds me of 60s and 70s horror like Kubrick and Polanski. Smart, deliberate, beautifully shot slow burn that grips you from the beginning and holds on until they decide to let you breathe with the horror. Ari is a director that cannot be reckoned with in my opinion. I left this movie feeling exactly how I felt after Hereditary. Disturbed, uncomfortable, and knowing I will be thinking about it for a long time. Florence was brilliant at making you feel for her, while being just neurotic enough that you felt for her boyfriend along the way. Also, this movie makes you feel every emotion, even ones you don't want to! Lines are blurred between good and evil, what is ok to see or not see, and an ending that leaves you wanting more. Go see this if you want something very different and powerful. Be prepared for large doses of gore, ""unsavory"" topics, and non gratuitous full nudity. They are part of the movie, and I'm not sure if i would have changed any of it, even though I feel they distract from most movies. Another masterpiece by A24 studios.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Wicker Man"" meets ""The Village""","Invited by their genial Swedish friend, four college students from New York take a vacation to rural Sweden to experience a Midsummer celebration at a commune. A couple of them are cultural anthropology students, who are naturally interested in the friendly isolated group and their odd ceremonies. The situation goes from friendly and curious to shocking. Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor play the American protagonists.""Midsommar"" (2019) is folk horror that plays out like ""The Wicker Man"" (1973/2006) meets ""The Village"" (2004) with elements of ""The Lords of Salem"" (2012). The topic of visiting a secluded pagan religious community and the increasing challenges thereof can be seen in other flicks like ""Ogre"" (2008), ""The Ritual"" (2017) and ""Apostle"" (2018), as well as the recent Indie ""Devil's Island"" (2021).If you like these kinds of movies ""Midsommar"" delivers the goods. Writer/director Ari Aster did his homework, combining fact with fiction, old and new. There's an insightful comparison between the lack of social intimacy in modern Western culture and the family-like camaraderie of the remote Commune. Pugh makes for an effective protagonist and there's some convincing gore. It's a professionally made piece no doubt.Unfortunately, the first half is more compelling than the second, which devolves into tedious ceremonies and the corresponding gobbledygook. Hammer's ""The Mummy"" (1959) had the same issue but was mercifully an hour shorter. ""Midsommar"" needed tightened up for a more gripping viewing experience, but directors generally don't like to cut scenes from their 'baby.'The film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes, and was shot in Budakeszi, Hungary (HÃ¥rga), as well as Korda Studios, Etyek, and Budapest, Hungary; Dani's apartment was shot in Brooklyn, New York.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Masterpiece,"Country you go, custom you find. Most of the time, we are talking about celebrations culminating in gargantuan binges of food and / or hectoliters of alcoholic beverages, but in the presence of closed communities, which perpetuate long-standing habits, it is possible to witness unexpected events, literally alien to the conception of time.All the more when we move into an unknown reality, it is desirable to take the necessary precautions, not to break the eggs in the basket, to avoid making it out of the jar (here, in the literal sense) and keep the eyes open.In extreme cases, as happens in Midsommar - The village of the damned, there is no other option but to be sucked into a bewitching and hallucinogenic vortex, within which even the most elementary form of free will is not contemplated.Coming from a multiple grief, Dani (Florence Pugh) decides to join Christian (Jack Reynor), her boyfriend, and friends Mark (Will Poulter), Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgran), on the organized trip to visit a community in the remote Swedish countryside, with the intention of attending their traditional midsummer party.From their arrival on the spot, they will witness unpredictable events, which will become increasingly violent and insidious, to the point of making them the main protagonists without their knowledge.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Overhyped, like everything these days but definitely worth a look-see...","Much like Ari Aster's first film, this is a well constructed drama that insidiously morphs into horror, leaving one to reflect on the many signposts that lead to its inevitable climax.Not so good: The American characters are largely uninteresting and unsympathetic, whether that was the intention, I don't really care. There are also problems with the running time and like nearly every film that comes out now, it needs a damn good trimming. Ironically I hear that the director is prepping a longer director's cut - lordy give me strength!!Good: this is a very handsome film, the lighting is some of the best I have ever seen and complements the excellent framing and production design, which has clearly been produced with serious TLC. The plot unfolds with a tantalising amount of unease and there are some very effective, well-controlled moments. Its best feature though, is that there is a lot here to unpick and a second viewing will surely unearth some hidden diddlers that were missed first time around.It has obvious genetic links with The Wicker Man and it's fair to make comparisons but to say it is simply a rip off is a very blunt observation indeed... those reviewers need to learn some nuance. 6.5-7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dragged out nonsense,"One of the only saving graces of this film was the cinematography which was very impressive.I appreciate that it is intended to be surreal, and almost like a trip, but the complete lack of any semblence of a plot meant that I was considering leaving the cinema halfway through.It's an incredibly long film with a very unsatisfying ending. The characters have no depth. There is a fine line between a bizarre masterpiece (think Hereditary, Requiem for a Dream) and poorly thought out nonsense. This film masquerades as one which will make you think and search for the 'hidden meaning'. In reality, there isn't a hidden meaning and it is simply a series of shots of Swedish people chanting and makes absolutely no sense.If you are a huge fan of impressive cinametography, give it a go.Its pretentious, dull and nonsensical.

Horror Story About The Nature Of Cults,"It's easy to forget, as you reach the end of this shattering horror story, that it opens with a moment of trauma. Before the central characters leave the U.S. for their trip to a seemingly idyllic commune in Sweden, one of them is visited with profound, shocking grief. Once they're in Sweden, it takes a good while for earth-shaking events to take place; not that these are not hinted at, of course. But as the scene is set, we are treated to something like a Robert Altman film. Multiple characters on the screen deal with each other as they relax on hillsides, play music, settle in, etc. In short, the sheer realism of this movie makes its sheer terror all the more plausible. Describing the plot can never do justice to the first-rate acting, cinematography and editing. Hitchcock once said, ""I wanted PSYCHO to be a fun picture."" MIDSOMMAR is fun, as well. But PSYCHO wasn't a documentary. MIDSOMMAR has something of a documentary about it. It is very much about cults.
You have to bring something to it when you watch it. The audience I saw it with (in its first week here in the U.S.) began laughing about two-thirds of the way through a particularly detailed sexual scene. There was grim humor in it, but this was the laughter of discomfort. On the way out of the theatre, though, I got the sense that even people who said they were confused by it were entertained. THAT said, I'm not certain entertainment was intended. MIDSOMMAR is scary because much of what it depicts is the essence of cult life.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant but disturbing,"My husband and I both thought this film was genius for the horror genre. It's certainly NOT your typical horror film. And it's certainly NOT for someone who can't stand feeling disturbed while watching a film. The ""horror"" aspect of it was subtle rather than being the typical in-your-face type of horror and was more psychological than anything. Because of that, I appreciated this film (whereas I do not like most horror films). Visually, it's a gorgeous film. The fact that it primarily takes place in sunlight adds a strange surreal feeling -- a stark contrast between a gorgeous sunny day and what is actually going on beneath the surface in the film, which results in a strange dichotomy and a sense of cognitive dissonance for the viewer. Again, I thought this was genius. The plot was also not annoyingly predictable like so many other films are, which only adds to its genius. Again, I do not like most horror films, but this film is one of those rare gems that I can appreciate on all levels, including its plot, its complex psychological elements and its visual artistry. One of the very best ""horror"" films that I've ever seen. I hope to see more films coming from Ari Aster in the future.",,Anonymous,Horror

"A Full Swedish Nightmare, But Entertaining.","I did not really know much about Midsommar as I only saw one trailer but Midsommar is one of those movies that you see the trailer for it once and you feel like ""What in the hell is this?"" but let me tell you, A24 and Ari Asters delivered a true and incredible horror movie experience. The emotions, the action, the characters and the overall story was truly amazing and as a mega horror movie geek, I can tell you that the horror in the movie will not disappoint you at all. I also have to give props to Florence Pugh who delivered an incredible and I mean it, INCREDIBLE performance as the character Dani. Her emotions and acting made it seem like she was actually part of it. And we also have to give credit to Ari Asters for taking/making this make believe festival (or at least I think it is) and making it so realistic. If you need a good horror movie or a good movie to go see, don't see spiderman, go see Midsommar!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ari Aster is a genius.,"People have already said this countless times before about this film, and I'll say it again; this film is not your typical horror film. You might like that, you might not. I loved it. I watch a lot of horror films, and it's always refreshing to find a film that attempts to do something different with the genre.
It's not set in some creepy location like an asylum, or an old mansion, or a camping site in the middle of some dark woods. Instead, it's set in a bright and sunny village in the middle of Sweden. Visually, the film isn't dark. The scares don't play off a nighttime setting (in fact, I think only two scenes in the film take place during the night), but instead everything is set in the middle of the day where it's light and there's no shadows or chilling wind. The film is visually quite beautiful and aesthetic, with colourful shots of nature, and an overall amazing cinematography. And yet, every shot and every take of the flowers and the mountains and the trees feel so eerie and unsettling. It's something you have to watch to experience.
The characters are well-built, and most importantly, they feel real from the way they talk to the way they interact with one another. I'll take this moment to highlight the main character, Dani, a well-written character who is brilliantly portrayed by Florence Pugh.
I could keep praising the film, because I loved it that much, but I don't want to spoil too much. Just go watch it. It's definitely worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really good movie but not for everybody,"Ok, so....after having read both negative and positive reviews I was really curious about watching this movie since the visuals looked very appealing, and after watching it I felt it would be good to write a review in order to give you an idea so u can make up your mind about if u should go ahead and watch it or not =>First of all,this movie is not for you if.... =>You are looking for a standard entertainment movie following the standards of blockbusters movies ( a big action movie, comedy, etc... ). So....I can understand for example that the movie can get boring for some people.With that out of the way letÂ´s continue =>I have read in some reviews that the story doesnÂ´t make any sense.
Not true.
I think it makes a lot of sense specially if you have any idea about history, antropology or psychology. Anyhow, after watching the movie you can always investigate a little bit about it to understand on what the story is based on.So....how can I describe this movie in a very quick way ? =>I think this movie tries to be a masterpiece of art with an amazing photography...disturbing scenes and an insane story with a lot of psychological tints, and which contrasts with all the brightness and light in the visuals of the movie. Some might claim it is surreal but from my perspective and given how twisted human kind can be in reality, Iand how twsited human kind has been throughout history and in different cultures, the movie makes sense.I hope my review helps you to take your decission",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beautiful Film... Lacking Depth.,"The title says it all. The movie, all 2+ hours of it, is absolutely gorgeous. Shot by shot Ari Aster constructs a film that is top notch in terms of visuals.However, once one gets past the images - it's clear this film, and its premise is quite hollow. Not much story to be found, and when it is there - it is quite muddled.As a fan of Aster's previous work, Hereditary, I had high hopes for this one. This did not meet expectations.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some will like it - some will not,"So then - why do I give it 8/10?Because it is a brave picture, as well as being exceptionally well-made - on a modest budget of around 10-million dollars.Although it will not be to everyone's taste (it was most assuredly not my cup of tea), it touches upon subjects regarding the human psyche that are well worth being delved into.Regardless of whether you will feel like you have wasted some hours of your life or have garnered some precious food for thought, after having watched this movie; the odds appear to be in your favour.Movies should not be made for the sake of being outrageous, and this movie has certainly in my opinion not been so, however it is that rare thing in movies nowadays - a movie that sticks in your mind; and for this reason alone, we should celebrate it - even if we did not like it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't be fooled by unexperienced audience,"Ari Aster did great on his 2. release. Midsommar is for elite audience and shouldn't be watched by the typical horror audience. The people giving this movie a 3,4 etc. just don't get the movie. Its a movie about grief relationships filtered through a spine chilling horror plot without building tension with cheap jump scares and dumb stuff (like most horror movies did over the last years). Nobody ever did a movie like this & in that way. The performances are absolutely astonishing, the picture & the atmosphere fit perfectly together and all the easter eggs, representing metaphors are absolutely genius.

In her eyes, things were both in and outside her control.
But to the viewer, we see someone almost willingly walking towards a conclusion.The soundtrack is mesmerizing, and the slow pacing creates a brooding suspenseOverall, a horror movie that deserves cult status",,Anonymous,Horror

Horrifically Wonderful,"This is by far the best horror film I've seen in the past five or so years. I've actually seen it three times since it's release and will watch it again shortly after buying the extended version.This film isn't perfect. It could actually be a bit too long and the middle sequence after the mid-act climax is WAY too long for such an intense climax. With that said, there are a few things that completely make you forgive those mistakes.1. Florence Pugh's performance : She's absolutely amazing and captures the intricate details of a person's psyche after experiencing a traumatic event. Her performance also justifies her actions later in the film. We are constantly reminded that she is broken and fragile. In that state she could be easily manipulated and should'e been nurtured instead of patronized.2. The first sequence, Mid-climax and finale. Like I said earlier the parts in between these sequences are a bit too long but these scenes are masterful, especially the build-up to the middle sequence. Aster reminds us , in the beginning of this film , that TRUE horror comes in the form of depression, suicide, murder and supreme lost of a loved one. The beginning scene is almost too much to watch, especially if you've experienced similar horrific acts. The Mid-Climax is just simply horrific. There's nothing symbolic about it. It's just something that you almost don't want to see ever again. The ending is tamer in comparison to the first two sequences but it does successfully wraps up a surreal experience in the most perfect way.3. The cinematography: The beginning of the film is dark and appropriate for the theme,but the rest of the film, almost 2-1/2 hours of it , is represented in a wash of light and colors. It literally looks TOO perfect , of which is exactly the feeling you should get once you meet the cult. By the end of the film the light and colors become annoying. Too me that's a good thing, because, also by then, you are finding out how horrific of a setting the land is. This is a perfect way carrying out a concept through the details of a film.4. The deeper meaning: This is of course my interpretation but the deeper meaning of this film makes it a masterpiece. I've seen reviews saying that the film is unrealistic and that there is NO story or mystery in the film. I actually think the exact opposite. it's unrealistic to some because it's an analogy of something that is very REAL . The complete disconnect we as humans have with trauma is represented clearly in this film. The story to me is about this disconnect with trauma or the lack of meaningful relationships. This is the reason someone can be drawn to cults or negative influences. The supporting characters in this film represent the everyday reactions and responses to horrific trauma by a lot of people today (ie thoughts and prayers). The main character represents the person that is truly grieving and is often left alone or made to think that their grieving is actually wrong. To me this analogy makes this film VERY realistic and actually more scary than other horror films.I absolutely loved this film and can't wait to watch the extended version of it. It's the well crafted, thought provoking, type of horror that we need in this day and time. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The colours, sets, humans, sunsets, plants, trees, dances are dazzling to watch. Midsommar is nourishing to the soul.

A Chilling Journey into Terror,"""Midsommar"" isn't your typical horror flick. It's more like a rollercoaster ride through a nightmare. Picture this: a couple, Dani and Christian, go on a trip to Sweden with their friends. But what starts as a vacation quickly turns into a descent into madness.The movie does a great job of setting the scene. You feel the tension building right from the start, as Dani and Christian's relationship starts to unravel. When they arrive in Sweden, things get even weirder. The sun is always shining, the people are smiling too much, and there's something just not right about the whole place.As the story unfolds, you can't help but feel like something bad is going to happen. The atmosphere is tense, and you're on the edge of your seat waiting for the other shoe to drop. And when it does, it's like a punch to the gut.The movie's visuals are stunning, with bright colors and beautiful landscapes that contrast sharply with the darkness of the story. But don't let the pretty scenery fool you - there's horror lurking around every corner.While ""Midsommar"" may not be for everyone, it's definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of spine-tingling thrills and psychological twists. Just be prepared to be on edge the whole time, because once you're in, there's no turning back.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another masterpiece for Ari Aster,"Director Ari Aster said this was a film about dependency which he wrote during a breakup
... and it shows. But it's so much more.A commentary on religion, friendship, depression, identity -- all inside an extremely unsettling Swedish folklore, sex cult, horror story. And it's funny, too! Yes, all these ideas exist simultaneously in a brilliant and methodically paced film that frolics in the realm between all things Kubrick and the Wicker Man.There are layers upon layers, clues given, and a deliberately hypnotic and hallucinigenic sensibility that lolls the senses so that the more graphic scenes of graphic horror hit with jarring impact. Moreso, to me, than in Aster's previous film Heritary (the best film of 2018). Not for fans of quick cut commercial fare, the timid or the squeamish, Midsommar is a beautiful, horrifying meta-gestalt that I look forward to viewing again.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gorgeous yet boring,"Since I enjoyed ""Hereditary"" a lot, I was excited about Ari Aster's new film ""Midsommar"". Gotta say... kinda disappointed. I remember hearing from someone that the ending is insane and s**t really hits the fan. Maybe that's where I set my expectations wrong, because it never really does. The film is somewhat disturbing, but it never got to me in the way that the events of ""Hereditary"" did. I really think it comes down to two things:
1. The films lenght. Not even the running time per se, just how long and dull most of it is. I'm not very scared of traditions, let alone Swedish ones, so it feels more like a trip through an ethnographic museum than a horror film.
2. The characters make some choices and react in ways that just took me out of the experience. Also dialogue in some crucial points of the film (very rarely) to me seemed stupid and unbelievable.
Biggest advantage to this film is the cinematography and set design. Both were truly beautiful and kept me interested through some boring parts. Performances are mostly fine, but Florence Pugh is top notch. Gotta love those screaming, crying faces amirite, Ari?

One of the most captivating and disturbing movies I've ever seen,"It's hard to describe the movie without spoiling it but I'll try my best. It's definitely a movie that's better if you go in not knowing much about it. The film was beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. In many ways, it reminded me of classic horror movies like The Wicker Man (obviously the original and not the horrible remake). It's beautiful and horrifying all at the same time. The movie is a slow burn like Hereditary but it's really hard within the first few minutes. I almost wanted to walk out in the first few minutes. Not because it was bad, far from it. But because of how soul crushing and triggering the intro is. But the intro really sets the tone for the movie and is important for explaining why the main character feels and acts the way that she does. One of the things I love about this movie and Hereditary is how Aster doesn't shy away from pain and human suffering. It makes the movie more painful to watch, but the emotional connection is like none other (and there are scenes in Midsommar that directly mirror this communal feeling of pain and sorrow). It feels as if Aster wants you to be a part of the movie, feel the pain, sorrow, suffering, and confusion that the characters feel. At the very least, it makes for some of the best character development.All in all, Midsommar is very far from an enjoyable experience, but it is a must see because of how masterfully crafted the entire movie is. Just be warned, many of the scenes are quite shocking (some of the plot points you can easily see coming but the visual imagery is nothing short of shocking, even if you do predict what is going to happen).",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A visually striking yet divisive horror,"""Midsommar,"" directed by Ari Aster, is a visually stunning horror film that unfolds in the perpetual daylight of a secluded Swedish village. The story follows Dani (Florence Pugh) and her friends as they attend a rare midsummer festival that quickly turns nightmarish. Pugh delivers a compelling performance, capturing Dani's grief and vulnerability with authenticity.The film's strength lies in its cinematography and production design. The bright, colorful aesthetics contrast sharply with the dark themes, creating an unsettling atmosphere. The elaborate rituals and customs of the village are depicted with meticulous detail, adding to the film's eerie charm.However, ""Midsommar"" is not without its flaws. The slow pacing and lengthy runtime might test the patience of some viewers, and the film's blend of psychological horror and graphic violence may not appeal to all.

Hypnotisingly Beautiful and Horrifying All At Once,"A beautifully disturbing film that ever so slowly edges the viewer into a colorful nightmare, prevalent with themes of overcoming grief, dealing with toxic relationships, and ultimately, finding a sense of belonging in an apathetic world. The film portrays possibly one of the best horror film performances to date by Florence Pugh (the main female protagonist) who pours her heart and soul out so completely and yet in a way that feels utterly real and human. 'Midsommar' also boasts its best work with enchanting cinematography and a psychedelic soundscape, and slowly unveils unnerving revelations that would make one squirm and yet fail to avert their gaze from the entrancing, almost hypnotic feel of the picture. Ultimately though, the film falls short to a slow-moving and fairly simplistic narrative, that spans over a largely excessive run time. I would recommend this film to those who are fans of the artistic and moody side of the psychological horror genre, who can also forgive the elongated runtime and the dismal, contemplative pace.

An unnerving nightmare,"This was a doozy. One thing that you can tell right off the bat is that it feels like an Ari Aster film through and through. To be able to make your distinct voice/vision be apparent with just two films is really impressive, but he achieves it. He's a great director. He knows how to frame scenes, what to shoot, what to capture on camera, what kind of feeling to give. He's an incredibly visceral filmmaker and his strengths are captured here. I don't think this is as complete a picture as Hereditary (that was a near-masterful horror film) as I do think the biggest thing weighing this down is its runtime and sometimes a less clear focus. However, even with that said it's an incredibly impressive film. It's perhaps even less conventionally horror than Hereditary (and if audiences hated that, they will absolutely hate this. My audience hated it) but the entire journey and ride is one very much worth taking. By the end, it also feels very much like Hereditary in both content and style, with an ending that does leave you with the same feeling as Hereditary. Florence Pugh is really great here too. She commands the screen, and it's interesting to see her play this kind of role after Lady Macbeth where she has to give off a very different screen presence.",,Anonymous,Horror

Strangest experience ever,I went into this movie with a lot of hope and promise.The opening act was very strong and set it out to be a psychological horror/thriller. The premise was easy to follow with some absolutely spectacular cinematography to keep the narrative flowing. This movie is filled with vibrant colours and stand out symbolism to make it visually appealing. That is about where the actual good stuff ends.About an hour in all hell breaks loose on the strange spectrum. I found many parts of this comical and laughable which I have no idea if that was the intended purpose. Many narrative plot points are brought in visually but then never built upon. Some symbolism doesn't seem to mean much (from my opinion) and overall leaves the viewer confused. This had so much potential to be a different kind of horror masterpiece but unfortunately fell short.

Rethink Before Watching,"I am at a loss for words. I want to give this film a high rating, I really do. The acting was stunning from Florence Pugh and the cinematography was a work of art, but I don't think that redeems the film from the traumatic and disturbing scenes that unfold throughout the film.I still find myself unsettled by the events of the story. I felt like I needed a shower as I walked out of the theater, and as someone who can normally handle gore, violence, and demonic films, that is saying something.While Ari Aster is obviously a master filmmaker, the question must be asked, ""How far is too far?"" I liked the idea of the cult and Sweden and all the main aspects of the story, I just don't understand why Ari had to be so chilling with the events of the film. The way they throw bodies around like they mean nothing is disturbing to me. I understand that's how the cult works, but something just felt wrong from a human moral standpoint. How could someone (Ari) have such a sick and twisted mind to come up with a story like this?

Florence Pugh carried the movie,"The performances esp of Florence Pugh are exceptional! She makes it seem so real and she is truly the only character I cared about. This movie, despite being so annoyingly slow, had me on edge and my heart was pounding at every scene. I do believe the cinematography was exquisite and I loved the whole floral aesthetic. The plot, however, was hollow. There was hardly any story. The build up was great but the climax came a tad bit too late. I can't even for the life of me imagine what else does the directors cut have to provide as it was already so unnecessarily slow. The movie did serve its purpose though, that is to thoroughly disturb and traumatize its audience.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Definitely a one of a kind type of movie.,"This movie was something, some would even call it a trip.. Honestly this movie held my attention very well for 2 hours. That said, it is slow, and main thing that carried me throughout the movie was the mystery, and the visuals/directing.The movie is a bit vague and ambiguous about some things and that took me out of it once in a while. Also some character decisions, especially at the start seemed too flat versus what a real, modern day human would do and think.Whilst the acting is fantastic, especially from the lead, it is also enchanting how the ''natives'' act (cant remember the name). And I think the directing just exposes that even more, the directing is top notch. Its so perfectly choreographed and keeps you in this flow albeit slow.The music is top notch, blends in seamlessly with the whole movie.The horror/scare element. To me, not that great. I found this movie quite tame. But it is merciless with its violence and death. That's the impactful part. And surprisingly its very subtle for most of the movie. I expected more gruesome images from the things I have heard about this movie.The story, this is kind of where I just let it go honestly. And I think that was intended, sure I can see the deeper meaning behind it. But it didn't really open things up for me or felt impactful. It was okÃ©.Why I don't love this movie more, slow pace, lack of humor and just very methodical. Great for a first time viewing but I don't think watching it again will reveal other things. You have so much time to take things in, you're very aware during the movie.So overall, I'd recommend it to certainly any horror fan. In general I wouldn't recommend this too quickly just because of how obscure it is. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best films of the year.,"10/10What a delightful experience. I am so happy I got to see this incredible piece of art. This surely is one of the best films I have ever seen.Plot: After the tragic death of her family, Dani an emotionally unstable girl is invited to see a mid-summer festival in Sweden by her boyfriend. What started as a drug fueled, fun adventure in an otherworldly place takes increasingly darker turns with the passing of each day.From the first scene of the film two things stood out. One is the cinematography and the other is the background music. And these two gets better and better until the end. I have never seen such a beautiful film. There are parts of films that looked incredible but to make film this beautiful is truly a work of art. The music and visual creates an ambiance that clearly gives a hint that this is going to be a tragic film. Once the friends make it into the idyllic village of the Harga the cinematography becomes even more awesome. It felt like a trip. The music always kept the tension even while nothing of unease was unfolding.The first time we get to see the bizarre and possibly dangerous nature of the pagan ritual the characters are part of comes almost after an hour. The scene is so shocking that I had to look away from the screen. This is not a film for the faint of heart. It gets grotesque and bizarre from this point on.The acting was superb. Florence Pugh did an excellent job portraying the emotional journey of Dani. The other members of the cast was fantastic.There are so many good things to say about this film. I did not see the trailer nor read anything about it. Wanted to see it with an open mind. I am glad I did that. I found this film way better than Hereditary which is an excellent film as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

He's in it for a combined 10 seconds. The plot. WHAT PLOT, nothing makes sense. Everything is just thrown together. In 2.5 hours, it could genuinely be condensed into around 3 minutes. You are waiting, for what feels like days, for some climatic event to happen which ties everything together. But no, nothing of the sort happens and you're sat there at the end wondering what's actually happened and what's the point of this awful, awful film. Oh yeah, film doesn't explain a single damn thing all film, just guesswork.If you are watching because it's labelled a horror film. Also do not watch. It's not a horror film in the absolute slightest. I don't want some poor innocent soul to click on this expecting some jump scare horror film.I have a film degree and I've seen my fair share of horrendous films, but my word this is seriously up there. There is so much wrong with this. I could genuinely write a 2000 word essay as to why this is such a pointlessly bad film. ""But the metaphors about grief are so good"" YEAH, because I watch a film for hidden meanings about dealing with grief. Bore off with your pretentious reviews.

A whole lot of potential that slowly fizzles out,"My rating of 7 is mostly for the visuals, which are in fact stunning. The horror aspects are intertwined with the beautiful in a unique and thoroughly unsettling way. However, the movie's length undercuts the tension at every turn. Sequences that need about 30 seconds get 10 minutes. The drug sequences are especially tedious. Every time a character takes a drink, prepare yourself for 15 minutes of weird daze-cam. Most disappointingly, the relationships crafted masterfully at the beginning never reach a convincing catharsis point.That said, Aster delivers visually in a way few horror films manage, and the theme of self-serving ""educational vacations"" is quite well played out. For instance, an especially disquieting scene involves a character reacting to an extremely disturbing cultural practice with excitement for being able to use it for his research.Visuals: 9/10.

A psychedelic trip to a Swedish wicker man.,"Midsommar is beautiful.It is a gruesome, gritty, visceral tale of a ill-fated Swedish getaway and delivers gore aplenty but unfortunately it doesn't quite deliver fear.I felt uneasy at times, and I felt tense at times, but at no time during the 150 min run time did I feel afraid. The scenes of horror are disgusting rather than fear-inducing which is by no means a bad thing, but the moments that are supposed to be scary with no gore seem to miss their mark.
I enjoyed the uneasy feel that grows at the start but it seems to falter towards the middle, and while the end tried to deliver the explosive finale like that in 'Hereditary' or 'The Wicker Man', there are sequences in the middle that really need you to stick with it and risk losing a lot of people due to the pacing.Ari Aster tells a chilling tale of dealing with loss, breakup and realising the damage of a toxic relationship. The themes of release and letting go that Dani is forced to accept are brutal and it drugs the audience into a psychedelic trance alongside the cast.All that said, what it does, it does beautifully, with some astounding performances and some truly disgusting moments that make even the most hard stomached cinema-goer experience a slight twinge. I enjoyed watching Midsommar, and even with the feeling that it left the possibility of an even scarier movie out in the field, you're not in any way dissatisfied with the end product.Midsommar needs to be experienced.Enjoy the festivities.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I liked this.....it is so mindnumbingly FUBAR. You will hate flowers after watching.,"Well.....this was fun/repulsive/trippy. An attempt to reproduce the effects of the 1973 Wicker Man on the public. This movie's purpose is to shock and repulse the audience while you watch the reactions. Just a bit long, though.
I never thought that one can abuse the use of flowers in a movie, but I was wrong. The horny viewers are in for some abuse when they are expecting a nude ritualistic scene coming up. No quarter is given. You will be flacid. The fictional mythology comes off as....fictional, unfortunately. Wish more research was done. The cultists crying and screaming together empathically was so annoying. Just remember one thing about the cult.......never drink their kool-aid.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Disturbing, bizarre, and excellent.","When you finally get to the end of Midsommar and realize what actually happened and why, it truly is quite the shocker it was meant to be. Throughout the film, the creepiness of the setting in which it takes place continues to be intriguing, made only weirder by the rituals that are seemingly normal and ""fun"" to the outsider. But from the moment when the cult women bizarrely mimic the sounds/cries/emotions of certain characters to the jaw-dropping climax, the viewer slowly realizes the horror that has taken place all along. The leading actress (Florence Pugh) plays a convincingly grief-stricken young woman in a relationship that is essentially falling off a cliff. As she realizes just how far they've fallen during the 'cultural outing' they embark upon in Sweden together, the sinister reason for each of their presence becomes more evident. The excellent part about the film is that none of this is fully recognized by the viewer until the very last frame. Great film for horror buffs with a taste for the bizarre and shocking.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

9.5/10âð¤â°ð
.
. ""Ari Aster has a beautiful mind, and proves it to us once again in this terrifying sophomore entry that literally leaves you at a loss for words.""
.
.Hereditary was a hands down ultimate horror hit, however upon seeing Midsommar, I feel that Hereditary has some competition. A lot have speculated that this may be a rehash of The Wicker Man, but that's where I draw the line. Midsommar is a huge slow burning nightmare that slowly evolves into a very real and genuinely terrifying experience that will only freeze you and force your eyes to stay still, pondering at the screen. Albeit, this movie was a bit more straightforward than Hereditary was, but don't let it distract you from the important Easter eggs and sneaky foreshadowing that Aster is known for. The simplest things such as the cinematography is a huge plus for those that may find this movie ""boring"" or ""slow"", I mean there's literally a shot of a rock that is just beautiful to look at. Another thing to love is the detail put into everything, ranging from the scenery, the clothing to the reactions and the, yes you read correctly, the gore! Also, Will Poulter is such a sweetheart of comic relief in the most unnerving of situations. .
.
.Verdict: It's really difficult to compare Midsommar to Hereditary, being they are two completely different movies, however what comes as an easy choice is saying that Midsommar definitely knocks it out of the park at being one of the greats in horror cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Loved Hereditary but...,"This is an overly long and tonally botched black comedy. Many viewers seem to dispute that (instead finding it to be an elegant commentary on grief, relationships and depression). However, the director Ari Aster has confirmed in interviews that it is indeed meant to be blackly comic. It isn't that funny, though. In the grand scheme of things, it isn't even all that odd. Parts of it look okay.It's a strange dichotomy. I found it way too long, tedious and very sporadically funny. Some seem to be moved to tears by the film. In truth, whether you appreciate it may depend on your gender/politics. It does treat the female lead's arc very earnestly. You might relate to her anguish. Florence Pugh gives it her all. However, the film treats the male characters as numskulls and slapstick fodder. This comic treatment includes a very casual depiction of sexual assault that borders on... torture porn for slighted women. It's slapstick rape, basically. The film seems to panders to college age non-ninary hipsters who false remember the heyday of horror as having consisted solely of promiscuous girls being butchered. None of the characters (male or female) are likeable, either wat.The setting isn't plausible. The setting is quite xenophobic. Whereas a film like The Wickerman didn't really need to play on Scottish stereotypes in order to create a plausible and disturbing environment, Midsommer offers a veritable smorgasbord (that's right) of Nordic tropes.This is the sort of trashy film people will hypocritically laud while claiming Lars Von Trier is some PT Barnum character.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Shocking and Disturbing Masterpiece,"When I first saw the promotional material for the film, I thought it was going to be heavily inspired by ""The Wicker Man"" (1973).

The film is an experience, unlike your standard horror film. It's is worth watching for its beautiful cinematography alone. My only negative, is the film is rather slow in areas with sub plots that are often blown away in the drug fueled wind.However I encourage anyone to watch it, purely due to the experience you'll receive.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unintended irony in that it looks like socialist ""paradises"" of the 1950s","People writing that this is a ""masterpiece"" need to get out more often, or at least read a few great novels. This is a fairly entertaining well semi-horror/dark humor film with a mountain of mostly tolerable plot holes and a jumbled ending and message.There is an element of social commentary. But there is an unintended irony as well. That the writer/director probably doesn't realize that anyone coming from a left wing statist culture will see all the evils of that type of society as much reflected as the right wing statist culture that the author has said he is warning about.Anyone who has gown up in an authoritarian ""socialist paradise"" will recognize a dozen major elements. The emphasis on rural tradition, complete with autonomy de-emphasizing group dances, costume, the casting out of the elderly, the sacrifice of the individual for the greater good, the reliance on meaningless texts , etc are all central to socialist societies. I watched it with my dad, who came from Soviet satellite socialist Latvia and he said its core elments look like the were taken right our of the nightmare socialist paradise he grew up inTeh senicide tha tis siupposed to to be shocking is in in fact common in prehistoric societies and many less developed societies. teh Enuio practiced it. so did nany polynisian groups.",,Anonymous,Horror
It was alright.,"Midsommar's strengths are all of its technical aspects. The directing, cinematography, editing and music are all outstanding. The biggest strength of this film is Ari Aster's voice as a director and you can really feel his touch on the movie. He's a very talented director, maybe one of the best working today. This is not his strongest film.The weaknesses of the movie are a) the family death setup that led nowhere. I actually think the best parts of this movie are probably before they even get to Sweden. Whatever it seemed to be setting up, was very interesting to me until they got to the cult plot. b) the plot is predictable. From the moment they get to the village, you know it's gonna be a kind of fish out of water cult horror movie. And it is. c) The characters are generic and disposable. Not even the main character has anything unique or particularly interesting about their personality. We know what ""they're going through"", but that doesn't really tell us anything about who they really are. From little we can gather, most of them seem like very unlikable people. d) The film is too long, maybe due to the opening of the film, which is great but unfortunately shouldn't have been in this movie because it has nothing to do with anything else that happens.There's enough to like in Midsommar to watch it and there are enough excellent shots that will stick in my memory for a while (I think) to praise it for being what Jay Bauman called ""A slightly elevated Eli Roth movie."" I agree with Jay on this one. I will say I liked the main actress' performance, very good at conveying emotion. Also, possibly the best ""shroom simulator"" I have ever seen.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Satire of Religion Masking as a Horror Film,"Can a movie be creepy, funny, horrifying and enormously entertaining throughout? This is the cornucopia of delights Ari Aster has produced in his second offering. Two ingredients that seem to have fueled his inspiration are, of course, the original British version of The. Wicker Man (quite an achievement itself) and the scores of Friday The 13th slasher movies where groups of youngsters go on a vacation to be killed off one by one. His movie rises to the level of the first and transcends the level of the second formula. One of the most remarkable things here is the first 20 minutes or so which create a traumatic situation that causes the young couple to appear annoying and psychologically questionable - so that as the story progresses we do not have the compassion for them that would otherwise make their ordeal unbearable to watch.
Important to note is that there is not one scare or ""jump moment"" in the entire movie. This is not a complaint, merely a warning to viewers who might see this as a failure, which, of course, it is not. The horror here, as it turns out, is all-pervasive and throughout all the bright sunny faces and clear landscape of the Swedish countryside. It is in the cult members' drinks, their food, their soil and their beliefs. The horror is in the way they live.
Hopefully Swedish people with a sense of humor will not be offended by the script's locale. It would be interesting to see how the movie ""plays"" in that country's press. One comes away from it eager to avoid the next chance one gets to attend a prayer service or join a group seeking some kind of so-called enlightenment - regardless of the country.

Gorgeous Slow Burn Horror,"Ari Aster may now be one of my favorite directors. His flavor of horror is deeply personal, and therefore absolutely gut wrenching. First in Hereditary, and now in Midsommar, he shows mastery in the mix of both human tragedy and grotesque horror to impart such stomach churning dread in every scene of his film. While some horror movies may be content to show us the demons in underground catacombs or the ghosts in big old mansions, Ari Aster's monsters have a through line directly to the characters' psyche. These characters demand the viewer to step into their mind. Empathy is the key to both these films.Midsommar is an exploration of that human empathy. How much are people willing to tolerate in order to have that sense of belonging? To be understood by anyone, even if by monsters? Midsommar is a slow film, but it doesn't mean that it isn't fascinating. It gives the film space to explore the layers of manipulation and psychological evolution that our protagonist Dani goes through. It does of course end with a traditional horror-infused bang, but the set pieces weren't my focus by the end. They even felt a bit superfluous. I mostly wanted to know more about this cult and how Dani was dealing with it. I felt like I was one of those anthropologists, conveniently watching and analyzing on the safe side of the screen.The cinematography and art direction were also just gorgeous. Who thinks to make a horror movie where everything takes place in broad daylight in the idyllic pastures of Sweden? Yet it worked. They nailed all the creepy, ominous moods and tensions. The sound design and editing carried many of these scenes and they were excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An insane, horrific and hilarious fairytale.","I didn't expect it to be this insane and especially not this goddamn hilarious. I haven't laughed like that in a while. Midsommar looks extremely beautiful, yet explores something pitch black and unsettling. It's dark but also wacky. The editing is very strong and there's many great dissolves in here. The direction is impressive and the visuals are genius at times. Sure, it's not wholly my thing in terms of writing but I went with it because I loved the sheer amount of craft involved in every image. There's so many long takes and the acting from everyone, especially Florence Pugh, is terrific. In my opinion the film doesn't even really drag. I was always invested in the story because it just gets stranger and stranger by the minute and because it knows exactly what it's going for. I'm happy that I bought the Blu-ray that includes both cuts of the movie and will happily watch the director's cut in a few months after I've calmed down on this experience. Ari Aster has yet to make his masterpiece in my opinion, but Midsommar is damn near there.

Midsommar follows the increasingly sinister traditions of a cult and the outcomes of these. I think the best thing this film achieves is bringing that uneasy feeling to the pit of the viewer's stomach for its entirety which should be the aim of horror to make someone feel scared or uncomfortable. I feel it does lose a couple of points due to the wacky nature of the film meaning the suspense of disbelief is shattered at some points of the film.

"As the director says, it's a Horror film, but it's a Fairy Tale.","Midsommar, more than the horror of the movie, is about the beauty of Tripping, death, blood sacrifice and reproductive sex.
Someone called it ""The sun-bleached paradise that's soaked in blood,"" which is a good way to describe it. It's a thriller, but it's definitely not a horror movie for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weirdness not justified by overall quality,"Midsommar is visually striking and thematically unsettling, but it sacrifices depth for style. While its eerie folk horror premise is intriguing, the film drags, stretching thin ideas over an excessive runtime. The sun's position betrays its supposed Nordic setting. The ""midnight sun"", as everybody who has been in Scandinavia at the summer solstice, is very low over the horizon. In the film the shadows are very short, as corresponds to the sun being high-just one of many ""f... physics"" moments. Gore feels gratuitous rather than meaningful, and the characters' arcs lack real emotional weight. Ultimately, it's an ambitious but bloated film that prioritizes aesthetic over substance.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A nice summer vacation!,"Dani has just lost her sister and parents, struggling to cope up with the loss. Her boyfriend Christian is being distant with her and wants to breakup but in the current situation is unable to do so, as Dani is frequently having panic attacks. Months later their Swedish friend Pelle invites the couple along with their two friends to their village for a summer festival. The little community of HÃ¥rga awaits their visit and the group is fascinated by their traditions initially. But the practices soon become too much for them to bear while the group gets divided in deciding whether to stay or leave. To those who stay, what impact their ancient practices have on them, forms rest of the story.I watched the Director's Cut and not once felt the runtime to be lengthy at 2hrs 50mins. Ari Aster has proved himself each time and I took too much time to watch his 2nd directorial. The concept hit me hard and the staging of several scenes. It is the psychological aspect than the gore or Shock value that leaves a lasting impact in Ari Aster films, be it Hereditary or this or Beau is Afraid. The setting of the story as well as characters in the first hour is so effective, it builds up perfectly to what's on the store an hour into the film.Once the shocker scene is over, it's back to psychological drama, focusing on Dani and Christian, with him constantly gaslighting her and Christian doing the same with his friend Josh. It is here we get a proper character arc for Dani and Christian, exploring their personalities, even establishing how their stay in the commune has impacted on who they are. From nowhere to belong to finding themselves in that particular moment among the commune. The way the group responds to Dani's outburst stayed with me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sweden's Green Inferno,"A group of PhD students are invited to a commune in Sweden by their friend (who's from there). It turns out to be more of an experience than they'd bargained for.The movie is very well made and Ari Aster is clearly a man with a plan but whilst it has vibes of The Shining and The Wicker Man, it's lacking the good stuff we saw in both.Disturbing visuals and imagery are constantly diluted by overly drawn out scenes and, in some cases, stuff which is frankly hard not to just laugh at.But the main drawback, I found, is how it relies too much on the PhD kids being about as naive as people can possibly be. This made for a tedious second half of ""don't go in the basement"" style goofs.I loved Hereditary, which scared the pants off me, but Midsommar is more akin to Hereditary's ending than its remainder.But it's worth watching and will provoke plenty of discussion and it is more refreshing than many horrors around at the moment, if a bit annoying.

"Not quite slow burn, psychological horror.","I would call this less horror and more horrifying. I definitely went in expecting some low level of torture porn, but hereditary was so gripping that I eventually caved and watched it. Very surprising. It reminded me, at least in tone, of the more morbid horror films in which at a certain point things start becoming so bleak that you're less expecting surprise and more preparing for an emotional drain. Its a bit like Bone tomahawk, cell block 99, The void or The Descent. You realize bad things are going to happen and the likelyhood of our protagonists coming out ok is looking grim. Its also at this point in the film that perception starts warping in a way that will make some people sick to their stomach. There's drugs involved, lots of drugs. The movie is in no way gory, but it is disturbing and difficult to watch. Its good, if you're looking for a serious drama, run away if you wanted popcorn flinging torture porn.I give it an 8. I could totally understand some people giving it a 7 or a 9 or 10. Theres a point in the film where literally nothing is technically happening, but I could not seem to pull myself away for a coke or a break. I was stuck to my seat. I think that deserves an 8. To me, while the protagonist Florence Pugh hit it out of the park and was mesmerizing to the point of a Bjork music video level, The other characters youre watching go through this arent given enough to do.

Garbage with some beautiful frames,"I apologize to the fans of Ari Aster, but I didn't like this movie. There are two things that I appreciated: (1) the shooting technique of the car ride scene, which I was already familiar with thanks to Hereditary, the first of movie of Ari Aster, and (2) the beautiful landscape of Sweden!The movie has been categorized as horror/thriller, but I disagree. There are at most 3 disturbing scenes, but that's unfortunately not enough to thrill you. On top, Ari Aster inflated the script with cliches that we have seen many times in other horror movies, and consequently, anybody who has spent a bit of time with movies can easily guess what will happen in the next scene.As I said, the only thing I like about this movie is the cinematograpy, which is not really the success of this movie, it's rather the beautiful nature in Sweden. This usually occurs to me when I watch Woody Allen movies; every frame is like a painting that you might consider hang on your wall, but the rest is garbage.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Almost Perfection,"Detailed review here :
By : Ananda Rakha
Origin : IndonesiaFirstly, can we talk about the poster? Yeah the poster is well designed, that i dont know any idea to make a better poster. I wont changed the theme. The titled name ""Midsommar"" displaying a cheerful season. Yeah thats good. Maybe we can change the expression of the character. To make it more horrific and unpredictable, we can make from sad expression to smiley expression. Okay thats all for the poster.The plot was perfect. Not too slow and not too fast. Its very well prepared from Ari Aster too make such a good plot and put hidden meaning behind them. The acting was brilliant! Manipulative cult, toxic relation, bad jerk, all well defined. The cinematography.... i can think you all are agreed that, this is a masterpiece. Its like the Aster's movie before ""Hereditary"".I can even described all of it because yeah. Its almost perfection. The only flaw of this movie is the plot are easy to read. And for some people yeah... bad ending.But still great movie to watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Feeling like someone tryed too hard to make you feel uncomfortable. The characters acted so well but lacked credable continuity.

You got to watch human faces get squashed in close angle, yeah that's some art for y'all you'll never forget. But don't worry, it keeps going for too long and turns into a parody of itself.",,Anonymous,Horror
Another great work from Ari Aster,"I very much enjoyed the horrifying experience of Hereditary, and so I was quite excited to see this movie. Midsommar manages to feel like an entirely new story, although both concepts turn out to be similar (creepy cult-looking stuff). Going into the movie theater, I was expecting to get ""kickked up"" like Hereditary had previously done, but I was very pleasantly surprised. This movie had excellent character development, and the emphasis was really on the relationship between the two main characters, Christian and Dani. Even though I didn't walk out of the movie theater shaken and with a new point of view, it was really fun to watch and also had its fair share of creepy and unsettling moments. Once again, Ari Aster hides so many details throughout the movie and the foreshadowing is crazy, which makes it a really fun experience to try to notice all the ""secrets"". This movie was much more casual for me, and a good entertaining psychological horror. I would recommend, but beware, this movie is also quite long, and slow-paced, which might not please everyone. I personally really liked it, it was a much lighter storyline and the cinematography was brilliant in my opinion, conveys emotion really well.Another favourite from Ari! A deeper look into unhealthy and dying relationship dynamics. If you think you're about to see a ""Blumhouse"" type of movie, this is not it, this is more of a drama. Nonetheless, still amazing to me.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Beautiful cinematography,"The usage of flowers and the sunshine which are stereotypically associated with happy and uplifting landscapes is a perfect contrast to this dark plot.The filming is spot on and the acting is brilliant.The story could have opened up to us a little more subtly. However, I think throwing us in the deep end with the notorious 'cliff scene' was an insightful means to speed up a slow moving beginning that doesn't include enough information on character backstory for a stand alone film.Out of all the newer horror films which seemingly copycat other styles from pre-200s midsommar adds its own new style which I believe is inspiring to new movie creators and smaller directors.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
What even is this movie?,"Good horror movies are either fun and crazy, or intelligent and interesting. This movie was neither. This movie tries way too hard to be shocking. It's like the director was trying to say ""Look how artistic I am! Look at all these disturbing images! Aren't I genius?""

Outstanding,"2 hours and 28 minutes seems too much for a film? Not for this one. You'll forget you're watching a film. Midsommar feels like you're dreaming. There are small visual effects throughout the film, such as living flowers and trees. This is caused by hallucinogenic substances that the protagonists, a group of young American students on vacation consume during their stay in a strange pagan cult community far out in the woods behind the hills in Sweden. A historic festival is about to take place. A festival called Midsommar, which only takes place once every 90 years. (!)What's the best way to describe Midsommar? My attempt would be that it feels like a bad nightmare that doesn't look like a nightmare at first. But it turns out that everything bad that could happen - and that you as a viewer do NOT want to happen - actually does happen. All the time. And it feels more and more panicky. What scared me about the movie was that it was believable. There are no ghosts or paranormal activity.Brainwashed humans are the monsters here. I know, this has been done many times before in other films about cults, but not with this perfection and that atmosphere as in Midsommar.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is at times shocking and horrific but it is also unintentionally comical. I wouldn't be surprised if some people who have seen it walked out on it. I can't exactly recommend it but I will say if you want to see something that is really bizzare and odd, then go see it. I did like it but I wouldn't see it again. One and done.

An unnecessary long and boring remake of The Wicker Man and The Wicker Tree,"The original Wicker Man (1973, with Christopher Lee) was not a terrifying movie until the very end but the suspense kept everybody guessing. The movie become a cult sensation (at least some of the final cuts of the film) not as an horror movie but as a metaphoric view of religion and society; there was some legends that the movie was based on real facts about Pagan cults, north of UK. The Wicker Tree has the same original director and a very similar story but instead of a Christian Police we have an Evangelical couple on a difficult relationship.
Midsommar takes basically the couple in crisis and a couple other characters, moves them to Sweden instead of UK.After a family tragedy; a girl joins her former boyfriend and some other friends, a group of grad students working on a thesis, on a visit to a Sweden community to appreciate the summer solstice celebration.They meet there white dressed community; quite inclined to drugs and rituals (and strange music).Ari Asher already showed he prefer style over substance (and story) on Hereditary (a movie that copy a lot from Rosemary baby's and other horror classics) but at least that movie was shorter.It seems he loves to film but hates editing; basically in love with his own scenes. Here, the continuous display of white dressed people dancing, playing instrumental music and doing strange rituals (in eternal daylight) becomes tediously repetitive without adding anything to the promised intrigue. Characters reactions became so absurd that even the movie laughs about some events. Clocking over 140 minutes the movie will be too slow even cutting an hour off. It is incredible that with such unnecessary length the resolution is rushed and confusing.There are couple of violent deaths shown, and a few others not. Everything quite predictable and not very engaging; because the director keeps distance with the main characters avoiding any empathy. In fact it is never clear if anyone is worth saving; specially Puig characters who is borderline obsessive and perhaps psychotic.In brief; there is no horror, the movie is tedious and far from entertaining. Critics praised it because its pictoric values, but people run out of the cinema after a while or start snoring.

Strange Self Indulgent Film,"Midsommar brought to us by horror prodigy Ari Aster could have been so much more. Most people are familiar with Ari for his breakthrough film Hereditary. A good percentage of people (myself included) found that to be one of the best horror movies of the decade and were clamoring for Ari's next work. In comes Midsommar a sunny acid trip to Sweden. Right off the bat, the audience is treated to a sorrowful pitch black opening, that while serving its purpose left more to be desired.If you're reading this you know what Midsommar is about. We get a good hour of buildup before anything out of ordinary happens. Once that shockingly gruesome moment happens it's as if we've reached a crossroads. The director had a few different paths to take from there, and he took a more self-indulgent strange one.
Unsettling music, obtuse camera work, trippy visuals, long drawn out scenes, head-scratching moments, a disfigured child, comical quips (both intentional and unintentional) Midsommar is a messy mixed bag.This film could have been more than another beautiful to look at, but hollow art piece. Ultimately it's hard to call it anything more than that. We are left without explanations for some big things, some elements feel like they were thrown in for no real reason outside of being visually jarring, and a lot of this movie feels overlong and dragging. Often times taking itself way too seriously and feeling like it was trying too hard to be something it isn't. Characters felt empty, even given the long run time to aide in giving them more depth.Just as these types of movies usually do we have some allegories here. We don't, however, have much horror at all. The viewer gets occasional feelings of dread and despair, but this is more of a drama than anything else which I'm not faulting it for, the marketing would just have you think otherwise.I can see the appeal, and it wasn't horrible but Midsommar drops into some pitfalls that I can't forgive it for. I left the theater just wanting more ultimately unsatisfied with what I was given.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Contrived and not clever enough,"Let's start by saying, Ari Aster makes good creepy films. I thought 'Hereditary' was fantastic until the ending unravelled everything he created. And likewise, 'Midsommar' has lots of good creepy moments. However, there are far too many holes and not enough heart.It's impossible to talk about 'Midsommar' without talking about 'The Wicker Man'-meaning the original Robyn Hardy version, of course-from which it borrows heavily. Beyond the obvious plot parallels, what separates the two is simple plausibility. As strange as the community in 'The Wicker Man' is, I believe this place could exist; there are such groups who believe such things. Moreover, I believe the motivation for the policeman to go there and to stay-to investigate a disappearance. By the end, the logic of it all becomes clear.In 'Midsommar'-without giving anything away-the motivations of the main characters are weak. Normal young kids don't impulsively jet halfway around the world on a whim with people they barely know for what is billed as a sort of community festival. If it had been set in Upstate New York, it'd have made much more sense. And the twist, which is less of a reveal than a dreadfully slow burn, is even more far-fetched. Regardless, you don't care at all for any of the characters, so what happens to them is of no matter anyway.Frankly, I wish Ari would get himself a writer to add some character development, reign in his more ludicrous ideas and fill in the plot holes. Perhaps then, the creepy atmosphere and unexpected shocks would add up to something great.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An artful piece of cinema thats both beautiful and unsettling.,"I love reading peoples' reviews where they complain about how their time has been wasted on a movie.. so they warn others not to waste their own. Oh no, not your precious time! You mean you threw away two and a half hours of your extremely important and busy life on a movie you didn't end up enjoying? How awful. It's ok to not care for a movie, folks. Art is subjective.My take? Midsommar offers a refreshing mix of raw performances and gorgeous cinematography, steadily building with an uneasiness that is almost sickening at times.. and in a good way. The lead lady, Florence Pugh, is genuine and endearing. The direction is confident and the writing seems untouched by any studio execs looking to squeeze in cute one-liners etc.. no nonsense here.

Midsummer Madness: 'Midsommar' Captures the Eerie Beauty of Communal Extremes,"In the verdant embrace of a Swedish summer, Ari Aster's ""Midsommar"" unfolds like a pastoral painting brought to life, a daylight nightmare that both captivates and unnerves. The film, a sophomore effort from Aster, is a tapestry of grief, tradition, and the human condition, woven with a thread that shimmers with an almost perverse beauty.The narrative follows a group of friends who travel to a remote Swedish village to attend a midsummer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly descends into an unsettling and bizarre pagan ritual. Florence Pugh delivers a tour-de-force performance as Dani, a young woman grappling with unspeakable loss. Her journey is the emotional core of the film, and Pugh's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing.Aster's command of atmosphere is undeniable. The sun-drenched fields, the ethereal light of the midnight sun, and the haunting stillness of the Scandinavian landscape are characters in their own right. The director uses these elements to craft a film that is as beautiful as it is horrifying. The cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski is exquisite, capturing the idyllic and the macabre in equal measure.The film's score, composed by The Haxan Cloak, is a subtle yet powerful presence. It underscores the film's sense of dread and disorientation, weaving through the narrative like a chilling breeze. The use of diegetic sound and folk music further roots the film in its setting, creating an immersive experience that is difficult to shake.However, ""Midsommar"" is not without its thorns. The film's pacing is deliberate, which, while effective in building tension, may test the patience of some viewers. The narrative sometimes meanders, losing itself in its own hypnotic dance. Additionally, the film's graphic content, though purposeful, borders on the gratuitous, threatening to overshadow the story's psychological horror with physical shock.The supporting cast, while competent, is overshadowed by Pugh's powerhouse performance. Their characters are less fleshed out, serving more as pawns in Aster's grand design than as fully realized individuals. This is particularly true for the character of Christian, played by Jack Reynor, whose arc feels underdeveloped.""Midsommar"" is a film that lingers long after the screen goes dark, a fever dream that is both a celebration and a critique of communal living. It is a bold statement on the human need for connection and the lengths to which we will go to find it. Aster has crafted a film that is as thought-provoking as it is unsettling, a cinematic ritual that is sure to divide audiences.""Midsommar"" is a film that defies easy categorization. It is a horror film that basks in the light, a fairy tale that reveals the darkness within. It is a film that demands attention, patience, and perhaps a bit of courage. For those willing to embrace its peculiar charms, ""Midsommar"" offers a richly woven narrative that is as beautiful as it is haunting. For others, it may prove an enigmatic puzzle, a piece of cinematic folklore that is admired from a distance but never fully understood.",,Anonymous,Horror

Different,"Occasionally you get a film that is very different to the norm. Does that make it a masterpiece or is there a reason no one makes a film like it? That's up to you to decide. Like most films that slot into this category, you will either be absorbed or pushed away, that's personal choice. All the gory weird stuff was what the vikings used to do, no one can't say it was tough back then! I loved watching the backdrop, you will see why. However, it does leave you with a great question at the end, is this from her perspective or her boyfriends? It's possible to watch it from two totally different points of view.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting if aimless,"I'd like to think Ari Aster was poking fun of the notion that it is wrong to judge other cultures as backward or cruel, and thus he chose the whitest people he could find to avoid accusations of cultural chauvinism, but I might be reading too much into a simple horror film. Also, it's a tad redundant since Wicker Man already did this, and far more subtly.It's a decent exploration of how cults recruit vulnerable, sensitive people with love-bombing, drugs, sex, promises of belonging and purpose. Though the lead actress is saddled with trying to breathe life into one of the most annoying, frumpy buzzkills I've ever seen. Her scenes are more cringeworthy than the gory ones.

Ari Aster just solidified his place as one of the new masters of horror,"Hereditary was no accident. Ari Aster is a visionary filmmaker and he's just proven that and surpassed himself with Midsommar.It is the 4th of July today and this movie was released yesterday - this is not only my favorite film of 2019 thus far, but one of the greatest horror films of this CENTURY, at this point.I grew up on 70's, 80's, and 90's horror. I perceive contemporary horror to be, for the most part, brainless, regurgitated, formulaic garbage. Midsommar is a rare gem for the genre, in this day and age. It journey's far, far out from the played-out possessions in haunted houses that make up 90% of the U.S. genre output. It is a breath of fresh, multi-colored air in a chamber full of suffocating ghosts. Within the first 24 hours of Midsommar's release, I saw a multitude of people post ""I loved it, but...it's not really a horror movie"". After viewing, this made me LOL pretty hard. I can't figure out what people would be perceiving this as if not horror. This is one of the GREATEST horror movies I have ever seen. It is pure and utter horror... it's just...a UNIQUE horror film, something we rarely receive nowadays. This seems like further proof that people have been so conditioned to the brainless formula of contemporary horror that anything that falls outside of it's own cliches is then perceived as ""not belonging in the genre"". That's actually horrific, in itself, if you ask me.With Hereditary as it's predecessor and a very promising trailer as it's backbone, I was chilled to the core of my soul just 5 minutes into the film. I knew I was in for something very special. Florence Pugh puts in a revolutionary performance and goes on to carry this film 10x better than a grip of A-listers ever would stand a chance of doing. Simply put, the movie delivers from all angles... cinematography, acting, writing, atmosphere, environments, set pieces, wardrobe, pacing, casting, sound design, sound editing, concepts, scares, violence, mystery - it ALL hits right on the money, and it's FULL of surprises. There is not a dull moment on this utterly terrifying ride. The film has no weaknesses.Though aesthetically there are only a few films that come off as comparable (like The Wicker Man, for example), I perceive this movie as a beautiful monster completely of it's own. There is only one other movie that I found it's eerie tone reminiscent of for moments at a time, and that's Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT. In fact, Aster's work as a whole, especially after viewing Midsommar, is now reaching a Kubrickian caliber of craft. It's that immaculate of a creation. I was teary eyed during the finale and it wasn't even a plot-based sadness - I was simply tearing up because I'd just witnessed such a visionary masterpiece, and I was in love with it.I don't want to say much more, but I will say that Ari Aster is a new savior to the genre, and thus, to film. I imagine I will be seeing this in the theater more than once. I...have to. I can't believe he pulled this off. It's...just...phenomenal. It's legendary. Thank you Ari Aster, and thank you to everyone involved. You came when we needed you most.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very bad - but still kind of fun to watch,"With 2,5 hours the movie is undoubtedly too long, especially since it is lacking any real plot or conclusion. During the film I was constantly curious what was going to happen next, and when it would start to become clear what this was all about. At the end I realized that it would not become clear: all that I had seen turned out to be just a series of bizarre rituals, without any real conclusion to finish.

Shock and Awe,"Perhaps one of the best films A24 has ever produced and surely one of the best horror-thrillers ever made, Midsommar is a slow-working poison that eventually takes you whole.

The cast is perfect, and Ari Aster is destined to make great films, horror or not.However, this film is not for the impatient or the faint of heart. There is unsettling violence and imagery throughout juxtaposed with stellar beauty. I will be rewatching this as soon as I am able.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I Could Not Stop Watching,"Right from the get-go the viewer of Midsommar knows that he / she is in for a weird ride. There is an air about this production that says 'trouble is right around the corner'. But also we wonder, How can these characters - seemingly bright and working on their university theses - not see, not apprehend, the trouble that awaits them?Three male American students are invited to a commune of sorts in Sweden. The troubled girlfriend of one of the four decides to join them (much to the chagrin of the boys). Upon arrival at the community the four get high on mushrooms, fall asleep on a verdant hillside, and upon waking are escorted to the commune's center. And it is here, and over a surprisingly few days, that the story unravels, with each of the guests being tested by the community's members.As I said, Director Ari Aster quickly lets us know that something's wrong. But what? And, if so, Why were the Americans invited? Is there a purpose? And does each have a purpose of his/her own? The camera work is 'intimate'; we zoom in on characters. At other times we are in a character's tight point of view. Scenes that seem to be still-photos are soon interrupted by characters appearing from out of the scenes' edges. Those questions and the cinematic execution; all very well done. And keeps the viewer - me - engaged.Florence Pugh is the troubled girlfriend. Jack Reynor her boyfriend. They're both fine in their roles. In fact they seem at first like typical American young adults whom we would meet at a party and take a liking to. That they're going to change during their stay is never in doubt.The film, like many others, is too long. Perhaps by as much as 30-45 minutes. Certainly the set-up in America seems to run-on forever. I wanted to be excited when the four arrive in Sweden, instead I already was a bit weary of them.But I might be nit-picking here. Because although I could have turned off the film with a click of my remote, I didn't. I could have fast-forwarded, but again, no.Instead I sat and I watched. And when the final scene faded to the film's credits, I was glad that I did.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Refreshing!,"The story is relatively simple and it's all stuff we've seen before (to an extent, especially if you're a horror fan), but it's very well crafted and executed, it doesn't really matter that the film wears its inspirations on its sleeve because its done with a respect that you can simply enjoy the trip you're taken on.It moves at a somewhat slow pace which might be a problem for the goldfish generation, but those who appreciate real suspense and intrigue will no doubt enjoy this captivating approach.The cinematography is flawless and some of the best I have seen in recent years, that alone makes the film worth watching. It is truly a beautiful looking film and the score compliments the visuals almost perfectly.It's by no means a perfect film though, there are some tedious moments and the ending for me was way too predictable, I found myself saying what was about to happen in my head before it happened on screen and I was right until the credits rolled. It isn't a particularly bad thing, I was left satisfied but it would have been nice to have been surprised. Others may feel different but that's just my take on it.Highly recommended for cinema viewing!

"An excellently shot, flawlessly directed, disturbing mess","This was one of my most highly anticipated films of the year for several reasons. I loved Hereditary, Ari Aster's debut horror film, which came out last year, and when the trailer for Midsommar dropped I was eager to go see his follow-up masterpiece. Turns out it was a masterpiece, but also one of the most sickening, demented and sadisticly bothersome films I have seen to date.At the end when the credits rolled, I sat in my seat, unable to think or speak, not wanting to stand up or do...anything, really. Midsommar is one that will leave a permanent mark on your soul. It's not happy. It's not moral and it's certainly not one to share with friends, unless you're ready to watch them grow sicker and sicker as the movie progresses.In the end I gave this 8 stars because I am a huge fan of Ari Aster's directing, and Midsommar was an excellently shot film. The acting was superb. It's just the movie itself that will disturb you to your core.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing Garbage,"This was a beautifully filmed and incredibly directed terrible movie. Everything was absolutely amazing, except for the actual movie. I love movies that are weird, creepy, strange, and abstract, but I get the feeling that this one didn't have a reason to be those things as much as it was. Yes it was a very interesting movie, but about 3/4 of the way through I just wanted it to be over. My reasoning is that there were just so many scenes that were absolutely revolting (which is good sometimes), but there wasn't a message or statement that gave the disturbing things meaning. It's like how in all of the Marvel movies there's hundreds of people that die in the background and no one cares, but then when one of the main characters turns to dust everyone freaks out because of the emotional attachment you have with what the characters are going through and fighting against. With this movie, the characters weren't very likable to me so I didn't really care about them, but then they would show all these close ups of incredibly violent and disturbing actions. I also think it wasn't warranting of the graphic level of content because couldn't figure out which side the film was trying to take the side of: the kids or the festival people. Exploring the strengths and faults of both sides is good, but when it's about a conflict between them and you kind of dislike everyone and you do all of these shocking acts of violence it takes away the emotion. Your left watching a very tense, randomly repulsive gore fest for absolutely no reason. I give it a 6/10 because of how beautifully it was made. I mean the visuals were just incredible and the camera work was fantastic. Plus the story arc itself was very good. But overall it felt like I was watching a movie where someone just tried to be as creepy as possible, which in terms of quality can only be so good. Also I won't give any spoilers, but there is a place with a whole lot of naked old people moaning and grunting for like 2 full minutes and I will never be able to remove those images from my mind...

Pagan mystery,"Midsommar is one of the best drama/ horror movies I've seen in the past years. It's originality is way beyond the average horror flick. The movie gives a look inside Pre Christian Europe on fertility rituals, combined with lots of reminiscences to the Nazi era, where blonde females were sexually heralded to produce lots of children. Obviously based on Arian views on Women, for these Nordic girls innocence is an absolute requirement. Logically the dark side of the focus on fertility is sacrifice.The acting and art direction is top notch, which is unique for this genre.I'm kind of shocked by the many bad reviews. I think Americans have no clue as to interpret and determine Midsommar. But for me, as a European man who has studied history, this is fantastic mix about the black pages of our history packed in great fiction.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
You either hate or love this,"You either hate this genre of movie, or you think it's great. That's what I can make of it.I saw Hereditary when it came out in cinema. Honestly, I thought it was pretty bad. But now I've seen this movie I start to realise that the style that the maker has chosen is not just a pathetic trial to make an interesting movie full of symbolism, if it makes sense or not.Instead, every part of the story is very thought through and deliberate.I think that you have to grow over the unconventional style of both movies Hereditary and Midsommar, before you are even able to appreciate them.Definitely not an easy watch, but if anything is clear to me, is that the movie goes very deep.Still not sure whether I would rate this high. But it's better than Hereditary. I'm interested what more we can expect from Ari Aster. Because if there's one thing that's clear to me, it's that he has a lot to tell the world through his movies.Curious for his future explorations in this same, somewhat uneasy, yet very unique style.",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Jordan Peele's Us,"People give Jordan Peele's Us far more credit than its due. Viewers mistakenly believe Us has something to say, but ultimately it hides its lack of substance in opaque imagery the meaning of which Peele is as clueless to as the viewer. But both Peele and viewers like to pretend like the movie has a deeper substance -- they just can't point to examples in the movie...Midsommar is the antithesis of Us. The film abounds in scenes with deeper meanings and bathes in intelligent themes (and blood). Its tense, but not scary. It's more thriller than horror.It's not perfect, the characters could be more fleshed out, and some of the decisions they make will leave you wondering if they maybe should have laid off the psychoactive tea. Overall, however, Midsommar is an excellent movie, intelligent, tense, interesting and in a perverse way - a lot of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weird and sometimes scary in the scandinavian midnight sun,"This was a weird, but entertaining horror flick, that popped up on my danish TV app.As a dane, and thus a real life neighbor to the swedish settting in the film, it was quite entertaining to watch this Hollywood take on Midsommar, that pagan leftover in swedish culture, something that we danes no longer celebrate.The film is quite uneven and requires quite a bit of suspension of disbelief. Some scenes and traditions of the HÃ¥gra are too random to not have set off our protagonists in real life.Said protagonists are paper thin in the film, it's all about the HÃ¥gra and the setting.I will say this film is interesting from a scandinavian perspective, because it features a lot of swedish actors and a lot of blonde people. This still being normal here, particularly in places like rural Sweden.However, from an american point of view, that is increasingly diverse, I can see how this ""land of the blondes"" might seem very foreign. I found this reverse exocitism interesting to think about.Overall, I found the movie unnerving in parts, humorous in others. Well worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I feel cheated,"We saw this in theater last night. It is rare for me to give a movie such a low rating, and I'll be clear about why I can't rate this higher than 6 out of 10 stars.Plot. This movie has a gaping hole in the plot about 15 minutes into the story and the writer failed to address it. You can't ask audiences to get over such a chasm of disbelief. My husband is pretty generous as a movie lover and he couldn't get over it. So the rest of the movie you're still asking, ""Why are they still there?"" It's implausible.That said, there is a lot going for the movie... strong performances... cinematography... interesting setting... unusual.Unlike ""Get Out"" which I had to watch twice more in a week because it was so much fun, I will never watch this movie again. But it is worth seeing once, though some scenes are grotesque and cannot be unseen (I blocked my view, knowing what was coming).It's really messed up. It's weird. And it has the weirdest porn scene I've ever seen, and I've seen some weird stuff - but this exceeds all weirdness. And that was a very funny part, the entire audience in the theater was laughing.The protagonist is a very strong character and carries this film - fantastic job by Florence Pugh!I believe all the writer had to do to close that gaping hole in the plot was to make it more of a trap.

Midsommar (Director's Cut) Is Better Than The Theatrical Version,"The following is the review of Midsommar (Director's Cut).After terrifying everyone with his ominous directorial debut, easily amongst the scariest films of the decade, Ari Aster returned with an original & audacious folk horror about grief, trauma, family, toxic relationships & paganism. And although his second film wasn't as nerve-rattling as his first, it was still a very uncomfortable, unsettling & unnerving horror that established him as one of the boldest new filmmakers out there.However, it is only after watching Midsommar restored with all the segments that were edited out to improve the film's commercial value does one realise the real masterpiece that Ari Aster's sophomore feature is. Clocking at 171 minutes, the director's cut doesn't modify the plot structure but instead provides additional richness & cohesiveness to the story that makes the overall experience far more fulfilling & complete.While there are a couple extended scenes here that the film was better without, most of the new sequences add considerable weight & emotional wallop to Dani & Christian's relationship conflict, thus making the finale much more cathartic & satisfying. Add to that, an additional ritual of the HÃ¥rga festival featured in this latest cut also provides a closure to the final fate of a character who mysteriously disappeared.Sewing new threads into an existing fabric in a manner that enriches the texture & quality of the whole tapestry by a considerable extent, Midsommar (Director's Cut) is a definite improvement in every conceivable way, and should be the only version available to viewers. Its almost 3-hour long runtime may seem daunting but the narrative flow & pacing feels much smoother & breezier, and expertly ties up all the loose ends.In short, Midsommar (Director's Cut) is an undeniably better, darker, powerful, haunting & rewarding picture than the theatrical version, and is Ari Aster's folk horror in its true, original & undiluted form. Strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,Horror

Ambitious Nightmare Examining the Male and Female Relationship Power Struggle,"I can't believe all the bad reviews, especially those relating to substance or lack thereof. It seems like many missed the point or didn't know what to expect going into the movie.This is not a horror movie (at least not in the typical sense like Hereditary was, and which I thought was easily the best horror movie of 2018 and is by the same director) although it certainly is horrific. Rather, it is an acid-trip nightmare born from the anxiety arising from the contemplation of a life-long commitment to a mate and starting a family, and familial pressure regarding the same. Much like Rosemary's Baby was a play on female anxiety arising from one's first pregnancy, this is a journey through the cycles of human life with special emphasis on fear of commitment and what it means for one's individual identity.The woman is portrayed as having a lot of family baggage and worried that her chosen partner's friends will not accept her, that he may be cheating on her, that her friends cannot be trusted, and that she will give up all power by continuing the relationship. Consumed with beauty and dreams of idyllic happiness replacing the chaos that is her current life. I should note that these traits are not always exhibited directly through her eyes or mouth but through the lens of her trip.The man is portrayed as doing his best to do the right thing but still wanting the respect of his buddies, tempted by seducers, and surrounded by women that want to lock him down. One friend, a horny but hopeless geek always getting into trouble. The other, a rival.The director doesn't pick a side (i.e., the female perspective v. the male perspective), but rather tries to show both sides fairly (including flaws) at the same time. You will have to watch the movie yourself to see who wins this power struggle for dominance and who is subsumed by the other.Don't go in expecting a simple-minded horror movie, go in expecting to see a brilliant manifestation of the complex emotions many women and men go through when finding a mate and trying to decide whether to commit. This movie will be too raw, graphic, violent and ethereal for many, but if you don't mind that sort of thing, what a truly brilliant piece of art this is.

"Unsettling, thought provoking yet obscure","One thing that is undeniable for Midsommar for me is the fact that this film is going to be relatable for a lot of people in its thought provoking themes. I took my a while to reflect on this!Initially I reviewed this film at a 6/10 after watching it because I felt that the art house direction and general tone/weird ideas portrayed in the film was too much despite the excellent core of the film but I couldn't ignore how long this film stuck with me after watching.For me what really works is the brilliant introduction, the creative cinematography and original score, the acting (particularly from Florence Plugh) and the core focus/themes of the plot. There is depth to the film making to be explored here which is great to talk about.What I feel prevents this film from being ranked higher is the sub-genre of horror this film sits within - the core premise works in a horror but for me personally, the film tips itself far too much in to left field obscurity that it becomes genuinely laughable at times and a bit ridiculous. The horror angle this film took in particular was the less interesting part of the film for me.It's quite similar to Hereditary and I'd argue the tone, drama and characters in Hereditary are more effective than Midsommar but I won't deny that when Midsommar hits hard, it doesn't hold back any punches. Prepare for a slow burn though.Definitely not for everyone, especially casual audiences (ignore the marketing) but a unique film in its own right, even if it does borrow a couple of ideas.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very creepy,"Midsommar is a very slow paced movie which can be boring at times if it weren't for the likeable characters and somewhat frequent humor. Although it is described as a horror movie, this movie is not scary as much as it can be disturbing for many. Without going into spoilers, this movie basically revolves around a small community of people from Sweden that operate as a cult. Although this is a very slow paced movie, it is VERY intense during several moments. This movie is also very mature. Contains a lot of blood and gore, violence, profanity, alcohol and drug use, sexual rituals, and very intense scenes. Not intense in a horror way but intense in a very creepy and disturbing way. My first thoughts after walking out of the theater was ""that was weird..."", and I stated that the movie was weird several times throughout. A lot of things that happen in this movie are very creepy and eerie and weird and disturbing and although it reminds me a lot of Hereditary, this is much more disturbing. But this is a decent movie. Not great and could have been better, but it was too crazy to not be good. A movie is supposed to entertain and this movie does not fail. But be warned, this movie can scar you",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Beautiful, but derivative.","A beautiful, but derivative film. The performances are good, and Ari Aster is brilliant behind the camera, but the lack of any real surprises or new idea left me feeling pretty indifferent toward it. It had some interesting themes revolving around grief and family, but I didn't feel that there was nearly enough emphasis placed on them for them to have any real impact. Also, the characters were just stupid. Just flat out dumb. The film is pretty, and the performances are solid, but it left a lot to be desired, otherwise. Some good idea with less than perfect execution. It's worth watching, but is disappointing following on the heels of Hereditary.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great photography and acting, but lack luster story","The movie is visually impressive, the score is well done, and the acting is very powerful.

This was an inventive start and had quite a bit of potential but I was left with a feeling of ""so what."" The journey that the protagonist goes through is powerful but the larger context to why is left too untouched. There are a few horror tropes in this movie that felt out of place, primarily the character Mark, and lots of could-be interesting facets left untouched.Overall, this was a let down for me and after two movies I felt didn't live up to the hype or potential with storytelling, I doubt I'd see a third Aster movie in theaters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Between the disturbances and the underdeveloped story line, I felt like I forced myself to stay until the end. The first half and the second half of this movie were two totally different experiences.

Few words of advice,"The aim of this short text is to give you some insights before you see the movie so you know to which elements you have to pay special attention.
-----------
It's rather difficult to write something specific and sensible about this movie. We see a group of young people coming to Sweden to witness some local community festivities. After being initially struck by paradise looking nature and hospitality of the locals, they begin to witness some of their weird and scary customs. And then we go...Almost entire movie happens during the day. There are no jump-scares. Nobody is coming after somebody. So I wouldn't describe this movie as a horror but rather as a psychological terror movie. And here's the reason why: Midsommar is successful in creating an atmosphere of distrust between the protagonists which makes us feel like not knowing who's going to do what and how. That's the exact reason why Midsommar makes us feel distressed.On the one side we have a pagan cult with whom we get acquainted as the movie rolls. On the other side we have a group of young people obviously shattered by life tragedies and mutual problems. Former represents a united community, later just a make-believe community. This is important to stress out since the director said in an interview that this is essentially a break-up movie (breaking up with someone is an act of bringing to an end community of two). That means that we shouldn't focus too much on the cult itself but on the protagonist's desires and reasons why. Why did each one in particular decide to go to Sweden? What were they looking for? How did this peculiar Swedish surrounding manage to bring forth their true faces? This movies isn't about providing us with psychological description of cult behavior but psychological description of our behavior, double-standards and hypocrisy.You may feel about the cult one way or the other but its purpose is in essence an instrumental one. And no matter how ugly they become, we can't doubt that they really believe in what they do. So it's important not to become to occupied with their rituals during watching of the movie. I'll conclude with some questions and tips which you can keep on your mind while watching the movie:pay the closest attention to Danikeep in mind her family tragedy and think about how that affects her presence (movie will notice you to keep that in mind with few flashbacks)think about Dani's relationship with Christian; this is very important as you'll clearly see in the final scenesask yourself if this pagan cult is group's enemytry to answer what were their motives for going to Sweden in the first placehow this peculiar setting brought about their conformity and behavior?I hope these question help you during watching of the movie and thinking about it!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Tense, Traumatizing Art","A suspenseful, drawn out trip of terror and trauma. My chest was tense and I had a hard time breathing throughout the majority of the movie. There are some parts that are tough to watch and made me feel very uncomfortable. The acting was also PHENOMENAL. Florence Pugh was INCREDIBLE! *standing ovation*Overall, I left the theater feeling highly disturbed and appreciative of the art and intentionality that went into creating this movie (mostly highly disturbed though). Very well written and directed.Side note: If you leave the theater feeling as perplexed as I did, I'd highly recommend going on YouTube afterward and looking up ""Midsommar Explanations"".

For Better or Worse: It's not Hereditary (Spoiler-Free),"For those of you who HAVE seen Hereditary: (If not, skip to next segment)""Midsommar"" is like another flavor from the same ice cream shop of discomfort, but truthfully... it's a bad acid trip that wears off the moment you leave the theater.A lot of that signature Ari Aster dread can be felt in the film's powerful/memorable First Act.The Second Act brings up a lot of questions and keeps you engaged, but don't expect to be terrified. It gets a little lost in itself and starts feeling a bit vague.So, like Hereditary, you're probably expecting a HORRIFIC Third Act, right? It's only natural considering that Hereditary was a Family Drama that ended on a horrifying note. Well, without spoiling anything, don't hold your breath. The Third Act abruptly throws the film into the Art/Allegory category without providing much in the nature of horror.Midsommar checks all of the boxes. It (kind of) answers all of the questions. But I left the theater, and my mind wandered back to Hereditary. Midsommar isn't really a film that stays with you, while for me (at least) Hereditary still does.Loads of respect to Ari Aster for trying something completely different, but it loses points for simply not being scary or disturbing enough to stick with you.For those of you who HAVEN'T seen Hereditary: (READ THIS if you SKIPPED)On the plus side, Midsommar is unlike any horror film you've seen recently. It deserves to be seen at least once by any horror fan.On the negative side, Midsommar struggles to even BE a horror film. It starts off as a drama and ends as an art show. Don't expect any scares to write home about. (Although to its credit, it does contain a few genuinely disturbing scenes)TL;DR:It's not Hereditary. It's barely a Horror film. But, in many ways, it's probably the most unique film you'll see this year. You'll show up for the ""horror"" but you'll only stay for the visuals.Props to Ari Aster for shooting a Horror film 90% in broad daylight. It's only a pity that all of the memorable ""scares"" still take place during the 10% shot in the dark.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Masterpiece,"This movie is a PERFECT example of how to build tension. It's slow, it's subtle, it worms it's way into your mind and creates a genuine sense of safety and security. For the first hour, you might even forget you're watching a horror movie. But then, oooooooh but then. I don't want to give a single thing away, but once the story takes a turn, there's an exponentially building sense of dread that doesn't ever go away. Again, it starts off gradual, but ramps up exponentially, until dread turns to fear, turns to horror.Alien is an effective horror movie not because Xenomorphs are scary by themselves, but rather because they pose a real, tangible, threat to characters that WE care about. Characters that we have a chance to really understand, and grow familiar with, even fond of. So when horrible things happen to them, we're invested not because of the shock value or the jump scare, but because WE don't want them to get hurt. It seems that most ""horror fans"" have forgotten that.Pacing and writing aside, the film is absolutely gorgeous. Even in the first 10-15 minutes, when scenes take place in normal apartments and bars, there is some really fascinating cinematography at play, and once it gets to Sweden, every shot is breathtaking. The use of symmetry and color is reminiscent of Kubrick, and I mean that as the highest compliment.The score is fairly understated, as it was in Hereditary, and I think it works even better here than it did there. It's only purpose is to build tension, instill dread. You won't even notice it in the background of most scenes, and often there's actually nothing to notice, but regardless of whether it's completely silent or blaring violins, it always feels appropriate.Look, I love big, loud, dumb, gory horror movies as much as anyone. Give me over-the-top violence and a paper thin plot, and as long as things keep moving, I'm along for the ride. But I can also appreciate auteur cinema, where a single artist's vision is realized by thousands of actors, camera workers, set designers, etc. And this is exactly that. Anyone who doesn't like the movie, I won't tell you you're wrong. But I'd ask that you at least try to appreciate the work that went into it, on literally every level.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hereditary's great follow up,"After Ari Asters debut film ""Hereditary"", I had that itching feeling some have when I first saw it. I wondered if, like many other directors, his first film was just going to be a fluke. Yes while the directing was amazing, the acting was phenomenal and some may argue if there's enough talent put out it's unjust to assume the next one won't be amazing. But I had my fair share of meeting flukes too (cough cough Nightcrawler then Roman J. Israel, Esq.) and know that too familiar emotion of disappointment . So I went in with normal-to-high expectations, re-watched Hereditary in preparation and went with my brother... And here I am and Midsommar proves that he's a capable promising director and should be looked out for whenever he makes a new film.Now this movie is obviously similar to hereditary but I wouldn't say it's the same as hereditary. It's almost like a different take on it. Both are about grief and family but both say something different. Hereditary talks about mental illness, family dynamics, and coping. Meanwhile Midsommar talks about toxic relationships, culture, friends and relying on people. Like Hereditary though both have amazing performances. Florence Pugh at least deserves an oscar nomination if not because they didn't give one to Toni Collete last year. She definitely is in her own when it comes to this movie. Not only portraying someone with extreme anxiety very accurately but like Collete shows subtlety where it's needed.
When it comes to the horror aspects that are the tone for both films, they contrast here and there. Hereditary is shot in a dark house to make you feel like someone's watching you in the dark (the parts where you have to almost squint to see what's in the dark not only puts you in the characters shoes but is also unnerving not knowing right away what the danger is). Midsommar has this bright white color palette the whole movie, confusing the watcher of what the time is or how much time has passed (which is brilliant considering the characters in the movie felt the EXACT same way). At points some of the scenes even feel euphoric and striking. Again similar to Hereditary, the way it's shot has a lot of purpose to it.Just like Hereditary it's well thought out and deserves extra watches for things we missed and things that add extra weight to scenes once you know what happens. Now having time to think a lot about this movie, I saw some female empowerment things there but I need to watch a second time to make sure.Now comes to the question on whether it's better than hereditary or not. The people I've seen online review this are mixed. My brother for example liked it even more. But where my gripes come in that keep it from a perfect movie or even being better than hereditary (which I think despite being fantastic, for me hereditary wins there) are that it's too slow at parts. Mind you everything they show is essential but they could have gotten there a lot faster, which by the way I think Hereditary did. It's ending too is something that'll make you finally decide whether the movie is fantastic or not liking it. What I think this film did better was expand on the other characters in the film (Hereditary's dad is someone almost no one goes bananas over performance wise.), the horror in general I thought was more disturbing, and being a more complex film (in a good way). There are a small things I could nitpick but I'm going to keep that to myself.

"Director's Cut To Be 30 Minutes Longer - PLEASE, NO!","One would most certainly enjoy this movie after having sampled the same drugs that the characters in the movie ate and drank - otherwise it was a wasted 2 hrs and 27 minutes.I would never have put this movie in the horror genre - nothing scary or frightening about it - unless the whole experience, as a viewer - was abysmal; which is certainly was - then, yes, it was a horror.Full of nonsensical visuals, dialogue, sets, and no discernible plot; ""B-grade movie"" acting; ""nails on the chalkboard"" soundtrack/singing/musical interludes. Cheaply made sets, costumes, ""special effects,"" and annoying film location(s). Furthermore, I'm guessing - poorly paid cast and crew.

Folk Horror At It's Best,"Midsommar: The Paganism in this film is very much of a Shamanistic type, differing in many aspects from the Celtic varieties. The ingestion of magic mushrooms is central to the rituals portrayed in the film and how the mushroom tea is filtered is made clear in a banner panel. A ""May Queen"" is chosen at the Midsommar, the winner of a dance around a pole, you dance until there is one woman left standing. In the old days The Dark One forced the young to dance till they died, now the young women dance in defiance of Him. These practises are carried out by a Cult in Northern Sweden at Midsommar when the Sun never sets.The contrast between the dark and snow of the U.S, as the film opens and the eternal sunshine of Sweden is vividly conveyed. Another darkness clouds Dani's (Florence Pugh) life as her sister kills their parents and commits suicide. Her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) wants to break up with Dani and is encouraged to do so by his friends Mark (Will Poulter) and Josh (William Harper) but Christian feels a responsibility towards her. When classmate Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites Mark, Christian and Josh to join him at a midsummer celebration that occurs once every ninety years at his family commune, the HÃ¥rga, in HÃ¤lsingland, Christian cannot exclude Dani from the trip. When they arrive, they are all welcomed as if they family themselves. But there are warning signals which should have screamed ""Get Out Of Here"" to them, especially to Christian and Josh who are Anthropology postgrads.The Midsommar Ritual begins placidly enough but soon takes on an aura of strangeness. By the time the first scenes of violence occur they are perhaps not so shocking because of the developing eerie mood but they are quite gory. There are episodes of savagery and sadism throughout the second part of Midsommar but they are all related to The Ritual. Far more import to the the narrative's development is the uncanny feeling which permeates the entire the film. What happens to the characters after they arrive at the commune is perhaps preordained, every action they take is in some way related to The Ritual, In this manner, ritual development, Midsommar resembles Kill List and The Wickerman though the storylines and outcomes differ.Midsommar is not a film you will easily forget, several viewings may be necessary though for you to catch every fine detail. Director and writer Ari Aster has delivered another Folk Horror masterpiece. 9/10.

Scandi Wicker,"Not really a horror film, more a disturbing, psychological insight into grief. Midsommar is the first pagan break-up movie, which has a major nod to The Wicker Man.This film has brutal violence, the deaths are shocking and gruesome. And the orgies are a little awkward. But it isn't a horror film. This is about what happens when you drop a fragile relationship into the most extreme of circumstances.Florence Pugh is fantastic - fact. She is always fantastic - fact. One memorable scene where she collapses on to the floor under the weight of her own anguish, wailing like an animal. But Reynor is also decent, reacting to everything like a deer in headlights. His coping mechanism is to straight out refuse to process anything that's happening to him.The film, which stretches to nearly three hours, is in no rush to reach its horrifying conclusion.

"What Happens In Harga, Stays In Harga","There is a scene near the end of Midsommar, where our lugubrious Queen of the May is plodding across the turf, essentially towing a densely intertwined train of flowers behind her very handsome.. uhn.. gown.., which is roughly the size, weight, mass, and shape of a Volkswagen Beetle.
Upon seeing this, my instantaneous vision was that of the lugubrious horse at the beginning of Melancholia, entangled as it was in a tennis net.. while struggling to gallop away (albeit in super-slow-mo) from impending galactic catastrophe.. and the end of life on Earth as we know it.
This visual similarity led me to wonder if perhaps the same writer-director had written both movies (not the case) -- the more so, as I realized that each possessed and savored the same kind of tension throughout the film.., while the viewer is but a half-dead mouse being toyed with -- Will the worlds collide, or not?! Will some terrible pagan fate befall our hapless American visitors, or not?
In short, Midsommar was/is every bit as nerve wracking as Melancholia, or better yet, say, Wicker Man (Midsommar's inbred cousin).., which I'm guessing has been referenced by every reviewer thus far. So enough said about it.Thus.. so much for plot and all that.., the more so, because lately my ""raison de la review"" has focused on only two things -- the synchronous mirroring of my personal life in any particular film (doubtless of no interest to you whatsoever), and the inevitable Hollywood/NWO indoctrination/propaganda being spewed by it.. (the film, not my life.)
NOTE: Please do not jump to conclusions, merely because I use words like ""indoctrination"" or ""propaganda"". Neither of these activities is necessarily all bad, as we usually assume.., just as franchise Religion or public education cannot be assumed to be ALL bad.I bring this up, because imho.. in our current climate of aggressive social engineering, propaganda plays a big part. And, while once upon a time the Hollywood ""show-bu$iness"" industry was mostly about entertainment (with a little indoctrination thrown in).., we would be idiots not to notice that, in recent years, this relationship has reversed.
Imho, Hollywood is now mostly about propaganda -- some of it.. perhaps well intentioned and long overdue.., some.. simply paid for by ""The Powers That Be"", and aimed at creating a ""global"" future, the details of which virtually no two ""conspiracy theorists"" can agree on.As for synchronicity (briefly).., I had my worries from the start..; BUT, in fact.., it wasn't long before I saw that the unrelenting tension and perpetual sense of danger, the mysterious, arcane pagan rites and mixed messages, semi-hostile glances and grotesque smiles.. was indeed an accurate and lucid portrayal of everyday life in my homeowners association.
It IS, however, a little early to know how that's all going to play out.As for the propaganda (not so briefly).., this was far less surprising.
First, there is the highly predictable, de rigueur injections of male-bashing, reinforced by an inevitable showcasing of dickish behavior -- lying, obfuscation, condescension, anger, mansplaining -- supplmented by emotional weakness or excessiveness, and bouts of raw immaturity or effeminate self expression -- reinforced by a litany of emasculating images, such as our vaguely unattractive and oily protagonist (who bore an unnerving resemblance to Seth Rogan) trotting about the tundra in his birthday suit.., and further reinforced by robes and ""pedal-pushers"" worn by all the heathen gentlemen.
Special (sarcastic) kudos to the curiously agile looking septuagenarian, who apparently lacked the intelligence or courage to swan dive.., then merely broke his leg.. and earned himself The Gong, while the vexed and frustrated crowd booed him off stage. (Empathy.. my ass.)Having hinted just now that both candidates for Ãttestupa (cliff diving) seemed quite fit and healthy, I'm not really sure whether the film was trying to endorse it or condemn it. Such ambivalence is probably my response to the whole bloody movie in general (as a sociological debate)..; but this lack of clarity merely lends credence to the premise that the story and subsequent questions it raises.. are, as I suggested, less important than the film's embedded propaganda.Bear in mind.., Propaganda is often best (most effective).. when administered in small or subtle doses.
(Do recall, if you can, the elder who stated that homeopathy was one of the community's sources of income? -- possibly the same elder who, when asked about his frock, gave it a little swish, and explained that they were worn by the men as a tribute to hermaphroditism (translation: transgendering.., a huge Hollywood/Masonic agenda).And.., with that epiphanous observation, I believe I'm suggesting that the overarching symbol-simile of Midsommar is the Harga community itself, which could easily be seen as a metaphor for Hollywood.
In that sense.. we could easily compare the homeopathic injections of Hollywood indoctrination.. to the doses of narcotizing ""teas"" and/or the occasional follicle in ones chicken pot pie, the wisps of inhalents (aromatherapy) common to their pagan apothecary, and other assorted magical ""natural"" remedies, etc..., collectively (the propaganda now) leading us all toward a sort of chronic, mass anesthesia, attended by slavish obedience to the nearest cell tower.. and an emotionless wife and several ""unclouded"" children to keep us hopping.In short, bit by bit, movie by movie.. we.. the voluntarily indoctrinated people of the United States of America Inc. are being prepared for whatever our paganistic NWO hosts have in mind.., if only to be assembly-line drones.. or soylent-green fertilizer for vegetables which have been engineered to mysteriously thrive in soil contaminated by cloud-laden aluminum, strontium, barium, etc etc., borne of so-said ""clouds"", better known as CHEMTRAILS.And Ah ha!! You now think I've wandered astray. Not so.
Had you paid attention you would have noticed several shots of the sky above Harga, in which definite chemtrails were present -- thereby (as good homeopathic propaganda will do).. merely, if only subliminally.. adding just another drop of lethargy to our midday tea.., until sooner or later what's achieved is a ""new normal"".
Call it the cycle of life.., where the old realities give way to the new (nudged off the precipice).., and chemtrails and human sacrifice are thought as normal as Friday night football.. or Molloch worship at Bohemian Grove.Pity me. At bottom, I'm struggling to see how this movie is worth watching -- especially if one has already seen Wicker Man.., neither of which movies I would particularly recommend for young children btw.., as tempting as that might be for the increasing number of neo-druidic parents.. eager to induct their children into the delights of nature worship, etc.., not to mention geronticide (which was re-popularized during the Obama years).I say this NOT entirely with tongue-in-cheek. That is, I have long considered that tribalism would make a comeback, and become the next step in (America's) evolution -- especially given the financial crisis, housing crisis, employment crisis, marriage crisis, etc. etc.., combined with the enticing lure of the corporate business model --
I.e., what works for Coca Cola should work for the average over-stressed ""family"".., and free daycare!In other words.., I don't care to attack Midsommar as a promotional film for this sort of bipolar, anti-Christian, commune-flavored, garden-centric, predictably-uniformed matriarchy. I'll merely point out that.. if it weren't for the tautly poised protests of Hollywood, and the thin black line of Amish buckwagons standing between paganism and Christianity, we'd probably have seen the word ""cult"" pop up somewhere in this film. (Oh no.., she di'int.)Praise Horga.!! And let the chips fall where they may.PS -- I usually recommend a sort of counterbalance.. after reviewing these propaganda pieces -- say, some small independent gem, as yet unpolluted by corporate money.
In this case.. I thought of a film more-or-less also centered around an obscure community -- namely Granger Washington (not far from here actually.) It's titled Cement Suitcase.

A Psychedelic Trip to Rival Them All!,"Ari Aster nailed it! The emotional journey in this film is everything. Florence Pugh pulled me into the film in ways I doubt any other actor could. Her performance was phenomenal. Last but certainly not least, this is the only film that has nailed the visuals of a true psychedelic trip.

See it in a theater surrounded by an audience riding the wave unique to them. It's sure to add to the experience.Personally, I saw this at an Alamo Drafthouse. I went alone and was surrounded by, much to my surprise, a crowd of couples aged 50 and up. Granted, it is the 4th of July and most everyone is out searching for a firework show. For us lucky bunch, we experienced one of our own. As I sat there near tears, a couple next to me was giggling at the absurdity of the particular scene (I'd bet they'd have a trip or two of their own) and another lone woman was quietly cheering on our lead.

Slow burn masterpiece,I think it will take some time for this film to bed itself in as a cult classic but I would rate this up there with Wicker Man and Rosemary's Baby as a title you think of when talking Horror masterpieces. Ari Aster has created something special here and while his last film was a more straightforward horror this has subtle elements of brilliance throughout. It shocks at the perfect moments while making you laugh at others. The undertones of relationship study is an interesting one and something most can relate to. Go see this movie with an open mind and you won't be dissapointed.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy. Shocking. Freaky,"This movie is creepy and shocking.I consider Ari Aster as a pretty decent film creator. I'm always interested in what he does and looks like he has a vision for what he does. There's really scary and shocking moments in this film that left me astonished such as the death body counts, they were freaky and scary. I do like the movies cinematography, there's some good shots I enjoyed and lots of brightness and darkness. The characters were pretty annoying and was hard to care for them but the performances from the actors were decent. The movie made me sympathize with the cult more.

Very Artistic Movie About Grief,"Midsommar Review:Midsommar is written and directed by Ari Aster, the same guy who wrote and directed Hereditary (one of my favorite films), and follows a struggling couple who travel to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult. This was my third most anticipated movie of the year. Hereditary was my favorite film of last year and I think it's an absolute masterpiece. This is definitely different from what I expected to see. Hereditary is a horror film about dealing with grief, and a bunch of other stuff that happens with supernatural cult stuff. I wouldn't consider Midsommar a horror movie at all. I think it's more of a drama with a little thriller stuff thrown in. It's more about Dani, played by Florence Pugh, and her failing relationship with Christian, played by Jack Reynor, all the while trying to deal with a recent tragedy. I should add that Jack Reynor did a good job as a horrible boyfriend and also a shocked man discovering everything that's happening. I think it shouldn't have been marketed or branded with the horror genre. It's not a huge problem it's just that after Hereditary and all the trailers for this most were probably expecting a horror movie. That being said it's not a bad movie. The plot is intriguing. It's more artistic and not for everyone. I think me and my friend were the only ones who actually enjoyed it out of everyone in the theater. Most people said ""Well that was stupid"" when it finished. I totally understand if anyone doesn't like it. The first hour I was debating if I liked it because nothing really happened. On an artistic level the first hour was good but not much happened. It was mostly the group getting high and sitting around before the festival. I thought everyone did a good job. Will Poulter played the funny one and he had many great one-liners. William Jackson Harper, just like his role in The Good Place, plays a serious guy and I enjoyed his character. He was most interested in the culture of these people. Once the festival begins things start to get more interesting and there's a sense of something being off. We all know everyone there is in a cult but we're confused on what they're going to do. Once the first most remotely ""scary"" part of the movie happens the rest of the ""scares"" are based mostly on shock value. One thing that might make people think this is dumb is the cult has many weird rituals that make us laugh in awkwardness. From what I read and know it was meant to be awkward so it wasn't just poorly done. I thought there were many shocking things that happen. That is all thanks to Florence Pugh. She is really good. They were saying that she was going full on Toni Collette in Hereditary but I don't think those two can be compared with the whole different plots. I thought Pugh portrayed a person dealing with grief perfectly. The opening tragedy scene we just hear her voice over a phone call and I thought it was just heartbreaking. The slow takes throughout, especially during that scene, added effect with some suspense and just making it like the audience is there discovering what is happening. May I add the cinematography was beautiful. It was brightly colored with pastels and there wasn't a shot, no matter how disturbing and shocking it was, that looked bad. Aster wanted pretty, light colors because there aren't many horror movies that have that look. There was always a sense of peacefulness throughout. It was honestly a calming movie that also wasn't at the same time. It's a very weird tone that I liked. The very end was such an interesting sense. Aster also likes a loud, beautiful song while something horrible yet joyous is happening. I really like that. The score by Bobby Krlic is good. Once again very peaceful and really pretty at times. This is a hard movie to write a review about. It's definitely one that needs an analysis and to be honest I haven't read one yet. I might be seeing it again and I might pick up on things I didn't the first time. I know there's lots of foreshadowing with these paintings and pictures in the background and plainly there for the audience to see. I found some that I noticed later and I want to know more. Overall it's a very interesting movie. Ari Aster went through a breakup and this is his way of writing it out on paper as he puts it. I can definitely see how that life event shaped this. That's really the meaning of the movie. Life events shape our lives. If you're not one for slow paced, artistic, strange movies this isn't for you. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. It's more aimed for a specific group. I did enjoy it, not as much as Hereditary though so I guess I was expecting just a little more. Not that it's bad I just had different expectations. If you plan on seeing it just don't expect a single thing. That will help for a better viewing experience.My Grade: B",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Building building building to not much at all,"I am a film buff. I usually watch on average one film per day from all types of genres. This film starts off well but it kind of gets lost in the middle. It's a long film at over 2 hours and after the first 45 minutes it settles into a suspenseful middle section. The way it build reminds me of old horror films like Texas Chainsaw or The Cabin in the Woods where there is something out there just beyond view but as a viewer you aren't exposed to exactly what it is. Unfortunately for this film, it's ultimately not much out there hiding. It's as it seems at the 1 hour mark that the villagers are bonkers and we could have got to that conclusion much quicker than dragging out the suspense for an hour and a half. The film also reminds me of the shining in it's pacing. The supporting male characters don't really develop and kind of goof along stupidly. I was hoping for some decent action at the end but it's fairly tame. The ending just kind of goes up in smoke. The film tries to open up some discussion on mental illness, death, grieving, puritanism and paganism but ultimately fails because although we are shown these things they aren't explored deeply or with any sense of conclusion. It's a very well graded and shot film and the visuals help keep the viewer interested over the long film duration. As a viewer I stayed to the end with this slow story but ultimately I wasn't rewarded as a viewer for my attention and the ending fell short. If the director cut 40 minutes from this film then I think it would have been better. There's a lot of repeated dialog, shots and plot points that could be removed. If you are aiming at a slow burn horror like the Shining then there better be blood streaming down the walls and a psycho with a knife. There's no real action or much excitement except for dancing around the may pole high on hallucinogens.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Brightly lit, underplayed, slow burn horror","This is the first film I watched by this director. Having no expectations, and not having watched his previous debut film Hereditary, I was impressed with the skillful storytelling, the way the shots were staged, and the use of various cutaways and CGI effects to show the characters's states of trauma and drug induced disorientation. The cinematography and use of color is amazing, I believe filmed in Hungary but set in Sweden. The overexposure does lend itself to a feeling of being off kilter, as well as the smiling good humor of the Swedish commune, as they distribute unknown drugs and perform terrible and disturbing rituals. All of this is very numbing and a good kind of commentary to the tolerated unease in the relationship of the principal characters Dani and Christian, who are on the brink of break up.The director has said the film Midsommar was a way of his trying to navigate the feelings of his break up. He has said there is no specific correlation but that he most identifies with Dani and that he has a lingering attachment to ""dead things,"" perhaps meaning to dead relationships. He offers no further specifics, but watching the film you get a sense of how, perhaps, those in our collective ancestral past dealt with cycles of life and death, be it by ritual or sacrifice (extremely literal in this movie), and the kind of depth of emotion that goes with those ceremonies of beginnings and ends.Midsommar is one part neurotic, hyper articulate and hyper aware relationship drama, portrayed very relatably, and then one part drugged out, mythical, pagan sunshine nightmare. It at times feels it's budget with some of its editing choices and choice of cast (familiar faces who don't quit gel together), but at other times it has the look and sound of incredible filmmaking, if very sparse in the absence of more sounds, and the gore it sometimes does show exorbitantly and then other times not at all.Horror isn't my genre, but I admire this film for its originality and the type of catharsis it does begin to induce. I don't think it went quite all the way for me in this department. I was expecting more. This film probably needs a very specific audience. Please do appreciate it for its staging and cinematography in any case.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A divider with great positives but some strong negatives as well,"I am from Sweden so I looked forward at watching this horror. For a Swede this is particular interesting since Midsommar is just such an innocent day of fun and some weird but harmless tradition. To twist that sounds like great fun to me. I mostly liked the movie and the strange part was ok to me and it was visually stunning at times.The positiveThe beginning really established how lonely the lead role character are. And how she is trying to survive after a just terrible trauma that takes everything away from her and I think that just matches the surreal events that will follow in Sweden.The camera work is great and so is special effects like blurry vision and so on.The buildings are not typicall swedish but more so connected to the iron age and viking age. This is combined with art similar to art from HÃ¤lsingland but with extra everything. It is a culture that has a lot from viking age combined with art and tradition from later times. Sometimes it is very foreign for a Swede but I think I understand where the director and the creator want. It is a mixed of ages combined with ideas of their own.It catches a lot of how a cult operates. Not the over the top stuff of course but the other things. Mostly how they recruit new people. How death is seen as a good thing to elevate to someting higher. How they target a person that lost everything to become her new family. And tradition and over the top believings keeps everything together.The negativesWell there is really one that by far excedes everything else and bring down my score with two stars. The nature is completely wrong. It is not Sweden and you see it instantly when they arrive. This is shot somewhere else and it is so off that it takes you out from the experiense for me several times. Everything is wrong, the threes, the flowers, the surrounding nature. This is not the way Sweden look like and as a Swede our nature is very important to get some kind of feel that this is Sweden. I have no problems with tradition buildings and so on was off. This is the way of this cult and this things are cleverly taken from different times in Swedish history and added with new elements that this cult has. That is completely ok for me and even done in intersting and intentional way. But then you just have everything taken place somewhere else probably pretty far from Sweden. Since Midsommar is all about nature and this movie capture this as well it kind of gets absurd when it is so very obvious for every Swede that this is not Swedish nature. It will not bother none swedes though so for them this weird choice will not disturb the experience at all.All in all a beautiful movie that just made one fatal error.-",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I didn't feel it was too slow at all, in fact I had my heart racing (maybe out of sympathetic stress? lol) during a good portion of it. The plot line and progression of events IS very chaotic and loose, I highly recommend going into it to be along for the ride. My favorite underappreciated facet of this movie is the sound editing; little things like ambient sounds being present or not really make you feel isolated.Overall a fantastic movie, especially if you enjoy movies like Hereditary, Mother!, Get Out, or maybe even the original Wicker Man (1973).",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Imperfect, but talented attempt in deconstruction of horror genre","I'd like to start by saying that Ari Aster is great artist, in my opinion. Hereditary for instance was a true revelation for me. A new word in horrors and a proof that they are not necessarily need to be shallow and can be truly scary and artsy (in the very best way possible) at the same time. I'd like to think of his debut as a deconstruction of horror genre (successful, unlike this one), more specifically: movies about demonic possession. Not to get into details: it was atmospheric, scary, clever and even funny towards the end - all the aspects of horror, in other words. Besides it had some great character development, deep psychological take on family drama and many more. Why do I get so much into the first one? Well, let's have a look how Midsommar fails by comparison.
Being, again, in my opinion, an attempt of deconstructing horror genre (here - about cults) it also, like in previous one, has really cool insides and analysis of romantic relationships, dealing with trauma and personal take on the family as a concept. Again, great cinematography, the actors are all top notch, interesting story even, exciting conflicts established etc. BUT! Like his characters-anthropologists Ari Aster here is not able to finish his thesis. Why? Because the movie is getting lost eventually in all the genre features and attributes. It's all in the bad (in my opinion) finale: character development? Forget it, the main character becomes just a simple offended girlfriend and not a complex character worth sympathy as she was introduced at first. Deconstruction of a genre? More like typical example, representative of one if you will. Deep analysis of psychological family drama? Try just a precursor of this banal horror story to reveal itself in the most ordinary fashion.
All the more disappointing it was for me that all of this could have unfolded beautifully since the movie had it all. But for the ending. However I would recommend watching it due to the talents involved and most probably will watch director's cut myself if it ever arrives.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best and unique horror films that i've seen this decade.,"Midsommar was a giant surprise for me this year. I didn't read any reviews about it and didn't saw any trailers, since i like being surprised and watching films without knowing anything is not something new, since i prefer it that way. I loved the film after i saw it for the first time and after seeing it for the second time - i loved it more from the beginning to the end. Ari Aster brought us something that was unexpected and masterfully made film with some problems that i have that did hurt the film and lowers the score down a bit. Aster proves that he is a person that will deliver greatness and i hope in the future he experiments with other genres other than horror.I love Hereditary so much. It was a breath of fresh air, since every year Hollywood continues to be so unoriginal and releases so many films that rely so much on jump scares (and being poorly made) and very rarely do we see masterfully made and original horror films, since those films show the strengths of the genre as a whole. After loving the experience of watching Hereditary, i was excited for the next film by Ari Aster and see in what direction he will take with Midsommar and like Hereditary - Ari Aster didn't disappoint with his new film.The story was great and it keeps you interested all the way through, but it may be very slow for many and unfortunately the pacing is not as smooth as Hereditary, since the difference between them is 20 minutes (or 44 minutes, if you compare it with the Director's Cut), so the film takes it's time and doesn't rush anything, but in some moments it may feel way too long. The film takes elements that were done before and does them in a new way or should i say: it takes them in a new direction. I'm not going to mention anything that can be considered as spoiler, but watching it you can tell what film inspired it and in some occasions - it's very obvious, but for me it wasn't distracting all that much. The strongest aspect of the story is the relationship between the two main characters (Dani and Christian) and the way it was presented felt very real and you witness how their relationship falls apart throughout the film and it's interesting to watch. The only complaint that i have towards the story is that there are scenes that were supposed to be serious, but they came out very comical at times.There is a lot that you can appreciate about it and it also succeeds in many of the aspects, but also a few things that are unsuccessfully executed:The characters are very compelling, but there are some that are not very well developed in the whole film.The acting is very good. Everyone does a great job with the material they are given. Florence Pugh was the one, who stands out the most for me and gives one of the best performances of the year.The cinematography is fantastic and the choices of where they placed the camera is great and there are many shots that are beautiful.The music is great: it's beautiful and in some moments it's haunting and the composer did a great job of building the atmosphere with with it.The dialogue is great. The way it was written is fascinating and the interaction between the two main characters was so interesting and felt so real, but there were times when the dialogue wasn't great. The character Mark (played by Will Poulter) did not have good lines at all.I learned that there are two versions of the film and because of that comes a question - which version should i recommend to everyone: the Theatrical or the Director's Cut? I had the chance of seeing them both and the Director's Cut was supposed to be the original version that Ari Aster wanted to release, but he didn't had the change, since we rarely see a 3 hour film in the cinema and Hollywood doesn't make long film all that much today. I can understand why some of the scenes were cut, but there is a scene which shows a ceremony (or ritual) that is set at night and after that shows more of Dani and Christian's relationship. After watching that scene, i don't know why it didn't make it to the Theatrical Cut. If you were expecting some gore or disturbing moments in the Director's Cut, then you'll probably be disappointed. If you don't have any plans of seeing it or you won't have a chance of watching the The Director's Cut - the Theatrical Cut still feels complete and doesn't feel like something is missing in it, so it's still a better option, but if you enjoyed the experience like me, then it's worth the watch.Midsommar is intriguing, disturbing and frightening and i highly recommend it to everyone who is a fan of the horror genre or even a fan of psychological horror in general. It's a film that after watching it, you will still be thinking about it and for me it's one of the best films of 2019.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
midsommar,"As someone who enjoys disturbing and creepy movies, I loved this film. I found that the metaphors in it were a good touch, but I didn't pick up on most of them until the second or third time I watched it. It was obvious that Ari Aster wrote this film intending it to be a breakup movie, but spiraled into chaotic cult drama. I would recommend this movie to those who have a strong stomach and can take some thrill",,Anonymous,Horror
Crawls under your skin,"Midsommar does what hereditary excelled at, crawling under your skin. Throughout the 2 hours you have with the film, the movie shows more and more disturbing parts which admittedly not scaring you that much, makes you very uneasy. While the plot and characters may be straightforward, the terrific and disturbing music adds a certain kind of ambience to the film that by the end of it, will certainly make you have nightmares. This is a perfect horror movie to watch in the dark but be warned, by the end of it you will want to crawl under the blanket with the lights on.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Masterpiece.,"You have to have an opent mind, to see this movie. If you don't it is your fault, and not the movie. Love to see movies that's not mainstream.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as strong as Hereditary,"I hate to compare such different films but, after Ari Aster's superb Hereditary, I had ridiculously high hopes for this film. While It didn't reach the horrific highs of Aster's debut, this is still an exceptional horror film. The cinematography is breathtaking, the acting is great, and there are some truly disturbing/unsettling moments strewn throughout. However, where Hereditary felt consistently lean and tense, Midsommar feels more loose and unfocused. There are a number of scenes that tend to drag a bit, costing the film a lot of its momentum. On top of that, the main characters feel a little lacking in depth which consequently lessens the stakes of the movie. While I cant call the film a horror ""masterpiece"", I can say, with confidence, that it is still a finely crafted film. Ari Aster has a strong artistic vision that sets his films apart from all of the mass-produced horror garbage that's often pumped into theaters to make a quick buck. While this doesn't have the ""oomph"" factor of his debut, I would still recommend that any true fan of horror cinema give this a watch",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunting and unnerving,"Clearly this film divides audiences. There are no dark rooms and jump out of your seat moments, but if you invest some time in it, you'll be handsomely rewarded. It builds slowly, and the threat grows gradually, but it's all the more satisfying for that. The contrast between the sunshine, the kindness, and what's really going on really builds the tension and the claustrophobia. I absolutely loved it, and I wish there were more horror films like it. If you enjoy films like The Wicker Man (original version) or Rosemary's Baby, you will love this and it'll stay with you for days",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Looking for some bad trip?,Beautifully made film in a gorgeous country. However it makes you wonder...was it worth the trip? A vacation movie added with some herbs and a concoction of psychedelics made this film.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A major let down and not worth the time,"This movies plot caught my attention from when it first released, but it took me awhile to get around to seeing it, and man is it disappointing. It is a very slow movie, boring, and way too long. Honestly one of the few films I regret watching all the way through. I'm just glad I didn't spend money on it. But hey, maybe I'm missing something, so I'm not against watching the movie again and try and prove myself wrong.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of time,"The cinematography is great, but that's where it all ends. The movies starts off good, but then slowly you start to realise that nothing is happening. It is boring and no ending whatsoever",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

A bad version of The Wicker Man,"Albeit the film style and effects are very well done I'll give them that. However like anything in life all style no substance is indicative of someone that is bent on impressing you with the shallow.I have watched thousands of films. I love cinema. I am crazy about it and even watch B movies as some of them are quite good and ""know"" they are B movies. This film is well....pretentious in that it leaves one with nothing really. It becomes tiring and eventually boring.Watch The Wicker Man to get a sense of perspective on this film and then try and watch this one.",,Anonymous,Horror
A pleasant surprise,"I've seen some reviews absolutely slating this film and I totally get the criticisms.
The characters make terrible decisions and stick around when you'd be out of there like a shot.
What I did enjoy was the unrelenting weirdness and cult atmosphere.
Wicker Man did it better but still give this a go.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tense & Unique,not for the faint of heart","Whilst reading a review by ""Hampersnow"" ..600 hour long bore ??
You want a masked killer and an ending that befits your level..? Go watch the ending of I.T Chapter 2 ..all happy now?
Something comes along different,slow burning,and well shot and slays it with that contempt!
Go watch a superhero movie,and buy the matching quilt cover.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could be the best thriller of the summer,"When we watch films 'like' Midsommar I have a feeling I'll go completely south in the third act, like it goes a little too crazy and a bit far.
Yeah it did go like that but it wasn't just all madness and no method which for me made this film better than some films like this one.
Midsommar I totally was all in from the start, for its long running time it didn't feel as long as that, we must credit the film for setting a good pace.
2 scenes in this film had me quite shocked, when you see you'll know exactly what I'm going on about.
Midsommar was a good film, a little madness towards the back end which was slightly too much but a part from that I quite enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
