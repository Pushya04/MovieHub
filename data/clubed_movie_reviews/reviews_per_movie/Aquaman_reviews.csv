Is it just me?,"What's with the 10 out of 10 reviews? really?. Sure it's probably the best (or second best) DC Justice league era, but that's not difficult.
Like all the other offerings, it's overblown, wooden, one dimensional and over reliant on over the top CGI.
As a child I was always a DC fan and I want them more than anything to bring this thing together, but Marvel have certainly laid down a tough marker for how it should be and DC still haven't met that challenge.
The main thing missing from the film is charm and simplicity, sure Momoa just about saves the day and I think he can develop Aquaman into a loved character, and the film is a step in the right direction. But 10 out of 10 it most certainly isn't.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
one of the best popcorn movies of 2018,"There are moments of awkwardness in the movie, but the stroy is engaging and full of intricate details. The visuals are stunning, too. James Wan definitely did an amazing job with the right cast. I can't think of a better actor to take the role of Aquaman than Jason Momoa. I will give it an A-.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A step in the right direction.,"This movie is pretty entertaining. That, however, doesn't mean that it has a great script. The truth is, DC played safe on this one, and it pays off, mostly.I was never bored throughout this movie, but that is not because of the clever dialogue, or the the amazing score. No, it's because everything in it is incredibly over-the-top. No kidding, be it the heroes or the villains, the action scenes or the romantic ones, every single thing in this movie is kind of exaggerated. Sometimes it worked for me, but sometimes it didn't. With that in mind, let's get to my pros and cons.First, what i liked the most: the direction, specially during the action scenes. James Wan managed to differentiate himself from that Snyder style of action pretty well (there's still one or two ""Snyder slowmo"" kind of shots, but that's it). The fight sequences were well choreographed and shot, with wide angles for most of the time. It was very pleasant to see. Now, I usually don't like when movies start looking like videogames, but it didn't really bother me here. During the gigantic CGI battlescenes you've seen in the trailers, the amount of elements on-screen can be overwhelming, but for the most part, they are well enough shot that you can differentiate what's going on, and so they eventually become quite satisfying.
The interaction between the two lead characters is too very entertaining, but then again, because Aquaman is just really extravagant most of the time, so it becomes this quirky, awkward chemestry. But that leads me into the cons.Yeah, remember when i said everything was exaggerated in here? Well, sometimes that leads to some really weird and unfitting, or just unintentionally funny scenes. For example (and I don't wanna spoil here), the movie will have this really awkward romantic song playing throughout this ""lovey dovey"" scene, but that just took me out of the film because it's so over-the-top and doesn't fit at all with the previously established tone of the film. It was weird. Not only that, but this certain character will constantly scream during battle scenes like he's a football commentator announcing a goal, like he's really badass when in reality it just comes off as ""just too much"". I won't lie, I started laughing after a while because he repeats it quite a few times during the movie. Most of these are nitpicks, but because this movie blows everything out of proportion, these small problems end up REALLY standing out.
Some bigger complaints are: characters having really flimsy convictions and changing them in the matter of seconds for weak motivations. The movie is also filled with cliches, but that's mostly because Aquaman follows the standard superhero movie formula. On top of that, i found some inconsistencies regarding character's abilities (like, it is established that inhabitants of Atlantis cannot breath outside of the water, but during certain moments they do it just fine).
The CGI is very inconsistent, from this gorgeous color filled underwater kingdom, to some pretty terrible green screen effects.
The dialogue, is mostly not very well written. Some characters don't suffer from it, including Aquaman, because it ends up fitting their personality, but some characters end up sounding really artificial.
The acting is fine. Willem Dafoe is Willem Dafoe, Jason Momoa is Jason Momoa. Temuera Morrison, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren all did fine with their respective characters. I think the worst ones are the villains, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen and specially Patrick Wilson (who's character is the embodiment of ""over-the-top""). Too bad, I don't consider him a bad actor, but goddamn was he subpar in this one.
I don't have major complaints wit the editing. It's pretty good, except once or twice where there's just too much going on on-screen and I couldn't follow it, but those were rare moments. However, the sound design has some odd choices. There's this scene where a certain character is handling a knife, and every time he gently touched it, the knife went ""KATCHING"" with that standard blade sound , but just extremely loudly and exaggerated. I just thought to myself ""what?"".Despite the fact that i nitpicked a lot, i think this movie works more than it doesn't. Yes, it's as a standard superhero movie as you can get, but it's a good one. Even with all of the odd choices and apparent problems, it's not a bad movie. The direction is quite good, some shots are fantastic and the fight sequences were very satisfying. It's pure, blown out of proportion, massive CGI fest fun, and I think that's enough for me. For an Aquaman movie, it does everything it should.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's flashy! That's about it....,"There's really not much else to say about this movie. It's clear they just wanted to dazzle the audience with as much CGI as they could muster into as little time as possible, meanwhile making NONE of the terrible jokes land.The story is.... well there isn't one really. It is so all over the place and disconnected that it is not easy to follow at all. Both Amber and Mamoa are dull as dishwater, which many knew before this movie and sadly this does nothing to remedy that either.The movie is a mess, the story is a mess - and when you leave a movie thinking that the only enjoyable part was the CGI then there is something wrong.Clearly, this movie was made for the cash grab and WB once more PROVE what we have all known for a long time; They simply cannot create comic book movies.

The movie is better than most of the others DC movies, but still got a lot problems, including story connections, logic and physics. I mean for me ""Man Of Steel"" is still the best one, followed by ""Wonder Woman"". All I can say is predicatble from start to finish pop corn flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The whole movie felt loud and relentless and so long,"There was embarrassing writing, embarrassing acting, and listening to Amber Heard trying to deliver this terrible dialogue with zero inflection was exhausting. Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they're from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The ""advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world"" trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said ""Ocean Master"" with a straight face I wanted to laugh.This would've been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.How many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn't hurt anybody? I counted three or four. Also, that paint-by-numbers forced romance - ""Wow there was a surprise and now we're accidentally holding hands"", ""Wow there was an explosion or something and I grabbed you "" - give me a break. And whoever put together the soundtrack for this film should be summarily executed.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Aquaman: retro dreams come true, to innocence and imagination!","I really love this film. Everyone talks about the GCI in Aquaman,but what moves me most is its style ,so called ""old fashioned fun"" .Here I'll talk about this.(This review is translated from Chinese by google translater.And I'm the writer of it.)First of all, the story of Aquaman is classic enough (that is, the old-fashioned set of some people), which is the journey of superhero treasure hunt. In an interview with James wan in""WorldScreen""magazine, James said that this is a very classic narrative technique. The growth of Arthur is like the growth of heroes in Spielberg, Cameron and Lucas movies. When Wan was a child, he watched the works of these masters grow up and always wanted to make such a movie, so this retro style is intentional. The facts also prove that the classic story will not be outdated. However, we can also understand from another angle that Wan did not try to try the dark and deep story style, but from the direction of being good at commercial blockbusters. In short, even if you don't have interest in the retro story, the level of the plot is definitely qualified in the super-Hero movie.Second, it is the retro feel of the picture. On the one hand, many dazzling special effects brought us back to Avatar and the Lord of the Rings until the shock of the first Star Wars, and the imaginative and fascinating atmosphere of the underwater world is obviously a tribute to the classic fantasy sci-fi movies, like those of Star Wars. Just like classic fantasy operatic movie opens the window of imagination for us. On the other hand, James indicates that the film is expected to be like special effects movies in japan(like Ultraman and Godzilla in last century ). No wonder the friend who watched the movie with me shouted ""The clothes looks cheap"" when he first saw the soldiers of Atlantis. ..... I believe that it is not a problem to add more cool special effects to the soldiers, but James chose a very traditional approach , allowing the actors to fight in plastic armor and add to the film. A little bit of childlike beauty! Seeing this armor design is a little touched. We seem to be able to see james that realize the childhood special movie dreams,hiding behind the viewfinder and snickering.And......To be honest,I'm little worried about Aquaman2,which is said to have been planned by Warner bros because the first episode is too successful,but I don't believe James will direct it again(just like SAW and Fast&Furious,he did once and did the BEST)And I'm also worried about Birds of Prey because the director is too young ...looking DCU(or DCEU) movies is funny ,we must stand some boring films ,but sometimes DC gives us BIG surpriseüòò",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A decent movie,"It looked nice, it sounded good, the special effects were impressive, my family enjoyed it, and so did I. I have read with interest reviews from those who thought the movie tedious, they must have visited a different theatre as the film I saw was far from dull, almost too much going on at any one point. The lead actor was very good, supported by an able, attractive cast. It's not a classic, but it's better then most of the rubbish being churned out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Everything But The Kitchen Sink,"Everything I saw, read and heard about 'Aquaman' before it came out had me convinced it wouldn't be my cup of tea. My impression was that this would be yet another bloated studio tentpole with cheesy dialog, a generic story and artificial looking CGI. However, once it opened, a passionate film fan I respect a lot started spreading so much obviously genuine enthusiasm for the movie that I eventually got over myself and watched it.I think it was the moment when Nicole Kidman swallowed a goldfish that I started to suspect I might actually enjoy this movie. That suspicion, however, turned out to be wrong, because I didn't just enjoy it: I ended up ADORING it. The weirdest thing: the film DID contain all those elements I had feared - and yet none of that seemed to matter. It just works. It shouldn't, but it somehow does, which is why I've since come to the conclusion that director James Wan is some sort of genius wizard filmmaker. Don't let the generic superhero tropes and cheesy dialog fool you into thinking this was a typical mainstream movie (though I DO suspect those things managed to fool the studio executives into thinking exactly that: which is probably how James Wan got away with it), because in truth, this is the least generic, most bonkers big budget studio flick I've seen in ages. It's the film 'Valerian' wants to be. It's crazy; it's over-the-top; it's beautifully designed with incredible attention to every little detail in every frame; it doesn't take itself seriously for a second, and yet it fully commits to - and loves - its characters and the world they inhabit.I was awed, literally awed by the design of the Atlantian society and technology; the worldbuilding and visuals are so distinct and original - which caught me completely off guard, because I didn't expect that in a 200 million studio picture for the masses. When the music score went into full synthesizer mode as ""Aquabro"" and Mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city, and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginable, I had a stupid grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision (the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie). And the film didn't let up. 'Aquaman' never loses steam; there's no weak third act (at least in my opinion); the wondrous discoveries and beautiful, unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end. Although it has a very different tone, I was actually reminded of watching 'LOTR: The Return of the King' for the first time.It's true, 'Aquaman' delivers the typical, clich√©d, cheesy superhero tropes in spades, but those generic story beats - some of which were probably demanded by the studio - seem to be all surface; they're not what James Wan (or his characters) are really interested in. It almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding. His biggest accomplishment, however - the film's greatest strength - is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve: he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete, unabashed fun.So, to sum up this review: against my expectations, the superhero film I least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me; it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again, because I was so in love with its bonkers, ""everything-but-the-kitchen-sink"" approach to filmmaking. Naturally, I now hope James Wan will also direct 'Aquaman 2', as I'm sure if given the chance, next time not even the kitchen sink will be safe.P.S.

The king of Atlantis,"Aquaman (2018) was a fun DC adventure that DC needs, by having fun and having humor instead of staying dark and brooding for each movie. Knowing more about Arthur/Aquaman and the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, while having him rise to be the king of Atlantis with lots of character development by the end of the film.Jason Momoa is cool and fun as Arthur/Aquaman; he was funny and cool in action scenes both underwater and on land. Once he gets the classic orange and green outfit Aquaman wore back in the day, he looks cool especially when he gets his mighty trident to be king. He seems like someone who does not know much about where he came from, but he tries to help people when he can.Amber Heard as Mera was not bad, but Mera's red hair looked like a wig sometimes. I like her ability to morph water and use it as a weapon, it is used in fun action scenes and the effects do look cool to watch. Mera and Arthur/Aquaman work well together, and they slowly start having a relationship with each other by the end of the movie. Plus, in certain action scenes I like it when Mera and Arthur fight together when going up against Atlantean soldiers.One of Aquaman's villains named Black Manta is in the movie, and he was cool to watch; I liked this big fight sequence between Aquaman and Black Manta, which was awesome to watch, but I wish he were used more in the movie or saved for the sequel. The actual villain is Ocean Master played by Patrick Wilson who was a good villain, wanting to rule Atlantis and saying Arthur cannot because he is half Atlantean and half human. The fight between Aquaman and Ocean Master was fun to watch in the third act climax.The look of Atlantis was pretty, and it had a lot of convincing effects; the sea creatures like sharks or any kind of fish looked convincing, and they are all in a big war, it is very entertaining to watch even if it is dumb. The action scenes have great cinematography being quick with no cuts and zoom ins and outs, especially in a great chase scene in Italy that was incredibly fun to watch. Aquaman (2018) was a fun DC movie that I do recommend watching whenever you have the chance, because it does something different than most DC movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The enormous visuality of Atlantis!,"We know that the DC cinematic universe that emerged as a result of the partnership between DC Comics and Warner Bros does not go well. Aquaman does not fall into this category. The film first appeared in China. Then the comments about the movie excited me. I was looking forward to it. It was a movie I really liked.The story of the film is a complete story of origin. We see how a character emerged and how he was a hero. We see what Arthur Curry has been going through since his birth. I mean, you can follow the course of the story very easily and there is no scene you will be surprised. From time to time clich√©s and boring moments can be experienced. When you think it's a story of beginnings, the cliches don't bother you much. I think this is a must for superhero films.While watching Aquaman, you feel a lot more of Wan's touch to the film. Aquaman literally makes you feel like a ""movie"". Because while watching the film, you can see the introduction, development and the result line in a very comfortable way. Everything is as it should be. The characters perform their duties more than enough. In the first 20 minutes, you already feel inside the film, and your attachment instinct confirms this. The origin of Aquaman is generally preserved. There are some minor changes to the film. At the same time, there are critical changes in the Black Manta and Orm. But if you are a comic book reader in general, Arthur Curry's story will give you pleasure. The film also touches on a beautiful subject; People pollute the oceans and nature. Jason Momoa had a successful performance. In particular, he has reflected the character change very well. Willem Dafoe is an actor that everyone will enjoy watching. Willem Dafoe had to have more scenes.The film has technical errors, logic errors, clich√©s. But in spite of all this, the good aspects are much more. James Wan really created a separate world for the film. The underwater scenes were very good. The visuality is tremendous. Sea creatures, underwater conversations, used camera angles, location preferences, costume designs, fighting scenes, visual effects were very good. The music was just as good as the visuals. Even a separate film for Atlantis can be shot. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable but forced in places.,"Firstly its nice to have a fun superhero movie, not something dark and gritty. This is how Superman should be.I like Momoa, he delivers.There's parts however that are just poor, really bad writing such as the child with a ridiculously coincidental Pinnochio book as a gift, the clich√©d story arc of a person who is dead that you know is not really dead.I think the constant bombardment of visual entertainment helped hide most of how shallow the movie really was and as such was my favourite DC movie so far.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The King has Risen.,"Better than any DCEU film, and some of MCU movies I think. The DC has step up their game - this is another level. Never had I expected this movie will this be good, after the Justice League and Batman V Superman because those movies are trash - and let's forget about those. This is the most ambitious comic-book movie I've ever seen so far. Finally a movie that DC fanboy deserves, this film is just beautiful within the cinematography, visuals, also the action scenes. The action scenes kinda remind me of Romanticism painting, it is visually stunning and breathtakingly beautiful. I'm not a fan of James Wan movies but he did a marvelous job for Aquaman. The cast are outstanding, badass performances. I don't think any actors can take the role of Aquaman better than Jason Momoa. The atmosphere of this film looks magnificent vibrant and has high-quality than any DCEU film. Finally we can see the light after those dark days. It has clear motivations for both heroes and villains, pretty solid.But, DCEU really need to fix their poor lines. The writing isn't the best - some dialogues are still cheesy & awkward. Nothing new for the plot, but it is simply enough - almost the same with any superhero film - save the world, family issues, etc. But it has a great message about polluting the water. Also the film scoring and soundtrack was a miss. And I don't see how and why Black Manta is the best villains, his story kinda flat and lacking for me. Black Manta has daddy issues seems not enough for me to think he is the best villain.Afterall, this is highly recommended movie for superhero movie fans. Also you have to watch it in an IMAX 3D.

Aquaman Review,"I am going to write this review as a movie goer and not a critic. I am not a fan of how critics write their reviews because it doesn't apply to the general audience. So as a normal movie goer this is my review. Aquaman was a fun movie with a lot of upside to it. The way Jason Momoa plays Arthur Curry is perfect. He has an attitude that no other superhero really has. He is witty, sarcastic, funny, but also has his sensitive side. I really enjoyed him as Aquaman, but as for the other actors, they were average. My one rip on this movie is the CGI. DC hasn't really produced a good movie with good CGI yet. And this movie, better than justice league when it comes to visual, still lacks the way a Marvel movie would. So as a fan, I noticed the CGI and acting wasn't very good and the dialogue was pretty poor. I also though adding Manta was just a waste of time and space in the movie. His character was a below average villain who besides his fathers death, didn't show a compelling story as a character. I did enjoy however how fun the movie was and how upbeat and also caresmatic it was. I think as a fan this movie is worth seeing because of it being a super hero movie who we haven't seen much of and how fun it is. I am giving this movie a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Although it has something original, we saw lots of cliches and similarities with other super hero characters and movies. What Aquaman did it first is creating a world under water and they did it alright. CGIs are really great. I liked it but sometimes you can easily figure out it is a visual effect because editors have to use these effects every time. And thats the hard part of the job. Even so this movie has the best CGIs in any DC movie for me. Also, Aquaman has a great action. Italy fight, submarine fight, big battle in Atlantis... Casting is great too. Momoa and Heard did a wonderful job on this project. But generally characters doesn't have tough motivations. Especially King Orm, he is not a so intense villian. On the other hand, film is so long.

"No 'Wonder Woman,' but wildly entertaining","The DC Universe has an uneven track record when it comes to recent film adaptations of its franchise. For every 'Wonder Woman' there's a 'Batman vs. Superman' or 'Justice League.' Thankfully for fans of these superheroes, James Wan's 'Aquaman' is closer to the former than the latter, at least in terms of entertainment value.While 'Aquaman' is pretty much billed as the Jason Momoa show, the cast actually does an excellent job sharing the limelight, even in the face of typically wooden dialogue. Amber Heard and Nicole Kidman do their very best as royalty from the sea, while Patrick Wilson surprises as scorned Atlantean brother King Orm - a role very different from those he is known for. Not to mention Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren, and a kraken voiced by none other than...Julie Andrews? As for villains, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II takes on the role of modern-day pirate Manta, whose suit looks like it would be a better fit in a Power Rangers movie.But the cast is not the main attraction here - it's the visuals. It's hard to imagine 'Aquaman' being filmed a decade ago when Vince Chase made it the biggest blockbuster in history on 'Entourage.' The level of preciseness required to make the underwater worlds of Atlantis and others come to life without coming off looking cheap is not to be taken for granted. There is such detail included to ensure these scenes are believable that in some instances it comes off as Pandora-like. This alone makes seeing the film on the big screen worth the price of admission.As for the plot, it's your standard comic book fare, with the hero story lifted from numerous films that have come before 'Aquaman.' In this case, the execution actually makes up for the poor storyline and scripting. The soundtrack and score are also above average for a DC Universe film, with the only exception being a ridiculous interruption from a Pitbull song that samples 'Africa' (but why?).'Aquaman' may not come anywhere close to 'The Dark Knight' series, or even hold a candle to some of the better quality Marvel efforts, but it surely is an entertaining ride that should be enjoyed for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

JAMES WAN IS A GENIUS!,"I have never seen a movie where I've not had a few seconds of boredom watching it. However I love most movies I watch. NOT one second, was I bored in Aquaman! I've never seen a better movie in my life. It's everything I've ever wanted in a movie. Action. Adventure. Comedy. Incredible visuals. Great soundtrack. Emotion. I could go on and on. This is non spoiler so I'm not gonna say much. You NEED to watch this in cinemas the day it's out! This is my opinion on the movie and I hope you don't disagree with me over my opinion after you've watched the movie. The story was fantastic and sends a real message to people about polluting the water. Orm isn't really a bad guy which is great. You'll understand what I mean by he's not really a bad guy. Black Manta was great with a great reason for his hatred in Aquaman. WOW! I was absolutely blown away. Cried so many times, I ran out of liquid in my body. I will be going watching it again an extra 20 times, I don't care, I won't be bored. WATCH IT NOW.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Lying there Under, under the sea","Aquaman of DC comics finally gets his top billing in a film as the nicely put together Jason Momoa plays the title role in this science fiction epic. Already a

Every superhero movie cliche you can imagine,"I have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score, let alone 10. After 20 minutes I have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule.
But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end.
Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face.
WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work. It just looks like a parody and not a well done one.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Go for the CGI, stay for the CGI","Where else would one see a movie with Willem Dafoe in a bun? The movie is almost non-stop CGI, with little bits of story woven between.

One learns that there are a lot of trench creatures, and that there is a sea in the middle of Earth.

Colorful and Bright Visuals; Nothing New From the Story.,"This reminds me of AVATAR. This movie is beautiful to look at, but its nowhere near as good as all the hype these people are creating. I don't know who these people that gives this movie 10/10 sycophantically, or if they seen any movie ever - but this movie is NOT a 10. Its really sad that today all movie makers have to do is show some bright colorful lights on the screen and people will give it instant 10/10. Here is my honest points about this movie (don't worry, pretty lights don't distract me):* Good enough acting.
* Surprisingly good cinematography.
* Good directing.
* Fight scenes look bit too choreographed.
* Story is nothing new - Its a rip off from several movies.
* CGI everywhere. (but at least this time its understandable why.)
* I don't know if it was the theater I watched this, but the music was bit too loud compared to the dialogue.As far as DCEU movies goes, this is slightly below Wonder Woman for me. I do agree this is a step towards the right direction for DCEU - but this is not exactly the right direction.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is the opposite of boring! It's mind exploding amazing,"Firstly i would like to say that my mouth came out of the cinemas with a cramp, as i was watching this movie earlier today. I was smirking, smiling, laughing my way through. I probably bothered some other people in the cinema but it was just that amazing! The action was stunning and perfectly done, the imagination of the movie was unique, it didn't just reflect some of the problems we have like pollution, and chemical dumping in the sea but also gave us another daydreaming topic. Just imagine what is in the bottom of the sea, what would the politics of the sea might be, what would happen if there is such miracle under the ocean. The creativity deserves a "" Omgoodness let me watch this 10 million times, this needs a sequal!"" well at least from me. I have watched thousands of movies, okay that was exaggerated, but this movie, i watched it and it is now offically my top 1.

Not bad at all.,"I will preface by saying that this review is coming from a person who never could stand super hero films, but was pleasantly surprised for what took place on the TV screen. I'll be honest, Jason Momoa is an OK actor, I've never really been a huge fan of his, but he was good (for the most part) in the movie. Patrick Wilson did a phenomenal job as the main antagonist and Willem Dafoe was as good as always. I will be seeing the sequel to this movie that is coming out in a few months because that's how solid this movie was. I will say one complaint that I have is that the CGI isn't the greatest but eh, I won't get deep into it because it was decent enough. I urge anyone (whether you're into superhero movies or not) to give this movie a watch, especially if you're fascinated by the ocean and/or underwater beings.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Aquaman,"A great cast, some of the best visual and special effects I have ever seen - a kaleidoscope of colour and movement in just about every scene; sometimes it was hard to know where to look, there was so much going on - and a fun storyline (that, admittedly, has been done before in different settings) makes Aquaman a winner.Jason Momoa is sensational as Tom Curry/Aquaman, a really commanding presence in all his scenes. I thought Amber Heard as Aquaman's love interest could have been better. Granted, she wasn't given a tonne to work with.Surprised to see Dolph Lundgren pop up a few times. Great to see Willem Dafoe, an actor I've always thought was great. Same goes for Australia's own Nicole Kidman. In the movie, her character is in love with the character played by New Zealand's Temeura Morrison, which is pretty cool, if you ask me.I'm pretty easy going and enjoy most everything I watch.

The most overrated generic superhero film you'll ever see,"I don't know where the hype for this film comes from, because it can't be from the content. The dialogue and characters in this movie are often ridiculous in the least entertaining way possible. Silly can be entertaining, but it can also just feel stupid. The female characters only seem to exist to be Aquaman's conscience (because he can't think for himself, as he's boring), they have no flaws or vices (in other words no depth). The villain is a cheap charicature of the warmonger, with a few poorly expressed environmental ideas thrown into his perspective. The good points of this film fall mostly on the visuals. It is a stunning film in terms of the undersea beauty portrayed, a literal riot of colour across the screen. I would also say that action is pretty positive, the combat is intense and epic. Overral though, I wouldn't reccomend",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great superhero film,"This film has received mixed reviews from the critics and after watching it not sure why the negative ones.Aquaman is a solid superhero film, yes you could say we have seen it all before but that doesn't make it any less fun. Jason Maoma is brilliant at playing the strong yet dump Arthur Curry/Aquaman. The story is very solid and makes good use of the main villain Oceanmaster and side one Blank Manta. The visuals in the film are brilliant you truly believe that it takes place under the ocean. The film passes by really quickly with a good amount of action and humour.

Lame,"I didn't care for either Jason or Amber. They don't have that star quality. She's barely Bimbo/sidekick worthy, but you can tell she thinks she is. Totally needs recasting for the leads and a new writer.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Progress in the right direction - as long as you're hoping for fun and grandeur,"They've finally done it: DC has embraced the cheese and abandoned their attempts to make superhero movies with both the dark, serious atmosphere of the Dark Knight trilogy and the light comedy of Marvel movies. It didn't work with Batman vs. Superman and it certainly didn't work with Suicide Squad, but they came much closer with Wonder Woman.What we have here is a movie which doesn't try to be grounded and gloomy like before, yet doesn't aim to be clever. Aquaman is proud of its corniness, with all the lame jokes, unexplained phenomena (do none of the underwater folks need gills?), and impressively epic deep sea battles. This last part is where the film soars. I have seen few movies with such a beautiful and grand scale of action that works in spite of its flaws. There are hordes of creative ocean monsters, ancient and colossal predators, Lovecraftian horrors, and jaw-dropping sceneries which make the boring, gray-scale landscape of Justice League almost forgivable.By no means is this a perfect movie. You can expect the usual plot holes and details that don't make much sense. There is little emotional connection due to pacing during dialogue that at times feels choppy and second-handed. The characters are fun and refreshing, but mostly predictable and, except for a couple, one-dimensional. The performances are good but nobody in the cast will be expecting nominations during awards season. I would point to both Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson as having the most interesting chemistry simply because of their obviously clashing personalities. Nicole Kidman had some bright scenes with real life in them. Willem Dafoe seemed suppressed in his role. In general, most of the other characters were just ""okay"". One of the main villains (Manta), in all his high-tech glory, is afforded a brief half-assed origin story to make him more relatable.But in spite of this, Aquaman seeks to be FUN, and it does a much better job than any of DCEU's previous endeavors. The change in scenery is even more perplexing than the first half of Wonderwoman. There are so many intricately-designed creatures and characters that I'm shocked the film's budget wasn't significantly higher. Also importantly, Jason Momoa plays a hero who just doesn't really care about behaving like one, which works - at least until a certain very specific turning point in the film. After the first half-hour or so, we are shown scene after scene of gorgeous visuals and battles to rival the most ambitious Marvel projects. It is a comic book movie, after all.There are some not-so-subtle critiques on mankind's treatment of the environment, and though it's a good message, it doesn't strive to go much deeper than ""humans bad, but not all bad"". Don't see Aquaman to have your life changed, but if you want an ultra-fun time at the movies with some significant progress in setting, buy yourself a ticket.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A real review from a grow up,"It does amaze me to see so many reviews that one way or another comes from the studio. They're so easy to spot, but I guess it helps to balance things out from the trolls who love to give good films a one rating.Quick review, the first half was a bit sluggish. With a super hero film who either need a bunch of super heroes which helps to move things around or you need a good number of scene changes to keep the audiences interest. Mortal Engines did a very good of moving from one scene to another, introducing new things into the mix. It did mostly fail on the story. So the first half of Aquaman was a bit weak because it didn't move well. The 2nd half did a much better job moving things around the world and introducing new scenery, above the ground, below the ground and beneath the sea. The visuals were absolutely amazing! I thought the score was a bit weak. Some of the songs were thrown into a scene and then crawled away. Felt a bit off. There were some good laughs along the way and as we find out to along the way the creatures that live beneath the sea are a lot more complicated than we might've believed. I found the scene in Italy to be the best over the seas. I thought the development of Mantra was weak and certain parts of that story were a bit confusing. Overall a very entertaining film, in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As silly as it is fun,"Let's be clear, Aquaman is a pretty dumb movie. But boy if it doesnt put a smile on your face then you probably shouldnt be going to a CGI laden superhero film. James Wan embraces the lunacy of the subject matter and delivers. The dialogue is truly what brings down the movie but Jason Mamoa doesnt let the poor script stop him from oozing charisma. While his chemtestry with costar Amber Heard doesnt fire on all cylinders it is still fun to watch everytime they share the screen together. For all the CGI, and there is a ton of it, the only time it's hard to watch is during the final battle. Other than that we get some of the best the industry has to offer. Most of the cast is working below their talents to be sure but they seem to be having fun and deliver convincing performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than Justice League atleast,"I always have a soft spot while reviewing and rating comic book movies and this will be no exception. I was one of those who believed Aquaman wouldn't be anything special, and even though it earned over a billion dollar pandering to a select demographic I wasn't wrong.For every step this movie takes in the right direction, it rewards itself a flaw that in the end brings it back to where it started. Let's start with the story, it is surprisingly an almost faithful adaptation of the ""Throne of the Atlantis"" without any of the Justice league; and if you watched the Snyder-Whedon travesty you'll know it's a good thing. A linear but enjoyable storytelling that isn't convoluted with exposition heavy dialogues nor peppered with the 90's laugh track. Being a fairly simple plot it enjoys the freedom of incorporating elementary gimmicks that is enjoyable for the whole family but wouldn't necessarily leave a bad taste for movie purists either. And as a result Aquaman doesn't shy away from taking a hearty approach to make the titular character more relatable and lovable. Aquaman ironically worked best when it pandered to the 12 year olds and played its strong suit of heart, emotion and family.As simple as the storytelling and plot is, the script is indifferent. I would have a hard time believing this wasn't actually written by a 12 year old. You hear a line and if you can't immediately guess the comeback you really haven't been seeing movies much lately. The script has to be one of the most generic stacks of line ever put together in a billion dollar movie.The jokes are minimal and are not bombarded after every 10 seconds, which doesn't make the J-bombs decent though. Most of the time they're not even funny but you'll still crack a smile a few times because your inner 12 year old is still alive inside you. One thing I have to appreciate is how they don't ruin heartfelt emotional scenes with a joke, which has become quite the CBM tradition nowadays.I'm not entirely delighted with the cinematography; it's pretty rough around the edges and really hard to believe this was by James Wan. This is a type of movie that could've been made by literally any director and if you didn't know who it is by, you never could've guessed it. Everything about this movie lacks originality and you can't help but feel it quite often. There are some undoubtedly cool shots here and there like the trench diving scene or waterfall scene but those are too few and far between. The awkward camera pans made it feel like a Hindi TV serial at times. Hugely disappointed that James Wan allowed all these bloated mess of a camera work in the final edit.The score was nonexistent, aside from the Toto remix by Pitbull I can't seem to remember any sound even slightly resembling a theme or tone. CBM's really needs a decent score to pump up the juices, which Aquaman offered none. The pacing as I mentioned earlier is actually quite satisfying, which doesn't drag on and overstay its welcome in the slightest.This is the part where the aforementioned ""one step forward- one step back"" quote comes to play. The costume design for Aquaman, Orm and Manta were absolutely impeccable. Emphasis on the word impeccable as I never could've conceived that they could make the corny looking orange outfit so badass on screen, the prop obviously goes to Jason for pulling it off but I'll come to him in a bit. Mera also had her comic accurate leotard on and not gonna lie looked really well on Amber Heard. But for every good costume design there are also few horrendous ones. The white Atlantean suit looked beyond ridiculous and cheap. It reminded me of those henchmen in the old Power Rangers series, and not in a good way. The terrible wig of Nicole Kidman was too bad to ignore, Amber wore her wig better although it's just the longer end of the same straw.The CGI in this movie was painfully inconsistent; some amazing underwater scene gets totally overshadowed by a stack of utter disgraceful CGI work. I am sure the slow-mo Mera jumping off buildings during the Black Manta chase sequence is a perfect example how rough the edges really were. On the contrary the visuals were actually quite delightful and the backgrounds selected pleasant. The sea creatures looked as good as how bad the CGI looked. The trench creatures played in accordance with James's horror root and looked pretty good.Some of the biggest surprises I got from the movie were actually due to the acting. You got more renowned actors like Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Amber Heard and on the other side relative lesser known creds like Dolph Lungdren (not exactly lesser known, but stereotyped), Jason Momoa, and Yahya Mateen. And guess which side did a better job! I always believed Jason Momoa cannot carry a whole movie himself, and he brutally proved me wrong. He practically carried the whole movie for me. If Aquaman was someone other than Momoa I don't think the rating would've been what I gave, it could've easily been far less. He pumped the charisma up to eleven and even managed to rock that goofy orange outfit like a total badass. Honestly though, most of the points I gave are because of Manta, Orm and Momoa.As for the villains, lets just get it out the way: Aquaman had the best villain adaptations so far in DCEU. Manta was exactly how I know him to be, down to his iconic outfit in a proper adaptation. Although he was fairly underutilized and sidelined I can't wait to see him pop back up in the sequels. Yahya did some sweetass work properly portraying Black Manta and deserves more praise.Patrick Wilson is silently becoming a household name each year and his role in Aquaman cements his case. He naturally blended in with the character like no ones business, and actually added subtle nuances. Orm looked, behaved and sounded just perfect, where he easily could've been a Luther, an Ares or even a *Honka Honka*. Props to the costume design team for the faithful recreation of the iconic facemask and cowl and finally doing justice to the rogues of DC universe. I am also kinda glad he wasn't made out to be a power-hungry one dimensional stereotype (even though he was sort of) right in his first outing.Now for the terrible acting, Dafoe wins it by a mile with his most horrendous acting ever, really hurts seeing such a talented actor just be there to cash in. Nicole kidman was a step up but nothing extraordinary. You can blame the script she was given and I'd agree with you. Mera on the other hand was definitely the better among the trio having more screen time and a better script to work on, but as I said, nothing that speaks volume.For a superhero movie Aquaman doesn't have many fights to showcase. I didn't like any DCEU action sequence other than the warehouse scene in BVS and maybe it's just me but overall it was below subpar. The first Orm Vs Momoa was bland and contained no gravity and the stakes felt artificial. The final encounter was better in every way which unfortunately was abrupt. So aside from the Manta fights there is absolutely nothing that Aquaman offers that begs a rewatch.For all the highs and lows Aquaman was quite enjoyable to me; more than I thought was possible. It had a good heart and was brimming with a weird innocence that I appreciate. I can't stop thinking how better this movie could've been if they paid more attention to the little stuffs. But I can say for sure this was a onetime movie and really has no merit to secure a second watch. But hey lucky for them, it worked out just fine.RATING: 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Do NOT Pay Attention to These Numerous Poor Reviews!,"Over the years, people have been watching movies and rating them based on a ""pole vaulting"" type basis.

An imperfect but wildly enjoyable ride,"What's it about?The latest attempt by DC to right the course of their up-and-down cinematic universe, Aquaman, directed by big-name horror director James Wan (Saw, Furious 7), tells the story of the titular character (played by Jason Momoa), mostly referred to by his human name-Arthur Curry-as he reluctantly begins to accept his destiny as the heir to the throne of Atlantis. Amber Heard co-stars as Mera, an undersea princess trying to guide Curry, while Patrick Wilson plays Orm, the main villain, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II plays Black Manta in a secondary villain role. Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren also play smaller but important roles, and Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman round out the list of stars as Curry's human father and Atlantean mother respectively.What works?Given that much of the action takes place in Atlantis and other varied undersea kingdoms, the visuals were where this movie was going to live or die. Fortunately, this is an absolutely spectacular movie to look at-there's hardly any cracks in a really impressive CGI fa√ßade, and the use of color and other visual elements to build an engaging, real-feeling setting is equally impressive. In short, this movie is game-changing in the scope and effectiveness of its visuals; for me, someone who's never read an Aquaman comic, who's never really thought about what Atlantis should look like, this was a wholly convincing depiction of the undersea world. Even the character movements, gliding and hovering through the water, felt mostly natural, and the dialogue was given just a hint of the normal distortion you'd hear underwater.While the visuals were necessary to make this movie work, there's more to making a good movie than just pretty imagery (most of the time). Especially with a superhero action movie, something trying to connect with a very wide viewer base, the movie has to check a few more boxes. Fortunately, it also does a pretty good job with its characters, especially Aquaman himself. The character is written in a slightly unusual way-he's not a classic Superman-type, saving the world because it's the right thing to do, but neither is he a broody anti-hero type. He's free-spirited and energetic but likes to maintain a lower profile in the surface world; he's goofy but motivated and confident. This, of course, makes it the perfect role for Jason Momoa, who plays the role with a perfect sort of cocky charm (he also spends a decent chunk of the movie shirtless, and he's a hunky man). He's also allowed to be a funny character, mostly played as a loose-cannon fish-out-of-water (groundhog-off-the-earth?) relative to the rigidly hierarchical, traditional, rule-bound undersea peoples. It's a line of humor that could easily grow tiresome, but one which is used sparingly and therefore effectively. It's also worth pointing out that the undersea world doesn't come off as too stilted or outdated-it gets some satisfying chances to push back on his behavior in places, which also happens to allow for some solid character development moments as Aquaman tries to learn his place as someone with powerful ties to both the undersea and surface worlds.The other characters are also mostly at least solid. Amber Heard's Mera is probably the next most important of the heroes. She plays the role well, but it's an unfortunate inevitability that a good chunk of her dialogue is just exposition, given that her role, especially in the first half, is explaining the rules of the undersea kingdoms to Aquaman. But in the latter half of the movie she gets a couple moments to shine, moments which she takes full advantage of. Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman are good in their own ways as Aquaman's parents. One standout is Willem Dafoe's Vulko, an advisor to the Atlantean throne and former mentor to the young Aquaman. His character has some interesting moments and good twists along the way.But as is the case with most superhero movies, the true test of its quality is going to be the villain(s). I was worried going in that Patrick Wilson would not be a good choice for Orm, the primary villain, but he is intensely compelling both as politician and warrior, bringing a quiet ferocity in his dialogue-heavy scenes but a vicious confidence in his action ones, building a very strong primary villain, and one who even gets some good character moments. Plus, he looks great in the full Ocean Master armor, once he breaks that out.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is also solid as iconic Aquaman villain Black Manta, though it sometimes feels like his character isn't necessary. He has a commanding screen presence, especially in the excellent opening sequence, but when he's allowed to function as a true villain, he often comes off a bit monologuey and underwritten, though a powerful enemy. He really shines, though, when he's allowed to take off the helmet and do some real acting, giving the character more depth and weight than it needed. I'm also really glad the decision-makers behind the movie were willing to eventually go all-in on the big, comic-accurate Black Manta helmet.The plot is mostly just adequate and generic, but it hits several of its emotional beats with resounding force. The ending is of particular note-without giving anything away, it takes a clich√© framework and plays it really effectively before breaking it off in an unexpected manner, one that leaves the viewer startled by some unusual but effective emotional questions.One last crucial selling point for any superhero movie is going to be the action. Here, again, Aquaman shines. The massive-scale undersea battles are impressively constructed, being sure to maintain some semblance of tactical order while keeping a character-focused perspective, but the CGI overload does tend to wear by the end. The real selling point, however, is the close-quarters combat. Even the opening's expositional setup has a beautiful long-take fight sequence, and it only gets better from there. The fighting is often done with tridents, and the choreography and execution is superb, fast-paced but feeling realistic and visceral, and it always utilizes superb camerawork. James Wan is a director who likes to play with his toys, and the sheer joy of creating some of these sequences is beautifully evident on-screen. Even the slow motion is handled with both care and obvious excitement, showing off some great moments while never becoming quite gratuitous.The music also deserves a mention. Rupert Gregson-Williams, who also scored Wonder Woman, is in solid form here. Several moments in the score are notably strong, and there are no obvious missteps. He might not be ready to supplant John Williams or Hans Zimmer quite yet, but he's definitely deserving of more attention and work.What doesn't work?As I mentioned a few paragraphs before, the plot is mostly just generic fare: find the magic item, beat the bad guy, become the chosen one you were always meant to be. Part of the problem is that this is a movie that had to do a lot of things-develop its main character, establish a massive and complex world, introduce and develop two villains, and give their villainous plots enough weight to feel like a threat to the hero. With all that going on, it's no wonder that the core plot was going to be a little simple. It's not quite Justice League-levels of simplisticity, but it probably is ultimately more of a weakness than a strength, even if it was an inevitability given the volume of other details and characters and subplots surrounding the main narrative.Another problem with a movie trying to do as much as Aquaman is that there is bound to be some tonal inconsistency. The main chunk of the movie feels like an amalgamation of a mainstream superhero movie, a Lord of the Rings-style fantasy epic with Game of Thrones-style fantasy politics, while also bringing sci-fi action and worldbuilding of the sort we should have gotten from the Star Wars prequels. That core combination, though, works surprisingly well. It's when the movie starts dropping in scenes reminiscent of Indiana Jones or Journey to the Center of the Earth that things start to feel like too much, or when it takes a brief detour into otherwise-effective moments straight out of the rom-com or horror genres. Each of the bits, taken on its own, works at least fairly well (especially the horror bit), but there are some inevitable jarring tonal shifts.With any movie of this scale and ambition, there are inevitably going to be at least a couple weak points in the visual effects. While, again, the effects are almost uniformly astounding, there are one or two odd points-an unsatisfying movement here or there, a giant CGI monster that doesn't feel entirely present. An early scene in an aquarium has some uncanny-looking sharks. But really, that's it, and that's just nitpicking.But is it any good?It is! It's not a perfect movie by any stretch, but it does a fair job with most things, and it does a couple of the big things-visuals, action, main character-exceptionally well. Even the problems are mostly inevitable byproducts of bold, exciting decisions elsewhere in the film that end up mostly outweighing the costs of the unintended consequences. On the whole it's probably not quite on par with Wonder Woman (though there might be an argument in that direction), but it's definitely in the same ballpark-another clear winner for DC and a definite step forward for a universe that finally seems to be finding its feet.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Overblown and overcomplicated but fun too,"First the negatives. Aquaman has a ridiculously complicated script, is too long and full of plot holes. The film is, at times, visually derivative ripping off various better films like Thor Ragnarok, The Hobbit and The Matrix and is highly predictable. The CGI is also ridiculously over the top in places. Don't watch this if you are expecting anything original.Now the plus side, Jason Momoa is a piece of inspired casting, he has the look and charisma of the 'halfbreed' Atlantean. Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman give their characters some real gravitas and Dolph Lundgren is a natural fit for his role. The dialogue is occasionally clunky but having established actors like these deliver them does help make it not so obvious.I hope we see more of Jason Momoa in the role. He has a charm and lightness of touch that is welcome, much like Chris Hemsworth's Thor. I'd like to see more witty one liners as he delivers the few he has very well.Not a perfect film and Wonder Woman is still the DC high spot in terms of recent films but Aquaman delivers action and character even if there is still room for improvement. If there is to be a sequel I hope DC will improve on this decent first effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Better stuff than what MCU offered us for 9 years,"CinematographyVisualsDirectingAction scenesVilliansDevelepmentsAtmosphereChoreographyI didn't even think another human being could top Snyder's visuals in DCEU. Well, I wasn't wrong about that one. I still think his visuals are the best in DCEU but this movie had lots of moments too, those wide angle and tracking shots were a treat. The cinematography was really satisfying, so thank you to Don Burgess and James Wan for that. Underwater CGI scenes were breathtakingly beautiful to look at. Set-pieces makes you forget about the world you live in. Not on the same level as LOTR or Indiana Jones or Star Wars but It's close, and I think that's a pretty tough thing to accomplish. Dialogues were cringy now and then but, unfortunately, that's what makes a super-hero movie ''good'' nowadays, and this probably will continue for the next 10 years. Too bad the days where Nolan's TDK Trilogy gave you goosebumps with just words are gone. Now it's just you have to act weird and say something out of place to create a chemistry between the characters. I can't even believe how people buy these kinds of contrived relationships anymore. Anyways, let me say this, the movie isn't something like Thor (2011) It doesn't make you feel like you're on a movie set. It actually has high-quality different places that set the movie's atmosphere perfectly. If you guys worried about if the movie is just a copycat of MCU film, you can relax. The only similarity between this movie and MCU movies is 9 unfunny and awkward moment. The movie actually harbors multiple layers. Antagonists are actually valued, they're not just background actors or extra performers, they actually have moments to shine. This isn't something like Ant-Man. It doesn't have a stereotype, clich√©, and generic film elements that created for the lowest common denominator. It actually has innovations for its genre. This isn't something like Black Panther, It doesn't have PS2 battle scenes. The CGI is actually well-crafted. This isn't something like Captain America: Civil War or most of the MCU films out there, it doesn't have a dim or bland color grading. The movie actually looks lively and vibrant. This isn't something like Guardians of the Galaxy, the characters don't act irrational or illogical, they actually have good reasons because they have developments. This isn't something like Ant-Man and The Wasp, It's not just a filler movie. It actually has a worth-seeing climax. This isn't something like Wonder Woman, It doesn't fail or fall flat in the third act. It actually fulfills its mission at every level. This isn't something like Avengers: Age of Ultron or any other MCU movie. The tone isn't out of place. The movie doesn't have a recurring and predictable theme. The camera isn't too shaky or it doesn't change in every second when an action scene comes up. The villains don't act out of character when they're in a situation. This isn't another Justice League, it isn't trying to be something else. It actually knows its place. But still, nothing can save this universe, not even something as good as The Dark Knight. But as a standalone, this is something worth seeing in the theaters.PS. It's not better than what MCU offered us for 9 years",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jason And The Search For The Trident!,"Aquaman (1) (2018) -Other than 'Man Of Steel' (2013) and maybe 'Wonder Woman 1984' (2020) this film was probably the best from DC that I've seen. That's not saying much, because none of them are generally very good, although Henry Cavill can do know wrong.DC tend to do a lot of reluctant hero storylines these days, with most of them trying to avoid the great responsibility that comes with great power, whereas the Marvel characters all seem to want to save the world or to prove themselves. I will always prefer the Marvel films I think, but this was a good origin story, which was light, fun and entertaining. I didn't feel a want to turn it off as I did with 'Justice League' (2017) or 'Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice' (2016), so that was definitely a plus.Khal Drogo (Game Of Thrones) learned to speak English and swim, but he was still very much the same sort of character and as much as he had that wicked smile and I would probably adore Momo as a potential boyfriend, Jason just didn't have the diversity to separate him from his other roles, in my opinion.In this film he was like an even dumber, beer swilling 'Thor' and he found himself a badass woman with an attitude just like 'Black Widow'. I didn't know if that was how the characters had been delivered in the Aquaman comics, but it felt a little bit like it had already been done in cinema more than a few times.I also had to wonder which barrel they had scraped most of the other actors from? A lot of them weren't particularly good at all, regardless of the size of their part (teehee) and some of the smaller roles were basically amateur. Even Nicole Kidman was a bit off, so maybe it was the director that couldn't get the best from them all? However, it was definitely Dolph Lundgren's best performance. Patrick Wilson, was more than a bit corny though and I also found Willem Dafoe's good guy hard to get.The CGI was very good and I felt that the film as a whole, had a nice quality to it and a definite comic book vibe. One that even some of Marvel's latest efforts have lacked.It was disappointing to see that such an advanced society, as the Atlantean's claimed to be, still solved their problems in such archaic and barbaric ways and the squid playing the drums was a bit too 'The Little Mermaid' (1989) for my tastes.I also thought that, although it was clear that they had tried to update him, 'The Mantis/Manta' was quite ridiculous and poorly constructed.It was the type of film that I would happily watch with my kids, if I had any. I thought that it had that certain something that made it acceptable for people of many ages to enjoy, if it was perhaps a bit simplistic.I might be tempted to revisit the 'Directors Cut' of 'Justice League' if it has more of 'Aquaman' in it and I would be far less likely to dismiss any follow up to this one, now that I've actually seen that DC can do well sometimes.741.91/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Visual Spectacle with adequate screenplay,"Henry Cavill is the Superman; Jason Momoa is the Aquaman, period. Even after 5 years since it's release, Aquaman is still Entertaining as it was in 2018. Kudos to Director James Wan and the rest of the crew for making a spectacular film.First of all, Thanks to Costume Designer Kym Barrett for nailing it with Aquaman's Suit. The Orange/Green suit looks so authentic and comic accurate, yet doesn't look ridiculous in any angle or shot. Always wondered how this traditional Aquaman suit could be brought to Live Action without looking like a Cosplayer and Designer Kym has proved otherwise. Not just for Aquaman, even the costumes for Orm, Mera & rest of crew are top notch. The atlantean army suits are so stylish and authentic looking.Casting is upto the point. Jason Momoa owns Aquaman. Hope the new DC management doesn't replace him. Amber Heard as Mera and Patrick Wilson as Orm did a commendable performance.Cinematographer Don Burgess, Production Designer Bill Brzeski and of course the Director of the film James Wan have created a visually spectacular underwater world. I could just simply keep looking at all the underwater shots again and again. I wish they show more of Atlantis and its people in the sequel. The Action scenes (both above and below sea level) are top notch. The stunts are good but the way they have been Captured by Don Burgess is awesome. The overall look of the film is even more enhanced by the electrifying music of Rupert Gregson Williams.The only drawback is the screenplay. It follows a typical Hero's Journey in a Three act Structure. The screenplay is coherent and adequate yet predictable. The dialogues are bit cheesy and mediocre. There's nothing new or extraordinary here.Overall, Aquaman is a visual spectacle with a stellar crew and adequate screenplay.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sea Hello, Wave Goodbye","What a difference four years makes. I've just watched this movie for the first time and straight away saw in it a pair of separate anachronisms which might affect how we might look at the film if it was being made right now.Firstly, it commences with the prologue sequence where our hero first crosses tridents with the man who was to become Black Manta but this while rescuing a Russian nuclear submarine. Now, post Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, you might be forgiven for having Aquaman leaving them to their fate.Later, the actress Amber Heard, in the prominent part of Mera, who I confess I didn't know beforehand, has of course now gained worldwide fame after her very public lawsuit against her ex-husband Johnny Depp.Anyway, let's go back to 2018 as if these things never happened and consider this film on its own merits. I was a big DC comics fan as a child although Aquaman wasn't the best-known hero or heroine of their roster. I remember his own original magazine folding in the early 1970's although he continued to be a member of the Justice League and later got his own solo book title back, but long after I had stopped my comic reading.So the question is, could this lesser character sustain a whole movie and do so successfully in the marketplace...? Well, as we now know, the answer was a definite yes and a sequel is due in the not too distant future.Actually, I've just recently visited and enjoyed our local town's ""Sea Life"" aquatic museum and can also recall a Vegas visit where there's an ananimatronic depiction of the fall of Atlantis, both of which possibly influenced my watching of this feature. Certainly the C-Gen visuals are stunning, bringing to life the denizens of the deep in all their varied glory and I also liked Jason Mimoa and Heard as Aquaman and his future wife Mera. As ever, in big budget features like this there's easy money to be made for past marquee-name actors in supporting roles and here Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe cash-in with pretty much phoned-in performances as Aquaman's disappeared mother and the boy's mentor / guardian respectively.Sure, it's pretty much a non-stop SFX-fest, but I was on-board for that from the start, even if several of the fight or battle sequences sometimes looked second or even third-hand. It was however a little odd to see what amounted to almost a promotional film for the Sicilian tourist board inserted into the action before the kick-ass action really took off. Story-wise I stopped early-on ticking off the references to Arthurian crossed with mythical legends and all the things I thought I'd seen before in other fantasy and / or action films, from ""Lord Of The Rings"", ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", to anything ""Star Wars"" and ""Harry Potter"".I did enjoy the injections of humour and was happy to follow this particular story arc even if the ecological message was promoted, as I expected, a little too much for my taste.Mimoa is certainly god or at least king-like in the title part and I was pleased to see him finally donning the familiar gold and green colours of the original comic-book character, at least for the climax.Yes, much of the storytellng is formulaic and embellished but I was buoyed enough by the visuals and fighting sequences, loud and long as they sometimes seemed, to compensate for things like character depth or story development. It is a comic-book adaptation, after all.Chances are that I will be on board when the sequel is released.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It doesn't take itself seriously for a second,"It doesn't take itself seriously for a second, and yet it fully commits to - and loves - its characters and the world they inhabit.Loved the stunning design - I was awed, literally awed by the design of the Atlantian society and technology; the worldbuilding and visuals are so distinct and original - which caught me completely off guard, because I didn't expect that in a 200 million studio picture for the masses. When the music score went into full synthesizer mode as ""Aquabro"" and Mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city, and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginableI had a grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision (the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie). And the film didn't let up. 'Aquaman' never loses steam; there's no weak third act (at least in my opinion); the wondrous discoveries and beautiful, unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end. Although it has a very different tone, I was actually reminded of watching 'LOTR: The Return of the King' for the first time.It's true, 'Aquaman' delivers the typical, clich√©d, cheesy superhero tropes in spades, but those generic story beats - some of which were probably demanded by the studio - seem to be all surface; they're not what James Wan (or his characters) are really interested in. It almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding. His biggest accomplishment, however - the film's greatest strength - is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve: he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete, unabashed fun.So, to sum up this review: against my expectations, the superhero film I least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me; it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"I thought Disney bought Marvel, not DC","There is no reason that I know for why Aquaman turned into the modern CGI version of The Little Mermaid, liberally mixed with Aladdin and The Lion King.

The pointless CGI, Heard's horrible wig, all the fairy tale characters that seek to show us how they are superior to people on the surface who have grown up reading about single dimensional characters like them, the predictability that one can find in children stories only. To be honest, the feeling I have most about this film is outrage. It is condescending and dumb. It's the Hollywood version of Homer telling Bart he's stupid.And then there is the cast. Jason Momoa, who I liked in Atlantis, the Stargate one, because he was supposed to have only one dimension. Amber Heard, who hasn't had a good role in ages and sporting that eye soar of a bad wig, Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe getting their paychecks. And Dolph Ludgren? WTF?

A Visual Marvel,"This film is worth watching for the remarkable production design alone. It is not an easy feat to make a film where half of the action takes place underwater, but here Aquaman excels. Gorgeous visuals, incredible underwater battle sequences, and well-choreographed fights make this film impossible to look away from.That said, the plot is fairly basic. Reluctant hero, doomed mentor, unexpected love interest, bad guy who wants to take over the world, etc. Aquaman is surprisingly likable, much different from his closed-off Justice League persona, but he's not particularly clever. He kind of just goes with the flow, punching bad guys as he goes. There are various attempts at injecting humor into the script, but its not very smart - especially compared with the witty comic brilliance of the recent Deadpool, Guardians and Ant-Man films.One aspect of the film that was done surprisingly well was Black Manta's origin story.

I'm so annoyed with the people who reviewed this movie before I saw it!,"I checked all these reviews before seeing the movie. ""Most Beautifully visualized!!! DC movie... so far"". ""Better stuff than what MCU offered us for 9 years!"". I was SOOO excited! I love all superhero movies, MCU and DCEU. I have been hoping for a good DCEU movie for so long, and have gone to each one hopeful. Wonder Woman was a step in the right direction in my opinion. I saw the reviews for this movie and was so excited to see it. And was subsequently let down, partially because I didn't read into the feud between the two franchises's fans.Look, this movie should not be reviewed as highly as it is. It has GREAT visual effects and Jason Momoa is actually pretty good. However the rest of the acting and writing is so so so so subpar. I've been reading reviews all morning, about character development, how it is way less cheesy than MCU movies, just the right combination of funny and serious. Every scene feels forced like a formula: have at least one funny joke, one cool visual effect, and one heroic speech about the importance of what we are doing. So repetitive, the entire movie. How is that revolutionary, or better than any other films the DCEU has produced? I blame my disappointment in this movie based on the DC only fans who are just forcing good reviews on this movie based on their hatred of Marvel. Because while I definitely love DC, and I like Marvel sometimes too, I pay $15 at the theatre for a GOOD MOVIE not a BRAND.I hope my review brings down some of the hype. It is still a pretty good film and OF COURSE I love Aquaman and think that every fan should see the film. But I could have waited until it is cheaper on DVD to watch, because it simply isn't worth it. Please don't let the annoying reviews that praise this film as some above holy savior of the franchise sway you, because it is not that jewel of the DC universe they claim it to be. And if any of those reviewers read this, please, when reviewing movies, leave your anger at the MCU at home so I can not waste money on a film that is by no means, saving the DC franchise. The last thing I wanted was to associate this film with disappointment.tldr: this film really needed a poorer review because the amount of praise it is receiving is unrealistic, and causing people to get their hopes too high about a mediocre film.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Aquaman: Basically what I expected, and that's not a good thing","Where could I even start?Let it be known immediately I'm unimpressed with the DC cinematic universe thus far, though not bad I've considered the movies very underwhelming for the most part. I think they dropped the ball thoroughly and rushed to make Justice League (2017) without debuting most of the characters first like Marvel did.Now Aquaman is a delicate one, because let's be honest he's hard to take seriously. He was silly in Smallville (2001), he was silly in his own cartoon, all the animated outings and the live action television series never even got past the pilot. It's a dude who talks to fish and once taken away from water doesn't really have a gimmick. For this reason (And many more) I was skeptical of the DCU version and with good reason, sure he was fairly neat in Justice League but here? Really?You see straight off the bat I'll say I like Momoa I'd consider myself a fan, he's a competent actor with a unique look. But he's not Arthur Curry! Aquaman is the blonde haired jock looking character, not long black haired bearded Samoan looking fella! So as much as I like the actor, I struggle to see him as this character who has been around since 1941 and has always had the same look which they've not embraced.So getting over that what do we have? Over 2hrs of CGI laden silliness featuring our beloved fishman, Atlantis, tridents, oceanic life fighting for him and goofy looking villains. In fact it's so CGI-laden and so colorful it may as well have been animated because it practically is anyway.The story is very Hollywood, very by the numbers stuff so no surprise there. The cast is decent enough but people like Dafoe just look so out of place because they're too good for this.I'd like to say this is take your brain out fun but it's not, Suicide Squad (2016) was take your brain out fun this right here is get yourself a full frontal lobotomy mediocrity.It's cheesy, it's tacky, it's over the top, it lacks the laughs that could have saved it (To an extent) and it's done nothing to redeem the DC universe in my eyes especially considering I'd count this as their worst movie yet.Aquaman is one of those critically acclaimed movies that I'll never understand why and can only assume it's fans are (Mostly) made up of children and ladies lusting after Momoa.The Good:Momoa is the personification of ""Cool""A few funny momentsSome very impressive visualsThe Bad:That simply isn't Arthur CurryHard to take any of it seriouslyTacky Hollywood nonsense",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

MAGNUS OPUM from DC,One of the Best Movies from DC. Truly a magnificent film. James Wan made his mark in Superhero Films.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a swim through comic book mythology,"Greetings again from the darkness. Were the TV series ""Entourage"" still on the air, they would now need a new recurring punchline. The AQUAMAN movie is real! At the helm, we are surprised to find the master of horror, James Wan, in the director's seat. Mr. Wan is known for such genre flicks as SAW, INSIDIOUS, and THE CONJURING, and his talent for visuals transfers well to the comic book style. In fact, with a run time of almost 2 ¬Ω hours, the visual effects are both exhilarating and exhausting.Sure, we've seen short bursts of Jason Momoa as Aquaman in a couple of previous DC movies, but this time he owns the pool. Momoa plays Arthur Curry as a hunky beer-chugging rock and roll party dude who just happens to talk to fish and breathe underwater. Since it's the first Aquaman movie, writers David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (ORPHAN) and Will Beall (GANGSTER SQUAD) provide us the backstory.On the coast of Maine in 1985, a lighthouse attendant named Tom Curry (played by Temuera Morrison) discovers Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) washed ashore. What follows is a whirlwind romance, the birth of their son Arthur, Nicole snacking on a goldfish, as well as her first kick-ass action fight scene. To protect her son, she agrees to head back to Atlantis where she faces the consequences of birthing a half-breed with a landlubber.When we first see a grown Arthur - with a classic hair flip - he is thwarting the hijacking of a Russian submarine by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his father (Michael Beach, IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK). Manta is one of the two main villains - the other being Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur's war-mongering, power-thirsty half-brother. Sharing a common enemy, Orm enlists Manta and provides a highly-advanced weapon that, for some unfathomable reason, Manta begins (via montage) to 'Iron-Man' it to another level - one much less stable. It's Orm who gets much more screen time as he plots a massive attack on surface dwellers (humans) who have been destroying the sea for years. You didn't think Hollywood would miss a chance to tell us how despicable we are, did you?The basic story is that Orm must defeat Aquaman to claim the throne and become Master of the Sea. Of course, Arthur is reluctant to get involved and only does so at the urging of his old mentor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard), both of whom wish to avoid a war with humans. The first battle of the would-be kings takes place in The Ring of Fire, a royal battleground missing only the accompaniment of Johnny Cash. The duel ends prematurely, so that an epic battle can later serve as the film's epic climax.Although director Wan may throw a bit too much 'plot' and action at the proverbial wall, it is interesting to note the history/mythology associated with Atlantis, the ruling class, and the missing trident. The legends are fascinating and the journey takes us to all ends (and depths) of the globe ... from the deepest seas to the middle of the Sahara Desert (itself once a sea) to the incredible core of the Earth. We see the ancient ruins, as well as the high-tech futurama Atlantis ... and it's all stunning to watch.Don't tell Marvel, but the film is somewhat a blend of BLACK PANTHER and THOR, and Momoa is every bit the Aquaman that Chris Hemsworth is Thor (quite a compliment). Yes, we find out that Atlantis, like our dry land world, is burdened with politics and power-hungry types, but the underwater world and the visual effects keep us mesmerized. We see terrific dragon-like sea horses, a drumming octopus, and a Kraken-like creature supposedly voiced by Julie Andrews (fact or fiction?). There is an early sequence that takes swimming with dolphins to a level you didn't experience on your vacation, and the lighting effects at times recall TRON and can be a bit disorienting.This is probably the largest scale DC movie to date, and director Wan chooses to make a splash with every element - character, mythology, setting, and effects. We also get appearances from Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as a TV talking head/oceanographer making the case that Atlantis is real and a threat. We even get Roy Orbison singing ""She's a Mystery to Me"", and the IMAX aspect ratio makes the first ever over-the-top underwater spectacle. And what a spectacle it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But it was like 20 minutes too long, most of the time I thought that it couldn't be more over the top, until the next scene actually was more over the top and the CGI sucks. on top of that the acting wasn't all that great at some times and horror of all horrors, Nicole Kidman can't move her face anymore.
Maybe it's the best DC films since 10 years for some, ok, but lets not rate it 10 stars just for that. be objective, because this most certainly is not worth 10 stars. it absolutely can't live up to Black Panther if you are looking for to compare it with another movie. While watching this, I was litterally thinking that there is a reason why it took 15 years to develop Avatar and yet another 10+ years for the sequels. Because the time and money went to good CGI.

It was good but the same typical DC,"It was a good movie. Acting was brilliant and hair and make up was great. The CGI was quite good, not something in particular I would point out but still good. The costumes overall were great except for the last costume aqua man wore which looked...well... different is the word. The storyline was a bit all over the place at times but about a quarter of the way through the movie it becomes a bit more clear. This film unlike most other dc films had some comedy in it rather than another 'seriously dark' dc movie. Most dc films are quite dark and barely have any comedy. It needs that balance of comedy to get the audience laughing but still a deep movie at the same time. Too much comedy and the movie feels like a joke but too much deep stuff and you feel like your eternally falling through a black hole, if you know what I'm saying. There was the 'I'm going to blow you up every five seconds' which is pretty much in every dc film (apart from wonder woman and the original batman trilogy). It was a good film and by any means watch it but if you are looking for a go to dc superhero/hero film, the batman trilogy is the way to go.

Aquaman Makes a Splash!,"Aquaman is an exciting and enthralling adventure that must be seen on the big screen! It offers one of the best stories produced so far by DC's cinematic universe.The visual effects in Aquaman are spectacular. The film is reminiscent of Tron, Avatar, How to Train your Dragon and Star Wars in its creation of the world of Atlantis on screen. As a fan of the comics, the vivid colours and comic accurate costumes are so pleasing to see cinematically. It is clear to see that director James Wan has done his homework. However, the de-aging effect used on Temuera Morrison is a little bit distracting. This is only a small criticism though, as otherwise, the effects are something to behold.James Wan brings everything that's good about the original source material. However, he also brings his own flare to the property, adding horror elements that merge beautifully with the world he has forged.Jason Momoa was born to play Aquaman! In recent years, Aquaman has been treated as something of a laughing stock. However, these times are over! Momoa has brought gravitas to the role and has made the character very cool. Amber Heard is also fantastic in this film adding a really interesting dynamic to the film. Her character surpasses the typical damsel in distress that superhero films typically have, instead giving us a powerful and stylish equal to Momoa's Aquaman. Patrick Wilson's portrayal of King Orm is good, but in the grand scheme of the film Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's portrayal of Black Manta shines out, offering a very compelling villain for future films. I must also add that Willem Dafoe's Vulko really helps add authenticity to the world of Atlantis with a subtle and considered performance.Overall, I would highly recommend the film to fans of casual film goers but also to die hard fans. The film's visuals are spectacular and are also supported by a strong storyline that will keep you totally invested throughout. I would give Aquaman 7.9 out of 10 as nothing is watered down!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Aquaman splashes onscreen with a spectacular torrent and a waterfall of barnacle action.,"It's safe to say that Aquaman is no longer not cool. The running joke is finally put to rest. Not only has accomplished director Wan created a decent superhero film in an extended universe that feels tonally convoluted, but possibly its strongest entry. That's not to say it's perfect, there is dampness in the far corners of Atlantis. But ""my man"", what a ride! Set after the events of 'Justice League', Arthur must step forward to be king of Atlantis and stop his half-brother from creating a war with the surface world. There's a phrase that has been circulating within the inner workings of the Internet. ""In Wan we trust"". A director who singlehandedly modernised the horror genre, entered the 'Fast & Furious' to create its best entry and conceptualised 'Saw', one of the most renowned horror franchises of all time. He is what makes Aquaman work. He is what gives life to the seven seas. He is why he is often the secret weapon in franchises. He understands any genre that is given to him. This solo endeavour, that rarely references other DCEU films, conforms to the cheesiness and blockbusting entertainment of earlier successes. From cringe-inducing one liners (""Permission to come aboard?"") to humour that often falls flat (""I could've just peed on it""), it often seems like it sets itself up for failure. However, because of this it surprisingly gives charm to the film and personality to its characters. It's so light in tone, purposefully juxtaposing the darker narratives of other entries, that it feels fresher than freshwater. Wan's eye for visual spectacle and intrinsically immersive action proves that it's not trying to be the next 'The Dark Knight'. Grand in scope, yet a personal tale of leadership for Arthur that enables his character to develop from a careless brute to a genuine role of idolisation. Considering the 143 minute runtime, it was paced methodically. Never did I feel the need to look at my watch, a rare achievement for any lengthy blockbuster.As the trailers suggest, the primary insight into Wan's ambitious creation is the use of visual effects. There were one or two scenes that physically gave me goosebumps. The design and architecture of Atlantis was awe-inspiring. Each building upholding a sense of modern personality, and each inhabitant spreading ancient history. Vivid neon colours invade your sight, as you sit back holding your breathe whilst being submerged into this otherworldly fantasy. With the help of Gregson-Williams' euphoric score, the world of Atlantis truly came to life. These visuals are then utilised during action sequences in order to stylise them. Wan tends to experiment with his camerawork (switching from POV to 360 rotational panning to ambitious one take shots) which invites you into the combat. Simple choreographed fights involving tridents soon escalate into kingdoms battling each other on giant crustaceans and hammerhead sharks. The range is splendid and maintains the entertainment. Momoa, Heard, Wilson and Kidman all getting involved within these sequences. The performances, for the most part, were good. Momoa is in his element and embracing every opportunity as the leading actor. Both his physicality and demeanour suit the role of Arthur Curry. Heard was also decent as Mera, the two interacting with each other often to create comedic moments. Although the end relationship is somewhat predictable, it was still pleasant to watch. Wilson also held his own (as always) as the primary antagonist. Kidman and Lundgren though were slightly dry and probably needed more time in the water.There are however faults that makes this a wet affair occasionally. The screenplay needed more work and is the weakest aspect to the film. Often relying on exposition, it never truly embraces its characters and instead settles for scope rather than nuance. For example, the secondary antagonist Black Manta was horrifically underdeveloped and unfortunately felt like an afterthought. Only showing up during action sequences and nothing more. Even the Ocean Master himself wasn't particularly developed enough to make you understand his viewpoint (aside from humanity destroying its waters). Wan has so many ideas, so many locations that he wants to showcase, that the narrative occasionally feels like shallow set pieces rather than a deep story. The ""Ring of Fire"" challenge fight sequence does accentuate the often poor human CGI, turning a pivotal moment into more of a distraction. I also found the conclusion underwhelming and rushed, in a bid to open itself up to a sequel. Still, in Wan we trust and fortunately his trust was justified. Aquaman is a nautical adventure that is sure to reinvigorate the extended universe that crumbled before it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a messy beautiful world down in the seven seas,"Aquaman is the first DC film that looks like it wants to embrace its fun sideUnfortunately, Aquaman is a film gasping for air. Hobbled by a messy and overstuffed screenplay, poorly developed characters, and a patchwork of unimaginative action sequences stretched across bloated running time. The film suffers through an identity crisis. It wants to embrace the campy Silver Age comics but it also wants to try to be serious and feels like a patchwork of many films. Yet ""Aquaman"" shows sparks of hope throughout, with visual finnese and one of the most fantastic openings in the genre. At times, ""Aquaman"" contains the hints of a blockbuster ready to engulf the world.
From giant sea creatures swimming around to Dafoe's Vulko riding a giant hammerhead shark, the film doesn't lack In its imaginative ways to transform the ocean .But its default mode is paint-by-the-numbers action, by the time you've reached the finale there has been over a dozen or so clashes. Instead of making one ""Aquaman"" movie, James Wan has made three or four films. Wasting away what could have been great storylines for future films.

Nice world building,"Before this movie I had literally linear idea who Aquaman was. I had never seen the comics, cartoons or the weird GameCube game. When this movie's trailer dropped I thought it was just a random superhero on whom DC is making a movie, like Plastic Man or Karate Kid (the DC one, not the popular franchise one). And so I walked in completely blind for this movie. And I'd say this may be a beautiful adaptation of the superhero, but definitely far from perfect.Unlike most DCEU movies which always have a lot going on, Aquaman has literally nothing going on. Or so it seems, because in this movie he has to discover his legacy, find his mother, stop his brother from attacking land dwellers, save himself from Black Manta who wants to take his revenge from Aquaman for having let his father die and also manage his relationship with his father, step-father, brother and Mera. And in spite of having so much this movie has a ton of breathing content, because each of these things barely last for 10 minutes.The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. The characters travel all across from the stormy lighthouse, the colourful Atlantis to the Sahara Desert and Sicily. The fight scenes are all well choreographed although they always begin with interrupting the dialogues. Depending on which character we look at, they are somewhat similar to their comic book counterparts. The sense of humour is, well, at least it's better than the 2017 Justice League.I was interested in the movie only because of its visual effects. And I got that. So I have no complaints. This movie was satisfactory, but not really great. I wouldn't mind seeing it again, it just won't be as interesting as the first time. It's pretty surprising to me that this is the highest grossing DC movie of all time, even though it literally had nothing substantial to offer. I hope they add a little more depth to the story in the sequel, because if Aquaman is really a legendary character then they have to make him look like one, and that won't come by just adding visual spectacles.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Demo-worthy visuals and sound,"The visuals of this dilm are insane, and so are the stylistic shifts (adventure, horror, sci-fi, super-hero: All have their own color pallets and camerawork)
I love the colors used, and James Wan found a great way to incorporate the ""origin"" story in a world where Aquaman already exists.The weakest part of this film is the dialogue, which can be a bit cheesy at times.I stopped encouraging people to see the film when the whole Amber Heard/Johnny Depp stuff came around, but watching this again helps me realise that this movie stands strong on it its own, both in relation to the drama and the rest of the DCEU.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"James Bond, Thor, and Godzilla but worse","Honestly Aquaman feels like a movie I've watched before. It isn't original at all and it feels like it took parts from movies I've seen before, mainly James Bond, Godzilla, and Thor.James Bond comparison: The reason these movies are similar is because they have somewhat similar action scenes, although of course James Bond isn't Sci-fi or fantasy. Their difference is that James Bond is much more exciting and less silly than Aquaman.Godzilla and Godzilla King of the Monsters comparison: I'm just going to jump straight to the point where Godzilla 1 and 2 aren't much better than Aquaman. Although the Godzillas have a slower pace it creates a much more climatic ending which Aquaman doesn't have. Plus the Godzillas have a darker tone.Thor Ragnarok comparison: Thor Ragnarok is a movie that is much better than Aquaman. The main thing that makes it much better than Aquaman is it's comedy. You will or have probably found yourself laughing a lot in Thor Ragnarok, compared to Aquaman where there was only a joke or two.At the end of the day I don't really recommend Aquaman for it's unoriginality and small entertainment amount.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow... just wow,"That was actually terrible, Jason Momoa is actually just a frat bro they picked off the street... amber heard was definitely not cast for her acting ability... and everyone else is just as bad. The only redeeming quality is the sfx, they're very good even if they look like the gungan city from episode 1. It was paced awfully, written awfully. And OH GOD the music was atrocious, I'm pretty sure I can find the weird string music from the desert scenes on imovie. And PITBULL!!! What is this 2006?! Just wow, the only good scene in the movie is the trench, which speak to wan's horror roots. But Jesus the choices made here are baffling.

Looks like DC is on the right track to get its mojo back !!,I am a hard core Batman fan so I can call myself a DC fan also. Well after the DCEU started I was excited that it can give a neck to neck competition to Marvel but that never happened.Marvel always got good critical reviews as well as phenomenal box office numbers. And yes apart from Man of Steel the other consecutive movies BvS or JL they both were not upto the mark. Wonder woman was a good movie though.Because of these dissappointments I was not excited for Aquaman. I thought this will also be added to the list of the above movies I mentioned. But I was proven wrong !! How did I forgot that the director of this movie is none other than Mr. JAMES WAN who made The conjuring and Furious 7. But everything aside. James wan yet again proved his mettle. And this movie is a sure shot blockbuster.DC has a bad repo for not giving much freedom to its directors. And that's why its movies become dissapointments. But as Wan claimed that he was given full freedom in making Aquaman we can ourselves see the results of it. And I hope that DC continues this trend in its future movies also.Back to the movie let's talk about pros and cons:-Pros :-1. Wan's direction is fantastic.2. Action director who has designed the action deserves a praise.3. VFX team also deserves a praise. A film like this is quite a difficult task to do. But still these guys have done it.4. Adding emotions in a proper proportion adds a character development aspect which we missed in previous DCEU movies. Though they could have shown more emotional attachment of Queen of Atlanta and Ocean Master.5. Performances by all the actors are fantastic.6. Art director also deserves a praise.Cons:-1. Film gets boring in between especially in Italy scenes.2. If character development of Black manta and Ocean Master could have been done a bit well. Then it could have been more amazing.My rating is 8/10.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than I expected,"Of all the DC movies this is the best. James Wan very well loaded the film contains a great visual demonstrating well the vast universe of Atlantis.

Wonderful.,"Only minor spoilers ahead.I agree that I was sceptical when I heard that James Wan is going to direct Aquaman. The guy who was famous for - Saw, Insidious, Conjuring, Annabelle, Lights Out - all out dark horror movies. I mean, if you take out Furious 7 from the list, the guy is almost completely dealing with horror stuff. The only plus point that I saw there was that all of them were 'dark' and the DC verse is supposedly 'dark'. Things got worse when I saw the trailer and saw some 'altered' old school scuba divers as villains. I mean it did look like Black Manta from the comics but to cast something that dramatic from a comic into a movie usually calls for disaster. And in the trailer there were underwater shots of Atlanta that reminded us of 'Avatar' and a Gigantic crab that reminded me of 'Wrath of the Titans' - So now you see my dilemma before watching the movie - it could be an Avatar or a Wrath in the waiting!But my oh my, this fellow blew my mind completely. Right now I believe this movie can bring back the DC movie verse from close to death.After watching Aquaman (due to early release in India) the one word that is still ringing in my head is - MAGNITUDE.The sheer magnitude of the sets, the stunts and the visuals got my jaw dropped. There were a lot of wow moments and more than once did I think about the 'scale' of the underwater world that he is trying to show to us. For instance, there's one scene where a giant blue whale looking like a fish when it swims past one of those fallen Atlantan statues under the sea. At that moment you will invariably compare the sizes in your mind.I would say James Wan has successfully compiled Avatar, the Titan movies, Pacific Rim, Godzilla, a bit of TinTin, Indiana Jones stuff, a pinch of Harry Potter (LOL) - all into one short fun packed movie. There is fantasy, future tech (in its own way), adventure, creature stuff, scary stuff and breathtaking visuals. And thankfully you won't feel that they have made it all too sweet for a PG-13 rating. It is just the right amount of action.Oh thanks for reading that much - As a DC fan, now you are probably thinking like - I know all that from the trailer but what about the Superhero stuff? What about Aquaman? Did he pull it off?My simple answer is a firm Yes.For a start, this was the one of those films where I waited to see who the casting directors were in the end credit (applauds to Anne McCarthy & Kellie Roy). Personally I felt all the actors were spot on for their roles - Nicole Kidman back in the DC world as Atlanna and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta steals the show in the opening moments, Amber Heard as Mera was convincing, Patrick Wilson as the rogue brother was a decent choice. And for a change you will get to see Willem Defoe (a.k.a Norman Osborne from MCU) and Dolph Lundgren, Drago from Rocky, in different roles (though it's hard to spot Dolph in his new looks).The towering Dothraki, Khal Drogo - Jason Momoa - to top it off. He is literally like a character walking out of a comic book with those chiselled muscles and the looks along with some pretty decent acting skills (he has a few comic one-liners too). He seems to have understood the depth of the character well and we will see him switching from the ignorant meta-human to the King of Atlantis along the way. There's a pretty decent back story (similar to WonderWoman) and a 'Save the World from Pollution' theme to hold on to. So overall the movie has a pretty solid base.There are some minor flaws like too many things going on in the final fight (but certainly not as bad as Man of Steel or BvS, here it is simply because of the same magnitude that I mentioned earlier) and there are some space-game like action sequences (even the BGM at that time seems odd but I think it might have been intentional) - but those are very trivial ones.Overall it is an entertaining DC movie and we feel like we are watching a true comic adaptation.So now you see DC's dilemma now - In the next JL movie - WonderWoman and Aquaman will be running the show unless the Bat and the Man of Steel proves us wrong.I rate it 4 out of 5. Watch it on a big screen to feel the magnitude.PS: Just one advice to all of you - PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILERS for DC movies. They simply reveal too much every single time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Aquaman (2018),"After the release of Justice League I wasn't optimistic about anything in the DC Extended Universe, not named Wonder Woman. I thought Aquaman was just going to be terrible and unnecessary in a universe that seemed to be in disarray. I was kind of warming up to it with the new trailers released and the fact that a competent filmmaker in James Wan. I think this is an fairly entertaining entry in the DC Universe and definitely the second best film after Wonder Woman.The film follows the story of Arthur Curry, who is an heir to an underwater kingdom that his half brother is trying to take control of. The film goes into the details of Curry's past and shows how Aquaman eventually became the hero he is today. In this film Aquaman must find a powerful trident and stop a war that threatens his people and all of Earth. The film stars Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, and Patrick Wilson.Wan reunites with a reliable name in Wilson who plays Ocean Master. Both him and Black Manta feel like generic villains as is the case with a lot of superhero films, its also tough to establish a villain with the general unfamiliarity with the Aquaman comics for the general masses. You can tell the film has a big budget as it is exquisite in its underworld fantastical elements and all the action and effects that go along with it.The film isn't anything groundbreaking when it comes to superhero films and its quite cheesy in dialogue and comedic nature. It still works for the most part and is a refreshing change in light, tone, and color in this universe. Its not exactly a huge endorsement as to why the DCEU should continue to exist, but it shows that under the right guidance it can work better than most previously anticipated.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Another Arthur seeks to become King, this time it is a Trident he must obtain.","This is a good popcorn movie, but I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library. It has a lot of very deep bass in many scenes and often rattled the glass doors covering the fireplace.The star is Jason Momoa as Arthur, the product of a union between a lighthouse operator and a mysterious injured woman from the sea. He is destined to become Aquaman. Momoa has the looks and at 6'-4"" has the stature to be legitimate in that role.His nemesis becomes Patrick Wilson as the underwater King Orm, the half-brother of Arthur. Their mother is Nicole Kidman as Atlanna. Each very effective in their roles. The general thrust of the story is Orm is unhappy with how humanity has been treating the world, both above and below the waves, and wants to conquer all to make things right. Arthur, being of both ancestries, seeks to instead promote cooperation. So naturally a mighty battle settles that issue.The computer graphics and special effects are really great, but for my tastes there is just too much frantic battles and destruction in the scenes leading up to the conclusion. I most enjoyed the first 1/3rd of the movie plus the last couple of scenes.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

CGI extravaganza,"In 1985, lighthouse keeper Tom Curry rescues a woman from the stormy sea. She's Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), The Queen of Atlantis. They have a son together named Arthur. In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Aquaman is a fun affair!,"Aquaman is a blast!DC got everything right for a change, and in doing so James Wan conjures (pun intended) a level of entertainment that bests their greatest in this decade- Wonder Woman. The humor, action, acting, editing, all are spot on for a change, and Jason Momoa as Aquaman is as inspired a choice as Gal Gadot was.This connected universe thing is not DC's cup of tea. They never established the characters well enough to connect them like Marvel did, and each movie was tonally different. DC's 2018 shift towards independent, disconnected universe way is far better than them copying the Marvel way. Aquaman though, introduced in fine style in 2017's Justice League is a remnant of their connected strategy. Momoa isn't the only guy bringing the house down though, the key guy here is James Wan. Wan has injected a sense of fun that helps entertain a wider audience, which DC so far lacked. Not that he has given up on his horror roots- some of the sea creatures and inspiring visuals will not look out of place in the Conjuring universe.Watching a comic book movie requires you to enter into the theater with an open mind. In this case, that is an underwater world, complete with shark and whale riders, highways for turtle-cabs, sea horses that are quite literally sea horses, bongo playing octopuses, giant prehistoric monsters, pink haired Dolph Lungdren- you get the idea.Aquaman picks up where Steppenwolf is defeated in Justice League, and people of earth know of a sea dweller who is out to help them. A backstory gives Arthur Curry's origin- eldest son of the queen of Atlantis who fell in love with a lighthouse keeper. She was apparently executed for her infidelity, but you know DC movies are all about mommies, so hold that thought. Arthur's half brother Orm wants to unite all the undersea kingdoms (yes, there are 7!) and wage war with Donald Trump and the rest of us genteel land dwellers because of global warming, ocean trash, pollution etc. Only Arthur can take him on, but for that he needs the Trident of Atlan. He is helped by Mera, daughter of Sir Pink Hair Dolph, and Vulko, counselor of Atlantis, while in his way stands Orm and his dreams of becoming Ocean Master, and his comic book nemesis, Black Manta.Arthur Curry: I'm no leader. I'm not a king.
Mera: Atlantis has always had a king. Now it needs something more.
Arthur Curry: Well, what could be greater than a king?
Mera: A hero.In one fell swoop, Wan provides an exciting origin story for both hero and villain, a believable romantic angle, and an emotional family drama, replete with epic battle scenes that shade Star Wars, and thrilling expedition sequences that match up to Indiana Jones. Momoa plays Aquaman as he played Khal Drogo- brashness and physicality that he has made his own, along with doses of humor and charm- no lasso of truth required for him to lay out his feelings for Mera. Speaking of whom, Mera is perhaps Amber Heard's first big budget role, and she fits the Atlantean princess to the T. Nicole Kidman is the most charming DC superhero mommy, and Yahya Abdul Mateen is a passionate Black Manta. Patrick Wilson as Orm is probably the only miscasting, but he too gamely plays along.Many thought this year's greatest spectacle was Avengers:Infinity War but do watch Aquaman and you may be pleasantly surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Strong visual. Weak dialogue/acting.,"Visually this movie was pretty great. They crafted a very unique and cool world and met my expectations for this, which was the original reason I wanted to see this movie in theaters. Sadly though, the dialogue was very painfully corny and unnatural feeling much of the time; and the acting of some of the main characters doesn't help. I loved Jason Momoa in Game of Thrones, but for some reason he did not appear to be able to naturally perform this role. I will say to be fair that the dialogue he was served to read gave him a massive disadvantage. What he does have going for him is he definitely looks the part, perhaps better than anyone else I can think, I just wish the performance felt more genuine.Another pro for this movie would be that the action scenes were pretty strong. Still I found that the corniness of the dialogue overshadowed this in my mind because it was painfully hard if not impossible to ignore at times.If you're going to see this movie, go in for cool costumes, sea animals, fantastical kingdoms, superhero action fights, and neat visuals. Leave your expectations for good dialogue and non-cringy character interactions behind.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Visually striking, but little else to hold your attention","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningArthur Curry (Jason Momoa) is a half man, half aquarian warrior, who has been raised on Earth, and uses his special abilities to fight for justice. His latest escapades have seen him rescue an underwater boat from a group of vicious hijackers, one of whom is now eager for revenge. Meanwhile, in his underwater second home, tensions are brewing between rival kings Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), plunging him into a desperate inter-world battle, alongside the beautiful Mera (Amber Heard), to discover his true self.Suspension of disbelief is sometimes something you must be willing to engage with any regular movie, but with superhero movies, it's always something of a foregone conclusion, naturally with the inevitable fantasy element that is attached to the story. But, even by these standards, Aquaman, one of the most recent additions to the staple, rather pushes the boundaries. Opening in 1985, Nicole Kidman, as a mermaid, leaps out of the water by some guys house and comes into his life, living as a couple and raising a son (without, it seems, raising any eyebrows or contravening any marriage laws.) But this brief spark of incredulity serves as a sweetener for the lengthy vapidness that is to follow.Jason Momoa was a guy I'd never heard of before this film, and who on the back of it, it would seem, suddenly garnered the star power to charge ¬£95 for his autograph at Comic Con. He certainly has the physical frame to fit the title role, and within the constraints of it, pulls off the grunting, edgy, wise-cracking tough guy in a perfectly serviceable manner, but nothing more than is required. The support cast is littered with big names, from Dafoe, Heard, Wilson, Kidman, and Lundgren making a pleasing big screen return in a none fighting role, all of whom are pretty much equally perfunctory.The film's big saving grace is it's magnificent visual spectacle, with some amazing CGI capturing a wonderous underwater kingdom, along with some snazzy costume design and amazing action. But it's at least twenty minutes too long and over indulgent, with a threadbare, unengaging story and empty, soulless performances. And that renders all that pretty meaningless. **",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You can tell the comic book movies are coming to an end.

Enough is enough if you guys are running out of ideas if you guys are putting females in male roles to get people to come and watch this of crap. Then it's time to scale back these types of movies. Start producing movie people wanna watch, not just the same type of people over and over and over again. This genre is totally wiped out creativity in the movie industry. Wanna make money .....make a superhero movie you'll make lots of money every one who loves comic book heroes go see it. Well I'm sorry but you're losing a lot of real fans love watching movies. We live in an era where young people believe the comic books ""fine literature or classical literature"". This is a total joke. This movie just characterizes how low we have gotten and why we fail to understand what movies really are.

Not as good as I hoped sadly,"Besides Wonder woman I have not been too impressed with DC movies recently. But growing up and loving those superheroes I always give those films a go. There were things that worked and didn't work for Aquaman. Sadly more things didn't work. The CGI and fight scenes were often over the top. The biggest issue for me was 'buying into' this universe. If you look at Guardians of the Galaxy we easily bought into into that crazy space journey with funny looking creatures. Aquaman in that respect is more believable but sadly it comes across as far fetched and you're not really immersed or taken on a journey.One positive is the somewhat decent plot. On one side there is a human rivalry and the other is an oceanic empire wanting to strike back at humans. Jason Momoa does what he can with the script but its not enough to carry the film. It tries to pull off too much of the unbelievable and passable. This is not a terrible film but its not memorable. Let's just say if viewers saw it showing on TV years from now they would probably keep flicking channels compared to tuning in for a few minutes. It's passable and not the win that DC so desperately needs to respond to the huge success and formula used by Marvel.

There are exceptions obviously, but comic book doesn't translate from page to screen, or so we were told...And then along came James Wan! What a director! What a movie! This is one of the most accurate comic book movies, like ever(except the lead, who looks nothing like Aquaman from the comics)!So Jason Momoa is great in this role! No doubt about it! And just like Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, Zack Snyder cast people(not very good, in terms of acting abilities), who naturally fit to these characters. I mean from the first shot of him onscreen you're like: he look nothing like Aquaman, I've read, but he IS AQUAMAN!Back to comics accuracy. Every other character is authentic esthetically, and personalitywise. Black Manta really is Black Manta(they even explain, why his helmet is so damn Big, Oceanmaster has his iconic Helmet and etc...
Now the Action! James Wan gives the fight scenes in Aquaman a unique cinematic language: they always begin with wide circular shots, that help establish the geography and after we're used to surroundings, James starts cutting to the choreography. And also long take fight scenes! Quite few of them actually!Film is pretty fast paced, but still manages to deliver solid story arcs, and clear motivations for both our heroes and our villains. Performances are solid overrall. No clear standouts, at least to me.I don't even need to say that the movie is visually stunning! You already knew that from the trailers!The score: pretty good! Aquaman theme is repeated quite often, and after the credits roll, it kinda sticks to your brain on a loop. Character themes overall are very good, although Oceanmaster theme is too dark, considering the fact that he is not evil personally.In the end It's a feel good movie for the whole family, with some real heart, and genuine humor!I highly recommend it!9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
DCEU back on track.,"We all wanted DCEU to be good like MCU. Wonder Woman is the only decent movie so far in DCEU. Aquaman has helped DCEU to be back on track. It has a very good plot, excellent visual effects, brilliany star cast etc. Overall it is a decent movie. It is not like any movie in MCU in my opinion as some said it is similar to Thor. Aquaman has it's own style of narrative and place comparing to any other super hero movie. Jason Mamoa did a very good job but it is Amber Heard who stole the show. She's a real bad ass as Mera.

The performances are good from everyone, Momoa has managed to make Aquaman cool, Amber Heard and Willem Dafoe are spot on as Mera and Vulko, and lastly we get two of the DC universe's coolest cinematic villains with Ocean Master and Black Manta (the latter having one of the best action sequences in the movie) and costume wise everyone is straight out the pages of the comics. Few minor issues, the humour just isn't funny at all, some of the dialogue is awkward and not well delivered. Also some of the licensed music used is dreadful (the score is good though).

"Momoa is worth the price of admission, but not the writing","Poor, poor Aquaman. Has there ever been a more maligned, ridiculed character in comic hero history? As a member of television's Super Friends, he was the least used or seen. Although he has been around since the early 40's and even spawned a more popular Marvel rip-off (Namor), he is probably been one of the least popular super heroes in comics, having canceled title after canceled title. Even Raj, one of the comic loving guys from ""The Big Bang Theory"" famously said ""Aquaman sucks!"". But in recent years, writers have taken him more seriously, making him more powerful and even gaining the public's respect. In ""Justice League"", he was one of the bright spots in the film and because of it he gets his own solo film. I never thought I would see the day when Aquaman would have his very own major motion picture but it is now out. The question is can it help the fledgling DC movie universe or (forgive the pun) sink it?
We learn that Aquaman'a parents were from different worlds; his father a lighthouse keeper from Main and his mother the princess of the underwater nation of Atlantis. He discovers her on the rocks on the seashore, badly wounded. After nursing her back to health, the two fall in love and they have a son, Arthur. When Arthur is an infant, they are attacked by soldiers from Atlantis and his mother is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis. As Arthur grows, he discovers he has powers to communicate with the creatures from the seas. He is taught by his mother's loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko, who trains Arthur to become a warrior, but is rejected by the people of Atlantis because he is a half-breed. After the events of ""Justice League"", Arthur has become a celebrity of sorts and considered a hero in the eyes of many on the surface. But Arthur's half-brother, Orm hails himself as Ocean Master and plans to build an army consisting of the armies of the 7 seas to destroy the surface dwellers for the harm they have caused to the oceans of the world. The daughter of one of the army's leader, Mera reaches out to Aquaman to help her stop his brother and reclaim his rightful birthright as king of Atlantis.
""Aquaman"" is a film that suffers from illusions of grandeur. It wants to be an epic superhero movie but it grinds itself down with silly and clich√© scenes and characters. It often tries too hard to be an impressive, all-time great superhero movie and ends up becoming laughable and over-the-top. Director James Wan, who is best known for his horror films like ""The Conjuring"" and ""Saw"" gives us too many jump scares for a superhero movie. I counted four scenes in where a huge explosion or a monster was supposed to incite a reaction from moviegoers. But if you can get through some of the film's major weaknesses, there is a true gem in this film... Jason Momoa. The Hawaiian actor is a star in the making. Just like Gal Godot from ""Wonder Woman"" the producers found a relatively unknown actor and gave him a role that will define him for awhile and one that he brings a lot of charisma and natural screen presence to. Momoa can be funny, truly entertaining without really trying. Early in the film, he has some great fight scenes, which is what he excels at as an action star. The script is not always the strongest, but Momoa makes the best with what he is given. Amber Heard is also strong as Mera but some of the other supporting performers are oddly cast with veteran, capable actors like Willem Dafoe & Nicole Kidman seeming like they are out of sorts and maybe uncomfortable in this film. Patrick Wilson as the main villain, Orm isn't bad but he also won't go down as one of the best comic villains of film. Most exciting is Black Manta, a personal favorite of mine who also provides one of the film's best scenes with his fight against Aquaman. I really wished he was the main villain, but I have a feeling if there is a sequel, we will see him again. The art direction and special effects are also a strength, and the money they spent on those aspects were well spent. But, like so many popcorn films if they had just delivered on a stronger script, this film could have been something special.
""Aquaman"" is not the strongest film of its genre, even though it really tries. It has a great actor to build a solid series around if they can just come up with a better script instead of going with old, tired plots and ideals. I would suggest they make it simple & subtle, not loud & predictable. I had a good enough time to recommend this film for a matinee, but you may find yourself rolling your eyes from time to time. No Raj, Aquaman doesn't suck, but his writers do.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Injects some much needed magic to these types of films,"I wholly expected to be rolling my eyes throughout this film, because I'm no fun of superhero fantasy. But that didn't happen, despite it being over 2 hours long. (well maybe I rolled my eyes a bit somewhere in the last 10mins after the 'final' sibling battle)Superhero movies should be all about bringing a certain magic to the screen, a spectacle that you can marvel at and simply switch off and enjoy. And Aquaman does exactly that. Plenty of beautiful locations, lots of action/fighting, some awesome effects (especially all the under-water stuff) and a nice mix of Superman and Indiana Jones type adventure.
The kind of movie I could watch with my kid one day (when he's old enough) that will give him that sense of wonder and magic that some older movies from my childhood did for me.I also think they did some justice to the whole Atlantis mythology here. Great stuff.
And having 'good guy' Patrick Wilson play the villain to good guy Willem Dafoe? A welcome and interesting choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's extremely colorful too, but not in a bad way. Gotta say, the costumes were really something else. You'd think an orange bodysuit would be bad, but it's honestly pretty good.

The best DCEU movie so far!,"Yes I truly mean it. Aquaman is not just the best DCEU film but also the best origin story or solo film in both the Marvel and DCEU universe.I last thoroughly enjoyed myself in a DCEU film when I watched Wonder Woman's ""no man's land"" scene. But in this film one can't seem to pick any specific action sequence that is so brilliantly crafted that it stands out, infact each action sequence is as brilliant as the previous one. The camera movements and lighting effects especially for under water scenes were stupifying i.e. cinematography on the whole was breathtaking.The third act of this DCEU film was a jaw dropping climax. The last time I experienced utter silence was during the third act of Avengers Infinity War. This time the theatre was filled with mind-numbing silence creeping upon every unsuspecting viewer slowly but surely making them move to the edge of their seats due to the burdening weights of anticipation, nervousness and excitement. The film ended with astonishment on people's faces and a huge round of applause.The visual effects were a treat for the eye, mesmerizing and charismatic. Being an aspiring animator myself, I could notice and appreciate the efforts taken in animating the Atlantians, making them float, swim as if they are fishes and not humans and make it all feel realistic. From the mosaic underwater architectures, the finely detailed character costumes, the enchanting visuals, to captivating and horrifying monsters and unforgettable marvelous action sequences, this film offers everything we need and more.Surely it does have the feels of Thor Ragnarok, Star Wars, Avatar and Game of Thrones - All packaged in one. One may think that the story is predictable. But then get ready, for James wann is about to turn your ship sailing event into a voyage far exceeding beyond your expectations.Personally I believe James Wann for the DCEU is propitious and I wish he directs Man of Steel 2 or even more DC films. Aquaman is tenacious, invigorating and a must see film for not only all DC fans but for anyone looking for a good movie for the weekends. Watch it in IMAX 3D on the biggest screen possible and feel the imersive experience of an underwater adventure. In the end it will be worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

WOW!!!!!,"Ok I saw this a month ago at a pre screening and it just blow my mind. The plot is simply enough but it's the way James Wan makes you care for the Atlanteans and ofcourse Ocean Master, brilliantly but if a little camply played by Payrick Wilson and more importantly how we the surface dwellers have poisoned the oceans with plastic materials and maybe deserve some form of retribution. My concern originally was the acting ability of Amber Heard and Jason Momoah but for me Wan gets two great performances from his leads, especially to my delight, Jason Momoah and the supporting cast are simply stellar. Black Manta is next level dope and the action, film choregraphy and fighting scenes are some of the best witnessed on the big screen. The music score has epic moments but also can have some strange choices at time but overall the score was great. The last act is worth the admission alone and I dare anyway to come out of this movie not being in simple awe at what they witnessed and beautiful the World of Atlantis is.
For the record I'm not a DC or MCU fan but I am now a James Wan fan, can't wait to go see it again on Wednesday this time in 3D Imax!Ps stay for the midcredit scene and please, please, somebody give James Wan the Keys to the DCEU universe",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolute mess,"So now that the movie is finally out on the internet, we'll start to see some real reviews that aren't written by the staff.The casting of the actors are absolutely horrible. It's a pod of second rate b-list celebrities that are phoning in their performances in front of a green screen. There has to be bigger fish in the sea than the mess they managed to bait for this deep water grave.The music is absolutely horrendous. I think somebody got the wrong fish on the hook. They hired Rupert Gregson-Williams, brother of the respected composer Harry Gregson-Williams. And it's apparent. The music switches between Jarre inspired synthesizer and stupid little guitar motifs that feels more at home in a 1990's Zimmer soundtrack.
There is no originality in this wreck whatsoever and all you get are the leftover chum and clich√©s from other composers and movies. It's insultingly amateurish.The whole movie follows that pattern. And I'm not surprised. this movie has 5 writers, 1 director and over 10 producers. it lacks a strong captain.
At no point does it feel like a coherent story. It's more like 3-4 different scripts was shoot 3-4 times by 3-4 different people, and then they pasted together the ""best"" parts. When ever the story tries to float it sinks like an anchor.This movie is an absolute assault on taste and intelligence. It's mindbogglingly bad.

An impressive feat for a movie that seemed impossible to make!,"Who ever thought Aquaman would get a movie? Or Guardians of the Galaxy or most of the other super hero movies we've gotten. Jason Mamoa is a big presence, but not the best actor, so DC surrounded him with great actors. This is a super cast, and a pretty good story, though it's pretty much what I expected, and a lot more stuffed in, just in case they don't get another chance. I think they will get to do another, but it's going to be hard because we've seen so much in this movie. This movie is fun, and well done, and also clearly a James Wan movie-for those Fast and the Furious watchers, there is a scene ripped right out of Fast Five. The main flaw, and it's hard to fault an underwater movie, is the overuse of CG effects. This is a problem with all DC movies, especially in the third act, and this one overly so. Marvel does CG too, but don't rely on it as much. But it's hard to help it, as I said, with so much under the sea. A lot of it looked great (hair flowing around, some of the huge explosions) Now that I've seen this movie competently done, I can't imagine what can't be done in movies, in the right hands.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Aquaman was quite a thrilling DC superhero movie!,"I first knew of Aquaman as a kid of the '70s when watching him in the animated series ""Superfriends"" when he was teamed with his more-established mates of Superman, Wonder Woman, and the team of Batman & Robin. There, he was clean shaven and had blond hair. He was also bland as were the other heroes considering they were on Saturday morning which were mostly kid shows at the time. Here, he has a beard and has much darker hair. He also has something of an attitude which is refreshing to see! But he's very much the good guy and he has many great adventures here. Jason Momoa is aces in the role and it's also nice seeing that guy who was Green Goblin in the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man film (Willem Dafoe) play someone more sympathetic here.

A GOOD MOVIE. A CHRISTMAS GIFT üéÅ,"This is my first time giving a review.This movie has all the elements that you need for a superhero film which is a perfect balance. It has sentiments, humor, fun and serious. Aquaman should be watched in theatre for great experience. First of all James Wan is ""The Man"". He had taken the risk and courage to bring this superhero to life. Aqua man was the least appreciated superhero before. But now it has changed. Wan did the magic making the character lovable like how Robert Downey Jr. made us like Iron Man.Now to the main part
The script is simple. It doesn't mean it is bad. It is simply good. With this simple script, Wan had delivered an extraordinary way of storytelling which is enganging and makes us glued to the seat till the very end. The narration, the vfx and whole are in the next level. We don't feel any lag as the story is taking us to an whole new adventure.
The actors did their part very well. Especially Mamoa and Heard. Patrick Wilson and Yahya did their job well. No words to explain how good they are.The chemistry between Amber and Jason is very well executed. I didn't feel the jokes were forced. Even if it is, it doesn't matter much.As I said the movie has the perfect balance in emotion, love, action, adventure, humor and serious. This movie won't be a let down for anyone who had watched or who is planning to watch it thanks to James Wan.""Praises to the whole casts, vfx team and one and only JAMES WAN for giving us the wonderful ride.""And to those who are degrading the movie.
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself for degrading a movie which is good in every way.To the people who are reading this.

I was thinking that that scene could have been a little faster. Also Black Manta was barely in the movie at all. I wish he could have been in more of the movie.

"Not bad, DC. Not bad.","The DCEU, or Worlds of DC as they are now calling it, have released another standalone movie, this time with the character of Aquaman. Now, DC has been pretty good with their standalone films; the only films that I have major problems with are Batman V Superman, Suicide Squad, and Justice League. Justice League wasn't even that bad of a movie. It just felt rushed. One of the best parts about that movie was the character of Aquaman, a character that everyone thought of as weak and stupid before that movie was released. What Justice League did, however, was turn Aquaman into badass, so I was really excited to see how they would expand on his story in his standalone film. Luckily, he is still a badass.
Aquaman is not the best film in the DCEU, but it is definitely not the worst. I don't think this is James Wan's best work, either. However, I still think that is is a very enjoyable movie with a lot of stuff to love. It's weird to think that this movie belongs to the same universe as Batman V Superman, Man of Steel, and the like. It's so much brighter; so much more colorful. It is beautiful to look at. All of the CGI, makeup effects, and costumes look amazing. It is the most colorful film in the DCEU by far.
Aquaman is an awesome character, and Jason Momoa brings a lot of character and comedy to him. Mera was a very likable partner for Aquaman to have, and she also knew how to kick butt. Willem Defoe's character Vulko was fine; nothing great about him, but also nothing bad. The villains were actually quite good, and you could really reason with almost everything they were doing. Orm, played by Patrick Wilson, bounced off of Aquaman very well. The seriousness of Orm and the goofiness of Aquaman meshed together very well. Black Manta was a fun villain, too. I liked every scene he was in, and his on-screen suit didn't look half bad. I just feel that for being Aquaman's most iconic foe, he wasn't in the movie enough.
Now, this movie had some very cringy dialogue that took me out of the movie at times. There were also some shots in the film that made it seem like the movie was trying to be too mainstream. At one point in the film, Aquaman and Mera walk out of the ocean onto a beach in slow motion, like something you'd see during a swimsuit ad. While this is happening, a horrible - and I mean HORRIBLE - cover of Africa by Toto, being performed by Pitbull, was playing in the background. It was such a ridiculous shot, and it took me out of the movie. The film also had a lot going on, and I feel with a little more cutting, it could have been shortened without ruining the plot.
Overall, I think this is a very entertaining movie. It adds a lot more color and character to the DCEU, which is something it much needed. It's not better than Wonder Woman, but it definitely is better and more well put together than the other films in the DCEU. I'm excited to see where they go next with the character. If you are skeptical about seeing this movie, just give it a try. It's very entertaining, whether you like the DC films or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ultra-Bad casting and acting,"I watched the film with an open mind and was honestly just disappointed with the film in general. Amber Heard was terri-bad.

"Entertaining, engaging and certainly extravagant.","Story doesn't take precedence in this world any longer. Gone are the days of DARK epics and COMPLEX anti-heroes that fall over their own motives. The DCEU has realised it's better off trying not to emulate Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy and Aquaman strikes a much finer balance because of it. As far as origin stories go (if you can call it one after Jason Momoa's equally strong performance in Justice League), it's much larger than the usual efforts that aim more precisely to establish rather than finish anything. Instead, Aquaman has loftier ambitions and though the pace can border on unrelenting at times, it's forgivable given how big this world is and how thoroughly the filmmakers immersed themselves in it. There's enjoyment to be found in simply being along for the ride, even if most of it was clearly computer generated. Aquaman knows that we aren't going to take everything it gives us with the utmost seriousness and it's refreshing that the film doesn't try to play its sillier moments with a straight face. It's definitely a fine instalment into the ever-growing panoply of superhero movies and absolutely worth watching on a Friday evening with handful after handful of popcorn.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a visually rich magnum opus (DCEU at its best),"Being a DC fan, it was tough to see the way DCEU was going. It had ups with Man of Steel and wonder woman, and it's low with Suciede squad.
But The king of Atlantis stands apart from all the other DCEU movies to be one of the best DC movies ever made. Visually rich, with a great cinematographic experience and Vision of James Wan, Aquaman is a rebirth of DCEU.
Scenes are spectacular, Acting is at its top with this movie. Jason momoa as Aquaman was perfect in every sense, so as patrick wilson, Amber heard and Nicole kidman.
But the reason of success of movie is a wan himself. Wan's vision to show the world with a vibrant color is noteworthy and to be very frank, deserves a nomination at most of the awards show.
Altogether, VFX makes it so rich and exprerience in 3D makes the deep ocean and action sequence much more vibrant and rich.
World of DC is much more imaginative than MCU and tough to represent. To show the hope of superman, justice of wonder woman, darkness of Batman, speed of flash and brilliance of cyborg, Aquaman gave a base on which Epic mega-structure of DC is possible to be made.

A step in the right direction for the DCEU.,"James Wan, a director-producer mostly known for his immensely popular horror films, shifts genre gears once again to take on one of DC's most iconic heroes. Having made his first appearance in last year's Justice League, Aquaman (Momoa) returns in his first stand-alone adventure that is both ridiculously corny yet ludicrously enjoyable. Aquaman, A.K.A Arthur Curry (half Atlantean-half human) is the rightful heir to the throne of Atlantis, and is reluctant to leave his human life behind in order to face up to his true destiny. With the help of warrior Mera (Heard) and Atlantis counsellor Nuidis Vulko (Dafoe), Arthur must fight to overthrow his malevolent half-brother Orm Marius (Patrick Wilson, a frequent collaborator with Wan), who is preparing to wage a cataclysmic war with the surface world.The DCEU, in a nutshell, is a complete misfire of a cinematic universe. Although Wonder Woman (2017) showed great promise for the franchise, even the most hardcore fans can't ignore the disaster that was Suicide Squad (2016) or the total mess that was Batman V Superman (2016). With Aquaman, James Wan makes the most of a clich√© ridden script and delivers a surprisingly fun film. Momoa leads the film with great charisma; his performance holds the film together entirely, and it is clear he's having an absolute blast in the role. Patrick Wilson was a fitting choice for Orm; he's menacing when required, yet his performance at times is corny beyond belief. Both Heard and Dafoe were also excellent casting choices, although their characters aren't as developed as they could have been. It is the action sequences that work best in the film. In previous DCEU films, the action sequences have ranged from excessively dull to criminally forgettable (with the exception of the terrific No Man's Land sequence from Wonder Woman), but Wan crafts sequences that are thrilling in execution and epic in scope. A fight sequence with side villain Black Manta (who makes an appearance more in the name of fan service rather than plot) is particularly awesome, and the final conflict may be an overload of CGI, but it's certainly epic and absurdly entertaining.Aquaman is definitely one of the stronger entries of the DCEU. It's cheesy for sure, and the writing is clunky in parts, but with Momoa's excellent screen presence and Wan at the helm, Aquaman manages to pull off all its absurdity. If the DCEU continues in this direction, it could finally live up to its full potential and even rival the MCU.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good chemistry between Jason Momoa and Amber Heard,"""Aquaman"" is an exhilarating cinematic experience that successfully brings the underwater world of Atlantis to life. The film's stunning visuals, intricate world-building, and Jason Momoa's charismatic performance as Arthur Curry contribute to its undeniable appeal. Amber Heard's portrayal of Mera adds depth to the character, combining strength and grace seamlessly. Heard's on-screen chemistry with Momoa enhances the overall dynamic of the film, creating a captivating and believable connection between their characters.

'Aquaman' has a different theme!,"It is almost kind of a new scenario, under water! There are many movies that themed underwater but not with a massive empire at the bottom of the sea. Many viewers are hating this movie based on their personal opinions like bad story, few superstars, Jason Momoa's bad acting, slow SFX etc. It is true that just like tipical Marvel or DC movies, the count of superstars are very less in this movie and that didn't made this movie bad in my view.
Jason Momoa is a big guy, and his size perfectly fitting with his character. But he couldn't 100% blend with that character in terms of acting, some tweaks are required.
About the movie, I like the underwater empire. It supposed to be huge and massive. But throughout the movie play, we won't get a feel like that. That is the main flaw of the movie. More of a budget empire üòÖ I think. I enjoyed to watch the water creatures that the soldiers are used to ride. The Trench Monsters, Sea Dragons, Battle Lobsters, Tylosaurus. Especially the Karathen, wow! That gigantic creature is almost a nightmare. The director had every possible chance to make this movie great but the limitation of time and may be budget made the move average I guess!
One of the things I more like about this movie is less cracking jokes and more of a serious attitude of all characters throughout the movie, mainly the main actors. In the Thor movie sequels, we can see, the first movie is the best of all. Thor the son of Odin, is really mighty! His talking, attire, actions are exactly resembles a true son of god. But after that movie, every characters are making things less important and making jokes. Thor and Loki didn't seem that concentrated on their respective characters behaviour. This is happening with all the superhero movies nowadays. Cracking jokes irrespective or their characters. Especially in fantasy and mythological movies. But Aquaman is better than that. All the actors are serious in their corresponding roles.
I had great expectation on the coronation at end for new king, but nothing was there. Another flaw in my view. I am not going to be a complete critic about this movie. To be honest, it is better than Spiderman movies (not the old ones), some Avengers and DC movies with too much hype.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Insane popcorn movie.,"This movie has a bit of everything. From the little mermaid, visual influences of blade runner, mixed with fantasy epic, plus the adventure of Indiana jones.

It's a strange movie, but it's fun, the visual effects do not always work, but when they work they are a spectacle. It is a pure escapist and meta-surrealist film, which does not make the mistake of taking itself too seriously.
For those looking to see a fun movie, Aquaman does not disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Lighter, Better","As a box office success this entry for DC has almost made as much as Justice League in a week.Aimed at a much younger demographic then the dark Batman V Superman films this movie is light, comedic and sometimes quite corny. What a DC movie should be. Aquaman was my favourite character in DC and he's done justice in this version.However, it works and it is entertaining. A stellar cast including Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson do a great job with the source material. Jason Momoa is solid as the title character but far different to the Aquaman I remember as a kid back in the 80s. Amber Heard plays a pivotal role as the Princess and holds the movie together. Looks a lot like Scarlett Johansson.Directed by James Wan who specialises in horror films the styling of this films was my major concern based on it being mostly underwater but it's done well and after a while you get used to the visual aspects of the movie. Whilst watching I felt aspects of movies like TRON, Guardians of the Galaxy and Flash Gordon!As usual with superhero films the running time at 140 minutes is probably 25 minutes too long.6.9/10Couldn't quite give it 7 but good option at the cinema with the family ( probably not small children). There's quite a body count in a cartoon kind of way.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Can I get my 2 hours back?,"I'm also confused about there these reviews came from. Cliche, predictable, poor acting, forced love interest between characters and terrible music.

A True Underwater pleasure,"So the best Aqua-version doesn't come from James Cameron and Vinnie Chase anymore but from James Wan and Jason Mamoa.Mamoa is Arthur, the son of a love affair between a human and the fish queen of Atlantis. A grown-up Arthur wants nothing to do with his mother's kingdom but is called upon to stop his half-brother from starting a war with the surface world.And Mamoa's got this, turning what is a silly looking character into a true Son of Anarchy. He checks off all the boxes, the physique, the brood, the macho rough-necking, and the funny.Really the whole cast is excellent here. He's got good chemistry with Amber Heard, who trades comic barbs and personal lessons with him, and fights well, but will be remembered most for this.Willem Dafoe shows up sporting a man bun as Arthur's former mentor, Nicole Kidman plays Arthur's mom.Patrick Wilson plays the half-brother, he does a fine job, but runs into the problem that usually plagues Marvel villains of having nothing to do after a while.I much preferred Manta, a villain with a legit reason for wanting revenge on Arthur.Most of these fish people talk perfectly underwater, which is silly, but the way they're able to see underwater is a gorgeous effect that rivals Avatar.Really everything from the action sequences, sets, costumes is a fantastical visual. Is it going for realism? Well at one point we see an octopus playing bongo drums so you tell me.Point is- it's pretty zany mix of things you might see in a Thor film and Pixar film and it's fun.Much of this focuses on a magical trident and fish people angry over pollution. Do we care? To a point. 2 hours and 20 minutes of this is a little much though and there should have been more of an effort to curb that.Overall this is fun, thrilling, and a visual pleasure with a real star turn from Mamoa.

A fun superhero movie,"Something DC does better than marvel is fight scenes, the fights are shot well and it's easy to tell what's going on. Aquaman has a different tone than other dc movies before it, it is more light hearted as can be told by the brigh colors in the film. The film's color grading is not dark and gloomy like Man of Steel and BvS, the film takes it self less seriously and it benefits from it, Aquaman isn't the type of character to be the lead for a dark and gritty movie. Aquaman does follow a lot of superhero movie stereo types such as losing his first fight with the main villian and having his main weapon destroyed and having to go on a journey to find a better one and then defeat the main villian the second time, but I'd Arthur losing his first battle then winning the second battle is justifiable. Arthur fights Orm and loses under water in the first battle because Orm is a trained Atlantian super soldier and the movie shows us that Arthur is good at fighting regular people on land. Arthur then fights Orm out of the water in the second battle and obviously wins.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

wonderful special effect,"The special effects and soundtrack are great (pretend to be a professional film critic, haha). The plot of the movie looks very cool. After changing the dark style that DC has always been before, some relaxed and humorous fragments stimulate the underwater fighting. The ending song is nice and worth watching.

Is this the start to the Rise of DC,"I liked Aquamam it was big,colorful, fun and overall an enjoyable DC superhero movie however it did have some significant flaws.I can say that Aquamam was DC's most ambitious movie to date and they nailed most.The first act of the movie is pretty solid you get some backstory on Author Curry, some nice foundation for the plot and interesting interactions between Aquamam and the villain Black Manta earlier on which the movie does a good job of making you understand his motivations for hating Aquamam and wanting to kill him and Makes Aquamam reconsider some of his actions regarding Black Manta which was some nice writing.The second act of the movie was surprisingly the weakest just when the story was about to kick into gear the movie gets goofy I mean characters like Mera and Aquaman become cartoony and silly as the movie's attempts to make you laugh becomes forced and awkward I mean there is literally toilet humor in this movie.It looked like two different people were directing the movie compared to the first half of the movie. Even characters like Black Manta became campy with him saying some weird dialogue. I wouldn't say the second act is terrible but compared to the first act of the movie it's just not as good.Luckily the movie comes into focus in the last third of the movie with some very good action, compelling story and surprisingly great CGI throughout the movie and some of the best I've seen in a long while.The best characters in the movie were undoubtedly Aquaman and Mera. Jason Mamoa and Amber Heard had nice chemistry with each other even in the goofy scenes, Aquaman's journey to becoming King was well done as the movie made you understand why he reluctant to be King and how Aquaman's character grew throughout the movie especially with the help of Mera who also has a good mini arc in the movie and she had some badass scenes in the movie and again her best moments was with Aquaman as they went well together.The villain Ocean Master played by Patrick Wilson was bland, I mean they could have done much more with him but as the movie went on he became just another generic bad guy. Earlier in the movie he had some decent reasons for wanting to have War with the surface and had some good interactions between him and Aquaman since their brothers but you never got to see more of that. Patrick Wilson's performance wasn't even bad it was actually decent but the story involving him didn't have anything significant to do besides being evil because he is a bad guy.Like I said earlier the visuals were incredible and very colorful especially with the scenes under water and the sea creatures i never knew James Wan was capable of directing a movie with such incredible visuals and great CGI so one thing you could say about Aquaman is that it was truly a spectacle at times. Atlantis and other sea kingdoms looked pretty good and contributed to the story well however sometimes these under water kingdoms like Atlantis felt empty at times I mean it looked interesting but you never got to see more of it besides action scenes and water battles which was kind of disappointing.The action was also very good again the visuals helped make the action good at times especially the final battle it wasn't the best thing ever but it was very nice.The story is pretty solid and Aquaman's journey is interesting as he deals with responsibilities he doesn't want to have but he grows over time into a hero and despite being campy at times the movie has some pretty funny scenes so that's another plus.So I enjoyed Aquaman it's DC best movie since Wonder Woman not as great but still a pretty good movie with a solid story, great CGI and visuals and characters despite a bland villain and silly second act. Hope this continues for DC movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

BOTH OF MY PARENTS CRIED,"I read a lot of comics and this is a very accurate live action depiction of Aquaman mythos. The film features the two antagonists just enough to do them justice and pays it off nicely to end the movie. Relationships are established that made the film full of heart and respect for the original material. A lot of reviewers talk of abrupt scene progression, but in my opinion it was an element that added to my interest in the plot. In retrospect, I think they complain about Aquaman stories as a whole and that is an unfair scale to grade the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Avatar, but Underwater","With Jason Momoa as Aquaman himself and Amber Heard casted as the beautiful Mera, you already know it's going to be a good looking movie. Knowing that James Wan is more of a horror producer than an action movie director, he did a good job tackling this installment. Bringing in Patrick Wilson as Kind Orm was a good tribute to having him be familiar within Wan's work. In general, the movie was great action packed adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the idea of Atlantis and how the characters looked underwater as well as their relationships with the different characters to see how they played within the story line. However, the CGI has been getting slightly more noticeable within the last couple movies that I have seen. Some of the stunts preformed in this movie that should have either injured the character or end up in a fatality, to return a few scene later didn't feel authentic. If you have seen Avatar, directed by James Cameron there is no doubt to where Wan got his inspiration from. Aquaman's Atlantis has the same feel as if you were in the land of Pandora, but just underwater. All in all, a great addition to the DC universe and can't wait to see what comes next.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun generic blockbuster,"For a decent while now the DCEU has been subject to controversy with the only movie being loved by both fans and critics to be Wonder Woman. Beyond that each film has had some sort of issue in the filming process before its initial release. Rather that be Suicide Squad with all of the Joker scenes being cut or Justice League with its infamous Superman mustache issue. All of these factors and more led to these films getting poor reception from critics and a few fans. So going into Aquaman there were many who were very skeptical.However with James Wan at the helm I had little worry. The man was known for making films that were commercially viable. The Conjuring 2 film made 320 million dollars on a 40 million dollar budget. Saw made 103 million on a meager 1.2 million dollar budget, and Furious 7 made over a billion dollars on its big budget 200 million dollar production cost. So there was little doubt that the film would do well. As far as quality Wan usually churns out quality work. His Saw series is beloved by many fans, his Conjuring work had been exceptional, and Insidious while not as beloved as Saw is also its own franchise. So I was pretty optimistic on him taking on the visual spectacle that was ""Man who can talk to fish: The Movie.""In regards to visual effects the movie isn't all that spectacular. There were areas that I found to be very clunky. Mera from a purely special effects standpoint never looked real, there were a lot of water effects that looked fake. The designs of the home where Aquaman lived were nice looking, but still needed a bit more rendering to be done. The fight scenes I will admit are pretty bad ass. Every fight seemed to find a way to surprise me. The ones underwater seemed to impress me the most with their visual flares.Jason Momoa also bolstered a lot of confidence and charisma in the role. His flirtatious attitude with Mera and his audacious approach to to his brother always put a smile on my face. He was defiantly perfectly cast in the role of a superhero.Additionally the film tends to be very funny. It always knew how to make you feel good when you watched. There was a lot of great chemistry between Aquaman and other character that allowed for some really enjoyable sequence that made me grin from ear to ear. It was just a good, upbeat, and fun experience at the movies.But my favorite aspect of the film was Black Manta. He was a marvelous villain. From start to finish he always kept me interested in the pain he was feeling at the loss of his father and how Aquaman chose not to save him. This anger fuels the antagonist and pushes him to vengeance. This desire makes the audience feel sympathetic to his plight and his desire for revenge.King Orm wasn't nearly as compelling, but I did like his character. He was more your standard bad guy who wanted to become king for his own selfish reasons and hated the people on the surface. There is a part of me that wishes this was two movies instead of just one. Perhaps then King Orm would be a little bit more three dimensional than he turned out to be.I really loved Aquaman and Mera's relationship. It was really sweet and funny. Jason played it more in the tone of him seeing her as a sexy catch and she was the sassy redhead who wanted him just as badly, and when looking at it through those eyes then they really work well for each other.Overall though there isn't really anything surprising here. It pretty standard superhero stuff. There a big awesome fight at the end of the movie that was cool to see. Mera and Aquaman have a overly dramatic kiss, and the movie ends with Aquaman giving a hopeful monologue to the future. So it was good.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Cheesy, terrible and fun!","I don't know if it's the movie or maybe it's the mood I'm in but sometimes I watch a really bad movie and I still have a lot of fun. This is one of those times.I'll start with the cons:
The CGI/special effects/costumes are REALLY bad! Some reviewers mentioned that they look like the Power Rangers and I agree, they really do. I also think there should be some physical differences between underwater people and regular people. They didn't have any fins or scales or anything like that. The only thing that was different was their wardrobe which, as mentioned, was really bad!The script also needed a lot more work in my honest opinion. I wish they'd put more emphasis on the way the two brothers were raised and their claim to the throne instead of on all those stupid wars and fights.On the plus side, the actors did a great job! I really like Jason Momoa! Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard and Willem Dafoe also did a great job. There's a lot of action and fun moments in the movie so if you're in a mood to see a fun cheesy superhero action movie, go for it.

First, yes, there are a lot of spectacular visual shots, but too many wide shots with too many little details that take away from the main protagonists, and after a while, they become stale. Second, the story is weak, the last fight is completely anti-climatic, essentially to win a fight in Atlanta, you need to get the better weapon to break the ones your opponent has. Third, the actings are subpar, Momoa and Heard cannot deliver more subtle emotions like Gadot and Pine, and Dafoe and Kidman are underused, the only memorable one is Abdul-Mateen's Black Manta (or just Manta). It's a fun ride, but nothing more. However, Wan's camera work is really next level.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great adventure,"Aquaman works because it is absolutely insane. A tale of underwater kingdoms at war with top tier melodrama and an Indiana Jones style treasure hunt in the second act for good measure. It's achingly sincere, unashamedly silly and visually exciting in a way this genre is supposed to be but frequently prevents itself from being.Jason Momoa makes the role of Aquaman his own, even managing to pull off the classic outfit. Completely reinventing it to fit his lovable personality and it's all the better for it. Amber Heard makes for a great co-lead and her chemistry with Momoa is definitely at its strongest when leaning into the comedic rapport rather than any romantic connection.The villains aren't as strong whilst still serving their purpose well enough. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is introduced well enough and given ample motivation to be a worthy rival; however the film doesn't really know what to do with him. Patrick Wilson fairs a little better with a commanding presence and more than enough shouting.James Wan's direction stays true to himself within the franchise studio system yet again. The camera rarely stays still in the action, delivering some trademark oners (or Waners) and his horror sensibilities get to make a brief appearance. The CG struggles to convey that everyone is underwater but for the most part it's really impressive with Atlantis itself being a vibrant highlight.Rupert Gregson-Williams really leans into the melodrama for his score. It's very varied with synth flourishes, a bit of generic rock and roll and that glorious melodrama, which kind of holds the whole thing together. On the other end, the soundtrack just dials up the insanity with a random collection of songs that always come out of nowhere.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Visually striking, but not a good script","Sigh. Another swing and a miss for DC.It was the weirdest experience. The movie started out so well. For literally the first 45-60 minutes, I was really enjoying myself. Then things got a little silly... then more silly... then more silly... then downright ridiculous. I realize this is a comic book movie, but still. Maybe Marvel has set my standards too high.It's not like the movie is a complete disaster. The world building and production design are downright amazing. This has got to be one of the most visually striking films I've ever seen, and that's saying something in today's day and age.The problem is the script. The premise is great: Arthur must find the magic trident to become king of Atlantis and save the world. Classic comic book/architypal awesomeness. Where things get bad is in the execution. Bad dialogue. Bad acting. Over-the-top and unnecessary additions to the plot. Jokes that don't work... at all.I kind of felt like the pendulum has swung too far the other way for DC right now. Man Of Steel and Batman Vs Superman were criticised for being too dark and moody. This one is too silly and childish. Poor DC just can't seem to get the formula right.This film had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it wasn't realized.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But, except the effort of Momoa to sustain in honorable way his character, nothing new. Sure, it is a simple, dynamic, cool film for fans and young public. And it works. But the too familiar ""it could be better"" remains present at the end. Not exactly as accusation, but as a form of nostalgia about old fashion fantasy - action films. Sure, it is heroic and propose a high noble, powerful hero. But something is missing. What ? Maybe, in essence, the answer has no significance.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

This could have been a really great movie if they focused on developing the characters instead of throwing everything including the kitchen sink at it. The movie was about 30 mins too long. It was really uncomfortable to watch and sit through and I was ready to leave the theaters 30 min into it which is only something I have done once before. I don't know why other people gave it a 10.

Visually stunning step in the right direction for DC,"Aquaman sets itself aside from the rest of the DC films by being what in my opinion is the best the franchise had to offer so far. Comparisons are bound to be made with the franchise's other arguable hit, Wonder Woman. Personally I think Aquaman beats Wonder Woman in that it had a final act that had a battle that was so visually appealing and interesting to look at that it absolutely blows Wonder Woman's failure of a third act out of the water.Which really is the story of Aquaman's success, it is a film that is wonderful to look at, the visual aspect of this film is that of a completely new level, with underwater shots and CGI that is groundbreaking and something that audiences have never seen before. The film had an interesting villain in Ocean mater, his motivations were well justified as the best villains should.Both Jason Momoa and Amber Heard were brilliant as Arthur and Mera as director James Wan excellently blends the actor's own traits into the characters. Utilizing Momoa's culture in the form of war cries and tribal tattoos to establish this new and modernized version of Aquaman.Aquaman is bound to wow audiences, while it's not the most interesting story wise it definitely sets itself apart as a fun and thrilling explosion of colours and visuals.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Finally a Decent DCEU Movie After WW!,"I always thought that the problem with DCEU was the over-handling from the WB executives and the conflict with the DCEU mastermind himself. But today James Wan came with a fresh new strategy, bringing a whole new experience of DCEU, the one we all deserve.
Since WW, I can say that this movie is the hope sprouting for us fans for all the upcoming DCEU movies. Sure it's not that great, there are still many rough scenes. BUT, there are exactly nothing I can complaint. This only makes me expect many great things from DCEU.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dreadful,"Worst film I've seen in a long while. Boring, poor plot, terrible acting. I can't believe people are giving this a 10/10! I actually left the cinema early as I had no interest in how it ended (probably with Aquaman beating evil and getting the girl - just a guess)",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Are you that Fish-Boy?,"I wasn't a great fan back in the sixties. Not like I was for the rest of DC pantheon. The TV cartoon was part of the Superman Hour (with that guitar dahh-ranggg! sound effect). On the Big Bang Theory, poor Raj was left being Aquaman because everyone else had their hero choice first. The character was a real #luser when it came to popularity. Then came Justice League.""I hear you can talk to fish.""Everything changed. HOLEY UNDERWEAR! It turns out that Aquaman is a BAD ASS!This movie delivers on all points. Aquaman is human, not just some strange Prince Namor Submariner. He likes drinking beer, partying with tough guys, getting tattoos and hangs with his dad. He cracks wise while he cracks heads. He's intensely loyal. And he's very powerful.Visually, it's brilliant with incredible action scenes. Patrick Wilson plays an arrogant leader who rules the Kingdom of Atlantis and has a plan to unite the Undersea against the surface dwellers. Amber Heard is the beautiful daughter of an allied Kingdom. Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman play Arthur Curry's parents. Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren round out a name cast lead by Jason Momoa. And yes, CGI is used. And the CGI is extremely effective. It gives a dreamlike appearance to underwater sequences which would be impossible to do as practical effects.The story is top notch: it follows a path that at times makes effective use of flashbacks while advancing the plot. It's very satisfying and concludes heroically. Yes, it's a fairy tale ending, but what did you expect? IT'S A COMIC BOOK-SUPERHERO MOVIE!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"6,5 to be accurate","I did enjoy the movie actually , i didn't get bored at all, but the plot was like watching a kids movie, nothing suprised you and the cgi was not good actually, also some scenes (not many don't worry) didn't have an actual reason to be there,i really couldn't care less about the plot in those scenes, ANYWAY you people should watch it, it's enjoyable but not a masterpiece or something",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I really hope DC makes a Sequel, these characters deserve it.","A movie where Nicole Kidman is a badass Atlantian Queen, Jason Momoa is a badass rightful Atlantian King, and Amber Heard is a badass Xebellian Princess.oh, and it's directed by James Wan.Aquaman is a fun undersea romp of a movie. Nothing groundbreaking here but a solid addition to the DC universe. As a fan of Wonder Woman and Man of Steel, this is my third favorite movie of the franchise so far.The writing is lacking and this movie definitely is a paint by the numbers superhero movie, but I really enjoyed the ride. The visual effects, the music, and the acting are all top notch.It is not a full set up of him becoming Aquaman but it is a setup of him becoming King. I really love Jason Momoa in this role, and I hope we get to see more of him playing this character in the future.A nice enjoyable movie to ride out the new year, worth seeing for a good time on a holiday afternoon.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
DC really owed it to James Wan,"I honestly thought dc movies are beyond cured after all their disasters movies..

Well, this and Watchmen and Nolan's Batman of course.All the scenes are beautifully made, CGI are excellent.

Best film to end the year with,"Thrill ride to the extreme! Never a dull moment as it moves quickly and without long winded character expositions that have dragged down previous DC films. The underwater visuals are the gold standard here, much like Avatar did eons ago, and the action is just as breathtaking. Most of the dialogue was uninspired hero encouragement (like lesser ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and without the same emotional weight). There are a few questionable scenes/concepts that may cause some brain cells to drown themselves.My main complaint is the audio mixing, primarily with the dialogue being way too low compared to the bgm most of the time. Compounding this, they add an echo-like effect for underwater scenes, which sounds like an immersive idea but only makes the words less clear and not easily understandable.But if you see one last film this year, you can't go wrong with this.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Honestly, it wasn't THAT bad","Some of these reviews are rated ridiculously low, while others may be overrating it a bit.

It had its cheesy/cringey moments and it had its really great moments.

The Most Spectacular Movie of 2018,"Finally, DCEU has back again on th stage by creating Aquaman movie and directed by James Wan. I never doubt to watch this movie, It was out of my expectation, It was the most spectacular movie, The most an epic movie, and the badass. Each character has strong character to play a role, the emotional played a long when watching this movie. Jason Momoa is matched with Aquaman character, Amber head as Mera was so adorable, The Black Manta waa damn, so good. The visual of this movie was great. Full of colour like we're living in another world, world of the sea. The story line, all was perfect. Perfectly complete my expectation even more. To be honest, I will watch this movie again, again, again, and again.

Could have been great but for one horrid performance...,"The Special FX are pretty spectacular, Jason plays a strong Arthur. Most of the actors are pretty good.The problem is that actress playing Mera. I've seen better acting from an old Polaroid photo of a Totem Pole (I'm being generous).The Mera actress looked like she forgot her lines and was looking off screen for queue cards half the time. Showed zero chemistry with the lead and wow was that red hair ever fake looking. Like why did everyone else including Willem Dafoe and Dolph Lundgren and Nicole Kidman ALL have beautiful natural looking hair pieces and Mera's all standing around with something they found at a Halloween pop up store?When you combine that with the atrocious acting, lack of chemistry, unexplained origin story etc the film needs a reverse Snyder Cut treatment and they need to remove all of Mera's scenes and replace them with still shots of coral reef or Patrick from Sponge Bob saying her lines instead.Just my opinions.I'm probably not going to see the sequel if the casting director makes the same disappointing choices again.On the plus side, maybe someone will make a fan cut of it and remove all those wooden scenes with Mera the way they have with Jar Jar and Ewoks.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cringefest with great Visuals,"This movie looks amazing. CGI looks a little cheesy here and there, but overall... The action scenes are super clear and exciting. I like the costumes, the scenery, etc. Definitely a fun movie on first watch.Now, on to the stuff that matters... This movie would be a for sure 1-2/10 rating, without the things listed up top. The script is horrendous, and the acting is almost just as bad. Horrible casting that only makes the writing even worse. It's super predictable and has some of the most cringe moments I have ever seen in any superhero film.The music, the horrible jokes and the overdone dramatic cuts... All things that just add on top of one another to absolutely ruin this movie even more.The action makes this movie watchable. I have watched a second time, because I am a fan of the visuals.

"Sadly, it's only a 'meh' from me.","Jason Mamoa shined in his new superhero role, but the 143 min length was ridiculous, as was the wannabe comedic one-liners. The directing was fairly decent, but I was disappointed in the writing. This film couldn't decide if it wants to be silly or serious, a superhero movie or a parody of one. Unfortunately, the bloated, waterlogged film is loaded with crummy CGI, cheesy costumes, and groaner dialogue delivered by actors who are too good to traffic in such nonsense. Watching this movie is like spending two hours and 27 minutes staring at a gigantic aquarium full of digital sea creatures and actors on wires, pretending to swim. Sadly, it's a disappointment from what I expected, and only a generous 7/10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This movie is terrible,"I felt cheated paying full price to see this in the theater.The dialog was inane.
The story was predictable and formulaic.
The actions of the characters made little sense.
Massive plot holes (and is inconsistent with events of the other DC movies).
Much of the acting was stilted or 'phoned in.' (Then again, with the poor dialog they were given, perhaps they were doing the best they could.)
The action sequences were boring.
Terrible CGI.
There was no chemistry between the two main characters/love interests.
And... I was bored. I started looking at my watch less than half way through.This was a clearly movie conceived, written, and directed by a committee. It had no direction, no soul, no purpose. I honestly rank this at the bottom of DC's recent crop of movies, I would watch Batman v Superman again before I would watch this.The BEST scenes were between his parents. I would have been happy to have just watched a two hour movie with Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman's relationship.My kids loved it.

A movie im definitely going to watch again!,"I.. absolutely.. loved.. Aquaman. I've been a fan of comics and comic based movies for a long time, and a character that i found quite odd and interesting at the same time was none other than Aquaman. The way James Wan had depicted him on the big screen, is the best way possible to potray the character. Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, most importantly James Wan did WONDERS with this movie . Atlantis looks so dreamy and beautiful, the sea creatures, to be honest deserve their own movies, and everything else is just.. no words. Absolutely amazing. It'd be absolutely amazing if the next Aquaman movie had another member of the justice league, cant wait.

Too cheesy to be taken seriously,I really wanted to movie to be just as good as Wonder Woman or even on the same level. My kids went because we love superhero movies MCU and DC alike.

SOLID SUPERHERO ENTERTAINMENT,"To start with let me first confess that:A. I'm not afflicted with a childish prejudice against any superhero movie that isn't made by MarvelB. I'm not going to trash a movie just because the lead actress is involved in an ugly dispute with her ex.That being said, Aquaman is a great action movie that delivers impressive special effects, a coherent story (no planet-hopping or multiverses) and competent acting. Anyone coming to a superhero movie expecting high art and Shakesperian acting is somewhat delusional. Also, the reviews citing the scientific implausability of certain aspects of the film are laughable. When we live in a world where we easily accept boy wizards, Hobbits and spaceships that roar and make ""pew-pew-pew"" sounds it seems disingenuous to criticize a movie about an underwater kingdom. Aquaman is a movie where it is necessary to suspend disbelief - not unlike any offering by Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or Marvel.This movie is a fun spectacle with lots of entertaining visuals from giant ships being thrown ashore to armies mounted on sea creatures facing off against each other in grand battles. Jason Momoa and Amber Heard will never win any acting Oscar's, but they turn in decent performances. Momoa makes a suitable conflicted hero and is certainly built like a superhero. It was fun to see the usually delicate appearing Nicole Kidman kicking ass with some convincing martial arts moves. To me, the most convincing visual effects involved making people look like like they were actually underwater. Their movements looked natural and even their hair moved convincingly.So if you can relax a little and remember that you are watching a comic book movie, you'll find Aquaman a pleasant experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The movie does not have that much illogical stuff, so most of the events make sense.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Doesn't live up the hype.,"I hate it when they withhold a movie for a holiday release so they have the potential to make more money. If a company decides to do then they better give me something to make the wait worthwhile. In this case they didn't come through for me, I was anticipating something better.I will say I kind of liked this movie but I expected more, it left me feeling kind of disappointed. I think they sacrificed too much of the story for more action. It felt like they were trying too hard to include too much for 1 movie. I think it might have been better served splitting it up into 2 parts but then it wouldn't have been as exciting. This movie really needed a good writer, someone who could have condensed the story into something that flowed more smoothly. The dialogue was at times silly and out of place. Momoa trying to be funny is like Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to be funny as the Terminator, awkward. Momoa is a great straight man, he has good comedic timing and had some really funny moments in Stargate Atlantis when he wasn't trying to be funny. If they wanted humor in this movie, they should have used the same technique vs. using corny jokes.Maybe because I'm older and grew up watching movies with incredible actors and dialogue but the CGI stuff doesn't impress me that much. Some of it was incredible some of it was just off and made the scenes look fake. I knew it was CGI and what they were showing was inaccurate, it took me out of the movie. I admire the movies that use CGI but don't make me aware of it. There were times I wished I'd had a remote control so I could fast forward through parts that were just way too drawn out. I wasn't crazy about the music, at times it didn't enhance the story and sometimes it was downright distracting. I think the music and background noises were overpowering, making it more difficult to understand what was being said.I like Momoa as an actor, he is visually impressive but I still can't wrap my head around him being Aquaman. It was like he as an actor didn't believe he was Aquaman? Nicole Kidman's performance was not all that believable either. Maybe it was the CGI or lack of great dialogue but it didn't pull me in. The antagonists were the worst, their lines were laughable. I'm reminded of a quote from W.C. Fields ""If you can't dazzle them with Brilliance than Baffle them with Bulls##t"" they tried to dazzle us with Brilliant imagery so we didn't notice all the Bulls##t.I love Super Hero movies but the biggest problem I have with them is they try too hard to be epic. Yeah I want a Hero and action but I want a good story as well. Too many times the story gets lost in the struggle to make it more Epic than the last Super Hero movie. I hate that they're always trying to outdo each other with action and special effects at the cost of the story. If you have a good story you don't need epic battles. I think this movie really sacrificed story for action. It's like when you go to a buffet and you eat a little of everything but you don't get enough of the few really good things. When you leave you're full but not satisfied. Although there were some great moments in the move it left me unsatisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Unique Maritime Epic,"Let me start by saying this film is a definite improvement from past DC Films. This movie felt a bit long considering it's run time of 2hrs 23 mins as the epic scope of CGI scenes battled with trying to keep a simple plot refreshing. It is a film of royalty and myth which rewards this film by giving it the grand scale other DC films lack. Sure this film does follow the typical formula, but there are a few twists which keep the film from being an absolute bore. Visually this film is looks pretty as the nearly endless CGI serves as mostly pleasurable to the eyes. The various environments of the sea vary from illuminated wonder to dreary darkness but it is satisfying to see how broad film is with creating kingdoms of the sea. There is a scene where Aquaman spins his trident with terrible CGI but I'll ignore that. As for character development, this film has had more than a lot of past DC films and as an audience we learn enough about Aquaman to understand his motivation. This could go deeper but in an already long movie it would be quite difficult and would most likely become a snooze fest. There are moments that are bound to make you smirk in the dialogue and the characters are likable enough that you don't end up hating them and might come to enjoy them during the film. However, this is an action film and deep dialogue is the last thing you'd expect. There are moments which can be a bit cheesy or over the top but it is satisfying to follow Aquaman through his journey though the sea. His relationships add a layer of richness which somewhat invests you in his motivations and endeavors. If it wasn't for his companion Momoa, his brashness and over the top nature would be unbearable and annoying, but she provides an acceptable balance. Overall, this film entertains with its adventurous feel and monumental battles but it falls victim to a lengthy run time which is unbalanced in pacing. I would recommend and I feel cinemagoers will feel some sense of satisfaction from DCs oceanic epic. It is a refreshing take on a system which is formulaic (both Marvel and DC) with a unique setting and royal grandeur which sets it apart from its predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
WATCH THIS MOVIE!!,"Alots been made about DC and it's movies.

A cheeky grin and swagger to match.
Great casting in Amber Heard as she's in 90% of the movie and makes Mara as powerful as she's meant to be.
The whole cast did an amazing job and should be commended.
The CGI is top notch and REALLY REALLY needed to be for this film to stand any chance.
James Wan made a film thats up there with all the other superhero offerings.

Beneath all of the cheesiness and the clich√©s you can tell there was heart put into it and that those behind it were very passionate about the project.The underwater setting is quite unique and leads to some visually stunning scenes, the scene where Arthur and Mera enter The Trench for example is particularly aesthetically pleasing. I also quite enjoyed the scenes with young Arthur and his parents, as well as those in which he is being trained by Willem Dafoe's character Vulko.This doesn't however negate the issues the movie has. The plot is convoluted and exposition heavy, they build up Black Manta (Aquaman's answer to Joker or Lex Luthor) as a major antagonist only to have him show up for a five minute fight scene in which Arthur easily disposes of him.There are some attempts to make jokes which often fall flat, as well as strange moments that feel out of place such as a scene in which a weird cover of Toto's Africa by Pitbull is played (What was that about? Because they were in the Sahara Desert which is in Africa?).Perhaps the biggest problem is that they portray Arthur Curry at times as being a complete idiot who is incapable of working anything out by himself, this is to seemingly make Mera's character appear more intelligent and competent than he is.Overall it's a visual spectacle and a fun time but not without it's flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Close to Perfection,"After a terrible start to the DCEU, it finally looks like DC is heading towards the right direction. The movie is very to the point, getting you excited in the first 20 minutes. A few times, the plot got a little messy, but it quickly got back on track. The music score was phenomenal besides two pop songs that were awkwardly place in the movie. The main characters were all interesting and great action scenes, the best being the battle between Aquaman and Black Manta. Overall, this movie was very entertaining.

HOW HORRIBLE CAN DC GET?,"This movie is just a testament to what DC has been doing. The acting was sub-par. The action sequences we're constantly interrupted by explosions.

Would not recommend this movie to anyone. DC, stop trying to compete with marvel and add subtle comedy to your movies. It's just not your game.

Aquaman,"I think Wan's Aquaman portrays the character and stays loyal to the story as well as it can. It's impressive how they were able to bring all those fantastical battle scenes and underground scenes to the big screen with modern technology, a true dream come true for comic book fans. The story is a great standalone movie but doesn't feel like it serves any greater purpose like those Marvel films, I guess for both better and for worse. Also unlike Marvel movies or previous DC films, I think the movie finds a good balance between being dark/deep and comical. The build-up is a little long, but the content within doesn't feel like filler and makes the world of Atlantis more interesting, it's impressive how so many integral elements of the film was integrated. The biggest problem with the film are the dialogues. They are painfully simplistic and uninspiring to the point where it feels awkward, someone needs to tell the writers that writing movie lines are not the same as writing comic dialogues!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Facepalm,"Appalling script, patchy continuity, the Scarlett Johansson look alike was a huge mistake.

Wilson, Dafoe, Kidman weren't enough to save this train wreck. The only likeable character was Temuera Morrison. I was surprised to see Dolph (not a fan) doing a reasonable job.

Aquaman,"Aquaman is another character introduction film in the DCEU. Like the other films in the series, it's long, action-packed, and often a little too cheesy. However, it's also tremendously entertaining.Indeed, I've had a surprisingly hard time deciding how much I like this film. While on the one hand, it has great visuals, fun action, and it's wonderfully entertaining. On the other hand, it has fairly poor CGI, cheesy and stupid lines, and pacing that, for the most part, feels odd. However, at the end of the day, movies like Aquaman are meant to be entertaining. And being completely honest, I had a great time with it. By the time it ended, I was cheering for Aquaman, just like I'm sure many others did. And it's that sensation that these films strive for. And if they achieve it, they tend to be quite good. The best example of this, and one that will most likely never be topped, is the Avengers Assemble moment in Endgame. It's a moment of triumph and joy, and no matter how much one might dislike superhero movies, it's hard to dislike a moment like that. And so when I see a new superhero movie for the first time, I always look for that moment of triumph where I can cheer for the hero. If that moment exists, and everything else isn't complete garbage, I really have no reason to dislike the film.The story is what bothered me the most about Aquaman. It follows Aquaman as he starts coming to terms with who he is. He learns that his half brother is planning an invasion from Atlantis to the surface, intending to teach us 'surface-dwelling' humans our place. However, Aquaman, who has lived his whole life on land, has grown quite fond of his home and wants to protect it from the impending invasion. To do so, however, he must claim his rightful place as the king of Atlantis, even though he never wanted to do so.
It's as much of an origin story as an origin story can be. Along the journey, we learn about his past, his powers, and his true destiny. Since it is an origin story, there isn't much to say about it. However, there is a lot to say about the way it was done. You see, stories like this should be simple. They should focus on the character being introduced, and that's it. However, Aquaman doesn't do just that. Not only does it introduce the character of Aquaman, but it also attempts to introduce others, like Black Manta. While I'm sure that it seemed like a good choice, as my understanding is that he is a bit of a fan favourite, the resulting product was needlessly complicated. It added extra to an already long runtime, and it added a plotline that had nothing to do with the actual story being told.Indeed, Black Manta is one of the most useless characters in the whole film. And one of the reasons why it was so difficult to decide how I felt about it. While I'm sure that the character is interesting and even powerful in the comics, the way he is treated in Aquaman, makes him seem weak and pointless. You'd think that a war between worlds would be enough of a threat and plot for a film like this, but alas, it wasn't. However, it's not just the character of Black Manta that bothered me. One of the most striking things was the surprisingly poor CGI. Especially in scenes with close-up action, or just close-up shots of people underwater, it felt cheap and looked weird. I understand that a big part of the movie taking place underwater adds its own challenges, but in a movie like Aquaman, that relies on looking good, I was expecting to see top-notch CGI. And, certainly, some moments look absolutely stunning. Shots that pan around the city of Atlantis, especially, look great. In fact, every time the CGI isn't up close to the camera, it looks fantastic.But, despite all my complaints, I had a great time with Aquaman, and it's certainly of the better films in the DCEU. While the ending, which really is the highlight of the film, comes quickly and out of the blue, it still delivers a satisfying and triumphant conclusion. And while there are elements that shouldn't be there, the focus always remains of Aquaman and his story, amounting to what is fun and entertaining superhero film. Just what it was meant to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exceeded our expectations.,"Fascinating movie with stunning underwater effects and amazing performances by Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman and all cast.

James Wan has the courage to laugh at his own ridicule... The film is not ashamed to come out in this way and manages to take this fantasy to a heroic level,"For many years, Aquaman was considered a minor hero in the DC portfolio and thinking about a film adaptation would have been seen as a reverie a few years ago. The character has always been treated with disdain and has even been the target of jokes in several TV series and even films over the last few decades, always in a pejorative way. The character debuted in More Fun Comics # 73 (November 1941, despite appearing on the cover ""November"", More Fun Comics # 73 hit the US newsstands on September 25, 1941.). Initially a secondary hero in DC anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes as the main hero.
With the expansion of the DC universe in theaters and the advancement of technology, it was possible to bring to the screen through the hands of one of the most daring and talented directors that have emerged in recent years, James Wan. The Malaysian / Australian director emerged in the mid-2000s when he impressed the world with the iconic horror Mortal Games (2004). Responsible for producing the following chapters of the franchise and for being ahead of other contemporary horror classics, such as the 'Invocation of Evil', 'Supernatural' and 'Annabelle' franchises, the director had already proved himself capable of venturing into other genres typical of blockbuster cinema in the acclaimed 'Fast and Furious 7 (2015)' and now arrives with all the merits to adapt Aquaman's comics for Warner / DC Comics. And in the hands of the director, the final product achieves an unexpected and surprising result.Being the sixth film in the Extended Universe DC and with a screenplay by Will Beall and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, the plot features Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), half-human and half-Atlantean, will have to stop his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who with a vast army at his disposal, plans to conquer both the other kingdoms of the ocean and the world on the surface, becoming the Master of the Oceans to attack the surface. Along with Mera (Amber Heard) he will have to recover Atlan's lost trident and accept his destiny as protector of the depths.
One of the great successes of this film was in the construction of the characters. After having previously appeared in 'Justice League (2017)', Aquaman has its story told in greater detail, since when his parents met, and why Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) had to abandon her young son and husband and return to Atlantis. Soon after, we saw Arthur grow up as a great partner of his father who raised him and being trained by Vulko (Willem Dafoe) both at sea and on the surface, until one day he could take over the kingdom of Atlantis. At the same time in which he presents the character's past and present, he already inserts the hero into the action, in an excellent sequence in a submarine, which even nurtures a feeling of an enemy's rematch for Aquaman.
One of the great successes of the film and that could have a totally opposite effect is the visual and visual effects. Just as James Gunn can create and dare with the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' look on a risky endeavor, so does this DC adventure. One of James Wan's great merits was taking on the fanciful tone and fantastic elements that are inherent in the character's story. The mission is not only to present Aquaman, but the entire mythology of the Seven Seas, including the history of their largest kingdom: Atlantis.
Building an entire universe in the underwater world was not one of the easiest tasks and the transposition of Atlantis from the comic books to the cinema is impeccable, showing all the financial power of the time when the city sank in the sea. They are a symbol of their time with voluptuous monuments and, at the same time, rich and highly technological of a society that was destroyed by their greed, but that also gave them the skills to breathe underwater and to evolve. The city, practically all built in computer graphics, is a delight in the eyes of those who watch. In addition to the city's architecture, the human costumes and the representation of dozens of marine lives are also perfectly done. The fact that the poetic license regarding the ability of the people of Atlantis to breathe and speak under the water at the same time that we see hair and clothes reacting to contact with water does not bother us at all. In addition to visual excellence, Aquaman's greatest asset is being bold enough to bet on a tacky yet mesmerizing aesthetic. Below the water, we see a parade of colors in the costumes and lighting. Feeling in Atlantis is a duty more than fulfilled, as well as the credibility achieved in the diversity of species in that world. The film is not ashamed to come out in this way and manages to take this fantasy to a heroic level thanks to the urgent and exciting direction of James Wan.
Jason Momoa has a natural charisma and clearly has fun playing Aquaman. If, during the casting, your choice was even criticized for not physically looking like the hero of the comics, when we see Momoa in 'Justice League' and now starring in your film, we can no longer disengage from the character's actor. Momoa forms a good pair with Amber Heard, sharing good romantic moments, which is not repeated so much in the most comical part. The actress is bestowed with the best and most relevant female character within the superhero films, with the obvious exception of Wonder Woman within her own film. Mera is the conductor of Arthur's journey to the throne, and although he is his romantic partner, he escapes the common helpless maiden clich√©s. Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman, even in minor roles, prove to be extremely efficient, including a super action sequence from the character of Kidman right at the beginning of the film.
The villains are other good hits of the feature. Patrick Wilson denotes the exaggerated tone of the film with his great Orm. The Master of the Seas next to the Arraia Negra lived by Yayha Abdul Mateen II. The first incorporates the megalomania of a son who was denied the throne, while the other is the embodiment of simple and pure revenge. Both work well and represent major threats to Aquaman, from the waters and land. Both are so well constructed, so that one is shown to be responsible for the hero's inability to refuse the call for his journey. Aided by the impeccable look, built from the comics of Ivan Reis and Geoff Johns - a good part of the people, in fact, are inspired by the duo's arc.
Some themes are discussed throughout the plot, citing the interference of man in the environment, in an inspired observation that the first act of the sea war against the land was to return decades of garbage thrown into the ocean. Xenophobia is also addressed in this same tone, with the superior underwater races seeing humans as minors.James Wan shows all his ability by merging scenes shot on a green background, combining all his ability to direct actors and create ingenious action scenes, which was already evident in the seventh adventure in the cinemas of the franchise 'Fast and Furious'. There are several scenes with interesting elements of transition, continuity, flat action sequences (highlighting one involving the character Atlanna, the duel to the candidates for the throne of Atlantis, the incredible sequences in Sicily, Italy and the entire final stretch after Aquaman took over the post of the true heir of Atlantis capable of wielding the trident of the former King Atlan).
'Aquaman' has an excellent look, action with scale, impact and tension, but it sins when it comes to creating true relationships between the characters. One observation is that the film makes it clear that Warner has freed itself from the shadowy bonds in which its extended universe was established from Man of Steel. The created world is well structured and has such a particular identity that such defects are superimposed. The work is full of references, the passage of Arthur and Mera on the surface includes a sequence that refers to the games, not only by the scenery, but also by the color table, by the conduct of the action and the temple, which resembles 'Indiana Jones', while the hero's first foray into Atlantis refers to 'Star Wars', when Jar Jar Binks takes Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to Gunga in 'The Phantom Menace'. James Wan has the courage to laugh at his own ridicule, putting the hero to talk to fish or riding a seahorse and, aware of the fantasy he proposes, the film of the King of the Seas has fun like no other DC hero has had in years.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Effects & Action But a Bit Overlong.,"Aquaman: The Aquaman I knew and loved when I was a comic reading kid had short hair, was clean shaven and wore spandex. Now we have a hydro-hippie who looks like a young, well fed, Willie nelson. This is a good film but is overlong and contains some terrible dialogue. The general acting and effects make up for this though.The wonderful undersea city of Atlantis could be a submerged L.A. from Blade Runner as mini-subs ape the actions of flying-cars. There are Merpeople, Lobster lads and lassies, even creatures from the Trench who resemble Giger's Alien. These are regressed tribes of Atlantis who exist alongside the Human tribes. We see the fall of Atlantis in thew distant past when man's hubris brought about it's destruction. Striking back at te surface-dwellers the Atlanteans send tsunamis crashing ashore, wrecking naval ships and returning decades of pollution to the land.Aquaman wants to prevent war between the occupants of the land and the denizens of the depth, but to do this the half-blood prince will have to claim the throne of Atlantis. Meanwhile he's managed to annoy a pirate who pursues a blood vendetta against him. All good fun if a tad drawn out. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An amazing shift into mature story about love and facing the biggest enemy:Who we are.,"Absolutely amazing movie. The best DC movie so far. The movie is moved from being a child friendly superhero to a more mature and serious story, where it matters who you are, and
The actor play is just phenomenal. All of the movie characters are really well developed. They have a really solid story behind them and the viewer gets attach to their story and who they are, and this is made in a really clever ways.
In the whole movie everyone grows and develops.
Another great aspect DC implemented was that heroes has also some weaknesses, and are drawn closer and closer to the average person, and that not superpowers are important, but the thing who we are. The feelings we express.
The cinematography is just stunning, and the special effects was the best i have seen in a 3D movie so far. Just amazing to watch. A lot of effort was put into the underwater world. They successfully recreated the beauty of the deep.
I have some minor complains about Mera. In some shots she was presented like an innocent explorer of the land, and in other shots she was presented like a provocative and super experienced badass girl. I dont really know what made this very rapidly change in character but who knows.
But the movie is absolutely amazing and it is a must to watch preferably in 3D.

"I enjoyed it, even if it's really nothing special.","I enjoyed seeing James Wan's latest, ""Aquaman,"" the 2018 live-action film adaptation of the famed DC Comics character. ""Aquaman"" tells a story that's actually quite similar to ""The Legend of King Arthur,"" and revolves around half-human/half-Atlantean Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) becoming Aquaman in order to prevent war between the underwater kingdom of Atlantis and the human world. ""Aquaman"" is much different from James Wan's previous films - of course, ""Saw."" The film (especially in its underwater sequences) looks fantastic and is beautiful to look at, but that's really all I got out of it. (I'm not a fan of Aquaman and perhaps if I was, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more.)

The Story is Boring and Everything Looks Incredibly Fake,"If I am being honest, I heavily dislike CGI, superheroes, and pretty much any mainstream films that are trying to be the blockbuster of the year. Well, Aquaman features really fake CGI, more annoying superheroes, and fails at being a blockbuster for me because I was bored, uninterested, and kind of disappointed half of the time.Aquaman is such an uninteresting character who is given no character development. Every other character does not matter because I could not even remember their names, which heavily implies that the writing was just awful. The CGI took me out of the movie so much, that I felt no spectacle at all, but I felt like I was watching humans stand in front of a green screen. Nothing felt real, and it annoyed the hell out of me.I wish I laughed more. I wish there was more cringe scenes, but honestly, this film was just really boring. I fell asleep tons of times and there is just nothing left for me to say. I mean, the enemies were horrendous, and I didn't care about one single thing that was going on. There was even this one bad guy (a pirate) that was given a montage scene with heroic music for what reason? It was so out of place and made no sense. He is supposed to be the evil person. The mother of Aquaman also annoyed me a lot. There is a decision that involves her in the film that could have happened so much sooner, and what ends up happening is so dumb, that I was really wanting to walk out.All in all, not even a red-head showing off some cleavage could spark my attention in this bloated, boring, and really ugly looking CGI-filled atrocity.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

DC is alive!,"I would quote Aquaman, "" This is badass"". Though I have seen its Hindi dubbed version for Indian audience. And that's where I feel a big mistake. The charm of the film is Jason Momoa and he has this gigantic personality and manly voice. But the voice in dubbed version is really no match for this superhero guy. I mean take a look at Marvel franchise! It's not hit due to its graphics and cool action sequences but the dubbed version had that impact over the mind of audience. I strongly suggest to redub the voice of Arthur and everything else is just fine. Scenes and sound is great. It has potential to uplift a new franchise. No more darkness and DC likes colors as well. üëç",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

80 years of ridicule now everyone thinks Aquaman's Cool,"James Wan takes a break from Horror and takes a shot at superheroes with Aquaman. One of the founders of the justice league and the butt of all jokes since 1941. Following the events of the justice league film, Arthur Curry(Jason Momoa) is still saving lives and visiting his father on occasion. One day Mera Princess of Xebel(Amber Heard) arrives and tells him that his half-brother Orm(Patrick Wilson) has waged war on the surface and he needs to return with the trident of King Atlan and claims the throne. Jason Momoa is still enjoyable as Arthur however of going for a more relaxed funny Aquaman. There are just moments where they just have jokes and moments that make him just slow & dumb. I understand that they went more for the 90s Barbarian Aquaman, However, there are points where he's just slow. Though his personality does still offer a likable charm given his past with his mother and doesn't care about Atlantis. Mera's with Arthur throughout the whole of the movie. While she does have her moments, she never really does anything to convince him into the mantle of the king the entire time. The film also doesn't warrant the romance between them they hold hands once and have one moment. This is one of the instances where a romantic bond needed to be there for leads. This is Aquaman's Queen and one of the most popular couples in Dc. Orm is pretty good you can tell that the director wanted to go for a more comic over-the-top villain, but still make him come off as a threat. Naturally, he's a more skilled fighter in the water than Arthur. He's meant to have the best interest of Atlantis in mind, but it doesn't show. It just makes him feel less like a guy who feels he's doing is just and best for his people. More just a crazy fanatic who hates the surface. Last, there's Black Manta(Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), having the whole throne war plot with orm wasn't a bad choice, but at the same time, they knew that had to fit Black Manta in there somewhere. He is a pirate who wants Aquaman dead for not saving his father. The problem is that while his suit looks great and the fight with him is done well. The problem is how they did his character where it suffered. This is Aquaman's arch-nemesis and the history between these two is soaked with the blood of loved ones on both ends. However, want they do with Manta and his father doesn't cement that hatred he should have toward Arthur. Honestly, you kind of forget about him for a while. The production design is beautiful and creative from the costume design, even giving Arthur the goldfish armor. Atlantis itself looks good considering the major of this movie takes place underwater, In most movies, you can't see a thing. Everything's bright may be too bright in certain areas. The idea of the 7 kingdoms is a nice expansion. The trench, Brine, and fisherman are welcome additions. The only uncalled-for scene is the deserter kingdom it helps leads to the trident but is that what you expect from Aquaman a desert. Overall despite its flaws, Aquaman is a fun entertaining film that shows off the creativity and quirks the heroes have been denied all these decades.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Bro-seidon Adventure,"Aquaman is the 5th outing for the DCEU and we'll... It sure is pretty.That's really all there is to Aquaman. All style, no substance. Visually, it's what I imagine a drug trip to look like. So many bright, swirling colors, vivid and vibrant.The biggest problem this movie has isn't actually its problem. It's the DCEU that it's forced to be a part of. The kaleidoscope of colors in Aquaman are stunning, but are a complete departure from the rest of the universe it's set in. Jason Mamoa is a fun guy to watch and has real potential as an action star but, Bro-seidon of Justice League still lingers in memory.Were this a stand alone film, it might rank higher for me. Sadly, that isn't the case and the crushing disappointment that is the greater DCEU weighs heavily on Atlantean shoulders.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Very conflicted about this film!,"To be totally honest and up front I am personally suffering from Comic book film fatigue at the moment, there is just an over saturation. I'd even go as far to say that I am getting less and less bothered or interested in them, the more that come out. I am more of a DC fan than Marvel but I have enjoyed films from both however I really couldn't care less anymore. Maybe thats just me.With that overly long intro out of the way onto the film itself, which I have to say I am very conflicted on because there are parts I really enjoyed but that there are also parts that were just ok for me. Unfortunately though that is the overriding feeling after viewing this film is that, it is just ok. Which is a real bummer because I go into every film hoping to love it.Lets start with positives firstly, James Wan. Wow can that man direct!! This probably from a visual standpoint one of the most amazing and breath-taking comic book films you're going to see. Some of the visuals underwater in the world of Atlantis are just incredible, and more importantly the camera work throughout some of the action scenes. Idea of showing two different action scenes going on simultaneously, switching between the two without cutting away is a brilliant way to give perspective on the overall area and scale of the action. Overall though it is nothing less than I expected from Wan because he is an uber talented director and he definitely added something fresh to comic book films in that respect.Strangely I thought that Jason Momoa was a good as I thought he was gonna be nothing spectacular but not terrible either, however I think there are couple other performances that really stood out to me. Firstly Nicole Kidman, she is one of the best around today period. So it shouldn't really be a surprise that she is really good, but you do worry now and then when you here about a huge name staring in a film like this. Are they just doing it for the pay check?? I thought her performance was really strong and is the heart of the film even though she has ""limited"" screen time. Every time she does appear on screen she is a scene steeler. Overall top class. The other scene steeler and this one was a shock is Amber Heard as Mera. Now this might be just me but I'm not the greatest Amber Heard fan, don't actually think she's that good an actress, average at best, maybe a little harsh. Wow has this got to be her best performance of her career as of yet. She commands the screen whenever she is on and I think she does a better job of carrying the film than Momoa. As soon as she is introduced to us you immediately warm to her or just latch onto her character and her motivations. However the best thing and probably the most harshest thing I could say is that she wasn't playing Amber Heard, she was actually playing a character......Do you get what i mean? Maybe my bar is set really low for her and actually this isn't really that good but who knows really......each to your own.All the other performances are really strong Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe and even Dolph Lundgren. They all do well in there respective roles.Now onto the negatives. Firstly the tone of the film, which needless to say is all over the place. In a way it sort of reminds me of the tone of ""Justice League"" or some of the Marvel films, one minute begin serious the next second being light hearted out of nowhere. There are so many ups and downs with the tone that it never really felt like an overall theme or tone to latch onto........Is it just me or am I going crazy. I can't quite put my finger on in it, but there was just a strange tone.Did we really need the character of Black Manta and he's sub-story? There is a lot going on in this film and I just think it might have been helped a little with a bit more of a simpler story with less characters. The character of Black Manta, although there was nothing wrong with the character itself or Yahya Abdul-Mateen II performance its just felt a little shoehorned in.Finally there wasn't anything in the film that made my jaw drop or was really fascinated by. Erm.......................can't find the words to describe it really, the film was just fine there was a lot of it that was forgettable not because it was bad but it wasn't really that great. Ah thats it there was no great moments in the film for me plenty of fine/ok moments, some good directing and performances but nothing......great.Overall this film is just 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out 10 it is ok/average, which is a real bummer because if you'd told me that about 2 and a bit years ago I wouldn't have believe you. I'm just a bit worn out with these films whether that is Marvel and sadly even DC now, and boy have I given DC some passes recently.....I'm looking at you ""Justice League"", ""BVS"" and ""Suicide Squad"". Some good directing from James Wan, two standout performances from Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard but as I said nothing great.......just fine.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Action packed,"One of the more colourful of recent DC films, action packed and delightfully predictable in the way that superhero quest type films are. I liked that Aquaman isn't the standard straight laced superhero, but more of a grey area.
Marked down for repetitive use of the same 'jump scare' for want of a better word. Any time 2 characters, usually Arthur and Mera got close and lingered for a second or more something exploded.

I mean , the characters and their development can't be so simple.. Atleast give 'em some flaws that'll be properly exploited . The Dark Knight was painfully human, half the MCU superheroes literally bit the dust .

Flawed But Entertaining,"Film Review: Aquaman (NO SPOILERS)Indiana Jones style adventure mixed with Black Panther style of tussle between two contenders for the throne. I was expecting the story to take a different route but it didn't. Also, it's fast paced and that can be a bit jarring because at times the way it abruptly cuts to a scene that explores another subplot.It feel like it's just another superhero film with just another okay pair of villains. But it's an entertaining one.Why was I entertained and engaged regardless of cliches? I cared about the characters of Aquaman and Mera. I was rooting for them and was invested in their adventures. They learned from each other and what they went through. This is how a character arc works and while it is a pretty simple form of character arc, it works.There are some really awe inspiring visuals in underwater scenes especially near the third act. The use of bright and vivid colors in some of those underwater moments is so good that the same cheesy Aquaman moments in some of the old comics pre-New 52 that you would've thought will never work in live action somehow look great. Action scenes are fantastic as well.While it is beautiful at times, at other times, it looks very very cheesy and artificial. This is one of the negatives that I'm going to discuss in detail. Maybe it's a personal preference but at times the comic book-esque costumes don't mesh well with the world they're inhabiting. This is one of the reasons I don't like visual aesthetic of some of the MCU films. Their worlds look too plain and the costumes end up looking silly.And talking about silly, I have to say that Aquaman should've taken itself a bit more seriously than it did. Jason Momoa is constantly trying to make you laugh, villains are making cheesy entries in slow motion like Bollywood films. It feels DCEU is giving in to MCU's approach in order to please the critics.. I'm not saying MCU films are bad but DC needs it's own signature style. But Aquaman does not feel like it belongs in the same universe as MoS, BvS or WW.I preferred Zack Snyder's dark and gritty style. Snyder knew how to balance realism with comic book visuals. Zack Snyder also brought that sense of ""gods among humans"" to these heroes. In his films, you felt the weight of their powers. How the world reacted to them also added to that but in Aquaman it seems like they have kind of nerfed these powers and brought him down to earth in order to make him more human. Yes Aquaman does a better job at making you care for it's hero than Man of Steel did but it doesn't quite treat it's hero like the godlike being he's supposed to be. I preferred the latter approach (with good writing of course)Back to the pros. Surprisingly, Amber Heard is pretty good in this, I was skeptical about her but she was very charismatic and charming in the role. Jason Momoa did a decent job of carrying the film as well considering he has never really led such a big blockbuster all by himself. Nicole Kidman put on probably one of the best performances in the film. Patrick Wilson was just okay.My verdict is that Aquaman is a flawed but decent ride for film goers. I will not say that it's a step in the right direction for DC because I want them to at least tone down the humor just a little bit especially with characters that are not entirely comedy based.Even with the flaws, it pleased me with heroes that I could root for, certain moments of sheer badassery and nicely tied up character arcs. I hope they improve upon the flaws in the sequel.I give it a 6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of Dc's better movies.,We follow Aquaman as he tries to stop Atlantis from going to war on the surface world. Aquaman takes place underwater the hole movie and they do a good job with the CGI everything looks Beautiful the movie it has some great shots as well. The movie does kinda follow the same story as Black panther but it's still good. The movie has great 2 villains and a compelling story.Jason Momoa takes on the role of Aquaman he shows a version of Aquaman who doesn't want anything to do with Atlantis he could care less what's happening there. He then becomes more caring for his people and is a badass. Amber Heard is also in this movie and she is terrible in it idk why people keep giving her roles. Patrick Wilson plays Aquamans brother and main bad guy he plays a villain who wants Atlantis to rule. Willem Dafoe does a good job playing the wise man who trained Aquaman. And Yahya Abdul-Mateen 2 plays the secondary villain who is way more badass than the actual Main villain can't wait to see more of him.Overall Aquaman was one of the better Dc comic movies and I hope Dc can continue to make good movies like this one.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Random use of 80s New Wave music. Who green lit this script? Who read this script and said it was coherent? I think Jason has problems speaking when acting with out moving a limb, because he doesn't feel he's interesting enough. Funny thing is, we like him as a person, he needs to chill and take a hell of a lot of acting lessons all day everyday for a few years. And, yes SEE is stupid too.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
MOST BEAUTIFUL SUPER HERO MOVIE EVER,"AQUAMAN MOVIE NON SPOILER REVIEWWhy you should not worry that DC messed up again?Its Directed by James Wan, if you liked The Fast & Furious 7 n cried, yea its him who directed and has directed this one as well so you know its in good hands.Why should you see it?Its easily the most Beautiful Super Hero Movie everüòç and is in same conversation with Avatar(2009 blue fantasy).Trust me on this one, it is very very extremely Beautiful(sorry Black Panther but wakanda is no match for the sea). The Underwater scenes are those non ever seen on screen and a cinematic experience is a must for this one üòç.Plot & StoryThe begging is a slow start and somehow hints that this would be another disappointing DC film as scenes are rushed. For me Narration is just a lazy style of story telling(not a fan) and it does turn me off, but they added present day narration and flash Backs which make it kind of Unique and i would give it a pass for that. The other thing is that the story is plan simple and straight to the Origin story of Establishing the Plot.Action & HumorAction packed film with good fight scenes and well directed Camera Shoots üò±üò± There is one you already saw in the Trailer and it Is well done. After Watching this Film Aquaman ranks Just after Superman and Wonder Woman(sorry Batman but its true) Watching this film makes me Hate Justice League even more as Aquaman is very Powerful and should have been utilized in that film. In terms of Humor 11 out of 20 jokes are funny is all i will say.Where does it stand among DCEU films?Maybe some will disagree, but There is Batman The Dark Night and then AQUAMAN. Yes i said it, it second best.Conclusion.You dont need to be a comic book or Super Hero fan to enjoy this movie. Dear Parents you and your Children will never forget watching such a film, take them and yourself this coming weekend at Fresh View Cinemas I WILL REPEAT, ITS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SUPER HERO FILM EVER.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This was rather impressive...,"Alright, well for starters I must state that I am not one overly keen on watching superhero movies, because they all just seem to follow the same doctrine and blueprint. But I was forced into watching the 2018 DC ""Aquaman"" movie together with my family.And it turns out that it was actually a good thing that I was forced to watch it. Because it turned out that ""Aquaman"" was actually one of the better superhero movies that have been made. Not that I am in anyway familiar with the backstory of the character and haven't read the comic books or anything.Initially I was a little bit hesitant about the movie, but it turns out that director James Wan actually managed to turn the written material of David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Will Beall and Geoff Johns into something truly entertaining and enjoyable. The movie was driven by a good story, where one quickly and easily got submerged, no pun intended, into the setting and into the ongoings on the screen. Plus it was also a plus that it had some rather interesting characters in it to help it along as well. Needless to say that the CGI and special effects also had a major role in making it a visually astounding and enjoyable movie.Now, normally I am not much fan of Jason Momoa, but I must admit that he really carried himself formidably in this movie and he really owned up to the responsibility of playing Aquaman - although I have no idea how much pressure would be on him to play that character. But he did it phenomenally in my opinion, regardless. It was of course a treat to see Willem Dafoe in the movie, despite it being somewhat disturbing and unsettling to see him made young and vigorous. Patrick Wilson actually was so well-cast for the role he had in the movie, and he brought so much grace, charm and wits to that dark character. I had initially not thought he would be up to the task, but he proved me so wrong. Then you have the likes of Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren whom also actually were fun to watch in the movie, despite them not having an abundance of screen time.The pacing to the movie was fast and upbeat, and the movie kicked off into a high octane speed right from the very beginning and it never really slowed down. Which was a very impressive accomplishment in my opinion, and it really made the movie all the more intense and enjoyable to sit through.As for the special effects and CGI. Well, there is just really just a single word necessary to summarize the entire movie. And that word is: wow! Are you kidding me, this movie takes you in for a tour de force and really showcases some rather impressive feats and accomplishments in the visual department and also in the audio department. Prepare to be blown away.With that being said, the movie is not at all flawless. Personally I found it a bitter pill to swallow the whole thing about the Secret Sea and what was going on there. It was just too far out there for my liking. And also the fact that all the marvelous, magnificent, malignant and spectacular aquatic creatures, vehicles and settlements have remained from the humans living on the surface is just beyond me. It makes absolutely no sense at all.Now, I was praising the CGI and visual effects just before. There were some scenes when we have the characters floating around and supposed to be appearing as if they are submerged and underwater, it just came off as being ridiculously fake to look at. That was a shame, because the rest of the 95% of special effects and CGI in the movie was just spot on.If you enjoy superhero movies. Wait, let me rephrase that. Even if you have no particular interest in superhero movies, then you should actually take the time to sit down and watch the 2018 ""Aquaman"" movie. It is definitely well worth the time, effort and money.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Could have a better story...great graphics thou!,"Ok, I'm not well verse in the DCU, so this first story of Aquaman would be very intriguing for me.
However, that was not the case.
If i were to write this story, i would write it such that it brings out the part why Arthur deserves to be the King. I would imagine he stole the Golden Trident, with the Trident rejecting him by burning his hands. I would imagine the evil brother declaring war with Earth people, both ready to destroy each other, and then Aquaman stood between the two worlds to stop the war! He sacrificed his own life to shield Atlantis from the attacks of Earth's leaders. His Trident would then be the magical weapon it deserves, and stop the rising gigantic tidal waves in suspension, leaving the homo-sapiens in awe. Hence learning a very important lesson: don't screw with Mother Nature! No more pollution! The Atlantis people would recognize him as their true King, the Earth people developed trust with this half-breed, and the Trident accepted him as it's rightful owner...
Nope...none of that.
However, the CGIs are great, the fighting scenes are quite intense, and all the characters used for this movie are beautiful.

"Terrible script, looks like it might be fun to watch in 3D","I was in the minority of IMDB reviewers who liked the underrated Justice League, and now, with the latest movie featuring Jason Momoa as Aquaman, I am in the minority again, this time having a far more negative reaction than most people.While the CGI action is *sometimes* fun, the dialogue is excruciatingly bad. Embarrassingly bad. This is particularly evident with Amber Heard, who hasn't developed the skill of more experienced actors like Nicole Kidman and Willem Dafoe to find a way to speak drivel with conviction. Amber seems terrible in this, but I don't know how much of that is her and how much is the wretched verbiage she is forced to spew.People are going crazy for the muscly Momoa. I was underwhelmed by him in Justice League, and while he certainly has some amount of charm, he fails to make Aquaman particularly memorable.The story is predictable. Some of the action works, some doesn't. Everything that's not action is painful to sit through.I did notice that the movie is very much filmed for 3D. Perhaps that's why I was underwhelmed by a lot of the action; it was more designed for effects than fun. I do suspect I would have enjoyed this more in 3D. I also probably would have enjoyed it more if dolphins dubbed in all the dialogue.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A visual spectacle of cliche,"What do you get if you mash up every superhero cliche together and make it look good? Aquaman. The only depth the film had was that it had scenes deep in the ocean. Every character is very superficial and you can tell this was not due to bad actors, but due to the whole script itself. It lacked any kind of originality, which is great for anyone just looking to watch a classic superhero film. Its lack of depth is actually pretty surprising when you remember that it has a run time of 2 and half hours. That would be plenty to write a complex story.But if it didn't have any depth then what did it have? Visuals. Lots of action, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard. Its like the same genre as Transformers really. You just basically go to watch a huge pile of cash. All focus is on being entertained by something happening and looking good, and this it actually does pretty well. Not once was I bored when watching the film and especially the scenes when they are sailing, the ocean looks really good and Amber Heard's hair is super red and shiny.So if you want to see this then at least you are gonna know exactly what you're gonna get and Amber Heard is really hot.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Awesome adventure&fantasy mixed movie,"This movie was a masterpiece. I alteady knew that I'll like it, cause I really love these kind of movies. It was a bit mixture of Romancong the Stone, Indiana Jones movies, Avatar (effects and the fantasy style). It was not a typical superhero movie, it was much more. Not exaggerated, but epic. The storyline was great, the visual effects were fantastic and I really liked the characters and the humor, the gags. Maybe Manta was a bit stupid man, but we could understand everybody's motivation and intentions. This is the movie I'll watch so many times cause every detail added something special. This was not a drama so you do not have to wait for Oscar winnig performances, but the casting was great, they all fitting into their roles and do it very believable.

It's an awkward transition from the Snyderverse to the future of DC,"So I saw Aquaman anddddddddd ehhh? It's not bad but it's not goood? Let me just give you the bad first. This movie is too long. I kinda felt the same about Wonder Woman as well, but I really felt it here. You could've easily cut down a half hour of this movie and nothing about it would've changed. The story is serviceable but not new. It bears similar resemblance to a Marvel Phase 1 movie so like: Thor 1, Captain America 1, but it lacks the performances and charisma of either of those. I like Patrick Wilson as an actor but King Orm is no Loki. He's pretty one note and cliched as the movie's villain. The visuals were a double edged sword so for the bad I would say it just got way too distracting for me. Infinity War had tons of cgi too but I was invested enough to ignore what wasn't actually real. And lastly, I'm just gonna say it, Aquaman's story is NOT interesting. Call me a hater but I've never liked Aquaman I'm sorry! There's a reason Family Guy keeps making fun of him all the time. Ok but what's good about this movie? Actually there's a lot of good things. The movie's visuals while distracting were colorful. The DC cinematic universe has stumbled with the Zack Snyder look that's just gloomy, lifeless, and boring. Aquaman actually tries to course correct the ship by creating a really bright and well animated world through Atlantis. The action is epic and ambitious because I can tell James Wan is a confident director. He definitely gave this movie a nice look so kudos to him on that. And lastly Jason Momoa, I can't deny how much I love him in the role. His character isn't written as well as it could be, but he does what he can, and he's so goofy I love it. It sounds like I hate this movie but I actually don't. It just feels like it's trying to get out of their past mistakes by making a safe and marketable movie. Which is fine. But I wanted something new and different. Here's hoping Shazam can give me what I'm looking for from DC. Should you go see it? Well.. If you're not into superhero movies you're probably not gonna care for this one either. If you want to see some good action and Jason Momoa doin his thing then I'd say it's alright. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
really thin plot,"I really dont understand all the positive reviews on here. This must be one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time.Sure the visuals are great, but what is a movie without a great story. Right, Aquaman.
I thought the plot was utter thin and way to predictable. There was almost no character development and all the jokes fell flat.
The dialogue consisted of oneliners and over-dramatic stuff. Like, not every dialogue needs music!This movie has also one of the worst sub-plots i have ever seen and goes nowhere. The movie would be the same without it. I laughed a few times at the many cheesy moments in this movie.

He's always been more than the guy who talks to fish.,"While not perfect, I would put this one at the top of the DCEU alongside Wonder Woman (2017). An underwater story of King Arthur, borrowing elements from Thor (2011) & Black Panther (2018), that brings us an entertaining adaptation of the New 52 Aquaman storyline by Geoff Johns & Ivan Reis. It's impressive how much Atlantean history they were able to include without bogging down the narrative. The underwater sequences are really impressive with the scale of this aquatic world brought to life, with nearly every bit of the film shot in IMAX. The acting was fine, although the stiff & expository dialogue made it obvious how much they are banking on the foreign market for this film. The CGI is well done, but it still suffers from some shoddy green screen work that seem to plague the DCEU. The score by Rupert Gregson-Williams stands shoulder to shoulder with his work on Wonder Woman, but some of the soundtrack choices are distracting. All in all, an impressive entry from DC Films & a fun super hero flick.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hollywood just doesn't have many of them any more. The plot line could certainly been better but the sfx were wonderful! And to have Nicole Kidman aboard was magical!

Surprising,"Aquaman is the brunt of every joke. The character has been constantly ridiculed for being really lame. ""Oh wow, he can talk to fish."" However, ""Aquaman"" 2018 is amazingly surprisingly thrilling! The story is engaging and the characters are fun and interesting. The visuals were also stimulating, what with all of the different fish, the drumming octopus, and the beautiful city of Atlantis, just to name a few.
The jokes often seemed a little out of place however, which throws off the viewer slightly. Jason Moamoa does action and drama much better than he does comedy.

He is very quickly on top of things even as his challenges become increasingly difficult. Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard were charming.

It's just... really bad.,"I am a fan of MCU & DCEU who favors DC comics (not movies) over Marvel. But let's be real: This movie is objectively bad. The visuals are pretty neat, Momoa is likeable and Manta with his suit is pretty sweet. This however cannot outweigh the ATROCIOUS writing, poor directing, bad directing and poor acting.
One thing at a time: the writing is so lazy, there is no explanation of character relationships (specifically Willem Dafoe & Momoa), the lore is hastly given, and the super hero cliches are bad. This is all on top of THE WORST written script I have ever experienced. Every line of dialogue explained everything that was going on very blatantly. That's not how dialogue works! Additionally there was absolutely zero character development.
Basically everyone outside of Momoa and Herd should be replaced in this movie. The movie was littered with actors who stood out like a sore thumb. Herd was pretty bad too but I have a little faith.
In essence the movie is reminiscent of Green Lantern: neat visuals, likeable leading actors and a cool, promising secondary villain, and an overall trainwreck.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Review - Aquaman,"Aquaman is very flawed, but it is still a very entertaining movie. James Wan while I don't like him, has his own directing style that makes this movie so much different from the rest of DCEU. Plus, the underwater fight sequences are quite enjoyable.
When I said that: ""Aquaman is very flawed"", I was referring to the acting performances and the screenplay. Momoa and Patrick Wilson are doing a decent job, but the rest of the cast, even Dafoe and Nicole Kidman are atrocious in it.

It almost looks like a comic book that came to life.Now that all the positives are done, let me tell you why I didn't like this movie. First of all, I just didn't like the protagonists in the movie : Aquaman & Mera. I thought the actors did a fairly good job but I just couldn't connect with their characters and that just took me out of the movie. Secondly, the non stop barrage of action sequences which would have felt awesome if I had time to pause and take a break after each sequences. It almost felt like the director was putting on one action scene after another to make up for Aquaman and Mera. By the time the movie reached it's climax I was completely exhausted and I couldn't focus much on the the battle with the Ocean master. Thirdly, they could have done a better job with the Ocean master. The actor who plays him is such an amazing actor, and I thought they kind of wasted his potential.Aquaman IMO is not a terrible or a bad movie but just that I didn't find the central characters appealing and that just made the movie mediocre for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A resurrection for the DCEU,"This review was written on Dec. 22, 2018.
*******I got home and turned on my laptop specifically to write this. In one word, this movie is beautiful.Hands down, it is the best thing that happened to the DC universe since Nolan's Batman trilogy. The story is very well robust, the actors are perfectly chosen (thanks Zneyder), and the graphics magnificent.Let me start by saying I am a big geek of ancient history and mythology. Atlantis and its legends instill in me a feeling of mystery and an intrigue that always make me contemplate the fantasies of its existence. This movie simply stirs up those feelings and takes you to the lost throne, explaining its majesty, its rise, its demise and now, its renaissance.The story has a beautiful path. Every sequence is well justified and so well connected that Aquaman's universe is well established.
The chemistry between the characters also flows so naturally that nothing seems forced or unexplained.Without adding any spoilers, despite my reservation of its ""completely"" happy ending, I will end by saying that indeed, Aquaman appears to be the hero who has lifted the DCEU from its years in the abyss, the movie that holds the DC universe to its rightful place among the legends.Also, ""Everything I Need"" by Skylar Grey is truly a masterpiece. A beautiful ending to a great movie.Bravo James Wan!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I guess that happened to portray a reality (in the sea) more precisely. I wished if they were clear even after being in Ocean. Despite that they were nice.

"He can swim, he can fight, and that's about it. Great for kids, not so much adults.","""It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea . . . ."" Edgar Allen Poe's Annabel LeeWhile the women in the audience for character Aquaman/Arthur can ogle Jason Momoa's fit pecs, the men can enjoy the young Amber Heard 's beauty as Princess Mera and for a bonus, that of the nicely-put-together Nicole Kidman as the matriarch Atlanna. And that's all there is folks, at least for adults. For 8-year-old boys, explosions and fights excitingly occupy almost all the film.
Aquaman/Arthur's reluctant struggle to find the magic trident (think a sword in a stone and claim his right to be king of Atlantis follows the usual mythical arc which includes fighting the evil brother, King Orm (Patrick Wilson), and finding the trident. Like the legendary King Arthur, this Arthur must wrest the trident from a monster, not a stone. Otherwise director James Wan can cut back to the lighthouse and Arthur's real father, Temuera (a fit Tom Curry), who waits patiently for the return from the sea of his mermaid wife, Atlanna.
Usually some relief can be had in the CGI setting under water, but here the scenes are so dense with creatures and ruins and, yes, explosions, that you can't digest it all and may end up not appreciating any. Nor can you possibly give a pass for Willem Dafoe, the true actor, with Kidman, in the whole lot. Because I just saw Dafoe play a memorable Vincent van Gogh in Edge of Eternity, I am miffed that he would play the king's vizier, with one line worthy of his acting ability and not any another.Jason Momoa, formerly of a Conan remake, is a physically-appealing choice, for previous iterations have him blonde, blue-eyed, and Thor like rather than the more interesting smoky-eyed, long-tressed surfer/biker dude here. Beyond the physical attributes, Momoa is given next-to-none smart lines or anything to help develop his character.Oh, well, 8-year old boys win this round.

Most memorable DC film yet,"I was initially hesitant about seeing aquaman since most of the other DC movies that have come out recently were just derivative, generic rubbish (with the exception of wonder woman). However I decided to give it a go and must say I quite enjoyed it. It has a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe in that it's very colorful and over the top. Action sequences are extremely well done and quite a few scenes are just stunning in terms of lighting and effects. The story is fairly basic but unpredictable enough compared to the standard superhero movie to be a bit more engaging. Some of the characters could have been fleshed out more but Jason Mamoa was a perfect casting choice and really steals the show. The pacing is ok, I was never bored but some scenes felt a bit rushed and others seemed to go on for a bit longer than was really necessary. I found myself wanting a bit more humor and a little less campiness (the costumes especially were a bit much for me) but overall I found the film to be enjoyable and refreshing compared to the rest of the DC movies.

"Unexpectedly great movie, with stellar visuals","After the poor run of Justice League and a few other DC movies, there was little hope that this movie will do well. Add in the fact that the movie is about Aquaman, who is to many quite unpopular, and that most of the movie time is spent underwater, something that is very difficult to depict. Yet they have somehow not only pulled all of this off, they have managed to make it into arguably the best DCEU movie.The story is about Arthur (Aquaman) gaining 'King' status in the underwater Kingdom of Atlantis, and his endeavours to stop the nation wage war against land dwellers. It is packed with amazing fights, adventure and a wonderful underwater world and its creatures. There is quite a dynamic in the characters, and it is good to see that some minor characters also get their chance to shine (Without going into spoilers, there's even a scene where nobody-soldiers have a say in the outcome of a major plot decision)The area where the movie lacks is dialogue. It is sometimes quite cheesy, and it is clear that DC is trying to add a little humour to the movie. Sadly, it doesn't seem to work in this situation. In any case, it is not tooo bad.Up until now I had considered Man of Steel to be the best movie of the DCEU. But this to me is much better.

"Beautiful to look at, but with a generic plot","Let me be honest, I didn't expect much from Aquaman, however, it was a bland movie to sit through.It starts with his parents' meeting, a regular lighthouse keeper and a queen of Atlantis, and how their son Arthur is destined to be the next king in line. Sadly, his mom Atlanta had to leave for safety purposes. Years later, Arthur uses his powers like talking to sea creatures and breathing underwater for good. Meanwhile, in Atlantis, King Orm wants to start a war between his own kingdom and land. And now Arthur, known as Aquaman has to time up with Mera, find an old artificat and prevent this conflict. The first half reminded me of Jupiter ascending, due to the fact that the protagonist who seems to be a regular person turns out to be royalty, and they also meet their siblings, that are actually the antagonist of the film. However, this one was way too unoriginal. It also reminds me of the Legend of king Arthur, where he's the chosen one to find and use the artifact, in this case, it's a trident. However, I can't say it's boring all the time. I liked the fighting scenes a lot, especially with all the atlantic technologies, which combines the underwater and outer space styles. And you can feel for the characters during these scenes. Not to mention, that the movie itself is a delight to look at, both underwater and on land. Despite mostly being done with CGI, Atlantis looks believable as a lost civilization set in a hidden place, where no one could reach. As for the land, I liked the desert, and a small Italian town. Both are really immersive and creative in their own way. Not to mention, all the animals and creatures look awesome!The cast isn't really terrible, in fact, it's okay. However, they aren't special. Aquaman is a brave protagonist, who isn't like everyone else, by being half blood. He actually got bullied by Atlantians there for not being pure. However, that only makes him stronger, as he serves as a bridge between two worlds. Mera is a love interest, who is actually the one, that warns Arthur about the danger. Despite her actress Amber Heard dealing with controversies, which I prefer not to mention, her acting was pretty solid. Orm was a villain, who is related to our hero, and despises humans for polluting oceans. His motivation is pretty unique, since it does address some modern issues of the real world. There was also another character whose name I don't remember, but he was also against Aquaman, and even teamed up with Orm, just to find him. However, he wasn't so important, as the plot progresses. Lastly, Vulko was the mentor, that taught our hero lot's of spells and tricks. He is against the war, and believes that only peace can resolve everything. He's a wise man, that honestly reminded of Shi-Fu from Kung Fu Panda, and his acting by William Defoe was great. Still, none of the characters were hateable, but none of them were stand out.My favorite scene was the backstory of Atlantis. It showed us that before, they were an advanced civilization, and how it was sunken. I loved how it explained everything in many details and how it executes the ideas of Atlantis and the lost trident.I actually thought that this movie isn't really the best, in fact, it was boring, however, I still could appreciate it. It has great graphics and world building, solid acting and even decent backstory. Not exactly my cup of tea, because the plot was generic, however, you can watch it in case you need a movie to turn off your brain and enjoy nice views of both worlds. But at least, I can appreciate effort that was made, and the creators tried their best with a simple material as a comic.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good but sucks in editing,"The movie was fun, enjoyed it very much.The CGI was great,the action scenes were good but some of them unnecessary,the kingdom of fisherman should have been left out coz they don't have any value in the movie as we are told that they are good people who respect knowledge and avoid conflict ,it would be great if they saved them for the sequel .Overall it feels a little tiring at the end.It stands at roughly 145 minutes which could be trimmed down to 2 hours.Momoa plays Aquaman like a goofy guy but he has lot of charisma because he has a lot of chemistry with all the cast including Dafoe,heard,Nicole Kidman and his father too.The moment in which he appears with the classic suit and the golden trident,that scene is epic,pure magic.The jokes were fine, could've worked with some little of them.The movie starts very fast but it slows a little bit in the middle.The villains were proper characters with a sense of personality.Both of them were distinct.One's motivation is ambition and the others is rage.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Most Entertaining Movie of the Year,"This movie was so entertaining. I spent every minute with my eyes wide in amazement looking at the cinematography and the visuals. The world is so well realized and so detailed. And the cartoonish nature of Aquaman is fully realized and taken full advantage of! Also, its mythic-style story fully complements its grande scale that it fully embraces. Admittedly it is a dumb movie, but it isnt a ""turn your brain off"" movie like the Michael Bay Transformers films. It takes full advantage of its dumbness and knows exactly what it is!

"A visual tour-de-force that has a pretty standard sibling-rivalry story, back-boned by Jason Momoa's loveable take on Aquaman.","Aquaman feels like one of those movies that's long overdue in its being released to the world. It's a wonder why this fella never got one theatrical release pre-2018, because so many iconic characters out there are just busting to be featured in these kinds of movies. Aquaman feels like it could have been released in 2004 and still would have had a similar response at the box office. It's got water, action, photogenic people populating the world it's set in and pop-music ranging from the 80s to now. It's got all the hallmarks of a blockbuster that's trying to cater to EVERYONE it possibly can. I guess this is something of a course correction for DC Comics Films.Aquaman is a step in the right direction in that it's more confident in its direction than Justice League or Suicide Squad were, but it's not the near-perfect movie-comic-mythology synthesis Wonder Woman had going for it. However a step in the right direction is better than a gigantic step backwards. I'm eager to see where the rest of Arthur Curry's story goes from here.Here's hoping that the rest of DC's upcoming movies can have the same self-confidence Aquaman does in its story and bombastic action.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Love it !!!,Deserves a 10/10 . Big Jason Momoa fan!! Epic film was glued to it all the way to the end . Loved it !,,Anonymous,Fantasy
Average & hollow.,"Aquaman is an ""alright"" movie which relies solely on its breathtaking visuals to maintain the audience's interest; the camera-work is kinetic & inventive & brings a real sense of liveliness to the sequences which are expertly choreographed & shot together harmoniously, as are the enormous battles - akin to James Cameron's Avatar or Star Wars set underwater; the visual effects are groundbreaking, mind-blowing & in abundance throughout - shot in a beautiful IMAX ratio that captures the scale of the film's multiple set-pieces but unfortunately, besides that, all the movie really offers is just mindless visual spectacle...
Granted, the world-building is impressive & the costume & set design really are a sight to behold but all of these things simply add to the slightly superficial feel... Purely aesthetic.
Won't however deny it it was fun to sit through - it's watchable - & Jason Momoa & Amber Heard have great on-screen chemistry but that doesn't excuse the paper thin plot & its total lack of substance underneath, not to mention the plot conveniences which had my eyes rolling, the cringey choices of music, wasted villain with great potential, weird score, forced humour & one-liners etc.
It's messy, convoluted, inconsistent & tries desperately to distract you from these flaws with its only reliable strength or selling point: the CGI.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

At times it was like combining the cool technology and weaponry of Star Wars with the cool neon world of Avatar, but trust me no amount of CGI can save you from the excessive absurdity you will experience scene after scene... after scene.

More cheese than I can handle,"I have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score, let alone 10. After 20 minutes I have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule. But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end. Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face. WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work.

I loved the campy feel of some of the lines because any comic book fan knows, a hero has some cheesyness to him. It has non stop action, great CGI, and they did a fair job of revealing black manta. Though he wasn't the main villain. It's a great take on aquaman, though they definitely have room to grow with the acting. Not perfect by any means, but it was so fun to watch that I couldn't help but talk about it all night with my wife during the drive home. Will definitely buy when it comes out.

An Honest Review,"The 10's? are a bit ridiculous. This was not a ten movie. This guy is clearly Aquaman. Society hasn't kind of figured that out? He's not trying to hide or disguise himself. He's not working a regular job in an alternate identity. Lex Luthor is not required to figure this out. Yet Manta says several times he needs help finding him? Clearly Mantas...a retard! Yet....There was nothing to imply Manta was adapt at reverse engineering advanced technology, yet he does it in 2 minutes? Because he needed to! It would have been far better to have an Atlantian weapons tech create it for him He's one of those annoying cardboard characters that they leave open his specific skills sets so they can just create an expertise for him whenever needed. Like how 100's of people in TV and Movies are fantastic world class hackers in their spare time. In this case Manta is Tony Stark when he needs to be.To me if somebody is THIS SMART, why are they a pirate? Why are they covertly working for Atlantis? How did they meet? Too many ""just because"" things. Another annoying thing...the bad guys of Atlantis clearly know EXACTLY where Arthur lives, which opens a large kettle of fish.At one point a villain will reveal he's known who was loyal to him and who wasn't the entire time. Which again brings up more questions than answers.Jason Mamoa plays Aquaman as a surfer/biker. It helps cement him as about as non royal as King Ralph. He's a fish out of water. One thing that should be amended is he's able to talk to all sorts of Marine life, not just fish.Ok so there's flaws. Then there's these 1/10 reviews. Also ridiculous. The movie is light hearted without mimicking Thor Ragnarok which got a little too silly. The acting is not going to win any awards. But I don't see Anthony Hopkins getting considerations for his Marvel work either.The visuals are stunning. The fight scenes are great! The chase scene rivals any Bond movie. Aquaman is very strong and invulnerable. But he's not Superman and this is shown very well that he's a notch below, but not too far below.This was a great effort. Not as good as WonderWoman, but not too far off.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The animated dc movie aquaman vs Wonder Woman and otter versions of black manta have been better in my opinion.The score was garbage. I'm one of those ppl who will literally go out and buy music based on the movie. I at no time enjoyed any of the music (classical type was fine).All that being said, it was awesome.

Awesome movie with epic visual effects. Breathtaking cinematic exprerience.,"There are plenty of reviews for this unique movie so I will be quick. Fist of all I am both a MARVEL and a DC fan and I support their movies as they deserve without exceptions. In my opinion, ""Aquaman"" is an awesome movie and the best of DCEU.Advantages: -Amazing CGI -Good Directing, Cinematic -Epic fight-duels and large-scale battle -Good actor's performance and preety actress -Based on Greek Mythology, representing a fantastical world right underneath usDisadvantages: -Some bad dialogues -Perhaps a bit more explanations -More character development -More realistic in some scenesI hope there is an epic sequel, which keeps all of the advantages and turns the disadvantages into more advantages and I am sure, that DC will do so. Be sure to watch this amazing movie in the cinemas. To sum up it is a worth watching movie with epic cinematography. Every frame feels like a painting worth sitting in. Must see movie.
