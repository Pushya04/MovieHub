"""Carrie"" marked Brian De Palma's breakthrough","It is a classic offbeat horror-melodrama merging harmoniously the family Gothic extravaganza, supernatural power, and a woman's movie of a peculiar kind It remains the cinema's best adaptation of a Stephen King novelThe film initiated De Palma's inclination for surprise diverts between playful imagination and reality, as in the opening, which swifts from a soft-core porn fantasia of girls taking a shower in the locker room to the fact of Carrie's menstruation for the first timethe first sign of ""otherness"" that will reserve her as an horrifying monster from her small-minded colleaguesAll the oppression that Carrie undergoes both at home (with a bible beating maniacal mother played by scary Piper Laurie who develops twisted bizarre ideas) and at school to suppress tension which takes the shape of super telekinetic power, the ability to move objects with the strength of her mind We observe with ambivalence as Carrie's insatiable revenge jumps the line into uncontrolled mass murders ever filmedSissy Spacek is amazing as the mocked, helpless girl pushed over the edge Her face and body twist like a living special effect to unleash her pent up rage, as well as her character's alarming progress from painfully shy high-school teenager to Angel of Vengeance",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie: 8/10,"Carrie boomed Sissy Spacek's and John Travolta's career. I understand why.Carrie starts off at a gym locker room, where we find out how much the other kids hate Carrie. But, we find out that Carrie has some powers. Like in other Stephen King book-movies, the supernatural aspect is only minor compared to the rest of the story, but it comes into play at the end. Carrie's mom (Piper Laurie) is an over-protective religious zealot who makes The Royal Tenenbaums seem normal. So Carrie tries to cope with her horrible life, but it's getting tougher and tougher.Spacek is exceptional as Carrie, and I now know why she was nominated for Best Actress. Her emotions are real, not some fake tear drops that make us think she's sad. Either she has great motivation, or she's one of the best actresses of the century (or both!). Laurie was equally good as her mother who locks Carrie up in a closet everytime she thinks that Carrie has sinned. This movie wouldn't be half of what it was if the acting wasn't so great. When Carrie was sad, you were sad. When the other kids ridiculed her, you felt like you wanted to kill the kids. When she smiled, you smiled. Emotions that raw couldn't come from just any movie.If you know me, I'm a stickler for character developement. Carrie didn't take much time, but from the opening scene you knew about Carrie and her weakness. So are the secondary characters; they're nicely developed even if their role isn't that major. Travolta had a miniscule role, but he was fine in it; it led to Grease and Saturday Night Fever.The prom scene has got to be one of the most memorable scenes from a horror movie. That red tint is awesome; it's like a premonition. In fact, the movie is full of premonition: the red tint, the freaky looking voodoo doll, ""They're all going to laugh at you."" I'm assuming that director Brian De Palma meant to put that in, so it just isn't about some supernatural powers, it's also about foreshadowing. Also, I dig that camera movement during the dancing.The blood and gore wasn't held back, but they just put in what was necessary. De Palma obviously stole from Hitchcock's Psycho, mainly the music cue whenever Carrie is using her telepathy. Also, her school, Bates High, is another Psycho refrence.Carrie was also very creepy. It wasn't a thrill-a-minute, but at the ending, that was Scary with a capital S. The last ten or twenty minutes were scare-inducing for sure. That last jump scene in the dream...wow! It's still jumping at me. If there was one complaint I had to do about the movie, it's that it took too much time to get to main scene and the prom went on a little too long, but other than that it's a first class horrror/thriller that any horror buff needs to see.My rating: 8/10Rated R for nudity, some language, and blood.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Anyone who expected just another horror movie is obviously dissapointed!,"I just came back from a special showing of Carrie in the student's cinema of my university and I must say one thing: THANK YOU to the director, for this is one of the best, most moving films I've ever seen. I honestly don't understand the ""it's not scary"" mentality!Now, whether you want to call this horror film or thriller or whatever else is up to you, but I think Carrie's scope cannot reaches beyond just one genre! It is a thriller, but at the same time a very humane movie. You can feel the girl hurting, you hate her mother, you dislike her friends! This movie wasn't made for cheap scares: every scene is brilliantly captured. The scary parts may be rare but when they are there you just can't move from your seat!The acting is also excellent, Sissy Spacek of course deserving most of the credit, but that is not to say that the other actors aren't great too.Concerning the script, all the credit goes of course to Stephen King. When you see this movie you can really tell the difference between an artist like him an some cheap Hollywood writer (Scream?). There is so much more to the story than: -Booooo! -Aaaaaa!So, if you want to see a ""scary movie"", go see Scream or some other shallow horror film. However if you are looking for a terrifying but also moving film, Carrie is just right for you. And please, if you must put this work of art into one genre, its  better if you put it in social drama rather than horror film. Of course it's not scary! It's MUCH more than just that.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
the original and best,"Watching the TV remake of Carrie last week just made me miss the original version all the more. There were so many elements that made the 1976 movie a classic, but I will try to name just a few...First of all, the original actresses could never be replaced. Sissy Spacek as Carrie White goes without saying. Sissy gave Carrie a child-like quality that no other actress can touch. You not only root for Spacek's Carrie, but you want to reach in and hug her. Equally irreplacable was Piper Laurie who brings a manic energy to her role as the religious-wacko Mrs. White. I loved how Piper and Sissy's southern accents enhanced their characters. I don't know if it was Stephen King's intention or not, but the way Carrie said ""Momma"" was just so southern. It was fun seeing Piper and Sissy reunited onscreen as southern sisters in the Grass Harp.Two supporting actresses in the film who get little credit are Amy Irving and Betty Buckley. Irving brought an intelligent, thoughtful depth to the character of Sue Snell. Buckley as the caring gym teacher stole every scene she was in. One of the most touching moments was Miss Collins taking Carrie in front of the mirror and telling her that she is a pretty girl. Then the terrible realization on her face as she wonders if it is another cruel joke. And who didn't love it when Buckley slapped Nancy Allen's face?Maybe the single most important element in Carrie is the suspense-building music. I can't express how perfectly the music framed every scene. It should have won an oscar for the soundtrack alone. The two beautiful themes still stick in my mind, ""Born To Have It All"" which was playing in the shower scene and ""I Never Dreamed Someone Like You (Could Love Someone Like Me)"" which Carrie and Tommy danced to at the prom. Even the cheesy band playing at the prom fit the mood just right with the lyrics, ""The Devil's Got a Hold Of Your Soul"".Carrie is campy nostalgia. It really is a time capsule of that era in history. The polyester, the gym shorts and knee socks, the afros and farrah-hair just take you back to 1976. Where else can you see the stars of Welcome Back Kotter and Eight Is Enough in the same movie?",,Anonymous,Horror
A classic!,"Perhaps one of the only genuinely good Stephen King adaptations, Carrie' follows the tragic tale of Carrie White (Sissy Spacek), a young girl who is continually made to suffer at the hands of her bullying classmates and not helped by her overbearing, religious mother Margaret (Piper Laurie). Carrie, however, is not like regular teenagers as she has been blessed(?) with telekinetic powers and as the inner rage grows within Carrie so, it seems, do these potentially lethal abilities.Brian De Palma directed this amazingly stylish adaptation of Stephen King's first novel which is arguably the best Stephen King adaptation ever to be made. Sissy Spacek's performance is one of the greatest to ever grace a horror film. Somehow managing to perfectly embody the typical school life of the usual high school outcasts, Spacek was able to bring to everyone the appalling life that so many teenagers are forced to tolerate. From the opening scenes where Carrie is utterly humiliated at the hands of her classmates after Carrie's hysterical reaction to her first menstruation, to the painfully wretched ending it becomes nigh on impossible not to sympathise with Spacek's character. Spacek was quite rightly Oscar-nominated for this performance. Spacek's performance was enhanced by fellow Oscar-nominee Piper Laurie in the role of the religious-nut Margaret White. In some ways the naivety shown towards Carrie and what is happening to her is amusing but at the same time it is terrifying to think that any mother could allow her daughter to go though such a generally horrendous life. Piper Laurie was able to make this all too abhorrent character her own with a thoroughly convincing and unsettling performance.De Palma cleverly directs this movie. Instead of immediately introducing us to Carrie's powers he focuses on the torment (and the tormentors) of Carrie first. This allows the viewer to feel for Carrie and will her towards revenge while ensuring that she is not made into a one-dimensional killer. The movie is very well paced and is presented in a brutally clear fashion. De Palma refrains from using any visual effects with the exception of the infamous `Prom Night' scene which was incredibly well crafted and immersed the viewer in this horrifying display of rage. The final twenty minutes of Carrie are some of the most intense and gripping moments to have been portrayed in horror cinema. These scenes without a doubt helped to build one of the most artistic and and incredible climaxes in all of film.Carrie' is not for those who just want to see people sliced up or prefer fast-paced horror as it is presented as a heart-breaking drama with a horrifying twist. The magnificent cast (which features John Travolta in an early role) was also graced with fantastic performances from Betty Buckley as the kindly gym teacher and Nancy Allen as Chris, the deplorable ring leader of this atrocious bullying. In my opinion Carrie' is unquestionably worth a look for horror fans. 'Carrie' is very well directed, with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror. My rating for Carrie'  9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
MELDING OF TWO GREAT ARTISTS,"""Carrie"" is a melding of two great artists, in this case, Stephen King, who wrote the novel and Brian DePalma, who directed the film. This is a tense, exciting thriller that is also a sturdy character study. It's hard to make a film that can accomplish both, but DePalma does it.King's novel mostly dealt with a telekinetic girl who is cruelly treated by her classmates. DePalma and screenwriter Lawrence Cohen follow the novel fairly closely, with the exception of the ending, which is a great deal more sensationalistic and better, in my opinion. (King himself liked the finale and the film, as stated in his exceptional study of the horror genre ""Danse Macabre"")As is the case in most DePalma films, the technical credits are superb. The cinematography (by Mario Tosi)is extremely effective; colors and shadows have never been shot more effectively in a DePalma film since. The film score is by Pino Donaggio, and it marks the first collaboration between Donaggio and DePalma. (Bernard Herrmann died shortly after ""Obsession"" was completed) Donaggio is among the most underrated and overlooked composers of his time. His scores for ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Blow Out"" and ""Body Double"" are all exceptional and all deserved Oscars. ""Carrie"" is no less brilliant, as it accomplishes what all great scores are supposed to do: enhance the film without giving anything away. Paul Hirsch's editing is also extremely effective as it was in ""Sisters"", ""Obsession"", ""Blow Out"" and ""Raising Cain"".But it is the performances that make ""Carrie"" stand out. Carrie is played by Sissy Spacek in a performance of such power and strength that she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (the first actress ever to be nominated for a horror film; the second would be Sigourney Weaver for ""Aliens"")She manages to hit all the right notes. A lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama. Spacek plays the role more realistically and the film is much more effective that way. (Just in case you didn't know, Spacek was a DePalma regular, but off-screen; she was the art director for several of his early pictures). Also, ""Carrie"" marked the return of Piper Laurie to films after a too-long hiatus (her last credit was ""The Hustler"") Here, she plays Carrie's mother. Again, a lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama, but Laurie resists the temptation. Her performance is a real knockout and also garned an Oscar nomination (she should have won, but typical Academy genius set in and gave the prize to Beatrice Straight who was in ""Network"" for a whopping 10 minutes and really didn't do much.)Also, as a side note, this film also is a start for some future DePalma regulars such as John Travolta (his first major studio film) and Nancy Allen (her first major role)What I really liked about ""Carrie"" is the absolutely perfect ending. I had commented before that ""Sisters"" had an absolutely perfect ending. The one thing about Brian DePalma is that he knows how to end a picture. ""Dressed to Kill"" had a really good one, although some people hated it as well as ""Blow Out"". ""The Fury"" has the greatest ending of all the DePalma thrillers.A small note to finish: In 1999, ""Carrie 2"" was made by profiteers at MGM. Despite a rich premise, the film was an artistic failure.  DePalma had nothing to worry about. The sequel (retread might be a better word) lacks everything that makes DePalma's original so good. Rent or buy the original, on tape (in pan-and-scan or widescreen)and DVD (widescreen)and forget the sequel, even if they give it away.**** out of 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best teen horror films.,"This movie is famous for being really scary but while it is that,the story is not as scary as it is sad. It's about a bullied misfit in 1970s high school with special paranormal abilities. The conditions for the story start from bad at the beginning, then it slowly climbs towards good by the climax, when it suddenly drops down to bad again and gets worse to a very sad ending. The climax scene is pretty effective with being frightening by being really chaotic and really brutal. The last few scenes are definitely the scariest,saddest, and most powerful. The story is very moving, so you can see why it's a classic. The direction and screenplay are kind of average until we get to the prom scene, but then they get really good. The effects and music are also very scary, but the music sounds exactly like that of Psycho. I thought this was a great film, but more of a tragedy then a horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A classic, in its own right.","A few years ago, I saw the modern remake of this same film. Now it's finally time for this one, which I just saw a few minutes ago. Made in 1976, the film became a classic and has survived the test of time. In fact, I would say that it is one of those old horror films that any fan of the genre must see.I will not go on too long to describe the story, I think it is well known. It was inspired by an original Stephen King novel (according to the information available here, the writer really liked this film, and even considered the ending to be better than the one he had originally written), tells the story of Carrie White, a young teenager who is extremely naive and who has lived all her life under the supervision of her mother, overprotective and religious fanatic, obsessed with the sin of the flesh and the weakness of the female sex. She is the target of mockery from schoolmates and it gets worse after she panics with her first menstruation, in the gym locker room. She simply knew nothing about her own body and sexuality because the mother was sure that a sinless woman (as her daughter had to be) would never be ""tainted"" by the blood that, for her, was the mark of Eva's original sin. Well, things get worse from there, with Carrie discovering that she has telekinetic powers amplified by fear or anger, and an anthological ending in a prom that goes terribly wrong.The secret to the success of this film is largely due to the main character. For us, it is clear that Carrie is a victim: victim of a wicked and crazy mother who mistreats her and carries on a permanent psychological terror; victim of cynical and selfish schoolmates who never think of the reasons why she behaves that way and never give her a chance to integrate; and finally victim of an extremely rare mental power that she doesn't know well or know how to control. Carrie is never truly a bad person or a wicked being. She has no pleasure in the pain of others, she is the one who is suffering. It moves us, it causes a strong empathy with the character, which we would like to help. The way it all ends seems filled with a poetic justice that also satisfies us, despite feeling for Carrie, and seeing that she will never be understood by anyone.Sissy Spacek was extraordinary in her work and obtained, in this film, her great work as an actress. Despite continuing and making other films, it is Carrie who immortalizes Spacek and makes her memorable. She gave the character a lot of psychological depth and drama, as well as having the strength for some nude scenes so brutal, due to their harshness, that other actresses with more experience would surely refuse them without thinking twice. The film also features the participation of Piper Laurie (in the role of Carrie's mother), Amy Irving and John Travolta.Directed by Brian De Palma, a director recognized for his meticulous spirit and attention to detail, its a film with good production values and an excellent pace, with time for everything, without haste or speed. Cinematography deserves a close look with a series of truly successful moments, from the use of colors (white and red, as at the prom) to the work of the camera (the scenes at the prom, the kaleidoscope, the punctual resource to division of the screen), everything was extremely thought out and done with great care. For more than one occasion, the film ""blinks the eye"" to Hitchcock, the most evident feature being the famous sound effect of the film ""Psycho"", used here by De Palma. The sound, visual and special effects worked perfectly, even though the fire in the house, at the end of the film, makes it quite evident that the house is a miniature and not a real building, all it takes is a certain sense of scale. The costumes also deserve applause, they fit perfectly into the big picture. The soundtrack, by Pino Donaggio, is one of the most beautiful in classic horror cinema. Truly a magnificent melody that is in the ear.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Though cluttered up with crass humor, De Palma's trashy flair and killer instincts make this a classic screamer...","When picked-on high schooler Carrie White discovers to her horror that she's been made the butt of a nasty prank, she unleashes her secret powers at the school prom and all hell literally comes loose. This sequence, filmed in split-screen, is a canny marvel of technical wizardry, twisted imagination and production design (check out that gorgeous blaze that erupts behind Sissy Spacek). The cinematographer lights everything up like fluorescent goodies in a candy-box (the continuity problems with Carrie's appearance here can be overlooked). But Carrie's anger is all encompassing--it's a high school holocaust--and some of her victims are innocents, like the gym teacher (played very sensitively by Betty Buckley). Carrie has become as bad as her enemies, and director Brian De Palma doesn't seem to understand the irony (he's also too interested in girl-peeping, although to his credit nobody comes off looking foolish). The picture is fun on the surface, but has a depressing undermining that is never quite resolved. Spacek's performance in the lead is flawless; Piper Laurie exceptional as her deranged mother (it was her comeback role, Oscar-nominated, yet it nearly typed her as a horror-movie actress); Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles, and William Katt are excellent as Carrie's classmates; Amy Irving is intriguing as schoolmate Sue who just wants to do the right thing (Pauline Kael of The New Yorker complained that Sue's role in the disaster wasn't made clear, but I disagree. I think she's conflicted and guilty and wants to help, wants to see Carrie bask in some of the glory which she helped create). Although an improvement over the Stephen King source novel, ""Carrie"" isn't perfect and is weighed down somewhat with dirty jokes and cheap laughs. Certainly it is a stylish picture, with beautiful (if repetitive) music by Pino Donaggio, and the final sequence is still being copied today. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sissy Spacek perfect,"Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is an introverted isolated girl. She gets picked on by all the other girls.

The plan triggers Carrie's supernatural powers.Director Brian De Palma makes this Stephen King story into a prom epic. The scene is iconic. However this movie is more than just one scene.

Carrie,"Now this Stephen King's horror classic has been confirmed for a remake which stars Chloë Grace Moretz and my diva Julianne Moore (highly likely to take on the role of the religion- maniac mother), both reinterpret two Oscar-nominated performances from Spacek and Laurie, with the juicy fodder, a belated Oscar finally seems to be approaching for my goddess (finger crossed). So it seems to be a properly perfect time for me to watch the original version for the very first time.Brian De Palma, has been considered Hitchcock at his time by his devotees, the similarity is both haven't received much awards-crammed recognition, but arguably De Palma is a lesser player as his oeuvre encompasses more run-of-the-mills, but CARRIE is by any standards not among them, and it could be his PSYCHO (1960) because De Palma shows off his artistry in a full-fledged sweep. For instance, there are many eye-dropping stunts: the opening credit, slow-motion of volleyball girl's changing room until Carrie's first bloody period running through her fingers; the multi-prisms perspective images after the blood splattering all over Carrie after a long-stewed happiness-hanging-by-a-thread preparation; the havoc of massacre at the prom is more supernaturally gratifying than scary.The mother-daughter face-off and subsequent house caving into debris scenes may be attributed to produce a more crowd-please impression (despite of its low-budget SFX and the well-expected surprise at the coda), the film could hardly be pigeonholed as a horrorfest, as Carrie is ubiquitous in every school, every class, a bully-defying story has much more drama empathy even after 35 years after its debut, which could nicely explain the ground for a remake now.Sissy Spacek is against the grain to portray a teenage girl due to her actual 27 years old age, the immense age difference is rarely perceivable if one doesn't know it before and Ms. Spacek is on fire in it, renders an extraordinary transformation from vulnerability to malice. Piper Laurie as well doesn't betray her Oscar nomination to give birth to a conflicting mother role which is hauntingly unforgettable. All in all, thanks to Stephen King's story to surmount many genre clichés and continue to stagger us with the rosy remake in 2013.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I guess that's it?,"I'm really not sure what I'm supposed to take away from this.As in, I understand the feminist interpretations, the religious symbolism (really how could you not) and all that, and I very much understand that Brian De Palma is just a little bit of a creep, but what I don't understand is why I should care about any of it.What I mean by this is that this film feels less like a horror film and more like a really average and boring high school drama for nearly the entire runtime, with an admittedly really great finale, but still one where I don't care about any of the characters. And yes, obviously you're not supposed to care about any of the bullies, but I don't care about Carrie, or Tommy, or Miss Collins, or anyone else either.It has a pretty serious case of Tomb Raider syndrome, where the writers seem to expect you to care about the protagonist based purely on how much trauma/damage she endures, which I quite simply don't. And when I don't care about any of the characters, and the plot is completely indistinguishable from any other high school film where the shy girl comes out of her shell - at least until the very end, then I just can't fathom why this is still considered one of the best Stephen King adaptations - or hell, even one of the best horror films of all time.It's got some good direction, and Sissy Spacek does sell the character really well, but that's honestly kind of it for what I can say I found really impressive.And man is Brian De Palma creepy in that opening scene...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
the first post-modern horror film,"At its heart, Carrie is not a 'horror film', but a film about horror.The subject matter is physical and emotional abuse; time and time again DePalma returns to the theme of abuse to create a sense of anxiety and dread.  And although our hapless heroine is the primary target of abuse (from her mother, her peers, and 'authority') abuse is also meted out liberally to others---violence against women (Travolta/Allen), and public humiliation by authority figures (Buckley/her gym class) also add to the discomfort level  (the John Travolta-Nancy Allen relationship is defined solely by abuse---and they in turn are the initiators of Carrie's humiliation).Except for Betty Buckley's gym teacher, all the characters are cartoonish archetypes---and almost all of these achetypes are brilliantly drawn. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie deservedly have been singled out for praise, but DePalma even managed to get the right performance out of decidedly untalented performers like Nancy Allen, William Katt (who is immeasurably aided by the kind of meticulous lighting that would have made Joan Crawford envious), and P.J. Soles.Buckley deserves special mention, because she does amazing things with a completely underwritten role.  By humanizing what could have been just one more cartoon (the lesbian gym teacher---lesbianism is never mentioned, but Buckley's subtle performance affirms what she has acknowledged in interviews--that she played her character as a lesbian) she provides a central point of reality that keeps the film from spinning completely out of control.DePalma's intent was clearly not to scare the audience, but to make the audience watch the film from a distance, deliberately plagarizing two of the most notable sequences in film history---Hitchcock's shower sequence and Eisenstein's use of the three-perspective split screen.  The shower scene takes place early in the film, cuing the audience into the fact that this is a film ABOUT film.  And in the climactic prom sequence, DePalma distances himself, and the audience, from the bloodbath on the screen by reminding us through the 'theft' from Eisenstein that its just a movie at the most critical moment.There are two significant flaws in the film.  For some reason, DePalma interjected a 'fast forward' comedy sequence involving the purchase of tuxedos--the sequence serves no purpose in the film, other than to restate the obvious fact that this is 'just a movie'.The second flaw is Amy Irving's performance.  Its not horrible by any means, but it just doesn't work.  Irving has grown as an actress since then (she was the only decent thing about the execrable sequel to Carrie) but the demands made of her in Carrie were beyond her skills at the time it was made.  'Chris' was supposed to be the conscience of the film, but winds up as wishy-washy.Oh, and DON'T watch this film on commercial television--rent the video. DePalma engages in some sacriligeous imagery that is ALWAYS cut from the film when it is shown on television---imagery that justifies the penultimate sequence of the film itself, and brings closure to it.",,Anonymous,Horror
One of DePalma's best,"High school misfit Carrie (Sissy Spacek) unleashes her telekinetic fury on her tormentors. This was a huge hit in 1976 and scared e silly. It doesn't scare me now (except for the closing sequence), but I still think it's a good solid horror film beautifully handled by Brian De Palma. It moves quickly, has some beautiful imagery (everything is shot in soft focus with muted color) and has almost uniformally good performances. The only bad one is by John Travolta way out of his depth playing a hood.Amy Irving (as a student who befriends Carrie), William Katt (with a very 70s afro), Nancy Allen (playing a real bitch), Betty Buckley (so young and full of energy) and P. J. Soles (silly but bearable) are all perfect. But Spacek is superb matched by Piper Laurie who is very scary and marvelous as her deranged, religious mother.Also the film is (by today's standards) very restrained in terms of
blood and gore. And the final sequence will make you jump (also notice
the cars in the background during that--they're moving backwards!)Only complaints--De Palma REALLY hates some of the high school
kids--you feel like like he's working out some personal issues here.And did we really need the slow-mo shower sequence at the beginning?That aside--this is a great film. See it letter boxed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amateurish,"This film probably speaks to anyone who was bullied or humiliated in high school, and there's great power in its well-known dramatic scene. It's entertaining in a campy sort of way, but Stephen King's writing and Brian De Palma's direction are both so unsubtle that the interesting premise isn't very elevated in execution. That's too bad, because Sissy Spacek is memorable as the title character, Piper Laurie is strong as her overbearing mother, and there are several others in the supporting cast of interest, including John Travolta and Amy Irving.Unfortunately, the story is too simple, and its characters are too extreme. The mother practices religion straight out of the 16th century, the kids in high school are so cruel they'll kill a pig with a sledgehammer, and it's not enough that the picked on girl is so awkward, she also has to have an incredibly powerful psychic ability. Meanwhile De Palma's ogling in the ridiculous shower scene, obsession with referencing Hitchcock, and tendency to prolong scenes gave the film an amateur feeling. Loved the jump scare towards the end, that was a nice touch, and this film is worth seeing, but it's far from great.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Outstanding horror/teen drama with a fantastic 70's atmosphere.,"Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a misunderstood young high schooler with a freakishly obsessive Catholic mother (an amazing performance by Piper Laurie) who borders on Neo-Nazi. She is horribly bullied at her high school, especially by the sadistic Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen), and basically ignored by every person who isn't putting her down. So when token nice girl Sue Snell (Amy Irving) decides she wants to build Carrie's confidence by giving up her place at the prom and telling her kind hearted jock boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to invite Carrie, Carrie's mentor Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) smells trouble. Sue promises all is well and Tommy ad Carrie run along to the prom. But when Chris and her dimwitted boyfriend Billy (John Travolta's second role) devise a horrible and humiliating prank, they don't take into account what has manifested inside of Carrie after all those years of torment, and how it will effect them in the films horrifying and very memorable climax.Brian De Palma's famous horror film, adapted from Stephen King's chilling novel, is often noted as the ultimate in teenage revenge films. De Palma used his distinctive style to make a chilling and original horror film that really is the best example of 1970's horror, the style, music, clothes, acting, dialogue and pretty much everything in the film is like a time-warp. The editing very original and you can tell the makers of the film enjoyed creating it.The acting is very fine, some of the best in any horror film out there. Sissy Spacek is great as the sympathetic freak, but at times you wanna slap her, she's so incredibly pathetic. Like when she's screaming about her period, running around nude. I can understand that she didn't realise what was happening, but running around like a lunatic, and bleeding on people through your vagina isn't gonna inspire sympathy from them. But since I read the book, I understand that was the intention. Piper Lurie was absolutely fantastic as the looney mother, and all the other performances were pretty passable. I have to mention PJ Soles. Her character was so awesome, I'd even go as far a to say that she was one of the (many) highlights of the film. Her character added a quirky charm the film that couldn't be matched by anybody else.Some of the themes explored was Carrie's journey into adulthood, shown through the way she learnt to control her powers and discovering different parts of her body and different things she can do, most obviously her first period and her telekinesis.Overall, CARRIE is an outstanding horror/drama. Any horror fan, or general film fan should check it out. 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Age of the actors,It's a decent movie the problem with this movie along with movies at that time the get actors that are in their mid-twenties or early thirties to play teenagers and most look older than the teachers and administrators. It's just not realistic in that way Sissy was 26 playing Carrie who was in the book 9-10 years younger and you could see this woman trying to play a kid. Same with most of the cast unfortunately that's what they do in Hollywood. If you want adults to play kids narrow the age gap so it's not so obvious to the paying audience. The movie follows closely to the book which is not the case with most movies that adapt a book to play as a movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kinetic Energy,"Youthful energy. That's what this is -- and what it is about.Spacek, King and Depalma are all at their most committed exuberance. Sometimes callow, but sometimes so rawly honest one often tingles quite apart from the story. See it on this basis alone. DePalma's  camera has a sense of dance -- Scorcese does too, but DePalma's is more emotional. Spacek is so clean in her acting that her ability frightens. How strange it went away, like a poltergism.The story has a haunting tone, also centered on youth and yearning. Menarche as a horror, the innocent acceptance/fear of the basest religion, the brash director intelligently spoofing Hitchcock. Odd mix that, so an odd and intriguing experience.",,Anonymous,Horror
"This ""Carrie"" is all that's needed, thank you.","The story's been oft-told, with a string of remakes and sequels, but this original version stands alone. It's the combination of direction, writing, musical score and powerhouse acting that makes 1976's ""Carrie"" the only one that was really necessary. A talented filmmaker, Brian DePalma's signature touches are all there, (including his brief gratuitous, softly-focused nudie shots for which I deducted a star....okay, it sounds prudish in 2019, but they're unnecessary and don't add anything, except maybe for horny guys.) Still, the overall result deserves its classic status, largely due to the cast. Even the secondary performances are natural, with standouts by Betty Buckley and Amy Irving. But it's Piper Laurie and, even more so, Sissy Spacek who run away with this movie--though she lost that year's Oscar to Faye Dunaway, Spacek was compensated with other 1976 Best Actress awards, including the prestigious New York Film Critics' prize. The screenplay allows for more character development than most similar films.....it isn't bogged down with unnecessary shocks and gore. For the most part, Spacek doesn't play her as a creepy ""horror icon""----her Carrie White is sweet, sad and heartbreaking, and you just want to hug her and make everything better for her. In fact, as a 20-year-old back in 1976, I kinda fell for Spacek as she began to bloom at the prom. (Ironically, the cheesy way the film is usually advertised---with the grisly shot of the blood-soaked Carrie---doesn't do justice to her multilayered character.) Please, Hollywood, no more versions of ""Carrie"".....this original is all that's needed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Superb Movie, this is how horror should be!","When we think of horror, we think of ""slasher"". We think of Ghostface running around stabbing people, and we ""Whats New"", or of Leatherface, swinging his Chainsaw into the sunset, and we think ""Thats Campy"" or of Jason haunting the camp he died at, and we think ""Well, thats nothing new!"". But, then we see Carrie, and we think ""Oh...my...god...!""Carrie, directed by the wonderful, talented Brain DePalmer, was actually a book, by, Stephen King. With these two minds at work, how could we not get something totally incredible? Carrie, isn't just another horror movie. It is a old idea, finally brought to the screen for millions to watch. The reason it is so good is because it is done so perfect, and it is done so delicately, and mad to tenderly...that the finishing product throws a movie at you that you didn't expect.Carrie, is our typical high-school misfit. She is mad fun of bye the lots of peers (the popular kids?) and the ones that don't make fun of her, probably are the ones spreading the nasty rumors. To make matters worse, the place were everyone should feel safe, her home, is just another living nightmare, making school a warm-up for her. She lives with a religious fanatic mother, who has her fare share of problems as well. All along, Chris Hargenson, accompanied with her boyfriend Billy Nolen, have a deadly surprise waiting for Carrie, and the most important night of her life...that will change everything, forever! But what everyone doesn't know, is that she has powers to move things!Now, after reading that dry, one dimensional summary, you might not think it is that good, but you must watch the movie, the you will know.What makes this movie great is it isn't just a horror movie, but a drama...the interactions between everyone, the good that people do, that only ends up causing more chaos. How truly evil people can really be, and...making the unbelievable, believable. Carrie has so many levels and hidden things, you might want to watch three times to really see it for what it is worth, not just a horror, but almost the study of humans...of course, it is very scary, indeed. You might also want to bring a pillow...just in case.The movie fast-paced, but wonderful telling of Carries life, just sets the tone. Starring Sisspy Spacek, who does a job nobody else could do with the role of Carrie, really will make you think. It also stars Piper Laurie, queen of the stage, playing Carries crazy mother. Her performance is done with so much power, it will make you shiver. Meanwhile, the rest of the cast does a wonderful job, and keeps you on your feet with Betty Buckly, Nancy Allen, who does a wonderful job portraying your classic, high-school bully, Amy Irving, as the kind-hearted, but misguided, Sue Snell, William Katt, as Tommy, Sues kind-hearted boyfriend, Jon Travolter, as Billy, and PJ Soles, who always shines no matter what role she is playing.Watch Carrie today!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sad fact of life,"I remember reading the book in 6th grade and feeling so very close to Carrie. I was the outcast for all of my schools, no matter where we moved the monsters would find me. I wished so hard for powers of my own, but I never got them. This is a wonderfully done film, and a true landmark of its kind. While the fashions and music have dated considerably, it's still a great study of how our culture eats its young alive, and even encourages victimization of others, through religious intolerance, social class, perceived intelligence as a threat, and on and on. The true ugliness of American culture is all here, and we hope you like what you see. The sad fact is, most of us nerds never get our day, we just quietly die in bedrooms and hang from swingsets. We are the ones who get punished for ""acting out"" when simply trying to defend ourselves from butt holes. Those same jerks never get anything more than a slap on the wrist, while we get suspended. Is it any wonder why so many of us die young?! Some of us choose to take a few of our tormentors with us, but let's be honest, the Columbine Kids just couldn't AIM. That's the real tragedy, not a bunch of privileged snots. Carrie avenged us all.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror movie that isn't so horrible.,"The movie ""Carrie"" has an excellent reputation as an horror movie. It's been selected as one of the best horror movies of all time by some British people and its sequel has been made after almost thirty years. So, when I started watching it, it was with great anticipation and a blanket to hide in the unbearable scenes.But you know what? Carrie is not scary at all. Except the last ten minutes and a couple of scenes in the beginning, the story is told as if it were some kind of a Cinderella story. I was watching it with a couple of ten-year-old kids in my house, and I had to literally scream at them to stop asking when it was going to get scary. They were a little scared when Carrie was using her supernatural powers covered in pig's blood, but not too scared. On the other hand, I found myself enjoying the romantic sentiments of the movie; I know I shouldn't but I did. If you take out the last part of the movie, you've got yourself a nice ugly duckling story. I wonder why the movie was made as horror and not a romantic comedy. It's basically what this movie is about for most of the time. Also there are some religious references that might offend some of the viewers.In conclusion, it's a unworthy horror movie. In fact, it's an unworthy movie. If you're trying to catch a horror flick, just pick any other horror movie instead of this one. You won't miss very much. I promise. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie hosts possibly the most memorable prom scene in Hollywood's history.,"If you haven't seen it, then you've atleast heard of it. The moment a timid innocent girl is titled prom queen before she causes catastrophic chaos nearly wiping out her entire year group. Best. Prom. Ever. Glitzy sequin dresses aside, there are subtle subtextual layers that really elevates this supernatural horror into classic status. A shy bullied girl named Carrie White is invited to prom, however she soon discovers that she has the power of telekinesis. The coming-of-age tropes outweigh the horror elements, granted there are scenes of gore and supernatural violence but these are incredibly dated now. It's how Carrie evolves as a young girl that truly captivates. Her first period, dealing with her fanatical religious mother and overcoming bullying, for its 98 minute runtime you see Carrie rapidly evolve as a character. The religious allegories that are presented, Carrie and her mother depicting Satan and Jesus respectively, works well the themes of maturity and motherhood. It's a spellbinding human portrait, expertly directed by De Palma. That prom scene was nothing short of genius. The five minute rotational dance sequence, the over excessive slow motion, cross cuts and excellent use of props. The whole narrative built up to that final act, and it did so with bravura. Spacek gave an expressive performance, intelligently using her eyes to capture the fury and anger within Carrie. But it's Laurie who steals the show, professing her adoration for God and repenting her sins by abusing Carrie. Their final scene together was poetic. Cohen's screenplay surprisingly embeds tongue-in-cheek humour, particularly with the character of Miss Collins, making the first act feel more like a teen high school film. The sudden shift in tone later on felt seamless. De Palma did use some detractors, his utilisation of slow motion stretched out the prom scene substantially yet adding nothing. Also further exploration into the motherly bond with Carrie would've made for a more sinister turn at the end. However this still remains a supernatural classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A genuinely scary movie, but also one with heart","One of Brian DePalma's better movies, in fact scratch that it is probably the best film of DePalma's career, Carrie is a classic of its genre. I also think it is an example of the film being better than source material. The book, written by Stephen King, is good, the film is a classic.Carrie does have some genuine scary jolts and unsettling moments, such as the crucifixion which is thrilling and unforgettable and the ending which still shocks me. But it also has heart, as there are some poignant scenes, especially as Sissy Spacek's performance is so heart-breakingly good. Piper Laurie is also brilliant, and it was quite nice to see John Travolta too.DePalma's direction is taut, the script is tense and lyrical and the story despite being much copied never loses its impact or focus. Stylistically and visually, Carrie is a triumph too; I loved the cinematography and the scenery and the lighting just added to the atmosphere which was consistently amazing.So all in all, truly excellent movie. While it is scary and shocking, it also manages to have an edge of poignancy and humanity too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The imagery of ""Carrie"" will stay with you despite its imperfections","Everything that makes high school an evil, evil place comes to the forefront in ""Carrie,"" or at least all the worst possible combinations of things that could literally make high school hell. Brian De Palma brings Stephen King's first novel to life as part coming-of-age drama, part obnoxious high school movie and part horror film in a way that's at times messy, but visually lasting and highly memorable.Unexpectedly, the film's title sequence takes place in a girls locker room where we get a barrage of full-frontal nudity followed by star Sissy Spacek erotically soaping herself in the shower and discovering that she's bleeding for the first time. The sudden change in tone sets the expectation for the shock factor that pervades the rest of the film, and De Palma portrays Carrie's consequent freak out and the subsequent bullying she endures from her peers with a certain surreal turbulence that will also make repeat appearance.Carrie has it rough. In addition to being bullied at school, her mother (Piper Laurie) is a religious nut who abuses her regularly, forcing her into a ""prayer closet"" for sins she hasn't committed. To complicate matters, she's started to develop telekinetic abilities. All this starts to set the perfect storm in motion for Carrie to completely lose it.Amazing, then, that despite all the foreboding, De Palma convinces us at times that things are looking up for Carrie. When one of the girls who bullied Carrie in the shower, Sue (Amy Irving), has a change of heart and convinces her prom date, Tommy (William Katt) to take Carrie to the prom instead, it seems like misguided and disingenuous help, but over time we come to believe Tommy sees Carrie in a new light. Suddenly things are looking up, even though we know that Chris (Nancy Allen), the girl still bitter about being punished for tormenting Carrie, has a nasty surprise in store for her that will quickly change things.In the script, we lose Carrie at times for these lesser supporting roles, including Chris' boy toy played by John Travolta right before ""Saturday Night Fever"" launched him to fame. Carrie is prime for a cinematic character study, but the film doesn't go in that direction nearly enough. As such, Carrie becomes the object of pity instead of empathy. And her mother simply acts like a zealot, so by the time we finally start to understand her, it's too late.It's a stretch to call ""Carrie"" a horror film; most of it is an exercise in effective foreshadow because we know all these circumstances will lead to something bad, but not until the end does it get a bit gruesome (though not nearly gruesome enough). Even so, the images are more creepy than terrifying. De Palma doesn't scare us so much as shock us with images we won't soon forget. There's a reason that to this day, everyone talks about the prom scene in ""Carrie.""Spacek also has an important role to play in the memorability of the film. Her performance certainly works as a sheltered girl dominated by her mother and shunned by her peers, but her looks contribute immensely to the story. With bug eyes and prominent cheekbones, she looks a little strange and plenty weird, but as she transforms herself for prom, she pulls a 180 that makes the final act's flip of the switch eerily effective.The whirlwind ending to the film will leave a sour taste for some viewers looking for more answers or definitive resolution. There's a religious connection implied in these final scenes that distracts a bit from what King did well with ""Carrie,"" and that's serve as a cautionary tale. At the least, you might think twice before picking on the loner, or at least regret whenever you did.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A truly, deeply, cynical film. A classic for millenia.","Carrie is a classic horror film that will be remembered for millenia. It is a moving coming-of-age drama-or thriller-or horror. In any case it is about a shy, sweet girl played by Sissy Spacek who inhabits in a cruel world. Her mother is a religious zealot who abuses her whenever she thinks Carrie committed a sin and her high school peers shun her. Many viewers will find the film not scary at all but it is not meant to make your guts jump out. No, it's a metaphorical tale of growing up and a deeply cynical one too which you will find at the end of the film.I will not spoil anything but I will just say how the film starts and it starts off in the girl's locker room. The camera pans along the misty room and we see the girls gossiping, chattering and dressing up. The camera finally focused on to Carrie who was showering. This scene is very sensitive, sensual, emotive only made possible by the synergy of music and cinemotgraphy establishing Carrie as a sweet and innocent girl whom we should sympathize. As she showers, blood flows down down her feet and shocked as she had never had period, or known, menstruation before. It is a premonition of things to come. It is the cinematography (the lighting and lenses) and the music which are the key elements that made Carrie such an effective film that it is thanks to Brian De Palma's direction. In particular, the music is used to build up and accumulate the tension especially before and during the infamous prom scene. I, being a film buff, I could see Brian De Palma took pages from film making textbooks by emulating German Expressionist movies for lighting to create horror and Citizen Kane and 2001: A Sace Oddysey for using music as an alternative to tell the story.The cast in the movie is excellent and they all have great played their roles really well. Of course the star of the show is Sissy Spacek and she balanced her role well by not being a typical vulnerable, damsel-in- distress and yet you will feel truly sympathetic towards her. As one reviewer said, she did not need to cry for you to feel sorry for her. The mother, played by Piper Laurie is a class A religious lunatic whom you would feel absolute contempt for abusing her own daughter. Similarly, Carrie's peers abuses her and you would feel so angry that you would want to take a dig at their faces with your fist. Now, if the above emotions are what most people felt, it means the cast have been really good with their role. As a matter of fact Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were nominated for their roles.Before concluding the review, I would like to offer some analysis of the movie to tie the review with my summary. The film Carrie is indeed a coming-of-age story but not your standard one. It is not even a standard horror film which may put off some people expecting jump scares and monsters. No it is far more mature and smart. It is a deeply, deeply, deeply metaphorical tale of cynicism and the world. Carrie is growing up and she is not prepared for the real world. She is your typical teenager (not considering the telekinesis) torn apart by pressure from the twisted idealism of her mother who do not teach her properly about the world and from the cruelty of her school colleagues. Only her gym teacher Miss Collins and Sue Snell showed genuine care.Overall, the I love Carrie and it has universal themes and message very relatable to all of us who went through the troubling teenage years and to those still in their teens. I don't see any bad points other than it is not a conventional horror which some people complained. Nevertheless, Carrie is a memorable and a classic horror film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Recommended,"'CARRIE' - 1976Directed by Brian De Palma{The Wedding Party; Singers}Starring Sissy Spacek{Prime Cut; Badlands}, Piper Laurie{The Hustler; Son of Ali Baba} and Nancy Allen{The Last Detail; Forced Entry}Plot Overview: Carrie(Sissy Spacek{ is a young girl, in highschool, who is bullied for being different and every night must go home to her abusive, religious mother. After Carrie receives her first period, in the middle of school, her bullying becomes more frequent, all the way until she is about to burst.Before I watched this movie, I made sure to read King's novel. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. So I went into this movie rather excited about the possibilities. And after watching it; it was fine. Yeah. It was alright. I liked some changes, disliked others. I wouldn't gloat about it being a masterpiece but I certainly wouldn't dismiss it as awful. It's a fine movie. That's the best way I can sum it up.What are the movie's main positives? Sissy Spacek as Carrie was a phenomenal performance. In a disturbing way, I bought into her being a depressed, troubled, poor, tortured soul, and constantly felt sorry for her in all the barbaric abuse she had to put up with. It was a performance that could have certainly won an Oscar; it was that good.Another excellent performance would be Piper Laurie as Carrie's mum. THIS was a genuinely terrifying performance. I don't like religious nut jobs at the best of times so one of them having complete power and control and dominion over me is scary enough. Add Laurie's twisted and demonic performance as the literal embodiment of Satan, and you've got a fantastic, chilling and memorable performance that could also have EASILY won the Oscar.Most of the remainder of the acting(except one person) was pretty good. Nancy Allen was great as the sadistic and cruel Chris. Amy Irving succeeded in her limited screen time at portraying the remorseful and sorrowful Sue. William Katt was also good as the cheerful and helpful Tommy Ross. With the exception of one person, no one did a genuinely poor performance in this movie, for me at least.Another massive praise I can give the movie is the remarkably unsettling way it is shot and edited together. De Palma's remarkable skills made moments in this movie chill me to the bone. I was constantly uneasy and on the edge of my seat, and De Palma masterfully drums up atmosphere and suspense until we reach the climax. Pino Donaggio's excellent score also helps in this brilliant creation of suspense and makes the movie constantly put me on edge.I love the original Stephen King story and therefore the aspects that do carry over are excellent and horrifying to behold. They do, however, make quite a number of changes. One of these changes, I absolutely loved. I won't spoil it but it was a genuinely creepy and horrifying moment of the film. It legitimately sent goosebumps and shivers down my spine. That is the only change I liked however, which I will now elaborate on.Obviously books cannot be translated to film word for word, and things either need to be altered, removed or condensed to make it a pleasant viewing experience. But the sheer amount of the third act that they condensed down made it annoying to watch. I was looking forward to seeing certain scenes and moments but they either cut it out COMPLETELY or edited it drastically. One of them was a specific way in which something happens to a major character. They COMPLETELY change how this happens to them and I really, really disliked that. The movie would have been fine at 2 hours, if they let the third act flourish like it was supposed to.And now for that actor who I mentioned before. John 'The Madman' Travolta. I have no issues with this man. Is he mentally unstable? Yes! Does this benefit his roles? Of course! Is he at least a fun actor? Definitely! I don't have issues with the man as an actor but there was something about him in this movie that I just REALLY did not like. He just wasn't that good in the movie. The character he plays was a very interesting one in the novel. I was pleased with how much of the character remained but not with how they portrayed him. I just think that Travolta was the wrong guy to cast in this role. He doesn't fit the role, in my honest opinion.Overall, I do like this movie. It maintains chunks of the original story, each of which is a delight to see on screen. It contains a steady series of excellent performances, and it features a very uneasy atmosphere. But I detest how much they altered the third act. I feel a little bad for marking it down so much but I really think it shouldn't have been changed. The climax of King's novel was fantastic, this is just lazy and uninteresting. But as a whole I do recommend this movie. I'll rate this movie 6 'Disturbing Shower Scenes' out of 10!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is a smart masterpiece that is a classic,"Carrie (1976) is in my personal DVD collection and also available on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a sheltered young lady with her over religious mother. The young lady has a unique power to move things with her mind that only further confuses her. When people start bullying her at school, and her mother pushes her to the brink, Carrie is about to burst. This movie is directed by Brian De Palma (Scarface) and stars Sissy Spacek (The Help), Piper Laurie (The Faulty), John Travolta (Grease), Nancy Allen (Robocop), William Katt (House) and Sydney Lassick (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). The dynamics of this film are so well told - but my favorite premise is how parents can really set up children to have no chance by over pressing their beliefs on them. We've all likely known people like that. The cruelty of children is really well depicted but this film goes way out of its way to really establish every character, top to bottom. The circumstances are brilliantly told and Carrie's naiveness are brilliantly depicted by Spacek. Laurie played the mother perfectly and I was literally scared of her from beginning to end and never could have imagined myself in Carries shoes. The setting and backdrops are very well depicted also, that Jesus statue was super creepy...and how could you not grade a movie 10/10 when the first scene is a shower scene? 😂 Overall this is a smart masterpiece that is a classic. As referenced, an easy 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Chilling,"I first watched this when I was 17 (I am 32 now) and recently I managed to get hold of a copy and thought ""I wonder if it's still any good?"" - it really is! It's more of a psychological thriller than a horror film, but that's not to say there aren't any horror moments. The maltreatment of Carrie by almost everyone else in the film is a constantly recurring theme, which, due to superb directing and screenplay, avoids becoming repetitive - the film favours Carrie's view of her world above all other characters, allowing you to become absorbed. This makes a lot of the film quite uncomfortable viewing, but it demonstrates just how brilliant the director is at manipulating our emotions.I'm not quite sure how much this film may have aged - I am from England and have no idea if the 'senior prom' is as an important event now as it was 26 years ago - and of course hairstyles have changed. It hardly matters, however. It's still a great way to spend 98 minutes - oh, and watch out for the ending!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
High school horror,"Carrie White, daughter of a religious fanatic mother, is a shy and awkward teenager. When her first period takes place as she showers after gym class she is terrified as her mother had never taught her about such things; the other girls in her class torment her. As her teacher tries to comfort her a lightbulb bursts... Carrie's latent power of telekinesis has been awakened. The girls in her class are punished for their actions; after which one of then determines, with the help of her boyfriend, to humiliate Carrie further to get revenge. Another suggests to her boyfriend that he should invite Carrie to the prom to make up for what they did. Back at home Carrie's mother is unsympathetic and tells her that her period is a sign that she was having sinful thoughts. As she grows to understand her new powers she gains the confidence to stand up to her mother and accepts the invitation to the prom... needless to say the night does not end well.This is rather unusual amongst horror films in that the person who has supernatural powers and ultimately uses them to kill people isn't the villain of the story but its victim. The villains are Carrie's classmates and her mother; the first group are just very unpleasant, for the most part, but her mother is truly disturbing with her absolute faith. The film doesn't rush to get to the horror; instead it gradually raises the tension; clearly signposting the fact that something will happen at the prom. Not all of the characters are black and white; until it becomes obvious I wasn't sure if the boy who invited Carrie to the prom was being genuinely nice or part of the scheme to humiliate her. When the violence starts it is perhaps a little too comic but that could be due to effects that while not bad don't feel quite real. The cast does a solid job; especially Sissy Spacek in the title role and Piper Laurie as her mother. Overall I'd say that this is a classic of the genre so a must see for horror fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I can see your dirty pillows.

Depressing rather than scary.,"This movie depressed me rather than scare me. It was horrific at the end, but everything else is just depressing. I know Brian De Palma was just following the book by Stephen King, and thats just find. But in general, the plot, and the depression was so terrible I just couldn't like it. I'm not saying De Palma could have made it better, just didn't like the story itself in general.It revolves around a shy high schooler named Carrie who is constantly picked on by the girls at her school, and her abusively religious mom. She soon finds out that she has telekinetic powers. She's asked by the most handsome guy in school to prom, where a few girls plan to play another trick on her, little do they know whats in store for them.A lot of the film is just her being treated like poop, until the final climax in the end, which is downright terror. I think my favorite character is the gym teacher, the only person in her life who has sympathy for her, and does her best to help her. My least favorite character by far was the mom. A complete psychopath!I just couldn't take the depression in this film. It calls itself a horror film. Though most of the film just seems like a teen drama, that is until the end. I was so shocked by how badly Carrie was treated. I mean my God, she was freaking hated to death. Looking at her would make any other depressed person not feel as bad. Most of the characters consist of mean girls, crazy psychopaths, or Carrie. But what do you really expect from Stephen King, not to mention this was his first novel. Mix that with Brian De Palma's love for violence, depression and gore, and this is what you get.Nothing but a nonstop series of depressing moments. A few parts were entertaining, but in general didn't do it for me. Like I said before, Its not really De Palma's fault, its just the idea in general. So its actually Stephen King's fault. The movie wasn't really bad, just didn't like the idea of the plot, so maybe the movies not that bad, but this is what I think of it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

This film established Brian DePalma as a new creative force in motion pictures.***/***** good but overrated",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unique horror,"I watch horror movies like I watch a fantasy or science fiction flick. What I want is usually the paranormal mystery that needs resolving, and the revelation at the end. I live for the twist. Very few horror movies have actually scared me. I can think of two. Trouble Every Day, with Vincent Gallo and Béatrice Dalle, made me feel genuinely sick in a way that no other movie has and like I thought none could. The other is Carrie, which made my hair stand on end several times. I mean, I was seriously creeped out.I think that for me it was a combination of DePalma's imagery--Spacek is a truly haunting figure, pure nightmare stuff--and the script. And here's what makes Carrie unique. It is actually a character-driven horror story. It just doesn't not follow the mandatory horror movie formula, but it takes its motivation and narrative momentum from the very realistically depicted inner torment of the protagonist. This had the effect of emotionally grounding the story for me, so that when all hell breaks loose, and the blood-drenched Spacek stares at us with empty eyes, it was the proverbial fist squeezing my guts.Recommended viewing, especially if you are wary of the boring standard-compliant stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slow story build-up but worth the time - a lesson we should all learn from,"Now here's a great director that knows his ABC's when working behind the camera. Good angles, fine continuity, good dialog, great acting from everyone - especially from Sissy Spacek. I gave this movie a shot the first time back in '87 and i was extremely satisfied at the end of the 95 minutes. I think at some point in our lives we'd all wish to be like Carrie, to exact vengeance on those who did us wrong big time but then again we realize Carrie's way is out of our hands and find other ways to compensate for it even if only once. Yes, I can relate to Carrie, being what she was therefore i can understand that what she did to those animals,was well deserved by them not just for mistreating her, but doing it in such a horrible way. The extent of human imagination is sick sometimes and leaves scars that never fade even with time. See, about Carrie, it's like this: you don't screw with me i don't screw with you, but if you're asking for it and i mean ASKING FOR IT, then you got what's coming to you, no excuses. All she wanted was to be left alone but the world around her, the harsh reality of people not being able to understand certain aspects of human behavior, didn't quite ""agree"" with her and the outcome was major HUMILIATION. And for what? Because she didn't fit in? That's the sorriest excuse I have heard to humiliate someone for.But then again there are people and there are people. Anyway i think and this is just my personal opinion, that Mr. Stephen King thought of all these aspects in a subtle manner when he wrote the novel, and still the subtlety can clearly be seen not only in his book but also and probably even better in the 1976 motion picture directed by Brian De Palma. This movie and the novel as well are a lesson in life that teaches us not to mess with things that are better off left the way they are, alone, in any given situation. To understand this you don't need to read between the lines the action unfolds right before the viewer's eyes. You have to understand that a person can take so much but when you cross the line there's no telling what that person is liable to do, and in Carrie we see - even though fictionalized- the exact extent of what damage a person's rage can do. This rage of course in real life is felt when unleashed in different ways. Hell, i wish i had telekinetic powers:D To sum it up, those losers deserved the wrath of Carrie, they had it coming to them and Brian De Palma did a fine job transferring the story of Stephen King's novel on screen especially for those who didn't have the patience to read the novel. Fine work Mr De Palma and Stephen King as well for if it weren't for his novel the movie wold probably never have seen the light of day.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
De Palma and King. What more do you want?,"You could hardly ask for a better movie based on King's debut novel.

There is truly quite a few brilliant moments in the movie, especially when it comes to Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie acting, memorable cinematic climax ,engaged art camera and directing .

"""Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.""","Brian De Palma's adaptation of Stephen King's first novel is one of the director's best films, if not THE best. The story, which everyone reading this probably already knows, is about a teenage girl named Carrie White who is tormented at school by bullies and at home by her religious nut mother. Carrie has telekinetic powers which are unleashed after a horrible prom night prank. Both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie deservedly received Oscar nominations. Neither won but that was the year of Network so that's not surprising. They both give memorable performances that are highlights of their respective careers. Nancy Allen and John Travolta are both excellent villains. Pino Donaggio's score deserves praise. Enough good things can't be said about De Palma's stylish direction. De Palma digs into his bag of tricks -- long tracking shots, split-screen, slow motion, etc. Most of the techniques that are associated with the director from his more popular films. I'm not a big fan of the man but as a director he entertains me, more often than not. Definitely a great film. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out. But please watch it before you watch any of the remakes, sequels, or variations that have been made over the years. There's nothing worse than when a great film is diminished to a newer audience because they saw the pale imitators that came after before they saw the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Film novel,"I haven't read all of Stephen Kings books and Carrie is one of those I have missed. But this movie even without being able to compare it to the book, does a very fine job. It does give you a sense of isolation and it does give you a powerhouse performance by it's lead actress. A horror movie that is scary.Even though it's from the 70s and there has been a really solid remake, this is really worth watching. I myself always try to watch the original first, before going ahead to watch any remake, but I would understand if some don't have the time or patience to do that.

Alive to this day.,"Well first of i have to say that i predicted both the pig blood being thrown at Carrie, and the mother trying to kill Carrie. However, that does not break from this movie's glory. This movie was incredible. Compared to plotless stupid slashers, this is what real horror should be.This movie is a huge morality game, and it reminds me of The Hills Have Eyes, as EVIL turns EVIL. I have to say, that the movie was very slow the first 30 minutes, but then it sky rockets. It really does pick up, and the movie becomes AWESOME.The acting is sharp, the plot is sharp, everything in this is sharp. I do not want to spoiler a lot, but if we are being honest, This movie 20 years ago predicted Columbine, no? In a horror sarcastic way, this predicted so many tragic events, that's it's actually makes my skin crawl.This is probably one of the BEST horror films i have ever seen honestly, it's on the TOP of the list alongside stuff like Martyrs, Triangle, Uzumaki, Child's Play, Cube, Hostel, Reanimator the list goes on...Even though the first 30 minutes are kinda slow, the movie turns 360 degrees afterwards.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Packs an awful, primal wallop.","Brian De Palma's terrifyingly Gothic thriller, Carrie, based on Stephen King's novel, is at once lyrical and trashy, a nasty revenge story with a Cinderella-like heroine.The eponymous heroine (Sissy Spacek in the movie that catapulted her to stardom) is on one level a stock character, a misfit who comes of age and discovers her sexuality under the most terrifying conditions.An early, crucial scene shows the totally unprepared Carrie White experiencing her first menstruation at the gym's showers; her friends react as if she were a freak. ""Help me,"" she screams in desperation, but her friends laugh, and it takes her teacher to pull her out of hysterics. It's defining moment that actress Spacek has described as ""being hit by a truck)
Fatherless, Carrie lives with her crazed, fanatically religious, mother (Piper Laurie), who perceives herself as a virgin damaged by sex. Shy and sexually inhibited, Carrie's main desire is to gain acceptance by her peers; she is unloved at home and ridiculed at school (which is named Bates High School, paying tribute to Hitchcock's Psycho). ""Äll the kids think I'm funny, but all I want to be is normal,"" Carrie tells her mother.The second part of the narrative turns into a slash horror film, another revenge story, thus fitting into the decade's dominant theme of vengeance. Carrie's telekinetic powers are used against her classmates and mother. In her retaliation, kitchen knives whiz through space, piercing her mother's body until she looks like a crucified saint.The two visual motifs of the film are liquid, water and blood: The tale begins with a shower scenes and ends with a gory and lurid blood bath.De Palma's first commercial hit, after a couple of small indies, such as ""Hi Mom"" starring the young Robert De Niro, is still one of his best and most iconic pictures, combining skillfully horror and adolescent angst.The shocking ending, which cannot be revealed here, has been imitated by many directors, and is still thrilling to behold.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dated Horror Classic,"Carrie was Stephen King's first transition to film, and the most successful horror novelist's story didn't disappoint. Sissy Spacek excellently portrays Carrie, a sheltered high school misfit who is ridiculed and tormented by her fellow students because of her innocence and naivety. Little do they realise, they are pushing her to the edge and helping her unleash the power she wields within.Sadly unlike the novel the movie has suffered the test of time, seeing it again now makes me realise how much of the horror is lost in this on screen translation; but i still salute it as a genuine horror classic; i remember how scared i was when i saw it the first time, and it is because of movies like this one that the horror genre has continued to evolve and entertain.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than most horror,"Carrie-**1/2- Worthwhile- Directed by: Brian De Palma. Written by: Lawrence D. Cohen, Stephen King (novel). Starring: Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, William Katt, John Travolta, P.J Soles, Priscilla Pointer.Stephen King's creative novel is turned into a high-powered De Palma thriller in this story of a high school outcast (Spacek) who learns she has telekinetic powers and finally snaps after being pushed too far by her cruel classmates and her Christian extremist mother.Carrie is a horror film by all means and succeeds pretty well as a horror film and even goes a step further by providing social insight into an alienated girl's true feelings toward society under the craziness of her mother (Laurie in a great performance). It even has Hitchcock elements in it that add to the intelligence to the experience. Yet De Palma is not the most fluid storyteller and his dramatic shift between sentimental, anti-bullying tale to bloody horror film does not gel the way it should.Also, De Palma uses a split-screen during the film's violent sequence. It's as if the carnage on the first screen is not enough for us and he wants to see more blood. He almost insults his filmmaking by saying he is not putting enough on the screen in one image but needs two to give the message of the sequence. His Hitchcock elements do not always work, simply because he does not have the same skill the master of suspense had.There is no doubt that Spacek's character represents a minority of kids out there and De Palma gives Carrie a voice amongst the growing suspense that makes a few noteworthy social points but this is a horror film that acts as a parody of Hitchcock and a new brand of feminine horror which many films would capitalize on later. King loved the adaptation and I wish I could have liked it as much as him.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a scary movie, just a major let down. ** (out of four)","CARRIE / (1976) ** (out of four)In ""Carrie,"" the acclaimed vision of Stephen King's novel, we meet a character who doesn't have good days, joyful moments, or times that she can laugh with friends. The title character is played by Sissy Spacek, who, under the circumstances, does very good things with her character. Carrie's mother has raised her under a constricting environment of fanatical religion and strict discipline. As both the novel and the movie open, we meet Carrie White, a high school senior who has a very complex body; she is telepathic-contains the ability to move objects with her mind-and she has never had a period. Now, I know I am becoming graphic in my explanation, but this is an important aspect of the story. The audience assumes from the implications and plot points that Carrie has had a rather cloudy history as a person and student. Her neighbors look away as she passes, her fellow students pitch tampons at her when she experiences her first vaginal bleeding in the school showers. These are the only things that develop Carrie White as a character-the rest is up to you to assume. In a movie where the main character kills countless presumably innocent individuals due to unkempt rage and years of building aggression, we better be able to understand her, but  the movie does not provide us with the right material.The problem with ""Carrie"" is not so much a problem with the movie itself, but a problem with the novel by Stephen King, and the adapted script by Lawrence D. Cohen. I read the novel before I saw the movie. I obtained a videocassette copy for critical screening to compare the two arts. I hated the book. Stephen King confused his simple, one-line story with frequent scientific rationalizations of the occurrences within the actual novel. It is like he didn't trust the reader with his idea, and felt the need to provide us with factual evidence that the story could actually happen. This distorts the narrative, and provides the reader with nothing but more questions. I like the movie better than the book because it is more visual. Although King wrote some vivid, picturesque scenes in his vastly popular work, ""Carrie"" makes for a much clearer screen presence because it is not so jumbled with awkward ideas and interceptive explanations. However, I still dislike the movie. Screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen does not alter King's depiction of the characters-one of the biggest problems with both the movie and the book.The character's in ""Carrie"" both in the movie and in the book, are all one-dimensional and stereotypical. The mother is a religious fanatic obsessed with finding forgiveness in everything her daughter does; the kind hearted counselor befriends Carrie, boosting her confidence to where she actually has the courage to accept a young man's invitation to the upcoming prom; the spiteful schoolgirls, obsessed with self-image and popularity, vow for revenge against Carrie, when Carrie herself was simply a victim of cruelty; need I go on? The character's are all seen in one light, and one light alone. The kind counselor never does anything mean. Carrie's mother sees everything as a sin against the Lord. Even Carrie herself is over the top in shame, hopelessness, and confusion. I never cared about any of the characters, therefore, instead of being terrified and involved when the film's disappointing but violent climax transpires, I was left analyzing my thoughts of why I didn't care in the least about what happens.""Carrie"" isn't a terrible movie. I liked the scenes at the prom and beyond; it has a good sense of style and momentum. It proves that Lawrence D. Cohen has a mind of his own, instead of using identical material to the novel. But it is overrated, tiresome, and often boring. This is not a scary movie-just a violent, abhorrent one. It contains all the necessary ingredients to make for a tantalizing, suspenseful motion-picture-but it never delivers. There are avid horror principles here, but ""Carrie"" doesn't seem to understand what to do with them.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A thrilling death ride!,"""Carrie"" is a thrilling death ride that will rip your heart out, chew it up, spit it out, and punch it right back inside of you. If you don't like horror movies, when this is on TV, turn it off immediately.This is a story of a teenage girl going through puberty, childhood relationships, proms and even murder.In gym class when Carrie takes a shower, she experiences the drama of her period. Now, you see, Carrie is misunderstood, and doesn't understand. Her mother is a crazy old lady who didn't tell Carrie about sex or puberty. Her mother mistreats her, slaps her, and locks her in closets.Anyway, the girls in Carrie's classes are always making fun of her and calling her terrible names. So, after all Carrie's little mishaps, a girl in her class named Sue feels sorry for her. So sorry, she tells her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom. Sue is doing this on Carrie's behalf; to be a friend to her. Oops! Bad idea!This movie is super-scary! I tell you, when I watched it, I was at a friend's house. I knew my father had told me not to watch the movie until I'm 18. I was 11, at the time. Let me tell you one thing. BOY, WAS HE RIGHT! I just about wet my pants! At the end, I got so scared!

My Review of Carrie,This film is the most scariest film I have ever seen!!!.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Some very strong scenes, but as a whole Carrie isn't entirely successful","Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a shy 17 year old girl who is bullied by her classmates for being a bit weird. This situation is exacerbated when she has her first period whilst showering at school. Out of the blue, Carrie discovers that she has telekinetic powers and is intent on using these powers to get revenge on those that are bullying her.For me, Stephen King adaptations have always been a bit hit and miss and interestingly Carrie falls somewhere in the middle. Like other King adaptations such as Christine and Cujo, Carrie essentially is one long build up to the eventual crux of the story which takes place at the prom. Unfortunately, if you're going to set the story up in this way then you need to make sure that there are two key ingredients; a really strong pay-off or an involving story between point A and point B and again Carrie only partly succeeds in both areas...What lets this film down slightly is that for the bulk of its running time it doesn't really explore Carrie's telekinesis particularly well. The majority of the run time seems to be spent on all the pretty people discussing the prom night. The side characters are rather bland and for me got a little too much focus. Thankfully some scenes are very effective throughout the middle of the film (most notably the scenes between Carrie and her mother - wonderfully portrayed by Piper Laurie). Whilst watching this film, it's very easy to feel for Carrie as a person as she not only has to deal with a gang of bullies at school, but she then goes home to her barmy mother who is some kind of religious nut. In some ways, I felt Carrie deliberately ostracised herself from everyone else for fear of bringing friends home. Reading between the lines, I suspect that there was definitely something of a 'daughter doesn't need any friends other than her mother' scenario with Carrie and her mother.The moment where Carrie starts to unleash hell at the prom is very good and this is mostly down to Spacek looking so damn creepy. The problem again is that the build up to this moment was far too drawn out. I'm all for suspenseful build ups, but if you leave it too long you're in danger of losing your audience. I kept thinking to myself 'Oh just bloody get on with it'. The film ends quite strongly, but again is it good enough to make up for its shortcomings? Yeah I'd say it just about does enough to make it worthwhile.As far as performances go then many may see Spacek as the star of the show and yes she was very good, but for me it was Piper Laurie that was the best thing about this film. She was a joy to watch here and her character did genuinely unnerve me slightly. Some of the other characters are rather bland particularly Travolta who shows his face a couple of times and collects his pay cheque.Carrie is a passable and watchable film, but it's very uneven and whilst it's effective at times, many scenes that don't focus on Carrie and/or her mother are quite tedious. It's certainly not bad, but a classic? I don't think so.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Carrie: A touching and beautiful movie,"""Carrie"" is not the typical horror movie, so don't expect that when you see it. As usual, Brian de Palma creates the strongest visual experience.

She was once one of the few people able to play a younger individual with high reliability.

Where is Carrie White now?,"Carrie White (Oscar-nominated Sissy Spacek) is about the shiest, mousiest girl ever portrayed on film.I'm a guy, and never have I really felt such sympathies for a nerd-girl, especially one who seemed genuine. Hence, ""Carrie"" looks and feels less a horror movie and more a teen-drama. Style filmmaker Brian De Palma directs ""Carrie,"" an adaptation of the Stephen King novel (King's first work to be adapted into a movie), and thus one of the scariest movies of the genre.As Carrie White, Spacek seems a natural. Our feelings for her are genuine, especially since as the film opens, she has her first period while in the girl's locker room and panics at the sight of her own blood. Because her mother (Piper Laurie) has burdened her down with a whole bunch of religious nonsense, Carrie just has no idea about how to react to a natural bodily function.The incident also brings about something else in Carrie: she realizes that she has psychic powers, which she then uses against her tormentors, including her mother and classmates Chris (Nancy Allen) and Norma (P.J. Soles), and Chris's boyfriend Billy (John Travolta). It all boils down to a blood-drenched, special effects-laden climax at the school prom.There are others who care for Carrie: a fellow classmate named Sue (Amy Irving), her friend Tommy Ross (golden boy William Katt), and a sympathetic gym teacher (Betty Buckley). But the constant torment of her enemies leaves Carrie no choice but to do the unthinkable on a night where everybody is supposed to be happy.""Carrie"" was made before the slasher madness of ""Halloween"" (1978), its sequels, and the many knock-offs. So in this sense, ""Carrie"" seems to be a stand-alone picture. As stated earlier, the bloodbath at the end is so unexpected in a movie that was building up into a touching teen story. Such effects-laden sequences come as a surprise and are indeed frightening to watch.Spacek is wonderful, generating the emotional depth required for her character. Since she just celebrated her 57th birthday yesterday, why not give ""Carrie"" another chance in some other media format to mark its 30th anniversary? I've read that Stephen King doesn't particularly care for the movie adaptation of his first hit; I find it hard to believe he's truly upset with the finished product. But ""Carrie"" is a true classic of the genre, one of the first of the best.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vicious and Relentless,"With the utmost respect, Carrie seems very much like an exploitation film of the slasher/revenge genre. In another one of the many films that was undoubtedly inspired by Hitchcock's Psycho, a teenager decides to unload her unusual powers on a bunch of unfortunately sour members of her school.One of my problems with many horror films is the loss of grounded characters who are easy to root for. I feel like many films in this genre focus too heavily on the antagonistic presences in the films that they forget to build out likable and realistic main characters. Carrie doesn't necessarily suffer from that particular problem, but it chooses to surround Carrie, a bullied and reserved girl, with stereotypical one-note characters. Sometimes it works, but I will always desire characters with understandable motivations.So even though there is basically no one likable in the story, Carrie succeeds in that it's an important tale of the damage that bullying can do and the lengths that the victim could go to get revenge. With a limited budget, due to it being the first adaptation of Stephen King's work, Brian De Palma does more with less. And even though you pretty much know what's going to happen, the execution is nonetheless very effective. Sissy Spacek kills it, as she did a whole lot in the 70's and 80's. She's complemented by an equally creepily eerie turn by Piper Laurie, who plays her mother. Yikes. Yes, It's definitely dated, but Carrie is a fun product of its time, and a story/message that should be remembered.+Bloody/fiery fun+Exploitive in the best ways-A few too many unlikable characters7.1/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic that stands the test of time,"Upon watching Carrie for the very first time in today's modern age one wishes that it were possible to go back and witness the film in a packed cinema screening upon release for it would have been a grand and previously unseen experience, for Carrie is a film that feels ahead of it's time and stands the test of age to still be shocking and frightfully spot on in it's depiction of teenage isolation and discovery of oneself.Carrie needs no real introduction as many know the story of bullied social outcast Carrie White, played so well by the then 26 year old Sissy Spacek. Spacek will forever be known for her role in this picture and what a great feat to lay hold on as her performance in the film is so eerily spot on you almost forget that she in fact isn't Carrie. Other performers in the film also resonate with special mention to Piper Laurie as Carrie's god fearing and overbearing mother Margaret and Betty Buckley as Carrie's gym teacher Miss Collins. The film also features early performances from John Travolta as idiotic teen Billy Nolan and Nancy Allen as evil school girl Chris.Much of Carrie's success must be related back to director Brian De Palma who directs the film with that voyeuristic style that made him famous in films such as Dressed to Kill and Body Double. If a film were to open the way it does as with this original Carrie today it would lose none of it's downright creepy vibe and would remain just as controversial. De Palma sticks to his guns throughout the entire runtime and is aided by a now equally classic film score from Pino Donaggio giving the film a unique moody atmospheric feel.I have no idea why it took so long into my life to catch this original horror classic but I am glad I have before I partake eventually in the newly updated version with Chloe Grace Moretz. I can see already that the film will have a tough time justifying it's existence as Carrie is the quintessential version of the Stephen King story and a movie that still shocks as it did upon release.4 buckets of pig blood out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out:www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the better King adaptations,"Relentlessly tormented and humiliated by her peers, a teenager fins that her growing telekinetic powers are the manifestation of her ascent into puberty which reaches a boiling point during her high-school prom that no one at the school wishes would've been discovered.While it's a little overrated, that doesn't take anything away from it at times since there's still some good stuff to it. One of the best points is the fact that there's an exceptional build-up initially based upon the religious angle, which is from the rather well-done religious angle on display. From the ranting and raving, which are perfectly done so as to really amp up the tension, along with her house which is like a containment camp for the religiously devout with crucifixes in every possible location, 'Last Supper' paintings placed in ominous places, and her special confessional, a small hole in the wall with figures, ornaments and strange candles, is just weird. All of these are building up tension, and it actually succeeds from others that haven't before in making this seem genuinely unnerving. It's also great at building tension earlier on with what happens at school from the very beginning, which has the distinction of showing some of the scariest images of a high school ever during the shower scene, which is one of the absolutely best parts due to it instigating all the great parts that followed, and the traumatic events that followed are what make it work so well. The initial bits used to show her gift are also some creepy images, and the events are pretty creepy. There's also some really great action scenes towards the end with the prom as one of the highlights of the genre which is quite fun when it gets going, with the fire raining down on everyone and the different methods of telekinesis-inspired tortures that are simply fun to see as there's lots of impaling, a couple of people set on fire and some electrified while standing in water or touching a microphone, and the rampage through town with a fantastic car crash and some more damage to be had making for a fantastic finish here. These here are the film's good points while there were a couple flaws with this one. The main problem here is that it takes a long time to get going as a long portion of the film, at least fifty minutes, takes place before we get anything remotely interesting. Making the beginning focus on the mother-daughter relationship over anything else tends to drop the film down a lot since it doesn't tend to place any kind of importance on the supernatural aspects of the story which are far more important to the story. There are so few jumps due to how the film is going, especially with the drama-like focus for much of the time, that after repeated viewings it loses some of its initial impact with how it goes about. Also, some of the religious discussions can be a bit much for those that aren't that versed in religion or don't believe in it. The religious aspect of the film is a large part of the film, and if you don't believe in what is presented, it can lead to some unpleasant experiences. These here are the film's flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, and discussions and events portraying feminine issues and religion.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I can see your dirty pillows. Everyone will.,"I am sure that I've seen this film before, but I watched it again to see how Stephen King managed to write a story that captured teen-aged angst amidst bullying and popularity contests.Sis Spacek was simply incredible and it is no surprised that she got the first Academy Award nomination for a horror film. Piper Laurie was also superb as her mother and got a well-deserved nomination herself.The effects and cinematography were superb, as was Brian De Palma's direction.I also liked seeing some people in their first or early roles like Amy Irving (Yentl) in her first role on the big screen; RoboCop's Nancy Allen; John Travolta in his second screen appearance; and P. J. Soles (The Devil's Rejects) in one of her first roles.A great horror movie about teen life.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A heartbreaking horror movie,"This is a highly successful Brian De Palma adaption of Stephen King's novel. And while I have never read the book itself, I can still say that this is one of the best films associated with both King and De Palma.Carrie is the story of a shy girl who is bullied in high school. She has telekinetic powers that seem to be connected in some way with her progression into womanhood. Her religiously fanatical mother dangerously over-protects her from the wider world. Things then take an unexpected turn when Carrie is invited to the prom by one of the popular boys from the school.Firstly, let me say that I find this film absolutely heartbreaking. It rips me apart emotionally every time I watch it. To say the least, this is not what you expect to happen when watching a horror movie. Much of the reason for this is down to the performance of Sissy Spacek. A more delicate and nuanced presentation of a troubled and bullied young girl you will have difficulty finding. She is perfectly cast. You would have to have a heart of stone not to want happiness for this girl. Another significant performer is William Katt. He too is excellent and is a highly likable presence; the romantic developments between these two characters are extremely touching and genuine. Forgetting the horror element for a moment, Carrie works brilliantly as a heart-warming coming-of-age drama. So much so, that every time I see it, I dread the horrific finale in the school. I just want this girl to be happy. By the end of this movie I feel emotionally drained. Although many horror films end in a pessimistic way, the manner in which events in Carrie are built up and then ripped apart is incredibly cruel and carry an unusually high emotional impact.Stylistically, as is typical for De Palma, this is a great looking film. The widescreen format is used beautifully throughout but the cinematic style is truly taken to the fore in the final showdown in the school. De Palma's combination of split-screen photography and jump cuts really accentuates that scene. It's a mesmerizing sequence that does not disappoint. If I had to voice a minor quibble about the movie it would be regarding the soundtrack. In a couple of the lighter scenes it's cheesy in a horrible way and later it unfortunately resorts to shrill Psycho-esquire strings when Carrie uses her telekinetic powers. This latter factor, along with the use of the 'Bates School' name, are the type of Hitchcockian references that De Palma has become notorious for. However, aside from this, Carrie is not an obvious ode to the master of suspense and should not be thought of as such.Overall, this is a great film. Aside from Spacek and Katt, Piper Laurie is also excellent here, in what is a film full of strong performances. The exemplary acting contributes to the strong dramatic impact of Carrie, and this allied with De Palma's mastery of cinematic style, means that this is a film of a very high calibre. Effective horror films to tend to work on the emotions, as they play on our inner fears. Carrie is no different in this. But what sets this film apart from so many of its contemporaries is that it is not only about that, it's also about adolescence, loneliness and bullying. It might even make you cry. And how many horror movies can you say that about?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Relentless and often tough film hybridising these ingredients of coming of age; family relations and high-school drama to really good effect..,"It would be fair to say that the titular character in Brian De Palma's Carrie is in no way leading a ""normal"" life at the precious, delicate stage she is. True to theory, De Palma inter-cuts between two scenes encapsulating the varied natures of what might constitute as ordinary teen-aged behaviour with what it is that our lead must go through at precisely the same time. The two scenes see school bully Sue (Irving), and what appears to be a standard night OUT for her, placed up against a typical night IN for our Carrie, played with vulnerable relish by that of Sissy Spacek. Sue is of the young; athletic and confrontative sort. She sits beside boyfriend Billy upfront in the passenger seat as they cruise around in his car. They're in the middle of a sort of argument, but it's one of those squabbles which you know no matter how long it goes on, as long as it doesn't venture beyond a certain threshold of aggression, everything will remain sound by this time tomorrow. She's challenging him as they chug along when he raised the point that he'd quite like her to stop playfully insulting him, but she plugs away anyway.It's a scene demonstrating an exchange in power and an established dynamic between two characters being pulled and pushed back either way; a scene told alongside another that involves Carrie who's at home with her mother. Here is another instance involving a young girl bordering on the leaving of high school in which that person must engage in an established dynamic built on further exchanges of power, only this time with an icy and thoroughly religious woman whose idea of 'saving' Carrie is to stilt her growing out of childhood. Neither instance is necessarily that constructive in their overall breakdown, but I would take a guess that the one involving Sue and Billy best represents how 'typical' young women might be spending their evenings. Oh, to be able to engage in a natural back-and-forth whilst out and about in the side seat of a friend's car wherein you challenge the dominant force of a partner rather than remain shut away inside with that of an equal force engaging in strict mealtime processions and being forced into reading the bible whilst locked in a closet.Carrie's lives in America and attends a high-school with many other girls of her age, most of whom bully; berate and wind her up. The volleyball match opening the film suggests good, healthy competition amidst the girls - competitors go for shots and clearly enjoy the physical activity to De Palma's applied slow motion. The reality is quite the opposite when we reach the girl at the back in the corner doing her best to stay away from the action; it is Carrie and alas, one of the members on the other team no doubt spots the weak spot in Carrie's team's makeup in so much she provides her with something to do: specifically, make the crucial shot on match point. She blows it and the ugly scenes as Carrie is 'comiserated' by her teammates alludes to the bigger picture.Not so far away is Carrie's mother Margaret (Laurie), a preacher who goes from door to door attempting to spread her religious musings in a way which is at once all of enthusiastic and quite maddening. One occasion sees her turned away by those whom own the house she has just called upon, and we note how pleased they are to be rid of her. The film does not linger with this family and their, in comparison rather perfect, set up nor further detail them much. Instead, we track home with the fanatic and to her domestic situation; Carrie's school day in mind, one could feasibly say that it is the more pleasant-a half of her daily existence as when she gets home to her lone mother, things are cranked up a notch. De Palma utilises the incoming end of school prom night dance as a looming deadline, in turn transforming everything into a shrill, and at times agonised, low level drama which happens to mutate into domains of the uncanny when great levels of frustration and anger boil up.The film is essentially one big build up to the prank-of-all-pranks that the bullies, lead by the aforementioned Sue and her partner Billy, who himself isn't shy of getting stuck into a hair-raising situation when we observe him out drinking and driving at once with the verbal confirmation that police cars are buzzing around, aim to play on Carrie at the end of school dance. Prior to all of this, the film shoots Carrie purchasing a dress for the special evening to the same music that accompanied the rest of the girls engaging in gym class; a series of exercises making light of their sexuality to highly suggestive musical overtures. Carrie is unsure of the prom and unsure that she has the ability to share such a realm with that of the 'other' girls, but the use of the musical track as she attempts to burrow her way onto a level playing surface following one boy's asking of her to the dance suggests she is approaching achieving otherwise. In spite of its reputation and what it is people either predominantly know or remember it for, the film is a low-level American town character drama more than anything else and works really well to that degree and is something most certainly worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
All time classic horror movie.,"Carrie (1976) is one of the classic horror films of our time, written by Stephen King and brought to film by Brian De Palma.The story is about a plain young girl called Carrie who's old fashioned and cant fit in no matter how hard she tries, she has no friends and constantly gets bullied and harassed by all the other girls at her school.But what nobody knows is that Carrie is a very special girl with powers that can cause devastating force!!! When Carrie gets unexpectedly invited to the prom by the school hunk, she thinks her life is turning around. But at the prom, there is a nasty surprise waiting for Carrie, a nasty cruel prank that has been set up to hurt and devastate Carrie. But all the laughter aimed at Carrie soon turns to screams as she unleashes her powers in retribution!!! Carrie is a great horror movie, with a great script and Sissy Spacek was perfect for the role of Carrie, this was her finest hour on the silver screen, no doubt about it. William Katt and Nancy Allen are also strong in the supporting roles as the school hunk and most popular girl (bitch).Carrie also scores highly for it's excellent ending, one of the best in horror movie history!!

Overrated,"""Carrie"" has to be the most overrated movie of all time. It starts off promisingly, but nothing decent happens until the final 15 minutes. Brian Depalma rips off Hitchcock at every turn.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Somewhat routine and disappointing, but the film thrives on Spacek's wonderful title performance...","The one thing that has haunted ""Carrie"" over the years is the most famous of all questions: Is it any good? There's no doubting the film's legend and popularity, but does it compare to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, or even a low budget slasher flick like ""Halloween""? In short...no, not really.It's a good film, to a certain degree, but it fails as a horror movie on more than one fundamental level (that being that it isn't scary). Some people love the work of Brian De Palma, and some don't. His fans believe that he is the next Hitchcock. Others think he is a poor man's rip-off.Indeed, he does ""borrow"" quite a lot of pointers from Hitch in his films, particularly ""Carrie,"" from the soundtrack to the style of the film. This is modern-day Hitchcock, complete with swearing and nudity too risqué for the likes of ""Psycho."" Perhaps, if Hitchcock were still alive, his films would be like this. Maybe. I don't really know. I do think, though, that De Palma's primary influence is definitely Alfred Hitchcock. Does he match his idol? Not really. I felt that he was just copying him during a lot of ""Carrie."" (Although I do love ""Scarface"" [1983] ever so much.)I have yet to meet someone like Margaret White (Piper Laurie) from ""Carrie."" I hope I never do. And in the film, her character is so over the top that she does indeed come off quite silly as compared to the way she was supposed to strike the audience -- menacing and terrifying. But she does instill fear in her teenager daughter, Carrie (Sissy Spacek), who longs to form a public life like everyone else, but is haunted by her mother's incessant rants about the devil and such. She even locks Carrie up in a closet for hours on end so that she can pray to God.But when Carrie is invited to the school prom, she disobeys her mother's commands and is delighted to be able to attend a public event with kids her own age. Unfortunately, the prom goes awry when Chris (Nancy Allen) and Billy (John Travolta, a year prior to his breakthrough in ""Saturday Night Fever"") pour hog blood all over Carrie when she accepts her crown as Prom Queen.This is when Carrie snaps and unleashes her telekinetic powers upon her small town, burning the school gymnasium and all those inside it, then wandering the streets drenched in blood, causing road accidents and other such tragic events.But Carrie is not evil. That is what the film tries to tell us, at least, and does a good job at doing so. The book is a bit different -- Carrie is a fat, ugly girl; not slim and pretty like Spacek -- but for the most part, it captures the same sense of empathy and innocence that the novel did. We don't see the bad in what Carrie is doing. We see the revenge. Just like we didn't think what Travis Bickle or Bill Foster did was necessarily anything ""bad,"" what Carrie does in the film seems justified by the end. That's the only thing I can really credit this film for -- building a strong title character. The rest is pretty routine and weak.This movie is carried by Sissy Spacek's performance, and for that I give it a solid recommendation. My mother met Spacek at a horse show in Virginia once, right before she was up for an Oscar a few years back. (She even got their encounter on videocassette.) In the heat of an Oscar race, one might expect that Spacek wouldn't be caught dead in a place such as a horse competition. Or one would expect her to at least look somewhat glamorous.She didn't look glamorous. She looked absolutely normal. She was wearing nothing but a modest winter coat and some dirty jeans. No makeup. No bodyguards. No press. She was just standing there amongst the crowd. My mother spotted here before anyone else, but didn't want to attract attention to her, either. So she asked her quietly if it was she and her suspicions were confirmed. Spacek had come to watch her daughter ride in the same competition as my sister. ""I loved you in 'Carrie,'"" my mother told her.And as she recalled the story to me, I thought, That's probably the compliment Spacek gets the most. She's a great actress, and certainly an honorable one. She's taken risky roles, such as that in ""The Coal Miner's Daughter,"" but has yet to succumb to the standards of Hollywood. I wouldn't classify her as a mainstream actress. It's apparent that she hasn't had plastic surgery yet like most actresses her age. I respect that. I respect her work and her as an actress.Sissy Spacek is the only thing that keeps ""Carrie"" from being another run-of-the-mill horror film with a few good ideas and an empathetic title character. The script is, for the most part, quite weak, and the acting ranges from great (Spacek) to clichéd (Allen as the nasty cheerleader). What surprises me most about ""Carrie"" is the impact it had and how it boosted Stephen King from being a lowly horror writer to his recent critically proclaimed title as ""The King of Horror."" I don't think he is, but that's an entirely different story.3/5.",,Anonymous,Horror
The First (And Possibly Best) King Movie,"A young, abused and timid 17-year-old girl (Sissy Spacek) discovers she has telekinesis, and gets pushed to the limit on the night of her school's prom by a humiliating prank.There seems to be little reason to review this film. Everyone knows it is a horror classic, and even has an entire book devoted to its analysis. Brian DePalma is one of the all-time great directors and he shows that here (using some of his trademark skills, like the split screen shots). Some may say he is nothing more than a cheap imitator of Hitchcock and others, but that is unfair. (Yes, there are a handful of ""Psycho"" references here, but that is to be expected given the material).Spacek is successfully awkward, William Katt's hair is amazing, and it is great to see P. J. Soles pre-Halloween. Amy Irving is great, and met her husband (Steven Spielberg) on the set, which is a story in itself. Nancy Allen always shines, and it is great to see her alongside John Travolta years before they reunited with DePalma's ""Blow Out"" (1981).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
stylish but empty,"DePalma is little more than a mediocre Hitchcock.  He is certainly gorier than the master, but there is not much else to recommend him.  Having once been a high school student, I can safely say that no one in ""Carrie"" acts even remotely like anyone I have ever known.  Having known many religious people, I would say that even the craziest and most fanatical of them did not much resemble Carrie's mother.  I did find DePalma's use of a split screen during the movies big scene to be quite interesting but even that seemed little more than a stylistic trick to enliven a rather ludicrous killing spree.

Nonsensical teenager drama movie,"I don't know why there are so many positive reviews praising it, probably because of nostalgia, but I'm going to write honest, objective review without any nostalgic baggage.First of all, this movie is not horror, it's a high school drama movie with 10 minutes of horror tacked on at the end. We have Carrie, a nerdy high schooler who happen to have magical telekenetic powers for some reason. But those powers are only used during the last 10 minutes of the movie, so you can forget about them for now. She is bullied for not knowing about her own period (she is a nerd who never read about basic human biology?) And later the bullies get rightfully punished.We learn that her mother is a religious nut who is obsessed with praying for forgiveness. At first that looks creepy, but after several scenes it just becomes predictable and comical.After about an hour of drama-related scenes of Carrie going to her first prom and the evildoers plotting revenge against her, the main plot point happens - she gets blood dumped on her and everyone in the audience laughs (as opposed to real life, where everyone would be horrified and would run to help her). Then Carrie remembers that she has magical powers and uses them to destroy everything and kill everyone in the building (I guess it's a plausible reaction considering everyone in the audience laughs, but still, that's kinda over-the-top). Everyone dies except for the actual evildoers. Do they run the hell away from there? No, they choose to... try and murder her by running her over with a car. But her magical powers prove to be stronger and she blows up the car instead.So why didn't she use her magical powers any other time? Why not in during the shower bleeding scene? Are we supposed to believe that she never used them up until now and nobody knew she had them? That's extremely stupid. That's like superman-disguising-as-clark-kent level of stupid. If anyone in the movie actually acted like people in real life do, none of that nonsense would have happened.In conclusion - a nonsensical teenager drama movie with a stupid unrealistic plot, with some over-the-top horror and gore tacked on at the end.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A classic in every sense of the word.,"Twenty-six years after its theatrical release, Brian DePalma's adaptation of Stephen King's ""Carrie"" remains a classic in every sense of the word. Poetically filmed and sharply drawn as a character study, it introduced moviegoers everywhere to one of the finest actresses of our era (Sissy Spacek), gave a career-defining role to a fine actress (Piper Laurie) whose talent and name would probably be forgotten by now were it not for this film, was the first true exhibition of John Travolta's enormous screen charisma and jump-started the careers of an impressive line-up of unknown actors (Betty Buckley, P.J. Soles, William Katt, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving).  And it managed to scare the hell out of audiences everywhere through sheer filmmaking technique and by showing only enough to make the audience think they see more than they actually see.Is it even necessary to regurgitate the plot?  We all know the basics: high school outcast is cruelly ridiculed by her peers, who don't know she has telekinetic powers--powers she is only beginning to understand.  Her high school life is hell, and her homelife even worse.  Her mother is a psychotic religious fanatic given to beating her over the head until she prays with her, refuses to let her socialize with anyone, locks her in the closet, goes bananas at just the thought of sex.  Piper Laurie is absolutely sensational in this role--deliberately over-the-top in a chilling yet darkly funny performance which should have won an Oscar for supporting actress but lost out to Beatrice Straight's two-scene cameo crying and screaming jag in ""Network.""  (Of course, as wicked as this performance is, it's amazing the staid Academy saw fit to nominate it in the first place.)  After Miss Collins, the well-meaning gym teacher (future Broadway diva Betty Buckley), berates the class for torturing poor Carrie, and humiliates evil Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen, gloriously naked in the memorable opening locker room sequence) in the process, she unwittingly sets in motion the tragic turn of events:  Chris and boyfriend Billy (Travolta) plot revenge on Carrie, while Sue Snell (Amy Irving), feeling guilty for her part in the incident, talks her boyfriend Tommy (Katt) into taking Carrie to the prom, hoping she'll finally come out of her shell and fit in.  We all know what happens next, let's just say it involves a bucket of pig's blood, water, electricity and fire.What's amazing about this film is just how gory it isn't:  I swear before I finally saw this film I was told that you saw heads severed, bodies explode and blood galore; however, except for the pig's blood, the gore here is pretty limited, although the final scene between Carrie and her mother has it's moments.  And as I said before: it's all in DePalma's brilliant directing.  Legend has it that the director deliberately began the film with graphic nudity in the initial locker room scene because he felt if he was that graphic in the first five minutes it would make the audience uneasy and they would spend the rest of the film not knowing how far he was going to go once the carnage began.  Also, the last minute shock scene was added because at the time, there was limited time between screenings and the next audience would stand outside the auditorium door waiting for the next screening and when the previous audience would scream, the next audience would spend the next 105 or so minutes uneasily wondering what the screaming was about. It's all about anticipating what is coming and not necessarily about how gross everything on the screen is, a lesson schlock directors of today would be well-advised to learn.I could go on-and-on about this film but suffice it to say ""Carrie"" is well-worthy of the designation ""classic.""  It's funny, it's sad, it's scary and mostly tragic.  And just to illustrate how cheap and sleazy it could have been in lesser hands, simply screen the awful sequel ""The Rage--Carrie 2"" and watch how Sue Snell's character is despicably trashed for a cheap thrill, or try to sit through the botched TV-movie remake which is as bad as this one is great and you'll see the difference is all in Brian DePalma--a director who has since had a spotty career but for one glorious moment put it all together to create a masterpiece.  ***** (out of *****)",,Anonymous,Horror

Deserves it's reputation.,"The opening credits scene in Brian De Palma's Carrie shows us the inside of a high school girl's locker room, De Palma immediately using his angelic tone as he slo-mos through shots of naked girls frolicking around with each other. Watching this scene I became very worried, fearing that De Palma was going to turn in another one of his D-grade faux-porno disasters and that this was going to be an unfortunate experience for me. We eventually get to the titular girl, played by Sissy Spacek, who sensually soaps herself up in the shower before having her first period, which she responds to by screaming for help, clawing at her classmates and then being bombarded by them throwing pads and tampons at her. For me, it all came off as hilarious in the worst of ways, and I was most certainly worried about the outcome of the film.About half an hour later all of my fears were gone, as Carrie quickly made a turn from this bizarre camp into something much more sinister and wickedly entertaining. De Palma has certainly delved into the camp before to mixed results, but here he transcends it, creating a high-drama high school horror that is exhilarating, hilarious at times and at others downright chilling. None of this could be achieved without Spacek's performance at it's center, a stunningly immersed work that dives right into the insecurities and pain of this character. Anyone who has been bullied in school can find something to relate with in her and I found myself going right on the same emotional journey with her, all thanks to Spacek's wonderfully empathetic work. It's an impressive evolution she goes down, from the mousy abused to the terrifyingly powerful, and Spacek is convincing for every moment.Special note should also be given to Piper Laurie who, as Carrie's psychotically religious mother, brings an intimidating terror into every moment. There are some scenes that sent chills through my bones but none did it more than the image of Laurie chasing us through the house with a knife in her hand and a haunting grin across her face. Boosted by these great performances, De Palma is able to bring his high school hell motif full circle in wonderfully entertaining ways. That angelic tone that he establishes right off the bat is present for the whole thing and just becomes more and more appropriate as the film gets deeper into it's religious themes.Even my complaints with the shower sequence ended up being thrown out the window when things came around to the bathing scene in the final act. The contrast between these two scenes was so well-done, perfectly capturing the evolution of this character. When we first see Carrie in that shower she is so lost and insecure, and the small appearance of blood sends her into a frenzy. Then, when she gets into her tub at the end she is literally bathing in blood, but she has no fear or nerves. She is calm, the blood serving almost as a catharsis, a rebirth for her. It's a serene quality, making the next moments all the more frightening. I do think that there are some sequences that De Palma drags out a little too much, trying to utilize a building suspense when his talent for thrills really lies in a more in-your-face approach. It's a small complaint though and only occurred once or twice in an otherwise high energy horror classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

But whether you love it, hate it or are indifferent about it, no one can deny the impact that CARRIE has made on everyone who grew up in the Seventies...or that it continues to resonate with new audiences even today.Based on the very first runaway bestseller by Stephen King, this was a tale that acknowledged the peril-laden sharks-and-piranha-filled environment that was high school. Teasing, bullying, ostracism and how shockingly (at least back in the day) the girls were more adept at practicing casual cruelty than boys would ever be.Into this circle of Hell as yet undocumented by Dante, comes poor Carrie White. No friends, a bleak future at best, and her only family being her Christian funda-MENTAL-ist wack-job of a mother, the last thing she needs is to become the favorite scapegoat of two of the meanest of the ""Mean Girls"" at Bates High School...Blond, frosty bitch-goddess Chris Hargensen and her irritating sidekick, Norma Watson. But that Carrie does, and the taunts, teasing and relentless bullying reaches its breaking point, when a terrified and clueless Carrie experiences her period for the very first time in the girls' locker room, and the resulting chaos resembles an all-female version of LORD OF THE FLIES (if you add flying tampons).But that very day, Carrie discovers something else she possesses....Latent telekinetic powers that have been unearthed along with her traumatic introduction into womanhood. Nobody knows - not the teachers, her tormentors or even her mother - and as Carrie begins to discover that maybe she does have a chance to assert herself and find some kind of happiness after all, the stage is set for a teenage tragedy of epic proportions.A lot of things were at stake with this film. It was Brian de Palma's last chance to prove himself as both an auteur worthy of carrying the torch for his hero, Alfred Hitchcock, and as a director capable of producing a box-office smash. It was THE long-shot at the big time for a cast of virtual unknowns: Sissy Spacek as the tortured title character; Piper Laurie, leaving semi-retirement to play religious fanatic Margaret White, Carrie's mother; Nancy Allen (a future Mrs. de Palma) and P.J. Soles as Chris and Norma respectively; Broadway and film star Betty Buckley playing the sympathetic gym teacher Miss Collins; Amy Irving (one of the future Mrs. Steven Spielbergs) as Sue Snell, the only girl on Carrie's side; William Katt (THE GREATEST American HERO) as Tommy Ross, Sue's BMOC boyfriend and the key to Carrie's downfall; and in a cameo that would send his career skyrocketing, John Travolta as Chris Hargensen's lunk-headed boyfriend, Billy Nolen.Some films are so bad that for those who participate in them in front of and behind the camera, no one's career is left unscathed. Happily, in the case of CARRIE, the exact opposite was true. Where de Palma's penchant for raiding Hitchcock's bag of tricks usually got him into serious trouble, he was firing on all cylinders with CARRIE, because it all worked perfectly. Everything - from the dynamic performances (both Spacek and Laurie were Oscar nominees), to Mario Tosi's photography and Pino Donaggio's unforgettable score - meshed together to go above and beyond King's effectively horrifying prose, and what resulted was a tale told about the hopefulness - and horror - of humanity, that has served as a genre touchstone for nearly four decades.All this time has passed, and even having seen it about two dozen times or more, the movie never fails to affect me. I almost envy those who have never seen it, because there is nothing like the first time. The experience will never leave you....EVER...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A terrifying story and a tragic look into life as a teenager,"Carrie is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story in film to date and still stands up to this day. The Story follows Carrie White a normal high school student who secretly has telekinesis powers and she will understand the powers she has and has to overcome her over protective religious mother and the school bullies who want to hurt her and the prom is when all of her powers are reveled.
The cast is lead by a amazing preformance by Sissy Spacek as Carrie and she can perfectly portray a lonely high school student. Piper Laurie is Margaret White the controling mother of Carrie who uses religion to shelter her daughter from the world and she is also one of the great major parts of the movie and her preformance is so super. The supporting cast is Amy Irving
,William Katt,John Travolta,Nancy Allen and Betty Buckley the supporting cast is also one of the best parts of the movie as well and they really bring out the characters from the book.
Carrie is such a great adaptation of a Stephen King novel and while it is a carzy story because a girl can move things with her mind but it's more than that it is story about how high school can be a rough lonely time and Carrie is a view on how some people are treated at high school and that bullying is a part of that time in a teenagers life and King made that a very good point which can be relevent to some youths in modern life. Carrie is a great movie and it defently is a movie that starts off like a teen movie and it becomes a horror movie very quickly and it is a great example of a Stephen King story adapted right.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It's simple, it's horror, it's a classic!","""Carrie"" it's all and more than just a simple drama movie of the 70's. It's a piece of revolution on the history of horror in cinema. With bunch of classic scenes that we can see that inspire various pieces of modern terror cinema, it's also one of the best movie adaptations from a Stephen King's novel.Simple and effective headline story, with creative production, strong characters, believable special effects and nice fluidity through out the film, ""Carrie"" works in every way. It's a fun watch and one of the works that definitely defines De Palma's carrear.Brian's storytelling on screen it's the perfect example of a movie that does justice to the original story and to the author himself.Maybe ""Carrie"" it's responsible for a huge good start on SK's carrear and post-modern horror cinema.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
More of a Good Drama Than of A Horror/Thriller,"When I first saw ""Carrie"", I expected to watch a different type of film. By having read the plot outline and some reviews, I had prepared myself to watch a thriller. Yet, I discovered that ""Carrie"", although it contains typical horror/thriller elements (such as frightening scenes, at least for the '70s standards), is actually is a drama; a good drama, in fact.The story revolves around an introvert and shy girl, Carrie (Spacek), who faces the sarcasm and teasing of her schoolmates. Moreover, the poor girl cannot even find peace at home, as she has a tyrannic mother (Laurie) who is obsessed with religion at the border of madness. When Carrie gets invited at the school prom by a charming boy, things for the first time seem to be going well for her. Yet, everything gets spoiled, as the arch-brat of the school, Chris (Allen), decides to play a very dirty and humiliating trick to her. Carrie, who has telekinetic powers, but who until this point has not actually used them on purpose, goes berserk, and things start to really go wild from here...Brian de Palma does a good job in focusing on the hardships that poor Carrie endures, and how these affect her personality. I found the first scene (where Carrie has her period and gets ridiculed by the other girls) especially disturbing, as it shows vividly how her environment treats her in the most inhuman and mean way. As a matter of fact, I believe that the point of the film has been to primarily portray the multiple psychological traumas that Carrie faces, rather than focus on her telekinetic abilities or her revenge. And this is actually the strongest point of the film: One cannot help but be deeply touched by the outstanding performance of Sissy Spacek, whom we watch going through her cruel ordeal.The other performances range from good (Buckley) to average (Allen, Travolta, Irving). Finally, Piper Laurie is very good as the evil mother.All in all, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unforgettable Classic,"A bullied high school girl discovers that she has the ability to move objects with her mind and uses her newfound skill to get back at her classmates and repressed religious mother.Sissy Spacek is excellent in the title role and can go from breaking your heart to making you recoil in terror in the blink of an eye. Piper Laurie as her evil mother makes an equally strong impression and takes what could have been a silly role into something dark and sinister. The supporting cast of teens and teachers is ever bit as excellent as Spacek and Laurie and they all create a believable environment for Carrie's ticking time bomb.Director Brian De Palma is at his very best here. He uses color, split screens (and diopters), and slow motion to create brilliant sequences of suspense.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

From Jedi To Sith,"A good movie indeed. It looks a bit old watching it now, but it's a really good movie. First movie based on Stephen King books. Although the acting is not very good and exaggerated, it does not bother you because the script and story of the movie are good. Sissy Spacek was so beautiful and amazing. If I'm not mistaken, she was 27 years old when it was filmed. First of all, I was annoyed with the mother character. Her ignorance is annoying. Parents should not raise their children religiously. If a person is sane, let him research and decide for himself or herself. I mean, this is a horror movie, yes, but it's really frustrating when the mother is ignorant, trying to raise her daughter in this way, and beating. Do not raise children religious. Give lessons and give education about the subject in the movie. I think it is a good and classic movie. I like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not too shabby.,"I have to be honest, I was a little skeptical about liking this movie 'cause I'm really not a very big fan of horror movies.  They're ok, but they usually don't interest me.  I figured I ought to see ""Carrie"" anyway, 'cause it's a classic horror movie, and it's directed by Brian De Palma.  I've really grown to like Brian De Palma as a director, ""Mission: Impossible"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and despite pretty bad reviews, I liked ""Mission To Mars"" a lot.  I also saw ""Scarface"" and ""Snake Eyes"", and they were pretty good as well.Anyhow, back to ""Carrie"".  As I watched the movie, I didn't feel like I was watching a horror movie.  Even after seeing it, I have a hard time calling it a horror movie.  I'm not really sure what I'd call it, but it doesn't seem to be much of a horror movie (although, I can't argue that it DOES have elements of horror in it).I thought the film was very well acted (minus a few scenes that I think could have been done better), and the story was actually pretty good.  The movie really seemed to flow quite well, I wasn't bored at all during the movie, and was interested in all the characters.  All-in-all, I thought it was a very good movie, and I hope that you agree.  Keep in mind though, that this movie was made in 1976, so it's not the same kind of movie as you see in theaters today.That's about all I have to say about the movie, thanks for reading.-Chris",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deserves its classic status,"Watching Brian de Palma's celebrated horror 'Carrie' one can't but help noting that it's dated, by its special effects (actually, not a problem), by it's film making techniques more generally, and also by the director's judgement of what passed for mainsteam-acceptable titilation in the 1970s. But there's also a lot going on in the (Stephen King-penned) plot: its poor eponymous heroine is caught between puberty, bullying classmates, a tyranical, evangelical mother and her own growing powers of telekenesis, which, it's ultimately suggested, are the results of demonic posession (or maybe even possession by Jesus!). In fact, the plot and pacing of the film are excellently managed, preparing the audience for the moment when all hell (quite literally) breaks loose. Carrie's own helplessness in the face of both her own power, and the cruelty of others, is well-conveyed. By the standards of modern excess, this movie is not exactly shocking; but the air of menace is pervasive throughout. I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre in general; but it's not hard to understand this film's classic status.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A genuine horror classic,"Brian de Palma's ""Carrie"" is based on Stephen King's debut novel of the same name. Today the film is recognized as a horror classic while Mr. King hasn't done too bad for himself either.The title character is a high-school outcast with a religious fanatic for a mother. She is routinely victimized by her peers but her developing telekinetic powers threaten to make her tormentors pay for the distress they've caused.The cast, composed mostly of unknowns, was well-assembled. Sissy Spacek is excellent in the title role and Piper Laurie showed no signs of having just returned from a 15-year hiatus. Both actresses received Oscar nominations for their efforts.Another strong point of the film is the visual aspect. It's clear that de Palma put a lot of thought into the film's look. While he sometimes goes overboard it cannot be denied that there are numerous striking images throughout the film. The musical aspect is also well-handled with Pino Donaggio's score sometimes recalling the work of Bernard Hermann while at other times imparting a dream-like quality.I would not hesitate to rank ""Carrie"" among the best horror films of all time, alongside the likes of ""The Shining"" & ""The Exorcist"". Even if you're not much of a horror fan I still recommend the film on the basis of the often memorable visuals.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Their not gonna laugh at this!,"Thank you!! Over 40 years old but what a well made horror story. It took me a while to process at first, as I wasn't sure about how to feel with Carrie being all innocent and sweet, then turning into a raging killer. And I have to say, I was actually kind of routing for her the whole time! This film just kept on continuing to shock me in so many ways.....without JUMPSCARES!!!!!!!!! It just builds and builds and builds. You really feel for the Carrie, and just hate the girl whose always bullying her. And they don't try to be subtle with the main antagonist, at the end when Carrie is drenched in pigs blood, her and John Travolta actually try to killer Carrie by running her over....Jesus Christ. It's so messed up by the end, the audience is routing for Carrie, to seek her revenge!!! Plus, the film ends as it should, finishing off loose ends and a fait that's inevitable for Carrie. It's a well directed film and has a lot of religious imagery, but only present when the mother is around....which works perfectly, as when Carrie is away from her mother, she's just a normal girl, wanting to fit in.It's like Pretty in Pink, mixed perfectly with Horror right at the end.

Little surprised me as a result of that familiarity, and whilst a few elements haven't aged well it maintains power and a capacity to unnerve. De Parma's direction make the extended prom sequence almost unbearably tense; his use of split-screen as it unravels a master stroke. Aspects of the whole feel too heightened for me, but the performances and universality of much overcome that. Spacek's performance is one for the ages, and the film's ongoing influence undeniable and deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good horror-drama by De Palma,"Once again, I have not read the original Stephen King novel on which this film is based on, so I can't draw comparisons there. I have heard, though, that it's a fairly faithful adaption. I don't have too much faith in neither De Palma or the idea of novel adaption, but this one looked somewhat interesting, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did; it's definitely one of De Palma's better, and one of the better horror movies of that period. The climax is great, some of the best use of split-screen and instant zooming I've ever seen. The use of slow-motion also adds a lot. The plot is good; it deals with Carrie, a teenage girl who's constantly bullied by her classmates and just about everyone else, for that matter. Her mother is a dominating and very extreme Christian believer, so Carrie also suffers under that. The film has a pretty good pace; there wasn't really more than five minutes in total out of the 90 minutes the movie takes where I was bored. The film has a few light-hearted and humorous scenes, which are probably there to keep the viewer interested, and intensify the climax, which comes as a huge shock, like a crack of thunder. Some would say that it has too many humorous scenes, considering the theme, but I think it was a good idea; though I guess the film is a little hurt by the unintentional comedy, mostly brought on by the slightly overacting performances of Nancy Allen, John Travolta and Piper Laurie. This is evidenced by the trivia section indicating that they did, in fact, think they were there for comic relief, which did ruin some scenes(mainly those involving Laurie, as she was the psychotic mother, who provided a little too much comic relief, rather than instill fear in some instances), though it's easily ignored, and doesn't ruin the movie as a whole, nor does it lessen the value of the point. The acting is mostly good. Sissy Spacek was great as the mousy Carrie. The characters were well-written, though I guess many of them, especially the teens, were cliches and stereotypes. The score was good. The music almost always fitted with the scene. The special effects are great, and the atmosphere and shocks were chilling. All in all, a very good horror-drama, that could possibly have been better, but De Palma makes good use of various cinematic tricks and editing finesses, which takes the film to a fairly high level. I recommend it to fans of horror and teenage dramas, possibly fans of King, and fans of Brian De Palma. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Far more than a horror movie!,"Well, Brian DePalma hasn't topped this movie yet! I saw it recently (for the fifth time maybe!) with some friends and I was astonished to find out that there were things I hadn't noticed! It's such a wonderful movie. It combines harmonically so many genres: college movie (one of the first), horror, light comedy. And Mrs. Laurie is breath-taking as Carrie's mother, while Sissy Spacek is, once again, over the top. And finally, there's the music: How can one describe the fascinating prom-song (I never thought someone like you..., sung wonderfully by Katie Irving); simply magical.About the art of the film, I would like to comment a thing or two: Notice the symbolization of the colors: White, black, red etc. There is always a secret message in the color of the characters' clothes. Secondly, the structure is amazing. I am amazed by the way DePalma constructed the movie; the moods change in a very convincing way(comedy-->irony--> horror etc.).To be brief, I am proud to say that ""Carrie"" is one of my favorite 70s films.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good, but...","This might be controversial, but I'm really not sure this stands up all that well. Sure it's a horror classic and it does leave an impression, it certainly did when I watched it in my teens. Now though it felt a little flat. Granted it starts with a punch. I'd forgotten how intense that first scene in the shower is, with its rip off Psycho audio stabs and the first look at Spacek's piercing stare. From there though it fells like a slow plod waiting game for that bucket of blood. Sissy Spacek is great as the outsider Carrie. Terrorised by her religious nut mother and vile classmates. It's pretty base stuff though. Bullied for being a bit different, pushed to the limits and to the beyond. If it weren't for the telekinesis we'd have no fun a all... how many times I've said that! Sure there's some fun to be had in watching nearly 50 years on, chuckling at the hair, the flares, the tuxes at the prom, but it's all a bit cheesy and schlocky. Like a daytime TV show cut with some B-Movie horror. I'm being harsh I know. I do like it. It is fun. It's classic revenge stuff as Carries goes postal on the entire cast, bad guys and good and 'that' scene is gripping, with its slow repeating shots delaying the inevitable and building to its dress ruining crescendo. Maybe it's one of those films that just doesn't pack the punch after it's first viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I have never seen any of the remakes, but it seems pointless to retell such an impactful story which is just beautifully executed.Carrie as a movie has all the charm of the 70s films, but yet it goes to a dark place. A place where morality is blended with massive psychological trauma, incredible supernatural ability, and the suffering of and confusion of becoming a mature human (sexually).Sexuality, plays a prevalent role in this movie right out of the gate, where all the cute girls are running around naked and fighting for boys. And sexuality is also strongly depicted against a strong Christian mythological backdrop.And there isn't a direct explanation.

The last word on high school,"If you're looking for the definitive statement on the experience of high school and being a teenager, forget about ""The Breakfast Club"".  ""Carrie"" goes deeper and more effectively into the subject than any shallow John Hughes treatment could ever hope to.Of course, it's all served up with a large dose of allegory.  Regrettably, few of us ever had the capacity for revenge that Carrie White does.  But the truth is here:  the mindless cruelty of fellow students, the first attempts to establish independence from parents.  This horror film has more reality to it than any ten ""realistic"" teen films.Additionally, it's in this early DePalma film that we first see his obsession with Hitchcock take shape.  Much of the camera work and editing is reminiscent of ""Psycho"".  Even the music score, though credited to a composer as original, is easily recognizable as a cobbling-together of Bernard Herman's ""Psycho"" score, particularly the music from the shower scene, which is used whenever Carrie's power manifests itself.The ending is legendary by now, and makes ""Carrie"" one of themost imitated films ever made, though few imitators have done their version with so much style and intelligence.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A terrifying tale of revenge that holds attention all the way...,"Stephen King's short novel CARRIE, was a decent book, not exactly scary, not really well-written.  Brian De Palma's CARRIE is an exercise in terror.  You can look past the religious symbolism thrown at you whenever Piper Laurie is on-sceen (she was up for a best supporting Oscar)  Just when you think you have it bad, you see a brutally mis-treated Carrie White.  Her mother is a religious zealot, tossing her in a closet to pray.  She is mauled at school by the immature (and grossly out-dated) teens in the picture.  Ah, but she has a gift: telekinesis!  Perfect for an ordinary plain Jane tortured by all and everyone around her.  Horror is not a word I think of when describing the film.  How about fiery intensity and terror.  This girl lives in a private hell.Which provides this De Palma classic with a clear and concise context. Carrie can explode at will and knowing this, we are held in a captive state. Also, her mother is probably the most terrifying figure we see.  She is a sick, depraved woman who treats Carrie like a miscarriage.  The mother knows, however, that her daughter has this gift, so she can be somewhat controlled.The acting is a bit dated, true, with the exception of the scenes between Spacek and Laurie.  (Spacek was also nominated for an Oscar as Carrie)  You almost feel like you have stumbled upon a lifestyle you should not be seeing.  Piper Laurie is nasty and demented as Mrs. White.  This film also has the distinction of being John Travolta's first feature.  Vinnie Barbarino goes to the evil heartland.  Amy Irving is forgettable and just so happens to be the only star from the original appearing in the upcoming 'sequel'.  Watch Spacek and Laurie at work.  The prom scene needs no explanation by now.  I was reminded of Hitchcock's REBECCA, when Judith Anderson sets Olivier's estate on fire.  This, like most of De Palma's work, stands on its own, with a little help from the master.",,Anonymous,Horror
After Thoughts,"I had such a roller coaster of thoughts before going into this movie and with my thoughts after 😅😅😅. When going into this I've always heard about the Stephen King film Carrie! It was in pop culture a lot and I expected it to be a great film! But then in the horror film community I found myself in, I heard a lot of people talking about how this is one of the bad ones. So I when going into I expected it to be super boring and was kind of dreading it, but I was pleasantly surprised! I don't know if it was the low expectations I had going into it, but it's not a bad film. I think the bullying was shown enough where you and people you hated but it didn't drag it out where the film just became miserable. It was really great seeing a young John Travolta in here, I was not expecting that! And I think that Sissy Spacek is a hugely underrated actress.

Excellent horrorfest which raises above every attempt to imitate...,"1st watched 12/10/2006 - 9 out of 10(Dir- Brian DePalma): Excellent horrorfest which raises above every attempt to imitate that followed. Brian DePalma does an excellent job of building up the suspense leading up to the prom thru slow motion, split camera effects, music, brilliant close-up shots and excellent direction even when you know what the final outcome is going to be. This movie started a series of Stephen King efforts brought to the big screen but for me the real star was the director. No other modern director could have done what DePalma did with this material, in my opinion. The movie is about an oppressed young girl, played by Sissy Spacek, who is made fun of because of her inability to fit in with those around her. Most of the problem is because of her bible-toting overbearing mother who chooses to close her eyes to the real world and blame everything on sin and the devil. Carrie, as she is known in the movie, in the meantime is starting to discover her telekinetic powers and is physically becoming a woman as well(which is seen by all in the famous shower scene that opens the movie). A few folks at her school are on her side and try to bring something positive in her life by hooking her up on a date to the prom. The problem is that others are scheming to setup a disaster but are unaware of Carrie's abilities to take revenge upon them. The rest of the movie, I'm going to leave up to you to see.

It's the classic tale of geek gets picked geek takes revenge out on her classmates. Sissy Spacek was great as Carrie but you can't say the movie was scary. There was the other protective mother, who's over enthusiastic religious beliefs wouldn't to make you sick. (she scream at Carrie for having her period) Don't listen to people who say this is the best horror movie of all time, there isn't any horror in it until the last 20 minutes the movie is just depressing!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
As good as horror gets,"I'm no fan of horror movies or books. Nor is Evelyn, my wife.As I've mentioned in other reviews, the HORROR genre is, and always has been, slighted. That is to say, knock off 2 or 3 stars and your new ceiling is 7-8.Even the (so called) expert reviewers do the same.As far as Carrie goes, the writing is so-so at best, surely below average in fact. But I am thoroughly convinced DePalma's direction is nothing short of extraordinary. Without it, this is another crappy horror movie. It's not just the suspense around scenes that involve her powers, (which were all good to excellent), or the pigs blood scene, or the final shocker; but the beauty of the the final dance where DePalma has the camera revolving around the Prom King & Queen, as they dance/spin in the opposite direction. It's nothing short of epic wonderful.Add in the fact that this movie has been considered an absolute classic for decades, exceedingly so too, out performing nearly all of the best in the horror category/genre in any decade.I was 22 when this was released in '76, Evelyn, 17. And if you ask most people in our age bracket, what movies stick out in your mind for that decade, or had an impact on you, you'd probably get the usual answers; The Godfather, Star Wars, Jaws, etc. And Carrie would be in the mix too, (the only one in the horror genre.). (Although we all now know that telekinesis is a proven power which some possess, and everything else in the movie was of this world then. Was it not? Perhaps it should just be considered fiction then?? Food for thought.)
In any decade, perhaps only the shining comes close.Regardless, although the experts rate other DePalma movies superior to Carrie, I disagree. But, as mentioned, horror genre movies, good or bad, so often receive immediate disqualification. If the writing were better, I'd rate Carrie a 10.Thx.Bob R.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
more  than  a  film,"each adaptation of Stephen King novels is a delicate action. because , more than expectation of readers, important is the vision of director. and, sure, the cast. Carrie is out of this law. because it is not part of an genre or expectation in ordinary sense. it is a classic but not is its virtue. it is extraordinary expression of Sissy Spacek performance but not is the essential part. because, out of definitions, it is a mirror. the horror side is only trace of a profound tragedy who defines our world. the blood, the expression of Carrie face, the shadow of mother, the end, all represents images for ordinary state of each of us. it is so human, so cruel in manner to expose the deep truth about society than it is not, in time, only a good/extraordinary/admirable movie, it is a warning. and clear mirror.",,Anonymous,Horror
"""I knew they'd hurt my little girl.""","These are the words Margaret White says, as she's about to stab her daughter Carrie to death, as punishment for going to the prom.I have seen both movie adaptations of this story, read the novel, and can honestly say that if I had to choose a favorite version, I'd pick this one, if -for no other reason- than because of the outstanding performances of both Piper Laurie, and Sissy Spacek, both of whom shine like new pennies.There is also the presence of John Travolta, early in his career, and Amy Irving early in hers.Though not one of my favorite movies, this film does have something of it's own to offer. It's one of Brian DePalma's best, and will haunt you long after you've finished watching it.What's striking about this story, is the rush one can get from pushing an already racked, and fragile creature over the edge...And the dire consequences that can come from that action.Shy and mousy Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) has been the butt of every cruel joke since toddlerhood.Raised by the fanatical and insane Margaret White (Piper Laurie), Carrie's home life is hell, and her school life is not much better.Constantly demeaned and humiliated, Carrie is surrounded by kids who have no compassion for her situation, and do everything they can to make it worse...That is until pretty and popular Sue Snell (Amy Irving), feeling genuine remorse for her actions, asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt), to take Carrie to the prom...But there are certain others in the group, among them Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), and Billy Nolan (John Travolta), who see this prom night as a perfect opportunity to do some mischief with an appalling stunt...not knowing it'll be the one that kills them.And not even the caring, and compassionate Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) can stop things now.People say Carrie's gifts are evil.It would be more accurate to say that this is what happens when mean people start preying too much on the weak, and the helpless.Like a myth or a spook story:Don't bully innocent people.

You've Got Satan's Power,"Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie give the performances of their careers as a teenage girl and her religious mother whose terrified of the day she'll become a woman and her demonic powers will be unleashed. To make matters worse, Spacek's Carrie is abused at school by her classmates and is being set up to be the laughing stock of the school on prom night.A memorable story by Stephen King is highlighted by the excellent performances all around and De Palma's wild direction which keeps all the emotional moments grounded in reality while letting the more fantastical elements terrify and entertain.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enthralling drama,"An enthralling drama. More than just a horror movie - the movie is also about growing up, school and all its trials and tribulations: peer pressure, bullying, fitting in (or not) and wacky, non- understanding parents.Interesting, intriguing set up. Director Brian De Palma builds the intensity and menace well. Great climax too.However, once we have the climax of the prom night scene, the movie seems to fizzle out after that. It's as if De Palma, or writer Stephen King, didn't know what to do after that. The conclusion is very weak.This movie launched scores of careers. This was Stephen King's first movie (or TV) credit. His next cinema movie would be The Shining. Since Carrie he has received 184 (and counting) writing credits, on cinema movies and on on TV.Brian De Palma had directed several movies before this, with little success. Carrie got him noticed.This was Sissy Spacek's 3rd cinema movie, Amy Irving's 1st and John Travolta's 1st. Travolta's next cinema movie was Saturday Night Fever...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Undeniable Classic,"Carrie is one of those undeniable classics that has such mesmerizing scenes that it almost feels like you're dreaming. From the tastefully done nude scenes in the locker room, to the final scene in which the girl brings flowers to Carrie's house everything feels hazy and dreamlike. I say this because the cruelty that happens in this movie is too much for one to accept. The way Carrie was treated in this movie was with a type of cruelty most of us can't comprehend. She is a sweet, mild tempered girl who means well and minds her own business, and yet everyone hates her. When I say everyone, I mean everyone. Even the adults in her life, like the brassy Mrs. Collins, are two-faced and have a disdain for her. Even her own mother, a religious lunatic who punishes her for wanting normalcy in her life, and who turns on her at the end of the movie. Carrie has absolutely no one, and that is heartbreaking. When even the people you're supposed to be able to depend on turn on you, what can you do? Carrie answers that question. Carrie is the story of the girl who has endured such extreme psychological and emotional abuse that she reaches a breaking point and destroys everyone who crossed her. Which, in a way, is a satisfying karmic equation, but also horrifying. Carrie excels at showing the human capacity for emotional cruelty to each other, but also in creating surreal moments that capture human emotions so poignantly. Its greatest gift is allowing us to see that how we treat each other matters, especially as young adults. It the holy grail of the horror genre and certainly a movie that will cut us to the core.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Campy Comedy,"A shy high school student who has led a very sheltered life becomes the target of bullies before she unleashes her wrath upon them. Spacek manages to make her character sympathetic, but she, like all the actors here, was in her late 20's, too old to be believable as a high school student. Laurie is hilariously over the top as Carrie's mother, a God-fearing woman. The special effects are cheesy. It's somewhat enjoyable if one treats it like a campy comedy, which it is unintentionally. The last 15 minutes unfolds in slow motion and drag on for about half an hour; perhaps De Palma did not shoot enough footage to meet the requisite running time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The acting of the entire cast is more than perfect. And everything fits perfectly. One of the best book adaptations to the big screen and my second favorite horror movie.

Be careful who you pick on,"Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a bashful and at times rather clumsy teenaged girl who is forever being picked on and humiliated by her peers. She is also constantly being hassled by her overprotective mother (Piper Laurie). When her high school's prom comes along and her peers actually make her a prom queen, Carrie begins to realize that she may be liked after all. However, it all turns out to be a set up as her peers have positioned a bucket of blood above the stage and release it to pour all over her. For a few seconds, everybody except Carrie enjoys a good laugh at her expense but at this point, Carrie decides that it's time to finally let out years of pent up rage and not being able to stand up for herself so she does so....with very deadly results.

"Pretty good, but not what I could call ""Stephen King classic""","This film was very interesting. There were a lot of ups and downs throughout. I liked this movie, I really did. I liked a good portion of the characters, and the story was well-told. But this just isn't my favorite King movie by a long-shot. I know I sound sadistic since this is his first book-movie adaptation, but I just can't honestly say this is my favorite movie. But don't let that stop you from watching it. It was well made and everything. My biggest grievances are the pacing of the movie, some plot holes, and some of the characters. The pacing here was off, things that should have taken place didn't, or took too long to. Some things in the movie were not fully explained either (like why Chris is such a bitch). And some characters needed to be taken out (like Chris, again). Chris was an angry bitch for seemingly no reason whatsoever. John Travolta's character didn't seem to have a mind of his own. I don't know why his name is on the DVD cover (It says ""Sissy Spacek / John Travolta""). Hes not even much of a main character and is WAY overshadowed by the annoying girlfriend Chris. The ending was sort of lousy as well...but, I don't rate movies badly just for a few flaws. Which is why I gave this a 6/10 and not a 1/10 (as over-dramatic movie nerds do just because a movie has some flaws). I recommend this movie to fans of Horror/Drama movies. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Without Sissy Spacek this would not be more than a mediocre film,"""Carrie"" has become a very influential horror movie. Brian de Palma is not known for his nuanced productions, but in ""Carrie"" the horror flows naturally from the characters in stead of shock effects appearing out of the blue. Only in the last twenty minutes de Palma unnecessarily accelarates and gives us one ""shoot out"" too many. The iconographic image of Carrie soaked with pig blood however is from this phase of the movie.The story of ""Carrie"" has much in common with the story of ""The match factory girl"" (1990, Aki Kaurismaki). An emotionally abused girl (both at home and outside) flourishes after she finally gets attention. The following disappointment is more then she can bear. She takes revenge in a gruesome way.It is interesting to see more or less the same storyline adapted in an American (""Carrie) and European (""The match factory girl"") way. The European way is more subdued, both in the way that is taken advantage of the girl as in the way that she takes revenge.In ""Carrie"" the action is situated in a high school, and therefore sex plays a more prominent role. The average girls are obsessed with boys and clothes and Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is an outsider just because her religious fanatic mother forbids her to wear pretty clothes (not to mention make up) and has told her nothing about the female period.De Palma uses this in one of the first scenes of the film. After a gym lesson Carrie is taking a shower and is caressing herself in a slightly erotic way. The spectator is expecting everything apart from a horror movie. All of a sudden the water turns red. Carrie has her first period and the mood of the film changes instantly. A brilliant scene. I wonder if de Palma for this scene was inspired by the famous shower scene from ""Psycho"" (1960, Alfred Hitchcock).In ""Carrie"" there are people who are willing to ridicule Carrie to score a cheap success by their fellow students. On the other hand there are also people who feel sorry for Carrie and try to break through her isolation. Both kinds of people are present under both teachers and students. Restricting myself to the students: Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen) tries to mock Carrie and Sue Snell (Amy Irving) tries to consolate Carrie.What surprised me from a director like de Palma (who is not known for his female friendly characters) is how weak the boyfriends of these two girls are. Both girls manipulatie their boyfriend as if they are radio controlled. Chris manipulates her boyfriend Billy (played by John Travolta in an early role) by giving sex. Sue manipulates her boyfriend Tommy (William Katt) bij refusing sex. By the way, the manipulating beauty queen Chris reminded me of Jacy (Cybill Sheperd) from ""The last picture show"" (1971, Peter Bogdanovich), and that is not a compliment.For a long time ""Carrie"" was for me synonymous with Sissy Spacek. I still am of the opinion that without her the film would be mediocre at best. There are however a few other names to mention. I always thought that the career of John Travolta started with ""Saturday night fever"" (1977, John Badham) and ""Grease"" (1978, Randal Kleiser), and was unaware of this earlier role. He plays not without merit. Higher praise for Piper Laurie who had not acted for 15 years (that means since ""The hustler"" (1961, Robert Rossen) I guess) and plays the religious fanatic mother in a scary way. Still ten years later she would again be the mother of the main character in ""Children of a lesser God"" (1986, Randa Haines).Honestly I didn't know the cinematographer Mario Tosi, but he contributed to the look and feel of the movie with striking camara-angles. To name just a few. Angle from above (birds eye view) in the opening scene when the girls are playing volley-ball. Angle from below in some scenes where the mother is harassing Carrie. Deep focus when Carrie says something in the class room en we see also the facial expressions of her fellow students. Circulating camera when Carrie is still having a good time at the Prom.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best Stephen King adaptations.,"This movie is an adaptation of the first book Stephen King ever wrote, and i think it couldn't have been better.First of all, it's directed by Brian DePalma, who made some dreadfully boring thrillers (Obsession), but also some very suspenseful thrillers (Dressed to kill, Body double). This falls into the second category. It also has some great actors at the start of their careers. After this movie, Sissi Spacek, Piper Laurie, John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving became highly respected actor/actresses.What makes this movie work so well is the involvement with the characters. Carrie, the main characters is a tragic and (aside from the supernatural powers) very realistic character. Who hasn't know a very insecure, shy teenage girl that the more popular people used to pick on. Only this time payback is a bitch. And although the way Carrie executes revenge on all those who have taunted her is very violent, you can't help but sympathize with her after all she's been through. Here was a girl who after a very unhappy childhood was given a glimmer of hope by being chosen as the prom queen, only to find out it was a setup for the most disturbing, embarrassing humiliation possible. Sissi Spacek is especially great at this point, when she's lost all her marbles. Piper Laurie is fantastic as the domineering, religious fanatic mother, and the likes of John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving are pure evil personified as heartless classmates of Carrie who are relentless in their badgering of her.Weakhearted people should brace themselves for the final shot.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Slow down,"Stephen King wrote this book in a hurry and when it came time for Brian de Palma to shoot it, he also didn't take his time. The result is a story that is rushed.The book is slim and the film is short. Motivations are barely explored and we get from point A to point B without much time for looking around to see what's causing what. Sissy Spacek is marvelous. Nancy Allen, too. Travolta is a joke, the least threatening bad boy ever.Of course, finances played a big part on why they were rushed. King needed money to eat. De Palma needed it for special effects. Neither got as much as they should. So out came the product before justice could be done. You see flashes of brilliance from men who would become titans in their fields, but this isn't the best effort from either of them.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great movie,"""Carrie"" is basically a film that shows how destructive human anger can be. A true horror classic, director Brian de Palma made ""Carrie"" a film that no one else could touch.  To some, this film isn`t scary at all. I partially agree, the first sixty minutes of this film can almost pass for a drama. On the other hand, ""Carrie"" exudes a distinctive eeriness and intensity that is more effective than blatant gore and horror. Sissy Spacek`s performance as Carrie White is nothing less than brilliant. Piper Laurie is equally good, playing Carrie`s religion-frenzied, psychotic mother.  High school has always been a hot concept for films, and this film focuses on a real adolescent issue; adolescent cruelty. It can be painful and unpleasant, but for Carrie White,it was pure hell. To top it off, she has to endure her mother`s madness AND understand her new-found psychic powers.  De Palma`s stylish but gloomy direction makes this film riveting, from beginning to end. ""Carrie"" also possesses a quality that a lot of horror films do not, poignancy. You can easily sympathize for Carrie and her sad life. Even when she unleashes her powers, destroying everything in her path at the end. The conclusion of ""Carrie"" is very disturbing and almost upsetting, because the protagonist`s battle to win some compassion ends terrifyingly and tragically. Carrie`s deadly wrath was unfairly triggered, but she had to pay the ultimate price. Powerful and chilling, ""Carrie"" is a horror film that should be enjoyed, appreciated and cherished.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
They're all going to laugh at you...,"Based on a Stephen King novel, Brian De Palma's 'Carrie' far exceeds the typical Horror genre. Even though it is labelled a horror film, it has a strong psychological context to it and the story itself is quite layered. As King occasionally does, much of 'Carrie' is open to interpretation but the problems presented in the film are still common among today's teenagers.An essential component of the film is Sissy Spacek who plays the title role. She completely embodies her character by capturing Carrie's fragility, vulnerability, shyness and low self esteem. Many young girls could relate to the character. Most of us might have noticed someone like Spacek's 'Carrie' in highschool. Kudos to the actress for such a brave and accurate performance. Amy Irving and Betty Buckley do a fine job. Piper Laurie is great as Carrie's deranged fanatic mother. The rest of the cast is good too but this is Spacek's film.On the technical side, it's decent. The visuals and editing are good enough and the score is brilliant.In terms of substance, 'Carrie' offers a lot more than the average horror flick and even though the conclusion is arguable exaggerated, it does reflect the real life horrors of modern day highschool especially the theme of bullying.",,Anonymous,Horror
I was disappointed,"The legendary Carrie, which everyone has seen and everyone loves. Man, when I read in the newspaper that it was going to be aired, I just had to see it. When I sat infront of the television, I was somewhat confused by the opening shower shot. Naked girls? It felt like a pretty unnecesary shot, but perhaps someway, in Brian De Palmas mind, it was necessary...The plot is: Carrie White is a girl who goes to Bates Highschool. She's an outsider who has no friends of any kind. The only relation she has is to the gym teacher, who's always nice to Carrie, trying to help her. And then there's her mother, who is an overly religious fanatic who, perhaps, should seriously consider turning to another religion before she dies from praying to much. Carrie has one strange ability, however... She can move things with her mind. Toss objects, unlock doors and open them with a mere thought.Suddenly, her world is turned upside down as a boy in school asks her to the prom. At first she thinks that it's just another trick, so that the popular kids can get her to the prom and them laugh at her. But as time goes on, she's not so sure anymore... And it also seems that her mind gets more and more powerful.I didn't really like this movie. First, it took off to fast. 50 minutes into the film, Carrie was already on her way to the prom, and we all knew that that was going to be the climax right there. At the prom, we got some character development, but nothing really more. It just drags on, until the splitscreen finale (which I'm not going to spoil) starts. This so called ""legendary"" scene, was not quite so good as I had imagined it. It was kind of tame, actually. But for 1976, I can forgive it.The actors do a pretty decent job at their work, but none of them stand out, except perhaps Piper Laurie, who portrays the mother. I really wanted that person to die from the first scene I saw here, and that means Piper did a good job with her. Sissy Spacek plays Carrie, but I really didn't care for her. Nor any other actors. Even John Travolta, who has a supporting role, doesn't really stand out, but everybody's gotta start somewhere, right?Nothing else is really remarkable about this film, except that De Palma's loooong scenes, makes sure that 100 minutes seem to fly by, somehow. It feels like we are given less, and that it takes to quick for the film to establish Carrie's character, and then plunge her into the prom... Well. I didn't like it at least. But I will give it some credit, for keeping some cool questions unanswered until the end. You'll see. They are pretty much unrelevant to the story, yet interesting.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I loved it!,"This movie is the best movie I've ever seen! It is my favorite movie of all time and nothing could replace it. The first time I saw this was in the seventh grade after school. I've heard from people that they thought it was scary, I saw that day and I quickly fell in love with it. It was always on after I got home from school so I would watch it. I never rented the movie because for some reason I didn't want to. One day when I was on vacation in New York I asked my mom if we could rent it. I was really bored so I thought a movie could be good. I watched it 3 times and then I had to return it. A month later in the summer I asked my mom if we could buy it from amazon and she did. It came in few weeks. I was so excited that I watched it all the time. I still never get tired of it. I at least memorized all the lines from the movie and saw the features for over five times. I just love it so much it became apart of me. The casting in the movie was superb. Sissy Spacek was excellent as Carrie White. I thought she was perfect. She showed so much emotion, hurt ,and anger that I really felt sorry for her. Piper Laurie was very scary as Margret White. She was such a religious freak that it made me almost want to kill her. Amy Irving was also great as Sue Snell. At the beginning she seemed mean but more throughout the film she was nice and she felt sorry for Carrie. Nancy Allen as Chris, she was such a bitch. I literally hated her I wanted Carrie to kill her at the beginning of the film. John Travolta as Billy Nolan he was dumb and cute at the same time. I really liked him in this film. William Katt as Tommy Ross, he was nice. He was such a gentleman to Carrie that I really liked him. P.J. Soles as Norma Watson, I hated her as much as Chris. She was like a little sidekick with Chris. She was always wearing that red baseball cap that it drove me nuts. Brian DePalma is a genius. This film was so great, I'm so glad he directed an Oscar nominated film that proves how talented he is. The special effects were amazing. I loved them. The score was tremendous! I want to get the soundtrack to it so bad. Overall the film is amazing and beautiful, if you haven't seen it I suggest that you should. So for me I LOVE CARRIE!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
the horror of menstruation,"A sheltered teenage girl is viciously taunted by her classmates and abused by her religious fanatic mother. With the onset of menarche, she realizes that she has telekinetic powers. Like many horror films in the 70s, this one moves at a slow pace and culminates in a shocking horrifying extravaganza.Carrie was a personal favorite of mine when I was a teenager. Watching it as an adult, I look back on it fondly, but it isn't as exceptional as I once thought it was. I suppose I identified with Carrie and saw her as a sort of an icon. Now I am able to see beyond that and pick-up on other themes of the movie that are simultaneously frustrating (considering the film is both written and directed by men) and intriguing. Most significantly, Carrie's special powers are associated with her first menstruation, and ""becoming a woman."" Her mother treats Carrie's first period as evil--Eve's first sin is also Carrie's sin and she needs to repent for the rest of her life. Carrie ignores this at first, but ultimately believes that her mother (who we find is a ""woman scorned"") is right, as illustrated by the notorious pigs' blood scene. This is a much more complex theme than I initially realized, and it could be read as either slightly feminist or slightly misogynist, depending on how you interpret it.On to the performances. It is hard to believe the lead actresses were nominated for Oscars for their roles. Piper Laurie terribly overacts (apparently she thought the film would be a comedy, so this is likely De Palma's fault) and Sissy Spacek's performance makes Carrie seem more ""special"" than sheltered and abused. The movie does feature some incredible and innovative camera shots that are always fun to watch. I still enjoy Carrie, but not as much as I did when I was a mad-as-hell teenager.

Could NOT be more disappointing.,"TERRIBLE!  If I were Stephen King, I would be infuriated that filmmakers performed such BUTCHERY on my work.  According to supplemental material on the Special Edition DVD, however, King apparently admires De Palma's and Cohen's version very much.In my opinion, King's ""Carrie"" novel was brilliant and powerful.  It actually WAS horrific and the level of emotion invoked by King was intense. The film adaptation does not come anywhere close to portraying the extremes to which the character's personalities and situations have gone.  Granted, perhaps the novel's characters are not particularly dynamic or complex. But they are effective, fun, and enjoyable.Some of the camerawork, sound and visual effects intended to be ""suspenseful"" are just plain hokey.  Well...actually, most of the film is. John Travolta???  Give me a break.How can this film have possibly earned Academy Awards?  Especially considering the usual pretensions of the Academy.

This movie will blow your mind!,"One of the best social misfit movies of all times, only this one has a twist. It's ""Carrie""! Made in 1976, Sissy Spacek the beautiful redhead from Texas, plays the title character hands down! The girls' locker room scene was just the beginning of teenage boys' ""wet dreams"". The showers, the dressing, and the late period Carrie gets that gets her all freaked out. I know she looks like your common outcast. However, hanging with people who ostracize her is a mistake anyone would make. She took care of that little bike brat who shouts ""Crazy Carrie, crazy Carrie!"" She should have popped his bike tires with her mind. Then there's the memorable prom scene. ""Dirty pillows"" are breasts and the mother was all high and mighty, and full of you know what! The prom was great, expect the pig's blood joke was the ultimate no-no. Everyone in on the joke paid the price big time, by feeling Carrie's rage, telekinetically. And the couple in the car, had their running her over plan went up in smoke as well.

Excellent film adaptation of Stephen King's first novel,"Released in 1976 and starring Sissy Spacek and John Travolta, 'Carrie' is an excellent film adaptation of Stephen King's first novel, which was published in 1974.  The second scene of the film, set in a high school women's communal shower stall, is intensely disturbing and sets the scene most effectively for what is to come.Sissy Spacek captures the pain and awkwardness of Carrietta White, a put-upon young woman who lives with her Margaret, her VERY strict Catholic single mother.  Margaret has a proclivity for locking her daughter in a small closet for hours on end when she - Margaret - believes the young woman has sinned.  Cruel and unusual treatment, indeed.What separates Carrie from others is her special gift - that of telekinesis. This is the ability to move objects using only the power of the mind, and is a real and well-documented - if rare - phenomenon.Great to see a young John Travolta as Billy, Chris Hargenson's (Nancy Allen) jerk boyfriend.  This is Travolta's second film; he made his film debut in Robert Fuest's 1975 horror classic 'The Devil's Rain', but was practically unrecognisable in his role.  For my money, 'The Devil's Rain' is one of the greatest horror movies EVER and is strangely overlooked - no one seems to mention it when discussing the great horror movies.  The film's final shot will haunt your dreams... if you can sleep after viddying it, that is!Anyhow... back to 'Carrie'.  This film contains director Canadian director Brian De Palma's trademark split-screen effect in places, and it works quite well.  Great work from Nancy Allen, who was married to De Palma at one stage.  Her characterisation of Chris Hargenson is spot-on.  Hargenson is a cold hard bitch who loathes Carrie 'with the fire of a thousand suns'!  And a big shout-out to Amy Irving as Sue Snell; quite a capable performance. William Katt fits the bill as the high school's resident football star and golden boy; whatever happened to this actor?  Have not seen him in anything since Steve Miner's 'House'.'Carrie' is definitely one of the best King adaptations, although I feel that 'The Shawshank Redemption', based on King's novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', is the finest one yet.",,Anonymous,Horror
"A pretty good film, with a few caveats","A pretty good film, with a few caveats. Sissy Spacek was fantastic in her role. It seems that the filmmakers purposely made her look as unattractive as possible. Nancy Allen was good as the villain, as were Amy Irving and P. J. Soles. Most of the cast, however, looked too old to be in high school, a flaw found in many, many films set there.I was in high school at this time (1976) and a lot of the scenes don't really ring true. But my school was in a suburb of a large city, rather than a small town, and our proms weren't held at the school, but in hotel ballrooms miles away.Anyway, I had read the book long ago, but never seen the movie until now. Stephen King makes every scene seem perfectly rendered on the page. This adaptation was pretty good, but I did find de Palma's direction a bit annoying at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A well executed horror classic,"Watching Carrie for the first time nearly 50 years after its release, and somehow it still manages to feel fresh and sharp with a cutting edge to it.The central performance from Sissy Spacek is pitch perfect. There's an unease and quietness to the whole thing underneath the surface that bubbles up gloriously. The supporting cast gives performances that maybe feel a tad dated in parts. They are hammed up a little too much at times but that does work within the context of the film.The story is very simple but oh so effective. It has the themes that come to invade most of King's works, and they are well explored on screen in this film. It is easy to see how so many later films have been influenced and tried to poorly imitate this film.A staple horror and probably the best King adaptation for the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Prom Fright,"I was 16 or 17 when ""Carrie"" was first released and still remember keenly the hubbub which surrounded it. I recall a double page spread in one national Sunday newspaper on the frights generated by the movie with a graph highlighting the extent to which people were terrified in a kind of scare-ometer by certain scenes in the movie. In particular I remember all the chat about the climactic ending but no matter how many times you were told how it was to end you were still shocked out of your seat by what happened next.I believe this is the first time I've watched it since then and I was immediately struck by just how dated, at least in some ways, it has become, like the fashions or the sappy pop music soundtrack but with its prominent themes of bullying, cruelty, mental health, sexuality and parenting a lot of what it depicts still resonates today.Sissy Spacek plays Carrie White, brought up super-strictly by her religious zealot of a single mother. At school, the shy and inhibited young girl is an outsider and an easy prey for the classroom bullies, coming in for particular attention from her fellow schoolgirls. In the painfully upsetting introductory scene, where the girls mercilessly taunt Carrie when she has her first period in the communal shower, we see early signs of her inner power of telekinesis which usually comes to the fore when she's emotionally disturbed. Remember that for later...The only person initially on her side is the sympathetic PE teacher although later another girl seems to repent of her own part in Carrie's humiliation actions and goes so far as to ask her bubble-headed hunky boyfriend to take Carrie to the Senior Prom in her place. The mob-leader however, isn't so understanding and with her own boyfriend plots revenge against Carrie, having herself been banned from attending the dance for what she did.Although her Bible-bashing mum tries to stop her, Carrie eventually goes along with the idea as we see her transformed into a pretty young deb enjoying the attention of her handsome young beau. She even wins the Prom Queen contest but as she steps up to be crowned, her nemesis exacts a literally cold-blooded revenge only for this to trigger Carrie's darkest emotions when all hell practically breaks loose.While the film is undoubtedly painted in very broad strokes, once you get past the ""High School Musical"" level of much of the preamble featuring some fairly gauche acting by the younger members of the cast, the movie really comes alive with the dramatic set-pieces DePalma creates when Carrie does her stuff, which means of course a circling camera, split-screen action, long, tracking dolly shots slow-motion sequences and dramatic jump-,cuts, usually set to heightened music, indeed more than once you hear Bernard Herrman's ""Psycho"" violins in the background.Not quite as good or as scary as I remember it from my youth, it nevertheless features an excellent Oscar-nominated performance by Spacek in the title role and is still an effective thriller even today.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The film is bad but the book was brilliant!,"Almost everybody who read Stephen King's novel will agree to say that the film does not bear the comparison. The film is too fast and forgets far too much to concentrate on the psychology of the characters. On the other hand the film has a big chronological problem compare to the novel, we get lost a little bit and everything does not seem logical: for example how can Billy and Chris foresee the blow of the bucket before knowing that Carrie goes to the ball? Simply because the film is too fast! Therefore the film can be a good horror film (but not more) for those who don't know the book and almost a disaster for the fans! Especially that the atmosphere is not completely there either and the actors are rather weak besides the impressive Sissy Spacek which almost saves the movie by herself! And what to say about Brian De Palma's obsession for Hitchcock? Unable (once again) to impose his own style, he goes as far as copying in a hideous way some details of ""Psycho"" (the music, the knife), but so significant and so famous details that we start to think of the other movie during some seconds by wondering which film we are watching! Anyway the conclusion is simple: read the novel or wait for somebody else to make a better adaptation! (4.5/10)",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lacking in... everything.,"For those who have not read the book by Stephen King, this movie may come off as fairly interesting. For those who HAVE read the book, it may disapoint. Don't get me wrong, it followed the novel... as well as a movie could.The book is fascinating, because of the way it's written. Believe it or not, the plot is rather thin... but the writing is brilliant. It switches off from 3rd person, to Carrie's point-of-view, to ""articles"" supposedly taken from local newspapers after the fact. This redeeming quality of the novel cannot be transferred to film... so all the movie could possibly have to go on is a flimsy plot and a reasonably-sized budget.The adaption lacks character developement, and often contains overly dramatic ""dun dunn duunnnn"" style musical-stings, which makes it seem more like an episode of a 70's sitcom than a horror movie.I must give credit to Carrie (Sissy Spacek), for doing such a wonderful acting job with what she was given (nothing).OVER-ALL: As good as a movie adaption of Carrie could've been, which isn't very good at all. 4/10",,Anonymous,Horror
"Not scary at all, but not a bad film","Is it scary in the slightest? No, but in this case in isn't really a bad thing. It's story, while not very original, is well told and keeps your interest throughout all 96 minutes. The trouble with a lot of non scary horror movies is that they become incredibly boring very quickly. That does not happen here. Carrie herself is a extremely empathetic character who you come to care about quite a bit. You see how she's treated at school and at home and it strikes a cord, at least it did with me. You want to see her be happy and when she starts to feel happier, you do to. The last thing that makes this film work is the last oh say 20 minutes or so. The use of slow motion and sound (or the lack thereof) create an incredibly tense atmosphere, and I applaud the filmmakers on their decisions. So, Carrie is not a scary movie, but it is by no means a bad film. It relies on other things to keep it entertaining. (Oh yeah, I forgot. No jump scares throughout the whole movie! It's a miracle!)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
There isn't a movie quite like it.,"A rather campy and hysterical horror of a kind they wouldn't make now, probably for good reason.But the resulting uniqueness in its style makes it a strangely disquieting if unsubtle experience.It's hard not to fall in love with Jolie Laide, Carrie and the plot gives every clue we are going someplace terrible without getting macabre till toward the end.Not always dignified; Carries mother is a laugh and at one point they actually fast forward the footage.But it is enchanting and hypnotic. While James Wan shows us a monster and then has us trying to escape it as if it were a Spielberg Movie, this is post-tonal recount of an unfortunate situation that turned into a nightmare.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful,"This terrifying adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel was directed by shock maestro Brian De Palma for maximum, no-holds-barred effect. Sissy Spacek stars as Carrie White, the beleaguered daughter of a religious kook (Piper Laurie) and a social outcast tormented by her cruel, insensitive classmates. When her rage turns into telekinetic powers, however, school's out in every sense of the word. De Palma's horrific climax in a school gym lingers forever in the memory, though the film is also built upon Spacek's remarkable performance and Piper Laurie's outlandishly creepy one. John Travolta has a small part as a thug, De Palma's future wife, Nancy Allen, is his girlfriend, and Amy Irving makes her screen debut as one of the girls giving Carrie a hard time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One hell of a good horror movie; a perfect blending of drama and horror,"Carrie was Stephen King's first full-length book and I very much enjoyed it. It was both tragic and thrilling and a real page-turner. The movie is just as good. Usually, book to movie adaptations fail (which has happened a lot to SK's books) or never live up to hype, but this is easily one of the best. With a perfect cast and a competent director, Carrie is easily one of the best horror movies ever made.Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is an unlucky girl. She isn't good at sports and she isn't gorgeous. She is constantly picked on. After a P.E. class, she has her first period. All the girls there throw tampons at her and taunt her. When she goes home her over-religious mother (Piper Laurie) locks her up in a closet. Throughout the movie we follow Carrie and her lead up to the Prom. She manages to get a date with a little help, first she is reluctant to go, but she soon picks up the courage and heads off. The night starts off so well, but will later end up in tragedy.....Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie are excellent in this. No wonder they got nominated for Oscars. The score is incredibly eerie and Brian De Palma's direction is reminiscent of Hitchcock. This movie manages to blend drama with horror and is one of the only (if not the only) horror movie to move me.4½/5.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Acting and Wonderful cinematography make this horror film Shine.,"The whole entire cast of Carrie can really act!  All of them are excellent in their roles and truely believable.  Nancy Allen plays a bitch so well and Piper Laurie really makes you think she is psycho.  And Sissy Spacek really makes you feel for her and plays a sad outcast so well...when in real life she actually won homecoming queen and was liked by just about everyone....go figure.  The rest of the cast including John Travlota, William Katt, and Piper Laurie took their small roles and really made their characters developed.  Even the extras or one liners make were great!  And dont think I forgot Amy Irving as Sue Snell.  She really had the role of the sweet girl next door but with a twist...she did wrong and wasn't all virginal and holy but knew what was right and did a fantastic job with emotions.  The film also looks sooo good, especially for a 70's flick.  The style and camera work is excellent and the long one shot at the prom was amazing...and of course the famous pigs blood and telekinetic frenzy was shocking...I think a little more should of been done besides the water hose and some fire...but still good.  Now besides all that...this film really is a great film.  Its not just another horror movie, it's a character epic that will have you laughing, crying, screaming, and enjoying.",,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good overall!!,"I really enjoyed this film. It was such a creative way of telling a story of a telekinetic girl who struggles with an abnormally religious mother and a school packed with bullies, sexual harassment, and unaware teachers. Although this adaptation of the original novel by Stephen King is an everlasting horror classic, some things could've been better.I think my least favorite part was the sound. Even though this was released in 1976, movies like Jaws had great sound, so I don't know what the deal was. Everything sounded extremely cheap and were not scary or original at all. The other thing that would have made this a better movies would have to be the ending. If the movie ended a lot earlier than it did, it would have felt more fun to watch. Everything was so dragged out, and didn't need everything it included.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie,"Sissy Spacek is really good in this as the socially inept, psychologically tortured, girl living in the shadow of her overbearingly Christian mother, with few friends and some remarkable telekinetic powers. What ensues is a complex, at times convoluted, angst-ridden horror film that sees the best and worst of human nature - of all ages - depicted, as thoughtless pranks and humiliation become the order of the day with some chilling consequences. Piper Laurie is superb as the zealot mother, as is John Travolta as the odious ""Billy"" and the combination of Brian de Palma and Stephen King make for a compelling, multi-layered critique on many different aspects of intimidation, bullying as well as adding some genuinely scary moments too!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Taking it Slow Pays Off,"Carrie is such an amazing film. The way Brian de Palma took the time to set up everything for that magnificent prom sequence is just astonishing. The tonal shift is brilliant, he managed to make a teenage drama with horror, slapstick comedy in small bits and a lot of heart in the central character, not to mention the fantastic ways he explored bullying and puberty together with demonic powers.He developed everything so well that even the ending, confusing as it is for those viewing it for the first time (not the ending itself but the why those things happened), grips our emotions and we are fully emphatic with the characters. I even dare to say that our empathy goes to every single character since there is enought insight to understand why they are the way they are. It's all in small things with a lot of foreshadowing, but it's all there. It's a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best attempts to un-kitsch King,"I'll be short: the movie is very well directed, acting is great, photography is notable, plot is mediocre (as always with King) and the very idea is as old as schools exist. I always wondered: can King write a multilayer and profound book at all? Movies made after his books often overshadow his books because of direction, acting, etc. but it's always obvious that the plot, King's creation, is always weak and has nothing to think about after the movie's ended. You can remember spectacular scenes created by a cinematographer, wonderful acting but never can remember anything wonderful about characters' minds. The only exception from this rule is ""The Shawshank Redemption"", but still even there is not much originality, even there you cannot find any inside work in the characters' souls. Have they souls at all? As to Carrie, it's again a typical kitsch about a peer-terrorized girl raised by a religion-obsessed mother. The characters are so cartoonish that sometimes even incredible acting cannot bring them to life (especially it concerns Carrie's mother). There is nothing much to discuss. Would I recommend this movie? Yes I would. Watch and decide yourself whether you'll watch it ever again or not. As to me I don't know, because the filmmakers did their best and their work looks really great. 2 out of 10 for the King's work and 5 out of 10 go to the filmmakers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The book was way better!,"If you thought this movie was scary you obviously haven't read the book.Even though I only gave the movie 6 out of 10 I would give the book 10 out of 10 Ill admit there were some scary parts but the book went into so much more detail. If you have read the book you'll know what I'm talking about. There were a few crucial parts in the book which they left out of the movie. In the book there was a lot more about carries mother which I found very interesting. I can imagine how hard it must be to make a movie exactly like the book but I think they could of put more from the book in the movie. In the movie everything seemed to happen in a flash but in the book there was a lot more suspense. On the upside Sissy Spacek was amazing as Carrie and the rest of the cast was good too, they looked exactly how I imagined them(I kind of wanted John Travolta to play tommy though).

"It has it's ups and downs, but it's a breath of fresh air for horror","Carrie is... interesting. The intro is bad, the story is excellent, the climax is okay, and the ending is terrible. The lows and highs are incredibly unbalanced, making a barely average film overall. The most notable impact the movie has is that it's not a horror movie, but rather the first movie that's about horrific things from the ""monster's"" point of view. It's just as easy to care about the monster as it is for her victims, which is a notable accomplishment.Beginning at the intro, several things right off the bat show poor directing and editing decisions. The locker room nude scenes are disturbingly gratuitous, especially since all of the girls are supposedly high school age and at least one is pre-pubescent. The sound is mixed horribly. Loud and high pitched noises have horrendous audio distortion, so shouts are incomprehensible and screams sound more digital than human. Granted, I'm not sure if the audio is equally bad from every playing source (I watched it on Amazon Prime on a device that handles loud and high-pitched noises well). The ""music"" is terrible, randomly inserting 2-second horror sound clips out of nowhere at absurd times. Lastly, Laurie (the mother) is an awful actress. Carrie has a Southern accent, but her mom keeps switching between American, English, and Scottish dialects, often switching mid-sentence.With the intro out of the way, the story quickly sucked me in. Spacek (Carrie) acts extremely well. It's easy to connect with her plight, and her emotional moments are very convincing. Her struggles and her newfound place in the world carry the movie effortlessly to the climax.*Potential spoilers below*The climax is decent. The split scene was an interesting choice that served well to portray a sense of chaos, and it also helped cover up the fact that things were happening slowly or with poor special effects on either single screen. The brief pause was good to signal the change of pace, and continuing climax at home was exciting. Laurie (the mom) finally starts to occasionally slip into a Southern accent, but now she's switching between 4 dialects instead of 3.Unfortunately the film decides to conclude on the worst of terms with a series of illogical moments. I understand the symbolism of the mom's position, but it's impossible for her to be suspended that way, and it's far too obvious that she's just standing and holding herself. Lying on the floor or on something at an angle would have had the same symbolic effect without breaking the immersion. The entire thing with the house is just stupid. I'm hoping it didn't end up like the dream sequence and that Carrie actually pulled it down, but it didn't seem like it was intentionally done by Carrie if it was her fault. The doctor is an idiot for thinking a high school senior is too young to remember a traumatic event. The music during the conclusion also goes back to the absurdly placed horror sounds.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

I for one resent the use of gore in these latter known splatter films these days and as usual the more subtle and imaginative approach works best.As one user pointed out this isn't specifically a horror movie, but rather a movie about horror. About a girl who is bullied and harassed by her schoolmates then finally takes revenge.Sissy Spacek deserved her oscar nomination as the mis-treated Carrie and Piper Laurie was equally impressive. I also liked Betty Buckleys performance as the gym teacher who tried to help Carrie.I found this film both moving and memorable.

Chilling horror story of an unusual night at the prom...,"CARRIE probably represents the sort of outsider feelings author Stephen King had as a nerdy teen-ager in high school. He was able to reach into those cruel childhood memories to create a girl with telekinetic powers that gives her the ability to wreak revenge on her tormentors in a big, over-the-top sort of way.And he found the perfect director for such a project in Brian De Palma. His vision of Carrie's everyday torments makes for a very gripping film and one that deservedly won Oscar nominations for both SISSY SPACEK and PIPER LAURIE. Standouts in the cast include AMY IRVING, JOHN TRAVOLTA and NANCY ALLEN (who became De Palma's wife).The disturbing scenes between Carrie and her mother have tremendous power but the highlight of the film, of course, is the famous prom scene where all hell breaks loose when the pranks get out of hand. It's a testament to the skillful playing of Spacek and Laurie that they got Oscar nominations in what is essentially a quality horror film.Summing up: If you like Stephen King stories, CARRIE ranks with the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Adaptation of Any Stephen King,"Carrie was a truly gripping movie to start this review off. It was amazing in nearly every aspect. I heard it was really good, and I enjoyed the book, but like most Stephen King adaptations, the movie sort of ruins the book for me. Since I really enjoyed Carrie as a book, I was reluctant to ever watch the movie until my aunt told me it was really good. She doesn't read the books, but she's good at telling what I'd like. So when I found it one day at a movie store for only eight bucks on DVD, I decided to get it. I got home and immediately loved it. It was amazing. From the shower scene to the ruined house scene, the movie was truly creepy and sometimes just all out scary. The acting was amazing, especially Piper Laurie as the crazed Christian lunatic mother. And what I think made me really go for this movie was that it stayed true to the book except for two parts, which were just as awesome if not better than the book.

De Palma boldly tries to mix high-school drama with horror and mystery, but in the end all aspects fall flat, and as is often the case with Stephen King stories, the supernatural element is the dullest one in the whole movie. Sissy Spacek's performance is memorable enough to make a very flat and undeveloped character work, somehow; the best performance in the movie, though, is that of Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother, and it's completely wasted, as is anything good that De Palma has here.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A poignant ""horror"" movie.","Rating: **** out of 4.Brian De Palma's career took of with the success of this adaptation of Stephen King's first novel (who also boosted King's own success) about a teenage girl with telekinetic powers, using it to enslave her high school bullies during the most unforgettably horrifying prom night in history. CARRIE was a box-office hit and became an famous entry in the horror genre. But surprisingly when I saw CARRIE for the first time, I enjoyed it for more than being JUST a horror movie. Have you ever seen a horror movie that is touching and heartwarming? Or a horror movie where the supposed monster or horror is depicted as a sympathetic outcast? Or a horror movie that, before descending into a bloodbath, is staged as a romance? CARRIE has it all. It's a horror movie as well as a send-up of one. De Palma knows that the movie isn't really much about Carrie's telekinetic abilities, but about Carrie herself.An icon of every high school outcast ever since, Carrie (played perfectly by Sissy Spacek) is depicted less as the violent monster she would eventually be and is depicted like anyone else who is bullied by popular kids in school and tormented by an oppressive parent. In that way, De Palma and Spacek is able to make us sympathize for Carrie as a nice girl who is pushed too far, making her now famous Greek tragedy-inspired finale all the more affecting. Piper Laurie is superb in an Oscar-nominated role (rare for a horror movie at the time) as Carrie's tormenting mother Margaret, who believes that her innocent girl is proof of her sinfulness. Laurie is both disturbing and devilishly campy, making her character one of the most memorable in the whole genre. Nancy Allen plays the notorious Chris Hargensen, a representation of the ""Most Popular Girl"" in high school, while Amy Irving plays the opposite in the role of Sue, a character who feels guilty for treating Carrie like dirt. William Katt plays her sweetheart who asks Carrie to the prom as an informal apology from Sue to Carrie. Betty Buckley provides the nice teacher role (a much nicer character here than in the book) who takes young Carrie under her wing. Oh, and watch out for John Travolta as Chris' nothing-but-trouble boyfriend.I hate it when some audiences from our generation look back on CARRIE is a campy, scare-free ""horror"" movie. Why, look for some cheap ""gotcha"" moments that aren't there? CARRIE is more than just the now-usual treatment of horror movies; it's a mature and affecting tragedy of sorts. How many horror movies these days are portrayed with sympathy and warmth that CARRIE had in its smaller moments? In the end, the movie is something that may not be scary, but its rather poignant and sad. In fact, I think some of the horror elements of the film are portrayed as intentionally campy, but that's just me.CARRIE is also a visual tour-de-force, with some memorable use of color and other visual techniques to drive the story. De Palma's trademark split-screen makes an appearance here during the famous ""Prom Night"" sequence. The film also has some underlying satire on high school life, during the 70's and even today. In fact, watching CARRIE today gives a few insights that probably wasn't a big deal back in the 70's.CARRIE is a masterpiece in the genre, and one of the most touching, funny, most tragic, and one of the most memorable horror movies ever.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Stephen King, at an earlier time...","Just after ""Salem's Lot"" and before ""The Shining"". King himself has commented that he wrote this while living in a trailer, living on an high school English teachers salary, and drinking (quite a bit) to forget about the state of his life at the time.Interjected in the story is the sardonic humor which all of us can remember certain people, places and ""catastrophes"" from high school. Carrie White (Spacek is perfect) embodies all the innocence and nerdy persona every freshman girl in high school hopes to not have. John Travolta and Nancy Allen, Amy Irving as the popular crowd. Also William Katt, who takes Carrie to the prom as part of the sadistic scheme.Comparing this to what happens in high schools today, this is now mild. Normally the theme of telekinesis would seem silly, but King paired with DePalma presents a viable story; the surreal insanity of high school, how everything is magnified to the point of hysteria. Betty Buckley in an early role as high school gym teacher.There is cutting edge humor here, which King often includes in his books. The principal, who is supposed to help Carrie, but is secretly repelled by her. Of course the standout performance is Piper Laurie, as Carrie's mother. Who wouldn't need some form of insanity to survive her psychological outlook on life?.While today a bit dated, this film still stands as one of King's earlier, and better films. His earlier stories, even the short stories, are well worth reading. ""Apt Pupil"" (1998) (with Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro) is also worth checking out if you are a King fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Another capstone in De Palma's career,"De Palma's among the most acclaimed directors of his generation. In this time period he was on a roll. Between this and Scarface, others... it's hard to pick a favorite. This might be his best.Carrie is a Stephen King horror classic, though less of a horror film in my opinion and more a drama/tragedy with a thriller section in the 30 minute climax. Sissy Spacek plays a very believable girl next door, who is as well adjusted as you can be with a horrible upbringing like hers. Her whole life is a waking nightmare, because not only is her home life a mess but her school is trash too.Not to spoil, but we get nice developments along the way and gain much better insight into the psychology of Carrie and the surrounding cast. The situations and interactions are believable, and Carrie as a character is relatable. Key performances by Sissy and Piper (Carrie's mother) are downright chilling, channeling shades of King's later works like Misery. I think what makes this movie so memorable is not only the spectacle of the pinnacle scene, but also how it captures really important aspects of commentary on society and bullying. Many parts of the plot and themes still resonate with people today, and cement it as timeless.As a side note the practical effects and cinematography are fantastic. Great directing. Hardly any problems all around. I love this movie and this is maybe my third rewatch over the years. Never gets old.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sickening to the gut,"I generally vote for movies and never comment or write a review. But this movie made me break my habit. I felt so sick and empty after watching it, I had to break my habit. One of the major reasons probably for such an emotional outburst would have to be the number of stars IMDb has bestowed upon it. Why this movie of all things? This movie does have its moments when the director is trying to showcase the character's powers, but miserably fails in developing any character. Reactions surprise you or leave you thinking what the hell is going on frequently in the movie. The movie leaves a lot of loose ends untied.I also found the acting quite uninspiring, especially from the protagonist. Blessed with a character to make a career out of, she delivers one of the most placid performances , I have seen.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense Film That Mirrors The Novel,"This is the work that made Stephen King a household name, however, when I read that he had thrown out the manuscript unfinished in disgust I was not surprised. I love King's work for more reasons than I can list here but I always felt that ""Carrie"" was like a hiccup (something coming out of nowhere that isn't usually what he later dealt with; or had dealt with in his short stories previously) in his chain of tales which, ironically launched his career rather than having occurred in the middle. The film directed by De Palma is well adapted and directed. While it is not scary I would say it is extremely tense. The conflict between Carrie and her domineering religious zealot of a mother are truly brought to life well. I thought it was interesting and truly a rare adaption which lives up to the material it is based on. It isn't perfectly done but there are many, many, many worse horror/supernatural films out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Sissy, sweet nightmare","In the '70s, ""Carrie"" was a show worth your money. By today's standards, it is not a horror movie at all. But horror isn't the point of this movie anyway. King goes much further than the simple scaring of the audience. ""Carrie"" is a primarily sad and heavy drama about an unhappy childhood, while supernatural aspects of the story and horror ending just serve the purpose of amplifying the drama. Mother, religious fanatic, was much more convincing to me in the 2013 remake, but Sissy Spacek really nailed her part. Although the movie does not give us enough time and background to get to know her well enough, Sissy's performance is so real and convincing that she transfers her emotions to the audience from the very beginning of the movie. We feel her sadness, her loneliness, her fears, her anger. When other kids mistreat her we want to kill them all. And at the end of the movie, that sweet shy little creature transforms into a frightening monster. Makeup cannot do that transformation on its own. Sissy nailed it. She is so creepy and scary at the end that she established herself as one of the most terrifying nightmares in horror movies history. Still, I prefer the remake.7/10 [10/10 for Sissy]",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stephen King's First Novel Makes It to the Big Screen,"Brian De Palma's assured adaptation of Stephen King's first novel does the book justice, but it falls short of a horror classic for me.Actually, this is one of those movies that maybe really wouldn't even be remembered today if it had not had the luck of casting an actress as good as Sissy Spacek in the title role, who finds things to do with the character that a lesser actress wouldn't have. It's also notable for showcasing John Travolta on the cusp of stardom. And Piper Laurie, who hadn't been seen by movie audiences since her appearance in ""The Hustler"" fifteen years earlier, pops up as a whacked out religious nutjob who would give Faye Dunaway's Joan Crawford a run for her money as worst movie mom ever.De Palma uses funky split screens to stage the film's big set piece, the prom in which Carrie lets her telekinetic powers loose on her tormentors. The device looks hopelessly dated today, but yet somehow works well in context and makes the scene more disturbing than it otherwise might have been.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Puberty can be rough,"One of the best things about Carrie, is that the makers successfully create empathy and sympathy for their main character. I don't think I have to point out that it makes a movie so much more enjoyable. It's something that lacks in today's Horror movies. Carrie White is brought to life by Sissy Spacek's outstanding performance, who I believe was the perfect pick for this role. The pace is quite slow and there's not too much going on for the most part. The plot consists of a slow build-up which builds towards a climactic scene. I won't spoil anything but it's easily one of the most amazing scenes I've seen on screen. The portrayal of high school cruelty combined with telekinetic powers is simply a recipe for disaster.Being a fan of his other work like Scarface and The Untouchables, I was pleasantly surprised as De Palma's name appeared in the opening credits. The fact that I could expect unfiltered graphic violence was a good way to start the movie. He even made fantastic use of split- screen techniques, which I'm not really a fan of in most cases. Neither did I expect John Travolta, which was pretty funny. Carrie, based on Stephen King's novel, feels authentic yet refreshing at the same time.

Why is this movie so loved?,"When i was about too watch this movie i had quite high expectations because of the reviews. Some people even said that this was like the best horror movie ever made. So with quite high expectations i jumped into the movie blind.Positives:Carrie's mothers acting performance is very good on being creepy and kind of out of hand.The story of the movie is quite creative.I like the fact that this movie focuses on bullying in school and when you've had enough you think ""enough is enough"" but this girl started a rampage!This movie is SOMETIMES good over what it's supposed to be.Negatives:I don't know why Carrie in the end of this movie opens her eyes so much and looks so serious. It's literally on the poster of the movie on IMDb.Controversial opinion, i know, but i don't think that Carrie's acting performances are that good.The movie didn't really have that much ""horror"" in it, maybe it was more of like psychological horror, a thriller or a drama? I don't really know but it was definitely not like most horror movies you see.The movie felt a bit slow.I don't really know what the ending of this movie was supposed to be. I might need a re-watch, but i just don't think that this movie is that re-watchable so i probably won't watch it again :/Who can you trust in this movie? What's the point of all the characters? Is there actually someone who cares about Carrie except the boy who wants to take her to prom (haven't seen this movie in a while, forgot the boy's name).Overall this movie is OK i think.

"""Everybody will laugh at you!""","It's funny how 5 words can mean so much to a person. I will never forget the image of this pale girl, with a look on her face of horror, embarassment, shame and raw emotion, covered in blood and through her eyes, the whole gymnasium, stands and laughs heartlessly at her humiliation.Carrie was a landmark for me, as I'm sure it was for a certain Mr King. It displayed for the whole world to see that school,(high school, secondary school) could actually be hell. In my mind Sissy Spacek was born to play Carrie White. She encapsulated all the emotions and feelings so well, your heart couldn't help but go out to her. In my mind this is a horror, but not in the sense of Carrie White's telekinesis, but of life, and of the people in it. Those who just wanna push things that little bit too far, for some nondescript reason. The girls squealing for Carrie to ""plug it up"" when she gets her first period and has no idea what it is, and when they start throwing tampons at her, is alot more frightening than most of the episodes of Carrie's telekinesis,(with the exception of the 2 final incidents). Piper Laurie's excellent portrayal of the religiously fanatical Magaret White, her determination that Carrie is first dirty and polluted which eventually gives way to her belief that Carrie is evil, is disturbing viewing especially considering that at the crux of this all, Carrie is her child. A WORD OF WARNING: De Palma's version differs from Stephen Kings novel, however that does not make it bad, since the initial essence is there. Carrie is an unfortunate victim of circumstance, trapped in a world that she does not control, one thread that is evident in both the film and the novel is that Carrie's ultimate empowerment and her decision (arguably based on instinct and reaction)to initiate it, leads to destruction of the town and finally of herself, but throughout the whole thing she remains, unsure and often even unaware.Carrie is a victim you care about and you understand the revenge she exacts upon her classmates and the redeemed Sue Snell(Amy Irving), however, you get the feeling that Snell's attempts to bring Carrie happiness is slightly a case of trying to forgive herself for descending into madness in the girls locker room.The final scene (one of the best classic endings of a film ever:discuss!?) is a final triumph for Carrie, her final revenge, her gift to Sue Snell, her legacy. But throughout the whole film, never was this more a case of just an innocent victim of circumstance. A triumph for King and De Palma, (plus a chance for De Palma to home his skills down, in particular his trademark split screen filming). If any parent ever said life was easy for kids, sit them down and make them watch Carrie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Old before its time?,"Stephen King's modern classic about high school bullying with a little dark supernatural sprinkled in of course.It is over 30 years old, but it watches much older mainly because DePalma is as usual trying way too hard to homage/imitate someone else's direction style while at the same time putting way too indelible of a 70s dorkism stamp on the texture. Much about the pop culture of the 70s is rather non-nostalgic and cringing camp, and a film like this one so completely bathed in the decade's cheap cologne, very justifiably suffers. Carrie has some effective horror scenes, maybe even a couple iconic ones, but these are too often followed by wandering Film School exercises that leave you scratching your head as to the whereabouts of an editor. The background score is soap opera grade and distracting. The performances are very good and the casting of the hate-ables is spot on. PJ Soles and the chubby obnoxious guy from Miami Vice shine as the hard to look at, too cool for school loathsome antagonists. Yet as with virtually all King works, the book is more satisfying than the film for lots of reasons. You lump all of these many negatives together, and the result is a film that really can no longer be watched in its entirety and survives only for about 15 minutes of its effective and disturbing horror imagery, which Im sure you could just you-tube and spare yourself a wasted evening.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Decent teen drama,"Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a teenager with a hellish life, routinely attacked by tormentors (Nancy Allen, PJ Soles) at school and abused by her zealous mother (Piper Laurie) at home.Usually billed as a horror movie, this isn't very scary. There's really no villain here. The tormentors aren't all bad, and Carrie's mother is only doing what she thinks will prevent Carrie from suffering eternal damnation.It fares much better as a drama. You truly feel Carrie's pain, and the way Carrie's treated is disturbing, but not really scary.But even as a drama, it doesn't fully succeed. The character development is sketchy and superficial, the psychological and emotional states of the characters are never fully realized, and there's nothing biting or thought-provoking.The performances are very good. Both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie deserved their Oscar nominations. Another standout is Amy Irving, as a fellow student who takes pity on Carrie. Irving's dream sequence at the end is the best part of the movie (I'm not going to spoil the scene for you, you'll have to watch it yourself and be amazed).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A glorious 1970s horror movie...,"The 1976 horror movie ""Carrie"" is definitely a movie that can be watched again and again. And it is certainly a mammoth within the horror genre, and it is a classic movie. If you are not familiar with the 1976 movie from Brian De Palma, you certainly owe it to yourself to track down the movie and sit down to watch it.The storyline, from writers Stephen King and Lawrence D. Cohen, is an enjoyable and entertaining one. The character gallery is rather detailed and well-written, with some memorable characters, and of course with Carrie (played rather well by Sissy Spacek) being the most outstanding and memorable. The contents of the storyline is capable of supporting multiple viewings without the movie becoming any less entertaining.Whereas the narrative might come off as a bit slow paced, director Brian De Palma is utilizing the time to establish the story, flesh out the characters and setting up the stage for the final showdown. And what a showdown it is. Once the blood comes down, the movie just shifts into a whole different pace and direction, making that last 30 minutes an extraordinary experience to sit through.The acting perforamnces in ""Carrie"" are good. Leading actress Sissy Spacek is simply phenomenally cast for the role of Carrie and puts on a stellar performance. The movie even has John Travolta, William Katt, Nancy Allen and Sydney Lassick on the cast list.While ""Carrie"" is not a movie that relies heavily on special effects, director Brian De Palma proved that you can make a rather impacting and memorable horror movie with very little special effects, instead relying on storytelling and character development. And that was a testament to ""Carrie"" and how effective of a horror movie it turned out to be. And it definitely is one that has withstood the test of time gracefully.""Carrie"" is a movie that you must watch if you are a fan of the horror genre.My rating of ""Carrie"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Maybe the book is scary,"I have long heard that this movie is one of the scariest movies ever made and that it is a directorial masterpiece that set the stage for modern horror. Absolutely none of that is true.Part of what marks 1970s horror movies is terrible acting. Specifically Priscilla pointer does probably one of the worst performances I've seen in a horror movie. Quite a few of the characters feel like they are a spoof of 1970s horror movie acting.The writing is not necessarily solid either. The concept is there, don't get me wrong. It's just that the script itself is not very compelling.But of course the biggest thing I hear about the film is the directing and how it changed the way movies were filmed. You maybe could make an argument for the spinning platform during prom, but none of the rest of the film is unique, even during or before it's time.My biggest issue is definitely that it's not scary (except for maybe the very last scene in the final minute and a half). Even though I hate Halloween, I get why some people are scared by it. I don't see what's scary about this movie. There's not jump scares, you feel too much compassion for Carrie, the main scene of the movie is a little too goofy to be scary, and the concept is not in and of itself scary. I just don't get it.For a comparison of movies I thought actually were scary, I present: The exorcist, Ju On the grudge, Ringu The Thing 1982, As Above So Below, The babadook, The shining, Night of the living Dead, and scream.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"one of the more entertaining, chilling, and tragic stories ever about High school","Carrie is from a novel by Stephen King, and directed by Brian De Palma, and it can more than likely be found in any horror section of the video store. But to me the film may lend itself more to being a kind of weird, darkly satiric take on High school life that only really gets into the outright horror in the last twenty minutes. For the most part Carrie could just as well be a fable about the ugly duckling or some other kind of outcast. Nothing in the film or story is necessarily subtle, but it's hard for me to carp- all of the one to two dimensional characters are brilliantly played, and through such fantastical material there is a truth reached that might not be struck with a different cast or director. It's a unique blend of theatricality, style, and some very realistic, harsh notes about societal repression. That it's fun, and funny, at different times also puts it a notch above other genre material (certainly above other King adaptations about the mawkish loner with special powers).Sissy Spacek is in a career-making performance as Carrie, the awkward girl that everybody in school (at least all of the juvenile teen girls in gym class) teases to no end, who's own paralyzed way of being among people works against her. The first big chunk of the film is really dramatically satisfying and heart-wrenching with, aside from the obvious 'trait' Carrie possesses, could happen to any loner teen. After an accident in the girl's shower, to which taunting reaches a high peak, all of the girls (including the likes of PJ Soles, Amy Irving, and the very sexy b*tch Chris played by Nancy Allen) get detention under the only one who really cares for Carrie (Betty Buckley), and so the girls plot revenge involving the senior prom and a bucket of pig's blood. Meanwhile, Carrie still gets her ultimate repression by her bible-thumping, very nuts mother (Piper Laurie in the most successfully over-the-top performance of the film). As the prom nears, a near iconic line 'they're all gonna laugh at you' pops up, and becomes the crux of the last grueling act of the film.De Palma has only a handful of films that come close to this one for his sheer love for over-stylized, prolonged scenes that almost start to comment on themselves. And there's a really wonderful element to some of it, it's almost akin to Sergio Leone's the Good the Bad and the Ugly in just trying to see how far he can take his style before it might implode or get to just the right height of suspense. Obvious enough are the Hitchcock lifts in parts of the style, most notably in the climax with the split-screens and very similar music cues (all he's missing is Bernard Hermann). But his style works to making scenes already with a satirical tinge funnier as opposed for just shocking edginess. My favorite was the scene showing the gym teacher working the girls hard out on the field, this reaching almost a cartoonish side to it. And, of course, what would a 70s horror movie be without an amazingly explicit, slow-motion jump-cuts in the girl's locker room? This style works best with King's material, adding an extra emphasis on the emotional manipulations and cruelty, and rigid, constricting structure, that school imposes.Sometimes, too, part of the enjoyment in seeing a film like this is not just the take on a telekinetic getting her vengeance on her teasers and pranksters, but how it all fits well into a psychology and general outlook on High school. Certain scenes with the supporting characters are good at this, like with a very amusing John Travolta and Allen in the car. This is the kind of take on high school life that likely inspired other films like Heathers and Donnie Darko, but Carrie has a kind of timeless quality to it too. On the other hand, if you are looking through the store and want Carrie to be a genuine horror film- once it truly transitions into that section, it's (appropriately) gory, lavish, and unexpected; I had already seen this climactic scene somewhere before seeing the whole film, but it still kept me on my toes, particularly the final confrontation between mother and daughter. One of the best King adaptations and a very good turn from director and cast.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
When Wickedness Strikes Out ***1/2,"Sissy Spacek in a totally brilliant Oscar nominated performance as a girl bewitched with telekinetic powers.

The latter, brilliant as Paul Newman's girlfriend 15 years before in ""The Hustler,"" achieved new heights in the role of the fanatic religious woman, afraid of sex and life in general,who would hide behind religion.

A thoughtful and engulfing classic!,"Excellent big screen version of author Stephen King's first novel is not only a suspenseful teen drama, but a touching character study too.Social misfit spends her days mocked by her classmates and harassed by her fanatically religious mother, then she discovers that she has the power of telekinesis...Director Brian De Palma made a number of top-notch suspense thrillers during the 70's and Carrie is surely one of his finest works. The story of this film is a compelling one because you not only feel sorry for the teen misfit of the title, but you also want her to find happiness. It all builds into a powerful drama that packs lots of thrills, occasional humor, and strong emotional tones. De Palma lends his usual stylish direction, drawing out the suspense and at times making the movie quite hypnotic with some inventive camera work. The lovely music score of Pino Donaggio is also a nice touch.Perhaps the best thing about this film though is the wonderful cast! Sissy Spacek does a touching portrayal as our title character, who turns to become quite frightening in the climatic prom scene. Piper Laurie is a powerhouse actress in the role of Spacek's crazed mother. Amy Irving is likable as the teen girl who wants to help the outcast. William Katt is strong as the hip jock who becomes one unlucky prom date.

Bitterly disappointing horror film,"When I first heard about how good Carrie was and how it set a standard for horror films, I was expecting a great film experience. However, Carrie to me was not only not a great film, but an extremely overrated one at the very least. My issues with the film lay more towards the storytelling where for 60 minutes of the hour and a half film it was like watching a 1970's version of Mean Girls. Shy loner girl is made fun of, humiliated by the popular girls and the storyline revolves around that in a very boring and pathetic pace. Sissy Spacek who is one of my favorites did do a good job in the film, especially in the final sequences of Carrie going mad at the prom, but there wasn't enough of a back story into the full range of her powers and the ""terrifying"" scene had none of the spine-tingling or heart-stopping elements of Halloween, or Jaws. Also people say Spacek was the first actress to be nominated for an Oscar in a horror film, which is incorrect as 3 years prior Ellen Burstyn was nominated for her role in what's been called the scariest film ever The Exorcist. Piper Laurie was also surprisingly good even more so considering it was her 1st film role in nearly 20 yrs. and is able to portray Margaret in a somewhat humorous, yet also unsettling way and really deserved her nomination. The rest of the cast is good, and De Palma's direction is decent Carrie just doesn't have any sort of real horror and is not the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beautiful Tragic and Dreamlike horror,"In 1976 Stephen King and Brian Depalma came together and working from King's material crafted one of the best movies ever created. The film tells the tragic tale of Carrie White (played marvelously by Sissy Spacek) a mousy abused girl who suffers endless torment at the hands of her classmates and fanatically religious mother (Piper Laurie who's also incredible). However, one of the girls Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels guilty and sets up her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take her to the prom instead of her. Another girl Christine Hargensen(Nancy Allen) gets her juvenile boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta in a very funny role) to play a prank on Carrie. Little does everyone know Carrie's dark secret: She is Telekinetic and once the prank is pulled, a holocaust of destruction is released like non ever seen before.This Classic from the 70's is flawless in every way; the acting is all top notch the effects are remarkable and the ending is haunting and tragic at the same time.

Gut-wrenching horror that is high school,"""Carrie"" is easily one of the best horror films ever made, a well-acted, yet difficult to watch display of the gut-wrenching horror that is high school.Carrie White (flawless Sissy Spacek) is a meek, introverted teenager who is treated with irrational disdain by everyone around her. Her vile classmates mock and humiliate her at every opportunity. Her teachers either patronize her or barely acknowledge her existence (the principal, in spite of being corrected numerous times, calls her ""Cassie""). Even worse, her own mother (Piper Laurie, who all but devours the scenery) is a man-hating, religious fanatic who forces Carrie to pray in a locked closet. Carrie's so used to being put upon, she's unaware of the fact that there are actually people who support her. One is no-nonsense gym teacher Miss Collins (stage veteran Betty Buckley), who defends Carrie against her heartless classmates. After Carrie is humiliated by the popular girls when she experiences her first period in the locker room shower, Miss Collins punishes their leader Chris Hargenston (Nancy Allen) by denying her prom ticket. Chris, a promiscuous, soulless queen bee, blames Carrie for her misfortune, so she convinces her idiot boyfriend Billy (John Travolta) to help her exact a truly despicable revenge against Carrie at the upcoming prom. It is also on that fateful day that Carrie discovers she has telekinesis, which at first frightens her but later empowers her, undoubtedly because it's the only thing in her life she has control over. Meanwhile, another unlikely supporter for Carrie is Sue Snell (Amy Irving) who's a real high school oddity: a mean girl who truly regrets her nasty ways, so she attempts to make it up to Carrie by having her boyfriend Tommy (William Katt) ask Carrie to the prom. Tommy, a dim but decent sort, agrees and Carrie accepts, though not without a bit of hesitation and bewilderment. Mrs. White tries to prevent Carrie from going to the prom by nastily telling her that Tommy will stand her up and that everyone will laugh at her. The newly confident Carrie, however, refuses to be cowed again by her mother, and goes to the prom with Tommy. Carrie is euphoric at the prom and Tommy truly enjoys her company, but, thanks to Chris's cruelty, heaven immediately turns to hell. Carrie's pent-up rage is finally unleashed as a nightmarish inferno in which no one will escape.""Carrie"" overcomes its potentially uninteresting teenage angst story thanks to Brian de Palma's direction and its well chosen cast of actors. Spaceck received an Oscar nomination for her performance; a rarity in horror films, but she truly earned it. Spacek makes Carrie a realistic, sympathetic character, and Carrie's innocence, insecurity, and ever increasing fury feel all too real. Spacek was actually in her late '20s at the time of this movie, but with her downbeat posture, wide, frightened eyes, and her long hair that she seems to use as a burqua, she does a seamless job playing the type of unpopular girl we all should have been nicer to. Spacek also does a convincing job displaying Carrie's temporary new happiness and confidence: her posture is straighter, her hair shinier, and during the early prom scenes, Carrie's new-found radiance really transform her from ugly duckling to swan. It's beautiful and touching to watch, and all the more devastating, knowing how quickly it will end. Laurie seems to have too much fun playing Carrie's abusive, Bible-thumping mother, and she's easily one of cinema's most awful mothers, right up there with Mrs. Vale from ""Now, Voyager"" and Mrs. Iselin from ""The Manchurian Candidate"".Two underrated performances come from Buckley, playing the type of teacher we all wish we had in high school (well, how many teachers nowadays would have the guts to punish the popular kids?), and Allen as the bitchy Chris. Forget Rachel McAdams in ""Mean Girls""... Allen creates the ultimate popular girl from Hell. Chris is a foul-mouthed, gum-smacking, Bonne Belle lip gloss-wearing vixen who always seems poised to say something nasty, and even her smile is more like a sneer. She and Billy are such a hateful, dysfunctional pair that their comeuppance is ""Carrie""'s most cathartic experience.While the prom climax is indeed terrifying (and the iconic image of a blood drenched Carrie will stay with you forever), I view ""Carrie"" as more of a tragedy than a horror. Carrie is a victim of our society's prejudice against shy, quiet people. As teens we take out our petty insecurities on shy people by mocking and torturing them. As adults we overlook and dismiss them in the workplace. Over thirty years since ""Carrie""'s release, nothing has changed. That's the real tragedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well-Deserved Classic,"I think that ""Carrie"" is deservedly a classic not only in the horror genre, but also in cinema. Before, you jump on me, let me say that I do not feel it is one of the best films of all time- I just think that the elements all came together very well.The heartbreaking opening scene, with the haunting score that appears throughout, immediately show us that Carrie is one of those that is doomed to be an outsider for life. This theme is consistent as Carrie encounters every character from the sympathetic and caring Miss Collins to the downright wicked Chris Hargensen. This film is driven by characters who we either love, hate and feel so-so for ( Tommy Ross )- which makes us invest our emotions into it. We see that Carrie is tragic and we feel for her because she goes through so much, both at home with mother and at school with her tomentors. We're happy for her when things seem to go right for the first time. The slow-motion sequence after she is named Prom Queen is just as delightful for us because she finally has gotten a taste of what it means to be noticed and cared for. Again, we become invested emotionally in this story.Then, the world collapses. Carrie realizes that all of this has been yet another joke- of the cruelest kind. And she's had enough. Suddenly, the anger builds and reminds us of her gift- which because of the way the story has been written, we forgot about for a while. But now, we are terrified. Because we've all wanted to lash out and hurt those who have hurt us. And now she has the chance to totally destroy everyone that has hurt her for so long. We don't necessarily approve of her actions- we just watch in horror.And finally, as she returns home, seeking nothing more than some love and care and warmth, she is met with hatred and anger- making her the tragic figure again.As kids, we all have moments where others are cruel. And for us, ""Carrie"" is a reminder of that pain and the terrible thoughts we have had. That's why it is a horror story to us. That... and Brian DePalma is a genius.",,Anonymous,Horror
Classic...,"""Carrie"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch a teenage girl being humiliated at the prom by her classmates and she unleashes the power she hides for so much time on everyone there.I liked this movie because it had a nice, interesting plot that contained plenty of mystery scenes that were combined very well with horror. The direction which was made by Brian De Palma was very good and he presented very well both his main characters and the plot. This had as a result for the audience to easily follow the plot while it could better understand the main characters and even relate to them at some points. The interpretation of Sissy Spacek who played as Carrie was simply iconic and she made the difference. To sum up, I have to say that ""Carrie"" is a classic horror movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most inspiring movie I have seen,"If there was something wrong with this film, it would be hard to pick out. It is amazingly acted, greatly scripted and everything a good film is supposed to be. It is my favourite film of all-time, and I couldn't stop talking about it for weeks after I first watched it. And then I got a reason to watch it again, I did my speech on Sissy Spacek, and I got the DVD out because Carrie was the main movie in my speech. Sissy Spacek was amazing, every scene with her in was special, she made Carrie White an emotionally-charged psycho. And what about Piper Laurie, she was just the most irreplacable character there will ever be, and I'm sure Sissy was scared of her just a tiny wee bit. The rest of the cast, Amy Irving, William Katt and Nancy Allen were amazing teens. I didn't like John Travolta's performance, it just lacked what the rest of the cast had going for them. Carrie has a sparkling script with added funny bits to remember it's a teen movie not a blood-sucking horror!! The moment Carrie gets soaked in blood, it's just so weirdly unreal to watch, ha ha. So I'm going to end this with my favourite tag line... IF YOU'VE GOT A TASTE FOR TERROR, YOU'VE GOT A DATE WITH CARRIE!!!!$$WICKED$$",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watching it 48 years later,"Well, I'm here because I watched the second version with an old friend, and they told me it was so different from the book that Mr. King wrote. I was curious to watch the first movie to see the differences between the two. So, here I am.Okay, many things are better in this one, and I'm pretty sure it's more accurate to the original book. Some things we see in both movies are definitely in the book. Just to make it clear, I haven't read the book. What I really loved about the 1976 version was how the characters fit better with the actors, and the casting was a much better choice compared to the new one. Beyond that, we seem to feel more emotions, more life, more elements that make the viewer care about what will happen in the story. I really think this one makes more sense in terms of the life some of us might have lived in high school, dealing with innocent things we did to be part of the ""gang,"" which didn't align with our values at the time. We felt more attached to the protagonist, without the cinematic aspects that the new movie takes so seriously. I'm talking about too many ""explosions,"" too much Hollywood stuff to make a mediocre movie seem more attractive. This one isn't like that. They use some really nice 70s horror/suspense music in certain scenes, which takes it to the next level, and they also include some slow-motion and silent scenes. The pacing feels a bit slow at times with these elements, but overall, it's a much better experience to watch than the new one. I did prefer some scenes in the newer version, but I think the 1976 version is a higher-quality film for me. It does have a few cringe-worthy moments and some scenes that I found unnecessary, particularly those showing too much skin of the adolescents. It feels like it could have been less intense in that regard and still conveyed the same idea.I'd definitely recommend watching this movie before the newest version to anyone curious about the ""Carrie"" films after reading the book. I'd give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of De Palma's best (and the best King movie adaptation),"Based on the Stephen King novel, this film details the ageless tale of Carrie White, social pariah thanks in no small part to her religious zealot mother, as she deals with being bullied.A great film is able to not only stand the test of time, but not become dated by the era that it was made. Carrie accomplishes both these tasks with aplomb. It still resonates as hard today as it did nearly 40 years ago (has it truly been that long? My how time flies) And even a couple truly atrocious remakes and ill-conceived sequel couldn't diminish the sheer power of arguably Brian De Palma's second best film.

Horror with a source that is not unknown,"High school student Carrie White has grown tired from enduring her life of oppression and torment under the tampon-throwing hands of her fellow classmates, the apathetic ruling of her school authority, and the maniacal punishment of her pious mother. As Director De Palma makes sure the audience is fully aware of our protagonist's hardships and consequent psychological states, he avoids a simple story where a demonized monster brings harm to innocent lives. Carrie's telekinesis abilities develop alongside her womanhood, and she becomes able to powerfully assert her justified agony onto those who mistreat her...and onto everyone else in her world. Furthermore, this movie presents us horror with a source that is not unknown, the most notable being religious extremism, social cruelty, and the persecution of femininity. Lastly, the movie does a fantastic job in constantly manipulating us as viewers into thinking things are safe. Warning: it is all a trap, because this is a twisted story where hopeful aspirations lead to the most terrible outcomes.For being blatantly but intelligently horrific with significant allusions to our societies treatment of womanhood, I give this movie a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch Out for the Quiet Ones,"I will never forget how old I was when I first read this book and saw the movie: I was eight. Granted it was rated R, my mother did not care. Then I got her and my middle brother to watch it with me. They loved it. In every high school (or grade school, for that matter), there is always that person who is bullied by everyone else and that person who tries to step in and stop it. What's sad in this day and age is that bullying has become such commonplace that nobody can stop it in time and the person who is the victim, nine times out of ten, will take their life.The gist of this is to, as the title states, watch out for the quiet ones. If you bully them long enough, they will do something to get even with you. You don't even need a timeless classic like ""Carrie"" to tell you that. In my opinion, this is definitely one movie that all school bullies should sit down and watch until they get the picture. When they're done watching it, they may actually break down and apologize to that person (or maybe they don't) for all that they've done to them.This is scary with a capital S. Ignore the two CGI-filled remakes that came after this. They can't even measure up to the shocks and scares that are developed with this one. A word to the wise: I try not to watch this in the dark. Keep a few lights on with this one. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Had good suspense,I learned that in this film the actress who played Margaret White studied her role as a comedy because of how extreme the mother was. In this film the main character who I think is interesting in Ms. Collins because it never actually specifies if she is on Carries side throughout the whole film she goes back and forth never actually choosing a side for Carrie. The fear factor in this movie wasn't great I wouldn't label it as a horror but more of a suspense because of the tension constantly built throughout the movie. I feel that in this movie the performances of these characters were super dramatic everyone was over the top and was at such a extreme that it wouldn't be a realistic thing to happen.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Horrifying with a menacing tone,"Carrie's opening scenes are truly disturbing. From the get to, De Palma creates an atmosphere of true dread. It's high school but it is still presented very seriously. the scenes of Carrie and her mother are perhaps the scariest in the film, thanks in part to the direction, but also because of the performances. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie (who I liked seeing in Twin Peaks) are a tour de force here, and at times their scenes linger on true religious obsessions to the point of insanity. The film is never dull, and until the final climax it keeps you waiting. The slow- motion montage before the tragedy in the end is very suspenseful and makes you want to in a way be there to actually help the characters, and it frustrates. I am not sure if I liked the ending or not, but it remains that Carrie is obviously a very influential film and has one of the most unnerving tones I have seen in a horror film.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Kinda Sad, Kinda Creepy, Kinda Good Too","I did not see Carrie during its original release but did check it out recently (40+ years later) and was pleasantly surprised. Spacek does a really nice job and she grows on the viewer. All of the other performances are fairly solid as well. The one thing that struck me as odd is that when Carrie is finally able to exact some type of revenge on her tormenters, she oddly does so very indiscriminately, including those persons that were kind and wanted to help her. This aspect bothers me a little as Carrie does possess a sympathetic side and that is not something the character would do. Other than that, Carrie is worth checking out for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The bloom is off the rose,"I've seen ""Carrie"" a bunch of times. I guess I always liked it but watching it tonight it kind of left me flat. ""Carrie"" has been copied/ ripped off (often by its own director Brian De Palma)/ parodied so much over the years that the impact of the film has been diminished quite a bit. It's classic De Palma style over substance. As far as 1970's low budget horror movies, ""Carrie"" is better than a lot of them but it hasn't aged that well. Sissy Spacek gives a great performance.

"""They're all gonna laugh at you!""","There's one thing I specifically like about certain horror films, and that is those that contain the horror elements, yet have a story that allows you to feel a great deal of emotion for a main or secondary character, depending on the focus of the plot. When Stephen King wrote his first novel, Carrie, it was shocking as well as emotionally heart-stopping. Brian De Palma's film, following soon after, is groundbreaking and intense, and captures the horror of the character's actions as well as the horror of her secluded and alienated school and home life. Sissy Spacek was brought to the project to play the title character, and does a top-notch job. She is the perfect ""ugly-duckling"" type for the role, and she is able to play out all of the emotion and terror that Carrie experiences throughout the novel. Amy Irving is does a credible job as Sue Snell, and her performance makes us believe that Sue really does feel sorry for what she has done to Carrie. The rest of the ensemble makes the movie believable, and never is there a moment where you will question the authenticity of a performance.The film is unflinching in its portrayal of female jealousy and sublimated sexual rage. The appearance of Carrie's powers coincides with her first period, i.e. the onset of sexual maturity. The following events are all about sexual attraction and jealousy, following Carrie's emergence as a woman, the dynamics of the other girls at school and their sexual/romantic intrigues, and the White family's bizarre sexual mores. The drama with the girls at school is all about dates and sex and going to the prom. Carrie's sympathetic gym teacher tries to get her to wear makeup and pay more attention to her hair. Meanwhile, Carrie's mother equates her menstruation with acceptance of sin, and later refers to her breasts as ""dirty pillows."" Once you start to look at it this way, you'll be surprised at the number of incidents and bits of dialogue that relate to this theme, and how carefully focused the entire screenplay is. The other amazing thing is DePalma's direction. The sequence beginning with the announcement of Carrie as Prom Queen is a masterpiece of building tension, notice the music and editing as the sequence gathers speed, culminating with the spilling of the blood. You will also notice that this entire sequence is dialogue-free. It is so tight, audacious and over-the-top that you have to admire it.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

What a Disappointment,"I never watched this movie in till last night. I was born in 1990 but I love going back and watching what my dad calls the classics. This is one movie I just never watched but with the remake out now I decided to watch this before I saw that one. I couldn't be more let down.For those of you who don't know this movie revolves around a teenager named Carrie(duh right?) who doesn't fit in with anyone at school. She gets her period while taking a shower in gym class and because her mother is a religious fanatic and doesn't tell her how her body works, Carrie thinks something is really wrong and when she asks for help they all bully her and pick on her. The catch is she actually has telekinetic powers and she slowly learns how to use them throughout the movie. The movie continues from there all the way in till prom where she is the center of attention thanks to a very cruel joke. I really thought I would enjoy this movie but unfortunately I didn't.Before I say why I didn't like this movie I did feel for her character and what she went through. I thought it was set up very well and just because it was set up in 1976 didn't detract anything for me. Bullying is bullying to me so that has nothing to do with it. Something was just off for me in this movie. Everything seemed to work but by the time the credits rolled I asked myself Why Didn't I like this movie?One reason is actually the prom scene. I know it is 1976 and the effects aren't as good as today but she managed to kill people with a fire hose? That scene was so boring to me and the whole time Carrie is just staring real hard at everyone. I found her portrayal good all the way in till that scene. After that her acting was dumb ed down. Her mother was one of the worse acting jobs I have ever seen. She was a religious freak but she didn't creep me out because most of her time on screen I thought she was trying to be funny. Carrie's gym teacher did do a good job though but not good enough to save it.Overall it wasn't a bad movie and I didn't go in with any expectations. It is just this movie gets so much love and the remake keeps getting bashed more than recent remakes. So I told myself either the remake is that bad or the original is that good. Well I can't speak on the remake but this is not that good. I also believe in judging a movie on its own merits instead of comparing two movies separated by almost 37 years. In-less it is a shoot for shoot remake which I read it is not, I don't see how it can be any worse. If it is I guess I am missing out on something. I give it a 5 outta 10.

I will say that Carrie is a girl with a mother that is overly zealous in her religion and has raised Carrie in it - making Carrie weird to others and they make fun of her for that. Carrie also has Telekinesis - a mental power that she uses only when she feels forced to use for her own protection.A really fun watch.

Ode to Hitchcock falls short,"Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" has been said to be his ode to Hitchcock. Unfortunately such a claim isn't justified.

But, what starts off as a great movie dealing with powerfully emotional issues of social ostracization and physical and emotional maturity turns into a cheap blood and gore fest.

An unmissable 70s horror classic.,"Over the past few decades, almost everything ever written by Stephen King has been filmed for either TV or the silver screen; however, very few of these adaptations have come close to matching the extremely high standard set by Carrie, the first King novel to receive the movie treatment.Directed by Brian De Palma, this superb supernatural horror stars Sissy Spacek as Carrie White, a shy and awkward teenage girl who is mercilessly bullied at high-school and further tormented at home by her overbearing, religious zealot mother (Piper Laurie). To make matters worse, at the same time as Carrie experiences her first period (during the film's unforgettable opening shower sequence), she also discovers that she has developed telekinetic abilities that get more powerful but less controllable as she becomes increasingly distressed.When a group of spiteful classmates (led by the gorgeous Nancy Allen and a young John Travolta) implement a nasty plan to humiliate Carrie during prom night, the poor girl finally snaps and unleashes her full psychic wrath on the unsuspecting revellers.Determined to impress with his first major Hollywood movie, director De Palma pulls out all the stops to bring Lawrence D. Cohen's excellent screenplay to life, displaying a confident and flamboyant style full of the fluid, gliding camera movements and impressive visual trickery that would eventually become synonymous with his work; these stunning visuals, combined with a lush orchestral score by Pino Donaggio and faultless performances from an amazing cast go to make Carrie an unmissable experience.Spacek's central performance is astonishing: her touching portrayal of the vulnerable and withdrawn Carrie—always wary, yet aching for acceptance—is heartbreaking and anyone who has suffered the indignity of bullying will no doubt find the fiery prom night massacre a strangely cathartic experience. Also worthy of praise are Piper Laurie as Margaret White, who mistakenly believes that she is protecting her daughter, but is actually doing much more harm than good (although her motherly advice about skipping the prom was, for once, right on the money), William Katt as Carrie's well-meaning prom date Tommy Ross, and Amy Irving as repentant bully Sue Snell, who is unable to thwart her school-pals' cruel trick.Stylish, beautiful, tragic, shocking, and even occasionally humorous, Carrie is an absolute classic that deserves a place in every horror fan's DVD collection. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Taking the Wrong Girl to the Prom,"This is what it boiled down to, isn't it? Taking the wrong girl at the wrong time to the wrong place. By today's standards, this is a classy approach to depicting horror on screen. It builds on the theme of alienation, taken to the Nth degree by circumstances surrounding the sad short life of Carrie White (Spacek). I think it actually improves on some of the points raised in Stephen King's novel. The scorn Carrie endures from her classmates is apparent from the first minute of the film (and who can forget the traumatic shower scene?), but the adults are all presented as clueless dullards, as well. It's a highly disturbing scene when Carrie is attacked by the other girls for her sexual ignorance, but the subtext of sexual repression extends to the scene after the shower, where the school principal gets distracted by the close proximity of the attractive female coach (Buckley), causing him to repeatedly get Carrie's name wrong. Carrie's anguished reaction triggers the early use of her potentially deadly telekinetic powers (powers surfacing after her first period).Everyone's actions, including those of the sympathetic coach, are really geared around being self-serving. The coach is intent on punishing Carrie's classmates with a form of torture, possibly out of guilt for behaving the same way when she was in high school. She makes herself feel better by enforcing this punishment on younger versions of herself. The one good girl (Irving) also decides to help Carrie out of guilt, to make herself feel better. No one really thinks about Carrie herself and this proves to be to everyone's downfall. They happened to pick the wrong girl to mess with - very bad luck all around. The first two acts, a build up to the climactic prom sequence, are just a preparation. We wait for things to go to hell at the prom and they do. The sequence is not very frightening by today's standards. Mostly, you see a water hose go out of control, and director dePalma employs split screens to diffuse the action. Then the two main culprits (Allen & Travolta) are attended to and this revenge (or justice) is also lacklustre.But then we're back at Carrie's house and with her truly creepy mom (Laurie). Ms.White is what actually made the film a shudder to watch, a very unsettling depiction of religious madness. The true climax is Carrie's final confrontation with her mother and it'll stay with the viewer for awhile, whether they like it or not. Then the real shock, the epilogue dream with Irving. If I had to pick the one scariest jolt in all filmdom, it's this. Even watching it repeatedly, knowing what's coming, still makes the hairs on my neck stand up uncontrollably.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a particularly deep story, but executed very, very well","I cannot compare this movie to the Stephen King novel, since I haven't read it. So keep this in mind when you read my review.Carrie is a very socially awkward teenager who was made this way my an insanely religious and deeply disturbed mother. While students laughed at her, they didn't realize how hellish her existence was at home. Sadly, when Carrie does open up to those around her and finally tries to fit in, the kids at her school proved at the prom that they were truly evil and deserved to die...and then they did! The film is very well done and I think much of the credit is due to Sissy Spacek for her incredibly gutsy performance. Not only did she do some incredibly rough nude scenes, show a wide range of feeling but also put herself out incredibly far in order to get the best performance (read the trivia section carefully to see what I mean). The film succeeded more for her performance than the other supporting ones--as it's a lot easier to play a jerk than to play the full range of Carrie's emotions.As far as the direction by Brian De Palma goes, I must point out that I am NOT a fan of his style. De Palma NEVER leaves anything to the imagination and seems to usually believe that more is best (see SCARFACE). I would have preferred a few moments had been played more subtly and the film been less crude (for a 70s film, this movie had amazingly rough language). But, on the other hand, there was a lot of very creative camera-work and the ending (done in slow-motion much of the time) worked very well.Overall, it's an exceptional film but too bad there's so much nudity and foul language--as it was intended as a teen film. I do think that it's okay for most teens to see it, but parents should beware that the film does cross the line from time to time--making it a better choice for adults even though the message is one most kids should see.By the way, the statue in the closet is Saint Sebastian who was supposedly martyred with arrows. In a neat but not particularly subtle moment, this is recreated at the end of the film. Also, if you haven't noticed, Carrie and her mother are VERY similar to Waterboy and his mother...think about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic,"Carrie (1976)**** (out of 4)Stephen King's bestseller turns into one of the best horror films of the decade even though the horror elements don't show up until the final ten minutes. The film tells the story of a shy and abused teenager, Carrie White (Sissy Spacek), who gets invited to the prom by a popular guy (William Katt) but this here might just be another mean joke. Horror fans usually love this movie but I think the film is a lot more than just your typical horror movie. Director DePalma does a masterful job at handling everything that happens in this movie because for the majority of the running time it's a character study of an abused girl who wants to break free from her shell and live a normal life, which isn't possible do to her crazy mother (Piper Laurie) and the abuse from her classmats. When the prom scene finally comes up DePalma delivers one of the most beautiful sequences of the era when Carrie and Tommy Ross are dancing on the floor. The way the camera swirls around them, the faster and faster pace, you know something bad is going to happen but while this scene lasts it's very well handled. All of the religious elements that are floating through the film are quite eerie and unsettling and the stuff with Laurie are at times hard to watch because of the abuse thrown at Carrie. Another strong aspect here are all of the performances, which are great and we get a lot of memorable characters. Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles, John Travolta and Katt are all wonderful and the film really wouldn't have been as great had any of these actors had false notes in their performances. As I mentioned earlier, Laurie is downright creepy in her role but the entire film belongs to Spacek. We've all know people like Carrie White and the way Spacek captures her shyness and the body gestures she uses is right on the mark. Do to how many changes Carrie goes through, this was a very demanding role on Spacek but she never misses a beat. The teenage drama stuff all works perfectly and that's why the ending, when it turns into a horror film, is so disturbing. We see the pain going through Carrie and we want her to find happiness and when she finally does there's a certain peace that comes over the viewer. This leads to the wonderful dance sequence at the prom but then the joke is played and all hell breaks loose. The way DePalma handles all of this and makes it work so well just shows what an amazing talent he is.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Great 70s horror film, even better than Exorcist!!!","Oh I totally love this film!! I even drove 20 miles to buy it on DVD. I haven't watch the DVD yet, but I did saw the film on A&E Channel. De Palma, did a great job in directing this film. So totally a novel put into film. I got so fascinated with this movie that I have to keep on looking up for more references about it (even the cast) on the internet. Sissy Spacek's performance is outstanding!! I totally give her thumbs up! I like the way how Amy Irving portrays Sue Snell, oh shes so hot!! Especially in the end where she was dressed in white and visiting Carrie's burnt lot with the flowers, shes looks so pretty! Everything in this film was well-written. If I was living in the 70s and someone ask me which horror film I like, I say ""Carrie""! I haven't seen The Rage: Carrie 2 yet, but I will and review it later. Anyway, good film! Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
BEFORE computer effects were cool,"Carrie is one of those movies that is just unforgettable and you can't help but enjoy. Adapted from a novel that Stephen King wrote, this is a fantastic movie. The Oscars for acting were very well deserved and I wouldn't doubt that this is one of the best films from '76.Carrie is a shy girl in high school who gets picked on... a lot. At home, it's not any better, she has a psychotic mother who is abusive and highly religious. Everyone underestimates her and doesn't realize the little power she has inside her, telekinesis ""Thought to be the ability to move or to cause changes in objects by force of the mind"". When she has a very bad incident at school, a girl, Sue feels horrible and asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom in hopes to make Carrie a little more popular. One of the girls, Chris, isn't feeling so guilty, more of in a revenge mood and wants to get Carrie back for her punishment by being banned from the prom for her prank on Carrie. Her and her hillbilly boyfriend, Billy played by guess who? John Travolta! They together devise the perfect revenge by dumping pig's blood all over Carrie at her perfect moment of being prom queen. It's not done yet, let's just say she can throw one HELL of a prom.This is a terrific movie, not just for horror fans, but for any movie fan.

Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie!

Now Sissy and Piper were nominated with a strong reason: they are great great actresses, and this movie is no exception for them. Amy Irving also did a wonderful job as Sue Snell, Nancy Allen as Chris, the villain and finally Betty Buckley as the Miss Collins. Priscilla Pointer and P.j soles did also very well. The men can't be left behind since William Katt and John Travolta also perform extremely well. The directing is also great, Brian's best work by far.

One of Those Disturbing Films That Still Packs a Punch,"The first Stephen King novel that was adapted into a motion picture. ""Carrie"" is a strong horror film that works because of its characters more than anything else.  A young girl (Sissy Spacek, in an Oscar-nominated role) has telekinetic powers, but tries to ignore them.  She wants desperately to fit in with her fellow classmates, but has always been an outcast.  After a humiliating episode in the girls' locker room, classmate Amy Irving convinces boy-friend William Katt to escort Carrie to their senior prom to make her feel better.  However, others have a plan to destroy Carrie's self-esteem forever.  Nancy Allen and boyfriend John Travolta have a devious scheme that is going to forever alter everyone's lives.  Piper Laurie (Oscar-nominated) is also on hand as Carrie's mother, a woman who has some real strange religious beliefs.

A horror classic for the ages!,"What can be said about Brian DePalma and Stephen King's masterpiece that hasn't already been said before. It became a smash phenomenon upon first release and has, not surprisingly, grown in popularity after years of VHS, cable TV, DVD, and Blu-Ray. But has it held up? YES!Carrie tells the all too real story of a bullied girl who gets no support from her religious freak of a mother who'd rather lock her in a closet and tell her how much she's sinned from getting her first period than trying to notify teachers of her plight. Luckily for Carrie, and not so luckily for her classmates and mother, she possesses a great power - one she can't control.Carrie is essentially a dark modern fairy tale. It's Cinderella territory all the way, but with a darker ending. Carrie doesn't get through her moment of glory unscathed. Instead of a glass slipper, she leaves a trail of blood back home with her.What could have been a simple fun exploitation film (see: Jennifer) is made all the richer by Stephen King and Lawrence D. Cohen's vivid characterizations and tight plotting. The actors are all universally stellar. Sissy Spacek takes Carrie from pitiful, heartbreaking, and ultimately, scary as hell! As her psychotic mother, Piper Laurie is more than up to Spacek's powerhouse performance. She's truly one of the most terrifying characters ever committed to celluloid, mainly because we all know someone just as unstable as her. Nancy Allen and John Travolta (in his first big leading role) are equal parts hilarious and pure evil...and boy, do they make evil look good. Amy Irving and William Katt both radiate kindness and warmth, as does Betty Buckley as Ms. Collins, the kindly gym teacher who seems to be the only responsible adult in the film.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Brian De Palma's exquisite direction. He was labeled as a Hitchcock imitator back in the day, but it's really nothing more than homage. His camera effortlessly glides through the sets and characters in the film. The crowning of the prom king and queen has never been so nail bitingly intense.Carrie is a simply perfect horror film AND a perfect film. It just is! It's filled with heartbreaking drama, pulse pounding suspense, plenty of humor, and a few jump out of your seat shocks! How can you ask for more?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my earliest encounter with De palma,"I don't know how many times I have seen this movie.
Carrie gets to know about her superpower ( decades before superhero movies were famous) that she is telekinetic and she can move things after a tragic incident took place in her school life, her mother is God fearing woman and looks at Carrie as if she has committed a sin.
In third act of film another tragedy happens when Carrie's batch mates manipulate the prom Queen results and declare her as prom Queen.
Now she uses her powers to avenge.
Brian de palma's camera technique ( split screen and diopter shots) deserve special attention.
This movie kickstarted many people's careers including John Travolta, Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie (relaunched), Amy irwing, William Katt, Betty Buckley, Nancy Allen, Stephen King and Brian de palma himself.
This movie stands outs as one of the finest horror movies from 70s way better than follow up movies that were made to bank on Carrie and miles better than Kimberly pierce directed disastrous Carrie",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great adaptation,"If anyone ever tells you that books are always better than the adaptations, show them this movie. Not saying that Stephen King is a bad author at all, but I do think that this movie does a lot of things that the original novel could do better.The book from Stephen King, for example, plays a lot with the order of chronological events and makes a lot of pauses to show ""documents"" strongly united to the plot. I personally find that annoying, and I was glad they didn't do that on the adaptation.Stop talking about the movie, I really enjoyed how they addapted the relationship between Carrie and her mother. It feels dark, abusive, and almost gross to watch. You really learn how to hate the extremist position of the mother about religion. Images like the Christ of the house help to this vision on the movie -and actually the reference over the end to this bizarre picture reforces it. You can really tell that the real monster is not Carrie, but her mother.The ambiantation is also great. On that is really similar to the book. Almost every stereotype from the 60s. And on the parts when the story gets bad as hell, the ilumination, color, and sound effects bright over their highest level.The suspense was surprisingly fantastic. They managed on a very well level the BOOMS that made every scene interesting and special over its unique level. That makes that, even the most normal scenes, have a level of horror that you can really appreciate.A truly classic, and a good movie indeed. Not perfect, not as awesome and terrifying as The exorcist, but you will enjoy it and appreciate the art behind it. 8/10 more than deserve.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Carrie"" remained today as good as it was in 1976","""Carrie"" is the movie made by Stephen King's first novel. For those of you who don't know (altough I doubt there are a lot of people who haven't heard of this), ""Carrie"" is the story of high school student Carrie White, who is constantly bullied by her classmates. As if this wouldn't have been enough, her mother is a religious fanatic, who thinks life itself is a sin. In the first scene, we are brutally introduced in the harsh high school life (I can't tell more, see for yourselves) and see just what Carrie's classmates really are. And so, Carrie must find a way to survive all these attacks. And she does... She soon discovers that she wields a special power: telekinesis. At first, she uses TK without actually realizing what she is doing, but then, she can control her power pretty good (she was never able to fully control it, but she made real progress). Now, the movie is a little different of the novel, but the major facts written by Stephen King are in the movie too. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie are the stars of the movie, being an astonishing mother-daughter duo. Their relationship is much more special than an ordinary one. They love and hate each other with the same passion, and they are often unpredictable. You never know what's gonna happen until the very end of the movie, it's like being on a roller-coaster--now it's going up, now it's going down, and you're going with it. Same is ""Carrie"", due to Sissy Spacek's brilliantly performance. You feel what she feels, and you almost feel sorry for her on that fateful Prom Night... Carrie was always the weak one, every cool kid's target for teasing and taunting, the one that never fights back. But on the Prom Night, which was supposed to be magic and ""a night to remember"", some of Carrie's classmates take things too far, by throwing pig's blood on her just as she is crowned as the Prom Queen. The moment is full of drama, suspense, and, eventually, horror... ( it's shown in the theatrical trailer) Than, she gets revenge on them, using telekinesis. The storyline is really interesting, but the special effects are really bad, due to the period of time the movie was made (yep, no special effects in 1976). Sissy Spacek and John Travolta really bumped up their careers after this film, and you'll understand why when you'll see it. The scary part of the movie (they say it's a horror film, I can't tell why) is not so scary and only lasts a few minutes. ""Carrie"" is most of all a drama, and trust me, the movie won't scare you, but it will make you think. Betty Buckley, the Broadway singer, has an important part too. If you haven't seen ""Carrie"" yet, just go and rent it, it's worth it. You know what they say, if you've got a taste for terror, take Carrie to the prom.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Indeed, I'm sure I haven't seen this for many a year, although I still remember the sensation it created upon its original release. Apart from DePalma's undoubted directorial skills, a largely rookie cast pull together in a most extraordinary way to lift what was to have been a 'B' feature into an Oscar nominated feature. Central to all this is the amazing performance of Sissy Spacek.

I can see your dirty pillows. Everyone will.,"Carrie: 9 out of 10: Shy teenage girl with telekinetic powers and a religious mother faces down: bullies in her last year of high school.The Good: This movie has aged like a fine wine. It features a star-studded cast including Sissy Spacek, John Travolta, PJ Soles, William Katt, Nancy Allen, and Amy Irving. Director Brian DePalma keeps a great pace, makes smart changes to the source material, and is not afraid of an artistic touch or two.The underlying theme of a girl coming into womanhood and all the power that entails is handled extremely well for a film that manages to be both an exploitation film (Hey it's the girl's shower) as well as well-received critical darling (Oscar nomination for Sissy Spacek and an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe win for Piper Laurie.)The ending works as well as you remember it but it is the little touches on the journey that elevate the material from its honestly pulp roots. Piper Laurie in particular really sells her over the top character with one memorable set piece after another.The Bad. Bernard Herrmann was supposed to do the music for this movie, unfortunately, Bernard Herrmann died before the production started up. Perhaps as an homage, like renaming the high school Bates High, or as part of his Hitchcock obsession Director Brian DePalma decided to use Herrmann's Psycho score over and over again. This movie started a trend of cannibalizing that eek eek eek Psycho Scare Chord that lives to this day.The Ugly. Good lord these are some old High schoolers. These are Grease old even Porky's Revenge old. I am not just talking about the leads either there are some suspicious hairlines and crows feet among the student extras in the prom scene not to mention Mrs. Herb Tarlek herself Edie McClurg as a high school student.Clothed Sissy Spacek almosts pulls of the wallflower in high school look. (Naked she more like Denise Richards in Wild Things than a high school girl having her first period) The other ladies suffer from a similar fate with only PJ Soles looking anything close to high school age.In Conclusion: From the last scene that has inspired horror films to this day (particularly the first Friday the 13th) to the theme of womanhood equaling horror a lot of what made Carrie unique is old hat in this day and age. What has held up through is the great performances and still hilarious dialogue (I am sorry I agree with Piper Laurie dirty pillows belongs in a comedy).

"EXTREMELY Dated, But Still An All-Time Favorite of Mine","This movie is almost 46 years old, and yet it's still remembered as one of the most iconic horror movies of all time. And that's for very good reasons. It doesn't hold up entirely for me. The 70s style ages the film far worse than milk being left out in the sun too long, but I feel it adds to the movie's charm. The things that DO hold up, however, are the incredible performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, the excellent direction by Brian de Palma, the cinematography, the themes that are shown throughout, and the haunting score by Pino Donaggio that should have at least been nominated for an Oscar. Despite the flaws that it has, Carrie is still timeless when it comes to the message it tells you, and that is to not bully people.

I wanted to strangle him. Carrie was the victim! I loved watching her give them what they deserved. I actually kept rewinding the scene where she kills her mother. If you look, during the closeup of her hand when the first knife makes contact, you can see a wooden block, but it disappears in the shot where she drops the knife she is holding. Watch carefully.

From the works of Stephen King. A film by Brian De Palma.,"Carrie (1976) was Stephen King's first published novel (under his own name) and it would be the first in a long line of book-to-film adaptations. As long as Mr. King continues to right, someone will always try to adapt his novels or stories for either the silver or small screen. This film not only made King's career but it launched a plethora of knock-offs.

De Palma's combined coming-of-age story and modern horror classic,"In the first ever Stephen King adaptation to hit the big screen, director Brian De Palma created a combined tender coming-of-age drama and modern horror classic. He did it by staying true to King's sentiment of juxtaposing teenage angst, alienation and bullying with the title character's horrible acts, thus tearing at our ambivalent sympathies in the process. This is clever instrumentation hidden behind an exterior which resembles other teen-filled horror flicks from the period, because in Carrie, nothing is quite what it appears, and - more importantly - no explanation is as simple as it seems. This gives the film depth and layers beyond what's common in the horror genre. And De Palma even had the boldness to use an overblown religious theme (and character) for effect, because he knew that King's knowledge of the social and interpersonal mechanisms at play in the story, together with Sissy Spacek's immaculate performance, gave the film weight enough to carry it. And speaking of Spacek, rarely has anyone portrayed teenage vulnerability and suppressed energy with more compassion - or explosiveness.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enthralling Unique Gem that stands the test of time,"'Carrie' is a wonderfully intimate horror classic adapted from Stephen King's debut novel of the same name and directed by Brian De Palma. Drenched in a dreamlike atmosphere of supernatural elements and religion, this iconic masterpiece features a remarkable cast and contains several memorable and outstanding cinematic scenes that perfectly captures Stephen's King's writings onto the big screen and will stay with you long after viewing.The Plot = Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) a young shy social outcast finds herself plagued by high school bullies and oppressed by her religious fanatic mother Margaret (Piper Laurie) at home. Carrie soon discovers that she's got telekinetic powers, and everything reaches boiling point when one of her bullies Chris (Nancy Allen) plots her revenge on Carrie at the upcoming prom with devastating results.The direction by Brian De Palma is outstanding and really draws you into this fully realized and enthralling world with many beautiful shots and impressive set pieces. The narrative instantly engages you from the start with its ambiguous nature that sets it apart from the other horror gems of the 1970's. When it comes to unsettling horror that truly shows you something unique and genuine not many films come close to the brilliance of this flick.The cast is what really brings this gem to life, specifically Sissy Spacek in the complex lead role of the tragic Carrie, timid, restrained, and sympathetic, she really draws you into the loneliness of her world with such poignancy in every nuance of her performance. Piper Laurie is excellent as demented Margaret White with probably the most frightening portrayals of a repressed religious fanatic ever put to the silver screen and does it with such conviction. Betty Buckley gives a wonderful performance as the compassionate teacher Miss Collins, Amy Irving also gives a strong performance as Sue Snell, John Travolta gives a standout performance in one of his earliest roles and finally Nancy Allen gives a fantastic turn as the spiteful school bully Chris, a real star making turn for her.Overall 'Carrie' is well and truly a landmark in the horror genre where everything falls into place perfectly with themes that stands the test of time and even to this day stands as the best Stephen King movie adaptation of all-time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Just How Sweet is Revenge,"Above all, this is a revenge movie. In fact, revenge movies have long been a staple of masculine entertainment. Charles Bronson, for example, made a lucrative career out of macho revenge where the culprits get blown away with big time splatters. However, this is a revenge movie of a different stripe, one that appeals to a great number of us who look back on high school as a kind of horror film in its own right. If the subtext weren't so poignant, Carrie would amount to just another splatter film. But it's that powerful subtext of the victim contracting special powers to avenge humiliation that taps into the hidden daydream of so many, young or old.In the movie, Carrie not only suffers at school, but home offers no refuge either. Mom's idea of sex-ed or life of any kind is to read the Bible and pray. No wonder the mousy Carrie hugs the walls hoping no one notices or worse, follows her home. The movie thus taps into the powerful emotions of an innocent kid trapped by circumstance with no apparent way out—an emotion, I expect, we've all felt at some time or another. Of course, Carrie does get a way out, but one that only happens in storybooks. Her misfortune is that this is a Stephen King storybook.Of course, Carrie's enraged bloodletting doesn't distinguish between the innocent and the guilty, so in that sense, she turns into a monster of a special sort. Wisely, the film makes that daring move from Cinderella-on-the-stage to murderous-monster-on-a-rampage, such that our initial delight in her ability to strike back must confront the indiscriminate slaughter her preternatural ability brings about. Thus, once the mayhem starts, the audience is plunged into a world of mixed feelings, without time to sort things out. Making the malicious Norma suffer seems poetically just, but what about the compassionate Miss Collins, apparently cut in half by a swinging bench! Thus, the casual cruelty of the locker room turns abruptly into the Prom Night from Hell, and we get a perplexing morality tale to think about.DePalma films all this stylishly, but with all the subtlety of a hammer blow to the head. Apparently, he belongs to the school that believes that if a little of something is good, then a lot more must be a lot better. Fortunately for both him and us, the material lends itself to his particular brand of visual excess. Carrie may not manage the artistic level of Val Lewton-type horror (I Walked with a Zombie {1943} or Seventh Victim {1943}), but it does, I think, tap into some of our deeper, hidden feelings. And that I believe is one secret of the movie's success.",,Anonymous,Horror
HILARIOUS...,"But not in a good way.Sorry, but as popular as this was back in 1976, doesn't mean it deserves kudos and praise today. I've seen it a few times, but not for about 30 years.Watching it now, it's just so horribly dated. The acting is so ham fisted (Laurie) it's hilarious. And it's not just Piper Laurie. Betty Buckley is shrill in every scene she's in, and definitely isn't helped by the implausible dialogue and situations she's put in.Yes, it was De Palma's breakthrough, but again, it doesn't hold up well at all. The scene between Travolta and Nancy Allen in his car on the way to a party is just a mess. She teases him, he laughs, then out of the blue, he fake (really fake) slaps her, which pisses her off, until it doesn't. Just a mess.And as others have pointed out, the actors playing the high school students were around 23-26 -- and they look it. With the exception of course for Edie McClurg(!), who was THIRTY-ONE years old when she played 'the fat girl'.Seriously? They couldn't find ANY OTHER ACTRESS besides Edie McClurg to play that part? It's laughable, seriously hilarious, because she's so miscast.Yes, the first minute or two is a good setup, and the climax at the prom is the well-remembered horror classic, but the rest?Hilarious.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good screen adaptation of a Stephen King story,"Be careful whom you pick on, especially after puberty.Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) comes from a very oppressive environment. Her mother Margaret White (Piper Laurie) is a zealot and does not stand for any nasty doings. Carrie is not the most popular girl in school. Let's face it she is the butt of many practical jokes.The time comes when puberty hits her hard. And Stephen King says that is the time when any latent supernatural tendencies creep out. Sure enough, Carrie finds that she can telekinesis. She even gets help from her PE teacher.Are things going to work out better for Carrie?Where did she get such a gift?Do you suppose she will be invited to the Prom by Tommy (William Katt)?Whatever you do, do not make a grave mistake.This is a well-crafted story with fine actors.

Blood Speaks,"Carrie is like Shining another masterpiece of the horror genre and both those movies have something in common: they are based on a work by Stephen King, and last but not least, they belong to the rather thin line of outstanding to well-made movie-adaptions of Mr. King's work.What else!? The director is Brian De Palma (well done!) and Sissy Spacek plays Carrie outstanding and most memorable. The iconic scene where she is covered in blood and pure terror/madness shows on her face I will never forget.Belongs on the must-watch list of every guy and gal and whatever who wants to be taken seriously as a lover of the arts of horror.p.s. the remake (2013) with Chloë Grace Moretz in lead is not a bad one (my rate a 6), but can't beat the original.

A terrific De Palma thriller that is still one of the most satisfying Stephen King adaptations.,"Brian De Palma is unfairly dismissed by many people as ""the Hitchcock guy"", something which ignores the variety of his output from the zany rock musical 'Phantom Of The Paradise' to the flamboyant gangster classic 'Scarface'. 'Carrie' has a few Hitchcock touches to be sure (mainly in the score which mimics 'Psycho'), but nowhere near as much as 'Sisters' or 'Dressed To Kill'. In several sequences I was more reminded of Dario Argento, but 'Carrie' has a stronger narrative than most of Argento's work. One thing that struck me on re-watching this (for the umpteenth time) is that like Argento, De Palma is often regarded as a cold director more interested in visuals and fancy shots than acting, but the main thing that makes 'Carrie' work is the terrific performance he managed to coax out of Sissy Spacek. Spacek had already given an impressive turn in 'Badlands' a few years earlier but this role is what really launched her career. It also did a lot of good for Stephen King! I would say that 'Carrie' ties with Kubrick's 'The Shining' and Cronenberg's 'The Dead Zone' as the most satisfying King adaptations to date. While Spacek all but steals the movie Piper Laurie is also very good as Carrie's fanatical Mom, in an over the top performance which for me really works. The cast is full of young actors many unknowns who went on to greater success, like Travolta and Nancy Allen (interestingly enough later teamed up by De Palma in his underrated 'Blow Out'), Amy Irving and P.J. Soles, who appeared in another influential 70s horror classic 'Halloween' not long after this. I also enjoyed seeing the great character actor Sydney Lassick in a supporting role as a sarcastic teacher. Lassick played Charlie Cheswick in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' and I always get a kick out of seeing him on screen. (Sadly he died last year with little fanfare). De Palma is still one of the most underrated ""name"" Hollywood directors. His movies have been pretty disappointing for the last ten years or so, but when he was good he was REALLY good, and 'Carrie' is testament to that.",,Anonymous,Horror
Teenage comes of age flick.,"This story is of Carrie, a girl who is picked on to the ridicules extreme right at the beginning of the movie.  The girls who pick on her are punished and one goes to the extreme to get revenge on the girl who had nothing really to do with her getting into trouble.  This one is so much like a typical day at a high school that it is boring.  Of course Carrie has a secret...her mom's psycho.  So when the teacher tells her about the problems Carrie has at school, she proceeds to beat Carrie and tell her how evil she is.  You just know she has a complex.  Carrie also has special powers too. So a nice girl lets Carrie go to the prom with her boyfriend, the bad girl dumps something on Carrie at prom and all heck breaks loose.  This film is just too mundane in some areas for it to be interesting.  Nothing you see is really all that revolutionary here...teens have been this way to each other forever.  The only thing interesting, or that is a new wrinkle is the powers and the really horrific prom, which for me just isn't enough to save the flick, but I can see why others like it.  It just isn't for me.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie (1976),"Timely, with some great performances, and a very eerie nature- Carrie is yet another great Stephen King adaptation, and one of the films responsible to why we have so many King films today. Carrie is certainly not a typical high school story, in any way, but it does have its fair share of stereotypes- with certain characters feeling nothing but the shallow cliches we have seen dozens of times in this film. Besides this flaw, the only other problem I had with the film was the ending, which seemed rather abrupt to me- although I have not read the book so I am not entirely sure of the reason behind it. Brian De Palma provides fantastic direction to this film, and is largely the reason why I feel the film works so well. So many moments in this film I feel may have fallen flat if it were not for De Palma, and I was glad to see his directorial talents shine so well on screen throughout. Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, and Betty Buckley all provide terrific performances on screen- although it is truly Spacek that shines throughout- not only on screen the longest, but also providing an incredibly breathtaking work and transformation throughout the film, which she plays to the fullest. The film can be entertaining, and often quite enjoyable. It isn't afraid to try and relate to its characters, rather than simply format it to a film standard, and I enjoyed the extra effort on behalf of that and the writers involved (at least in that aspect). In the end, Carrie is not King's best adaptation but one of the most important. It has its weaker moments, but all in all, it feels like a terrifically strong effort, and one I wouldn't mind watching again.

Brian De Palma's finest hour.,"Sissy Spacek's star-turning performance in 'Carrie' is one of the finest portrayals by an actress ever in a horror film. The film, adapted from a novel by Stephen King, revolves mainly around adolescence and religion, adolescence in the sense of a outsider girl on a high school with telepathic abilities who ""just wants to be normal"", and religion in the sense of her Christian über-fundamentalist mother who's been teaching her inside-out about life and all its possibilities. The film does not (like surprisingly many Stephen King adaptations) go for the full-on shock effect of murder, blood and nerve-wrecking excitement, still, with all these ingredients very much intact, director Brian De Palma (who's on a victory-run of invention) presents the film with a high-school backdrop full of bubbly life, and the themes of lost family and love, and the alienation of teenager-life, is always at the main focus. 'Carrie''s disturbing undertones and shocking scenes are still full of terrifying life, and as any great horror, it brings that tingling feeling of nastiness, wrong and suspense.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Captures The Essence Of Why The Material Works,"The ""Carrie"" story--originally penned by Stephen King--contained some of the most interesting and truly uncomfortable themes ever put to paper. For the most part, this film adaptation effectively captures those main points, especially when it comes to the titular character.For a very basic overview, ""Carrie"" sees high school student Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) undergo her first menstrual period in the gym class showers and be relentlessly mocked by the other girls for it. Having not been educated about ""those things"" due to her crazed, religious fundamentalist mother Margaret (Piper Laurie), Carrie struggles to understand what is happening to her. Not helping matters is how Carrie also begins to develop telekinesis, allowing her to move objects with her mind when her emotions get out of control. When fellow student Sue Snell (Amy Irving) gets boyfriend Tommy (William Katt) to take Carrie to the senior prom, a series of events transpire that are as tragic as they are horrific.First and foremost, ""Carrie"" works because it does the most important thing completely and utterly correct: it makes the viewer sympathize with young Carrie White. In order for the material here to work, one has to feel mortified for her in an almost visceral fashion. Spacek's performance is brilliant in that regard, rendering Carrie a sad figure, but not so sad as to be dismissed. Instead, she is someone you will desperately want to see succeed or gain some semblance of a life, making her continued tragedies all the more compelling.There are also so many interesting concepts floating around in the screenplay here, such as: religious mania, adolescent coming-of-age, parent/child struggles, and high school friendship. In other words, there is usually always ""something to think about"" in each scene. In that sense, I would never classify ""Carrie"" as a horror flick. It is far more drama/thriller by genre.About the only reason I can't give this film a full 10-star treatment is because director Brian de Palma whiffs on a key point of the overall narrative. This is most clearly seen towards the end of the film, when the major trauma inflicted upon Carrie is met--at least at first--with laughter. This seems a bit odd or out-of-place and is never really explained, whereas the source material does a much better job of conveying how Carrie is such a pitiable figure that only bursts of emotion such as anger/laughter can truly classify her persona.Overall, though, ""Carrie"" is a classic thriller filled with uncomfortable themes and acting performances that will move you. It is very much worthy of King's original work and will likely stand the test of time along side it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie,"A quality film.This film grabs hold of an ordinary lonely girl scenario and flips it on its back creating a fresh and unique experience for that time. The acting towards the end really picks up and so does the plot. I also found interesting how everything revolves around religion, one girl is the devil the other is an angel and Carrie is the odd one out, maybe Lucifer an angel turned demon by the cruel minds of humanity. The movie at the start was rather weak in my eyes and bloomed maybe a bit late in my opinion but overall a good classic film that has a secretive true meaning which is always fun to find out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"31 Years Later, and I Still Shudder","Brian DePalma's Carrie is a defining-moment movie for me. I saw a lot of movies when I was in my upper-classman years of high school and I don't think I ever saw anything like Carrie to date, gory to the point of gasping, filled with high school viciousness and pubic hair, and with a heroine as repulsive as the stuff inside the zits on your forehead. I saw it just six months after graduating from high school, when kids often go into a blue funk because they miss the structure of, but not the culture of high school, and I felt as if I was watching home movies of some of the people I hated in school.Carrie was shocking and horrifying, dirty and very, very sad.But more than that, it's a great little supernatural flick, with fine performances, zesty pacing, and a lot of heart. To this day, I enjoy Sissy Spacek's work, because she was able to pull off Carrie White (although the girl in Stephen King's book is a lumpy mess of protoplasm and DePalma had to work to make the pretty, wholesome, and curvy Spacek look bad). Travolta can be taken seriously, too. Piper Laurie scared the Holy Water out of me.I could go on listing the cast members who were very impressive, but I'm running out of time here, and you know it was a great cast.I remember seeing Carrie at the State Theatre in Spokane during a November snowstorm. My best friend and I exited after the movie and I still recall feeling blue. Not because I was one of the popular kids at Shadle Park High School (I wasn't), but because there was so much I had missed. For some reason, this horror movie about a horse-face of a girl with a late menstrual cycle and telekinetic powers made me sad, made me miss high school.Great movie, strange frame of mind. 31 years ago on a snowy night.",,Anonymous,Horror

"An Excellent,Scary And Suspenseful Horror Classic With A Brilliant Performance From Sissy Spacek. Brian De Palma And Stephen King At Their Best.","Carrie is one of the greatest Horror Films ever made,an Excellent,Scary and suspenseful Horror classic that is filled with amazing direction,great performances from Sissy Spacek and the rest of the cast,a fantastic script and a beautiful,haunting film score. All those elements make Carrie a classic and Brian De Palma and Stephen King at their best.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name,Carrie tells the story of Carrie White(Sissy Spacek),a quiet and shy 17-year-old girl who is bullied and tormented by her High School classmates and lives with her Mother Margaret White(Piper Laurie),a religious fanatic. While at school,Carrie discovers she has telekinetic powers,an ability to move things with her mind. Later,Carrie is asked to the prom by popular classmate Tommy Ross(William Katt). Unfortunately,Carrie and Tommy don't know that there is a prank planned for Carrie at the prom and the prank will lead to deadly and tragic consequences.Carrie is an brilliant film from beginning to end and was an amazing breakthrough film for director Brian De Palma and Author Stephen King because it was the first big box office hit for De Palma and the first Stephen King adaptation to the big screen while also being one of the all time great Horror movie classics and one of the best Stephen King adaptations. Carrie is a great movie that is very scary,powerful and truly suspenseful,intense and dramatic,stylish and tragic and is a movie that will haunt you not just physically but mentally as well from the first time you watch it. I think one of the reasons Carrie is not only a Horror classic but a classic film in general is the way it deals with themes such as bullying,revenge,being an outcast,wanting to be accepted by your peers as well as dealing with the strings and arrows of teenage life and all of those themes in the film will always be relevant and timeless because there will always be bullying and feelings of being an outcast among people of all ages. Carrie is scary and suspenseful because this film deals with monsters not Zombies,Vampires or large Werewolves but a monster of a different kind:human beings. While there are good human beings in the film like Carrie and a few other people, the other human beings in the film are evil beyond redemption because of the things the evil characters do to Carrie. The film is also scary in the situations and haunting imagery that director Brian De Palma shows which is very nightmarish and dream like that makes the movie frightening,disturbing and atmospheric. The suspense in Carrie is done with great build-up the most suspenseful sequence in the film being the now famous prom scene which is one of the greatest scenes in movie history. What's amazing about the prom scene is the way De Palma builds the tension with the prom scene with Horror,romance,terror and dread all at once and when the build-up stops there is a terrific pay off that is scary and powerful. The prom scene and the whole film in general is a Cinderella story with a Brian De Palma and Stephen King twist. Carrie is a movie that also works as a great character study of Carrie White one of the finest and iconic characters in the history of movies and literature. Right from the very start of the film we as a viewer relate with Carrie because like Carrie most of us have been outcasts,had no friends or have been bullied to the point where we want revenge on our tormentors. When we see the relationship with Carrie's Mother we sympathize with Carrie because of the torture she goes through living with her Mother and we root for Carrie succeed and not to live in fear. Carrie is a classic character that you will never forget and one of cinemas definitive outcasts and anti hero's. The screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen is terrific and mostly stays true to Stephen King's book while taking out the Crime Drama flashback element of the novel and making the story leaner and meatier. The ending of Carrie is amazing and one of the scariest and greatest endings in movie history that will shock and chill you to the bone and make you jump out of your seat. A classic ending.The whole cast is great. Sissy Spacek gives an excellent,unforgettable Oscar-nominated performance as Carrie White,with Spacek bringing depth,sympathy and sadness to the role. A powerful performance by Spacek. Piper Laurie is brilliant in her Oscar nominated role as Carrie's Mother Margaret White,with Laurie being scary,terrifying and having great scenes with Spacek. Amy Irving is wonderful as Sue Snell,a classmate that wants to help Carrie. William Katt is terrific as Tommy Ross,Sue's boyfriend and Carrie's prom date. Nancy Allen is great as Chris,one of Carrie's bullies. John Travolta(in his film debut)is outstanding and funny as Billy,Chris' boyfriend. Betty Buckley is fantastic as Miss Collins,Carrie's coach. P.J Soles is fun and memorable as Norma,one of Chris' friends.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera and bringing a haunting and beautiful visual style to the film. De Palma also uses his trademark split screen shots for one of the suspenseful scenes in the film. Amazing direction,De Palma.The score by Pino Donggaio is fantastic,haunting,beautiful,intense and truly adds to the film's nightmarish tone. Powerful score,Donggaio.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Brian De Palma,Stephen King,Sissy Spacek,or films in general,I highly suggest you see,an excellent,scary and suspenseful Horror classic that is Brian De Palma and Stephen King at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Being young the first time I saw it I completely missed the fact how horrifying this movie is on multiple levels, from the religious fanatic mother to the unbearable bullying she endured. I think 30 years ago I was more interested in just seeing displays of her telekinesis, and completely ignored that the horror in the film begin with the first scene and doesn't stop.

"Dated, But Still Good.","The very horror classic that has haunted prom nights ever since it was introduced to the filmgoing audience back in 1976, Brian De Palma's Carrie is one of the first adaptations of a Stephen King novel on the film canvas and even though it looks quite dated today, it's still does a much better job in storytelling elements than the horror flicks of today.The film tells the story of Carrie White; a shy & peerless 17-year old girl who possesses a rare gift of telekinesis and has faced nothing but constant abuse at the hands of her fanatically religious mother. The main plot of the film concerns a humiliating prank Carrie's classmates play on her which ultimately ends with very drastic consequences.Brilliantly directed, wonderfully adapted for the screen, nicely photographed, fairly edited, finely scored & benefiting greatly from Sissy Spacek's impressive performance as Carrie, there isn't much wrong with the film yet whatever it puts on screen doesn't hold up so well after all these years & Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother didn't help either for it was too hammy a performance to be appreciated.On an overall scale, Carrie is an interesting look at supernatural powers, high school bullying & the often frustrating phase every teenager generally goes through, and is one amongst the many unforgettable chillers to come out from Hollywood during the 1970s. Time hasn't been very kind to this motion picture but it still possesses a mysterious strength that can spellbind many newcomers.",,Anonymous,Horror
"""I can move things...""","Carrie is a must watch classic horror of the 70s and all time.

Her mother is extremely religious and domineering. Carrie discovers her powers of telekinesis and unleashes the extent of her ability during an intense outburst when she is humiliated by her classmates at senior prom.The aspect of this film which shocked me the most is the intensity of Carrie's mother and Carrie's upbringing. Margaret White i a religious fanatic who, her views predominantly against sex, menstruation (which she never informed Carrie about) which she believes are sins.I think this is one of the most accurate film adaptations from Stephen King's book Carrie and pays attention to details from quotes to visibly showing feelings of characters that are only described in the book.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

My brief review of the film,"An absorbing allegory about the effects of high school bullying, it is disguised as a horror film to allude to the horror of such mental anguish. The film manages to depict true emotional concerns involved with school life and ontological pressures even while juggling an overcoat of horror. Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek are the perfect choices for their roles, and the overall film is impressive on a cinematic level. The only quirk in the film is the typically horror genre ending, but that hardly can affect the effectiveness of this emotional drama.

Strange even for Stephen King,"This was just a strange, strange movie. Beginning to end, I just kept shaking my head with a puzzled type look on my face. I believe Spacek has the perfect face for the role to look just innocent enough but at the same time evil. I found her character more irritating than anything else, which is why I rated the movie a little lower than normal. And my god, the mother?! Who wouldn't want to strangle her. I understand she was meant to be very out of the ordinary but her character was so over the top, I wanted to reach into the screen and strangle her myself.

One of the most relevant horror films ever made,"Based on Stephen King's novel, ""Carrie"" is a classic horror film directed by Brian DePalma and one of the greatest movies from the 1970's that still echoes in our minds and in the popular culture.If in many high school themed movies there's always a shy and lonely character who gets abused by everyone in the school and sometimes in the family we owe this characteristic to Carrie White, the main character played by Sissy Spacek. And if we sometimes identify with the tragedy of the character, with a possible chance for revenge the ones who are bad to us, you gotta recognize: you have a part of Carrie inside of you. I don't know how Stephen King idealized this story or his motivations but all I can say is that it works, it scares yet it makes you look at life with a different perspective.Carrie had a hard religious education at home with her mother (Piper Laurie, excellent) that looks more the devil himself than a woman who preaches the Gospel. And the teenage girl doesn't know how to behave herself during classes at school, or even taking a shower when she finally had her first period (a scene meant to be more dramatically sad than scary, except for the music) and she gets mocked by her colleagues all the time.The film evolves into a dramatic story but there's a catch. In the middle of the drama we find out that Carrie has special powers, she can move or break objects with the power of her mind, and that's something she can't control quite right and no one knows she has this ability. I'll won't spoil more things, I'm gonna let you see for yourself, but by this time you can possibly know what's the horror in this story.I must admit I had a total dislike over this film when I watched a few years ago; now I understand why it's an effective and powerful film, and why it was relevant in 1976 and still is today. DePalma released ""Carrie"" on the same year of many great classics whose major themes were ""We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take this anymore!"".Carrie White is no different than Howard Beale (""Network""), Travis Bickle (""Taxi Driver""), Rocky Balboa (""Rocky"") and the Woodstein team (""All the President's Men""). Strange mixing of films some might think but if you look back to all these characters and their struggle to challenge everything and everyone, is quite similar from one to another. In the scene where Carrie stood up and says to her mother that she'll go the prom with a boy for the first time in her life you can see the exactly same thing when Howard Beale shouted the most famous movie quote of that year. Gladly all these films were great, and were recognized with nominations and awards, and survived to tell how the American society felt at that time, and ""Carrie"" even while being a horror movie knew how to be a important piece of filmmaking.As I mentioned in the beginning most films today has some qualities and characteristics that appeared here for the first time and the way DePalma presented the story was excellent, including homages to his idol Hitchcock (the music by Pino Donaggio reminds some parts of Bernard Herrmann's theme in ""Psycho"", and by the way Herrmann was the original composer of the music of the film but died a few months before the filming begin). Not only the music, but the editing is also great, and one of the most awaited moments is the prom night, there are thousand of things in that scene that keeps you thrilled all the time, no matter how many times you watch. And at last the great casting composed by Spacek, Laurie, John Travolta, Amy Irving, William Katt, Nancy Allen and Betty Buckley, all wonderful.It's a very interesting horror film but more than that it is a historical study (in terms of film) over a period. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yes, there are the classic horror moments (the pig's blood; the firestorm; and the hand-from-the-grave shock at the end, inspired by the equally brilliant DELIVERANCE), and De Palma's direction effectively echoes Hitchcock without ever blatantly imitating the Master. But what makes CARRIE so effective in its story of a repressed high school student who takes telekinetic revenge on those who have humiliated and tormented her once too often is the devastating, Oscar-nominated performance by Sissy Spacek in the title role. There probably isn't anybody else who could have played the part with such devastating effectiveness. Spacek, in fact, may well have given the single greatest performance by an actress in a horror film right here.Pino Donnagio's effective score, which echoes not only Bernard Herrmann but even Stravinsky, tops off one of the most effective, indeed one of the most downright disturbing, horror films of all times. CARRIE is a film that will certainly be remembered long after SCREAM, URBAN LEGEND, and all their myriad clones have been forgotten. It is by any standard one of the most important and disturbing horror films of all times.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie,"I have to say, this movie was not what I expected. I hated it the first time I saw it because I was expecting horror, which only came in the ending. I saw the sequel, which inspired me to see the original again, tthe second time I liked it. If you want to see it, remember, it's more drama that horror. Overall, it is very good and I give it a 9 [out of 10]",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
NOT A CLASSIC,An absolute bore. Terrible acting. Horrifically boring plot. The climax is a terribly bland school prank. It's honestly hilariously bad for modern standards.

A must see for horror fans.,"""I wanna be normal, I wanna start to try me, a whole person, before it's too late for me to.""What happens when an odd, repressed, emotionally abused teenage girl with telekinetic abilities is pushed past her breaking point by an overwhelmingly humiliating prank pulled by her bullying classmates? A prom night that no one will ever forget. If they happen to survive it, that is.Carrie is an absolute horror classic. It runs the gamut from unsettling, to creepy, to horrifying, and every second of it is enjoyable. If it doesn't freak you out before the end, you're made of sterner stuff than I am. I don't think I'll ever forget the insane zealotry of Carrie's mother or the mesmerizing carnage of the end of the movie, among other scenes, and the best proof of a good horror movie is one that is memorable.This is by far the best Stephen King adaptation that I've seen, and the fact that it was based on his first published book makes it even more impressive. The pacing is perfect, with a perfect build up to the spectacular finale that will have you torn between feeling satisfaction of seeing some horrible people getting their comeuppance, and a genuine horror at the character of Carrie. If you're at all interested in a scary movie that's effective beyond constant jump scares or gore, then you should love this. I sure did. It's quality hasn't diminished in the least by the years that have gone by since it was made. Great camera-work, great score, great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
So sad and so brilliant,"First thing to say is that, even if you don't like the film, the music is absolutely brilliant. It's hard to describe; classical, but heavier than normal. I've never known anyone who doesn't like the music.The story of a girl who is bullied at school and at home is heart-breaking and Sue Snell recognising her duty to help Carrie gives the film an uplifting part. What Carrie does for revenge is wrong, but she does not gain anything out of it. It's a very, very sad film overall, where nobody gains and all the tragedy could have been so easily avoided. The mindless brutality of Carrie's classmates have disastrous effects. The insanity of the mother is not as over-the-top as in the novel, which I personally thought was an improvement. Sissy Spacek is really good as Carrie. The scenes when she acts nervous and scared are best; she looks a little unusual and this suits the character.I've read the book too. The film is a fairly faithful rendition, but there are bits that are different. It's not quite as sad as the book and there are bits of humour here and there. Tommy Ross is less of a character here and the part of Carrie's infancy is missing (because the scene went wrong and they didn't have enough money to film it again).I love this film, although I'm not sure whether someone who was Popular at school would find it so effective.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie - When Payback Goes Telekinetic,"Carrie White is the girl no one notices in class, the one they'd rather bully between gym sessions. She's a mix between Luna Lovegood and Eleven, except instead of bending spoons, she flips entire tables-and your life along with them. Brian De Palma transforms this awkward, misunderstood teen into a weapon of mass destruction, and let's just say prom night has never been more lit.Brian De Palma, the maestro of filming trauma, proves here that he's sharper with a camera than a Predator with its laser sight. His direction is equal parts meticulous and ruthless-every shot, every camera move, tightens the knot in your stomach. The prom scene, in particular, is a masterclass where visual beauty and raw horror collide in a blood-soaked symphony of vengeance. Hitchcock can rest easy knowing De Palma aced his homework.Sissy Spacek is a revelation. She plays Carrie with an intensity that makes you uneasy the second she's on screen. She's a ticking time bomb, and when she explodes, it's monumental. Piper Laurie as her fanatical mother is equally brilliant-a Bible-thumping zealot who makes you want to burn every holy book in sight. Between her unhinged mother and her sociopathic classmates, Carrie didn't need telekinesis-she needed a damn break.Carrie is so much more than a horror film. It's a psychological drama disguised as a gut-punch, a stark reminder of why you shouldn't mess with fragile people. De Palma doesn't just show off cool supernatural powers; he immerses you in Carrie's pain, shame, and rage. The paranormal element isn't there to dazzle but to amplify the tragedy. Think Shakespeare on acid, not The Avengers.What makes Carrie so powerful is its atmosphere. The lighting, the sets, the music-everything oozes menace and discomfort. Every high school hallway feels threatening, every prayer from her mother sounds like a curse. And that final scene? It sticks in your brain like an evil guitar riff you can't stop hearing.Carrie isn't just a movie-it's a lesson. A lesson in why bullying is a terrible idea, and why Brian De Palma is a cinematic genius. Blending poignant drama with visceral horror, this adaptation of Stephen King's novel is a timeless classic. If you haven't seen Carrie, it's time to repent.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Carrie,"Carrie, a slow burn thriller with some horror elements, I found myself disappointed by this, and was expecting more from this, I might've been overhyped, but this isn't a movie I'll come back to.Directing, I found it surprisingly sloppy and weak, some odd zooms, awkward cuts, the whole first hour is just a drag to get through. It's only got that nostalgic allure to it. The split view/cut gimmick is used a lot and unless this pioneered it it does feel somewhat excessive in its usage and doesn't add the extra character emotion that it should provide. And the excessive nudity is questionable for it's reasoning, it seems like it's just there because it wants it, not because the scene needs it. The movie spends a lot of time on things that end up so useless, like the whole detention scene, so many of the schools scenes that don't involve Carrie, Sue's influence and choice is oddball, character relationships are weird. Tommy and Sue's relationship is underdeveloped making Tommy's decision later so unjustified.If anything, the one positive I have to say is the last 20 minutes. And the acting of Spacek being incredible. She carries the movie and any scene she isn't in just immediately drags. Honestly the main reason this gets the rating as is. Just a lot of this movie felt like filler up until the end and those few Carrie scenes.As a horror, it's tame. And the way it lands the finale could've been more disturbing, even though the facts are really intense and crazy. It's never elevated to be intense to the viewer. Music was alright.Sadly, not going to be memorable. I gained nothing but the general zeitgeist I already had.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fad horror,"Another legendary `classic' that disappointed me.  Let's start with Carrie, herself: okay, she's an outcast and she's sheltered, did we really need King to write her as being so distant from reality to the point of being ignorant of everyday common-sense things?  Where's the subtlety?  Why doesn't King go all the way and have her wear a sandwich sign that says `I'm REALLY sheltered' so there's no doubt any viewer (and I mean any viewer) can get it?  He pushed Carrie too far in his attempt to make us sympathize with the poor girl who doesn't know anything . . . and it made me not sympathize with her.Carrie is the most developed, rightly so since the movie is named after her, no one else comes across as anything more than props (cliché props at that). In a nutshell, the opening scene and credits barely introduce all the characters and then we're off to the prom for the inevitable.  In other words, the movie doesn't really spend time with any characters nor does it take time to be with any characters except Carrie.  What little development there is with all the other characters is a collection of writing gimmicks that were overused when King wrote the book. So if the film doesn't care enough to develop these guys and the situation, why should I care about them?If King or De Palma bothered with developing the characters period, and developing them in a non-cliché way, I'd of been much happier with renting this film.  Heck, and if either of them took some weird yet original twist to the development process, I'd applaud them for their creative and artistic integrity.  The fact is, nothing in this film is developed very well.De Palma's trademarks are here in all their overused and annoying glory. There's a thing called restraint . . . it's not in this movie.  Really cool techniques are only cool when used right.  Things like the split screen and the camera-rotating-around-its-subject-endlessly got old faster than the CG in Star Wars and the Bullet Time in Matrix: Reloaded.  I do admit De Palma has a fair amount of artistic flair, but like Quinton Tarintino, there's just too many aspects (technique wise) going against him for me to get into the film.I generally like Stephen King, and I have a lot of respect for him.  But I did not like this movie, and I really hate to say it, but I feel its success deals more with it being an early De Palma film, an early King novel, and the first novel to make it to the big screen (our society is obsessed with people's creativity degrading over-time . . . the first are always the best.)  And now especially, it was the first (big) teen-telekinesis film made in the 70s which be default makes it old school `classic' horror and makes it `good' by definition.  Theories on its success aside  now for facts.  It did succeed, and I still don't like it.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Masterpiece In Horror...,"...Yes, it is a masterpiece. Carrie is an excellent movie based on the excellent Stephen King novel. This movie is a classic that appeals to hardcore horror buffs and others too.The Plot: Carrie White is an outcast to her friends at school. She is the girl everyone picks on, she isn't very pretty, she is awfully shy, and people seem to hate her for no reason. Her mother, a obsessed and at times psychotic devout Christian, abused her daughter in the most terrible ways. Things begin to look up when Carrie is asked out to the prom by one of the most popular guys in the school. Prom will be a night to remember... if they live through it.The Good: This movie is a classic and definitive film in the horror genre. It set many standards for the horror movies that followed it. This will probably forever be remembered as Brian De Palma's most famous movie, and it is easy to see why. Carrie has some of the most impressive direction and cinematography I've ever seen. You will believe it when you see it. The acting is superb. Although some of the actors may seem a tad to old for teenagers, I think they are good. Sissey Spacek gives a groundbreaking performance as Carrie, the character who made her a star. Piper Laurie was the perfect choice for Margaret White, Carrie's crazy mother. Most of the supporting cast excels too. Also, look for a pre stardom John Travolta, in his first major motion picture performance. The movie starts out with a creepy and dramatic theme, and picks up into a scary bloodfest for the finale. May I add, the final scene is so crazy, it will make you fall out of your seat.The Bad: Some of the acting in this film is merely average at best. My other complaint about this movie is how it deviated from the book at the end, but it sticks to its source very well until then.Overall: Carrie is a must see! I Give it a 9/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror in broad daylight,"Many horror films belong in the night, where murder and ""punishment"" roam free, films where daylight is just precious lost hours building up to what will soon unfold when the sun sets.Carrie, until its momentous final scenes, is bathed in California sunshine, warm in temperature but not in temperament, as we are slowly shown the many different factors that will cause Carrie to break. The prom and the aftermath are night shots, eerie and deadly, but the last moments return to the sunlight, and to the false comfort of the day.This is another Hollywood product where everyone looks just a bit too old to be a teenager, but it doesn't really matter - in a way the slight lack of believability just adds to the surreal nature, and the material still hits home.For a film that is about bullying and the consequences of cruelty, De Palma remembers to include a number of moments of kindness and support, chiefly from Betty Buckley (whose performance tends to be one of the most underrated aspects of the film) as the fair-minded gym teacher who tries her best to help Carrie, and William Katt, the dreamboat, the top man at school who slowly goes from part of the taunting and humiliation of Carrie to falling in love with her. It's Buckley and Katt who unwittingly bring out what Carrie becomes, because they make her think life doesn't have to always be terrible. They upset the balance of her school and home life just as much as the nasty bullies do.Carrie is often described as a revenge film, and I think one of the reasons the modern remakes have faded into oblivion is because they focus too much on the revenge aspect. In a post-Buffy world, there is more of a posturing about some type of BAMF getting payback amidst the angsty soundtrack and arch one-liners. The tragedy of Carrie is that she doesn't get revenge - she causes wholesale carnage. She doesn't spare good people, as she does in some other version of this material. She kills everyone because she is no longer able to differentiate between friend and enemy. She essentially ""dies"" when that bucket of pig's blood falls on her. It is a startling reminder of the cost of bullying, of what happens to people who are ground into the dust by day after day of unrelenting abuse. Only when she returns home does she briefly go back to what she was, just long enough for her chief abuser to kill her and end the cycle in the only way it could be ended.One of the benefits of modern life having no set trends or styles is that it allows us all to reassess what it means to be ""dated"" and to question why something is passe just because of old clothes or hair. This film, much like Carrie herself and what made her who she was, will live on forever.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror in a way you wouldn't expect. Sensible and unpleasant. An unique one in its genre.,"The movie is often classified as an horror movie and it also is on basically every horror top-list published, but truth is that this movie isn't really an horror movie in terms of having all of the standard required horror elements. I just say this as a little warning, since I have the impression that lots of people are watching this just because of the reason that it always tops all kinds of different horror-lists. It still is a movie with unpleasant and oppressed undertones and yes, it's of course based on a Stephen King novel, so it's totally understandable that this movie is classified as an horror movie, but it's not the kind of horror you would expect. The movie is far from standard, which is perhaps the biggest reason why this movie works out as such an horror like one, but in totally original way of its own. The characters and situations are all unpredictable. You never know what to expect, which adds to the atmosphere of the movie.But the movie is also really powerful and effective as a drama. I remember when I first watched this movie I was still too young to be able to read the subtitles, so there was no way I could understand what the movie was about, but I could still totally feel for the main character and feel her fear for her mother and at school. It's of course also absolutely thanks to Sissy Spacek's great performance that this comes across so effectively. It makes you feel and sympathize for the main character, even though she is a really unusual person and extremely shy, insecure person. I think that everyone had a sort of Carrie like person in their class at high school (althouh I hope not as extreme as this one!), which also makes it easy to relate to the events and characters within the movie.I was also surprised at some of the light and fun elements within the movie. Apparently also some of the actors thought they were making a comedy during the production of this movie. Some parts of the movie really reminded me of some good old fashioned high-school comedies. But of course the comedy goes never at the expense of the movie its tension or dramatic elements. The comedy just makes sure that this movie isn't a complete dark one. The comedy is used to draw the people more into the movie and makes us feel more at ease, rather than pushing them away with only heavy distant drama and an uneasy atmosphere. I think Brian De Palma did a really good job at this! The best horror and tension also works out best when a movie makes you feel at ease first, rather than constantly trying to scare you, also with its atmosphere.Yes, the movie is also still a real Brian De Palma movie, so expect lots of unusual, artistic and often long shots. The movie has some typical De Palma moments in it, especially toward the ending during the prom. He also knows to build up the tension and a sequence in a way only he can. It's part of the reason why the ending is such a legendary one.The whole end-prom sequence is really an extremely memorable and brilliantly shot and constructed one, also once again thanks to its wonderful build-up of the inevitable events to come. It's one of the most extreme and totally straight-forward sequences, which makes sure that it will stay with you forever.For most part the movie also works out so great due to its acting. All of the student characters are very authentic and it helps that they are being played by not the greatest actors around. Let's face it, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen and William Katt never really became the famous respected actors everybody expected them to become in those days. Sissy Spacek really plays the role out of her career as Carrie White. You totally feel and sympathize for this girl. And Piper Laurie also plays a totally great and effective character, that perhaps is the most evil and scary one out of the entire movie, as the religious-freak and mother of Carrie. Also of course the early- and quite big movie role for John Travolta in this movie is already sort of a legendary one.It's truly an unique movie to watch. There never had been a movie like ""Carrie"" before and there almost most certainly won't be another one like it. Brian De Palma himself tried it a couple of years later with his movie ""The Fury"" but I think that experience made him realize how totally unique in its sort ""Carrie"" actually was and still is.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

You're not gonna laugh at this...you're not gonna laugh at this (but it probably will scare you),"""Carrie"" - probably more than any other movie - shows that even in the worst situations, we've all got the power in us; granted, most people probably don't have telepathy.Anyway, this first adaptation from a Stephen King novel was done perfectly, with Sissy Spacek as the mousy but deadly Carrie White. Everyone in the movie does a top-notch performance: Piper Laurie as Carrie's disturbed, fundamentalist Christian mother Margaret; Betty Buckley as gym teacher Ms. Collins, who befriends Carrie; William Katt as the clement Tommy Ross, taking Carrie to the prom; Nancy Allen as the despicable Chris Hargenson, wanting nothing except to brutalize Carrie; Amy Irving as the circumspect Sue Snell; and even a young John Travolta as Chris' crony Billy Nolan.The most famous scene is of course the prom scene, where Chris and Billy go a little too far in their vile plans, leading Carrie to do something that no one will ever forget. And believe you me, you won't forget it either. You shouldn't forget it, because ""Carrie"" is one movie that everyone should see. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

horror classic=fear of female sexuality?,"this was not the first time i watched 'carrie,' nor will it be the last, not if i have anything to say about it. every time i see it i leave convinced this movie is a metaphor for man's fear of female sexuality and yet have done little to further this belief. the greatest evidence i find to support this belief is the correlation between carrie white finally getting her (much delayed) period, a sign she has become a woman, and the development of her telekinetic powers. previously lacking this skill, with the onset of her menstrual cycle it is only moments before carrie is flipping ashtrays and, soon after, obnoxious boys as the ride by on their bicycles. there's piper laurie's comment regarding how, eve was weak. had she been stronger perhaps she would not have tempted adam, which led to knowledge of themselves as sexual beings, and their banishment from eden. if carrie's mother had only been able to control her sexuality then perhaps she would not have engaged in premarital sex and none of this would have happened in the first place. where i find myself hung up is the significance of carrie being covered in pig's blood before all hell breaks loose. there's clearly something in the fact that she is drenched in the blood of a female animal, like a giant menstrual flow, and then finds herself incapable of controlling her own powers.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie,"Bullies get more than they bargained for when a prank goes wrong in 'Carrie', the 1976 classic based on a Stephen King novel.A shy 16-year old girl with telekinetic powers named Carrie is viciously bullied and humiliated by her female peers when she experiences her first period in the school shower. Following the traumatic incident, the gym teacher Miss Collins makes it her mission to teach the girls a lesson for what they did to Carrie. One of the girls named Sue immediately regrets joining the others in the attack, and makes it her mission to make it up to Carrie by asking her boyfriend Tommy to escort Carrie to the prom. Miss Collins of course immediately thinks Sue is up to no good with this scheme and Carrie herself has trepidations.Meanwhile, we witness Carrie's home life as one filled with abuse at the hands of her mother Margaret. Margaret treats Carrie's first period as some sort of sin, and locks her up in a closet for more than 24 hours as punishment for her wickedness against God. Back at school, we see popular girl Chris Hargensen still upset at being expelled for bullying Carrie. She decides to plan an evil prank which involves dumping pigs blood on Carrie at the prom. After rigging the prom queen votes so that Carrie wins, Chris puts her prank plan in motion ... all leading to an explosive and supernatural ending that no one saw coming.'Carrie' is a classic and one of my favourite films of all time. A big reason for it's success in my eyes was the actors involved and the way they made the viewer care for their character, whether it was for positive or negative reasons. You can see why Carrie is the way she is after witnessing the abuse she endures at the hand of her psychotic mother. We watch as she discovers her ability to move/break objects just by being angry and enraged.Sissy Spacek rocked the house down as Carrie, showing all sides of vulnerability and eventually turning psychotic. She received an Oscar nomination for the role, which is rare for anyone in horror to do. Another Oscar nominee for their work in 'Carrie' was Piper Laurie who played Carrie's abusive and religious mother Margaret. The performance she put in was so realistic and so cruel - very well done. One young stand out for me was Amy Irving who played the bad girl turned good - Sue. Such a character that the audience could root for, Irving played it so well to the point that I felt she was more a main character than Carrie at times. Nancy Allen was another amazing stand out in 'Carrie', playing the vicious lead bully Chris. Also notable was a well done cameo by John Travolta.The original 1976 'Carrie' is a film that should be seen by all. The acting is what made it a hit in Hollywood, and the story along with it's visuals kept me entertained throughout. Often replicated, this first adaptation of the Stephen King novel is by far the best of the series.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Her powers and Sissy's performance above all takes the cake here.

Well done horror film that showcases the different and highlights revenge.,"Brian DePalma's 1976 horror thriller based on Stephen King's novel is a well done film that has theme of feeling different and it proves that an outcast can have the most fun and revenge in the end.

Carrie has no friends no hope she's an outcast well the one little thing she has going for her is the secret powers of being telekinetic as she can move objects, move people and even start fires.Finally when all around Carrie go to far with the mocked encounters and humiliation Carrie then takes her powers of vengeance to new levels and new highs a powerhouse moment as this special gift cause hell and a firestorm of a good time at her high school prom! Overall this is a wonderful film of blood, fire, revenge, and getting even as the film is straight to the point and cast chemistry is in top form, as ""Carrie"" is clearly a horror classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
classic,Awesome classic horror film we all grew to know and love,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic horror masterpiece,"Absolutely fabulous horror movie, with a shock at the end. One of the best Stephen King's adaptations ever made. It's all in DePalma's brilliant directing and genius acting by Piper Laurie and marvelous Sissy Spacek, she made Carrie an emotionally-charged psycho. Amy Irving, William Katt, Nancy Allen, John Travolta, and Betty Buckley also made this movie remarkable. My favorite scene which is probably many peoples favorite is when Carrie snaps with pig blood all over her stunning white gown which was a fantastic contrast and screaming and terror falls onto peoples faces. The plot is fantastic, effects are excellent (don't forget it's 1976) Sound is great,creepy and full of tension. Amazing movie, 10/10 def.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie Is A Class Of Her Own,"Brian De Palmer gave us some high-quality thrillers throughout the 1970s and Carrie is the best one he has directed. A man of such quality teaming up with horror genius Stephen King is only going to create a masterpiece.
So, the film centers around Carrie White, a bullied misfit with no friends, no confidence and unaware of her telekinesis. Not only does Carrie endure torment at school, but she also puts up with her psychotic mother's abuse at home. One day at school the bullies push Carrie too far and she snaps, they turn the shy teenager into a vengeful young woman hell-bent on revenge. The final 40 minutes of this film when Carrie's full powers are on display, is one of the most iconic scenes in horror history.
Whilst this film brings a dark satire to the high school horror, it also touches upon serious social issues such as bullying. The power of this movie brings you so close to Carrie, you can relate to her, share sympathy and can understand why she did just snap.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Religious Girl From Hell.,"Few horror movies entertain me from open to finish, but this is one. I feel a connection with Carrie as I was too sheltered and had to go through a lot of teasing from it.While I was not chased by my Mom with a knife or into a prayer closet but I could not see Harry Potter and God was very much in the center of my life. (And now, too, but not as strictly.)For Carrie, she does not know about periods until she has her first at school-to which she thinks she is dying.When she snaps and uses telekinesis to terrorize her bullies and mother, it has some pretty frightening and unexpected images.This a horror movie that does what it's supposed to-scare you! Many don't because I know what is about to happen. This does not and that is refreshing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Moving and Creepy Classic,"A perfect horror/drama featuring career-best performances from Sissy Spacek as the title character and Piper Laurie as her deranged religious mother who believes her daughter is going to hell for having her first period in gym class.

Director Brian De Palma knows how to wring suspense out of a stone.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
this film isn't even remotely dated,"Watching this film, some 43 years after its initial release, is a revelation. It's well made, superbly photographed, and features a stellar, phenomenal cast. Piper Laurie, lured out of retirement after 15 years, is amazing as Margaret White. She looks too young to be Carrie's mother (the producers originally wanted Joan Fontaine, a good dozen or more years older than Laurie). But Laurie's performance is outstanding. She has so many memorable lines, some that I still quote to this day. ""Pimples are the Lord's way of chastising you."" Sissy Spacek puts 110% into her portrayal of Carrie. William Katt is a shining star who, amazingly, never got another role he could sparkle in like this one. Amy Irving play the level-headed part, understated for maximum sympathy. P.J. Soles is delightful, and it's clear why Carpenter was thrilled to get her for Halloween (she was a bigger name than Jamie Lee Curtis at the time). Nancy Allen is unforgettable as Chris. Sydney Lassick and Pricilla Pointer both put in good work in their parts. And John Travolta, in a part only slightly larger than in The Devil's Rain, gets second billing...lol.

One of the best horror movies of all time!,"Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is just your average everyday high school misfit as she has been taunted and tormented by some of her schoolmates and her dominating religious mother (Piper Laurie). She discovers she has telekinetic powers and uses them when she gets upset at the prom as a prank goes wrong.Co-starring William Katt, John Travolta, Amy Irving and Nancy Allen this movie is one of the greatest cinematic horror movies of all time. Brian DePalma does an excellent job on directing this supernatural shocker and it is quite faithful to the book, the performances are excellent especially the cute miss Spacek and the music score is memorable in this movie especially the unforgettable prom sequence that made this a genuine classic.Also recommended: ""Akira"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Scanners"", ""The Fury"", ""Firestarter"", ""The Shining"", ""Sleepaway Camp"", ""The Pit"", ""Making Contact (a.k.a.

Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie!,"A) It isn't long enough and B)It frays from the original novel a tad much. Watching Carrie almost forty years after its release is strange as it seems more relevant than ever and so of course they had to bloody remake it, of course they did. Watch the original, it's amazing. Sissy Spacek shines behind wisps of strawberry blonde hair and balances out the campy yet undeniably horrifying performance of Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother, who was deservedly nominated for an Oscar afterwards. The film is noteworthy for its beautifully iconic and startling scenes. It was Stephen King's first published novel, John Travolta's first mainstream role and my first horror film.

"Depressing Shocker , Maybe Too Depressing","CARRIE is based on the eponymous book by Stephen King and is brought to the big screen from Brian De Palma . It is arguably the highlight of both mens' careers which is a shame because it was King's debut novel and an early contribution to cinema from De Palma . Many people have gone in to the plot in great detail so I won't bother , but does anyone agree that the supernatural elements of the plot are the weakest parts ? Put it like this Carrie White is becoming a woman , is bullied and humiliated by her class mates and lives at home with an unbalanced religious theocratic mother . If you've not got a hell of a lot of sympathy for her you're probably a corpse . If you've ever vaguely had the problems Carrie is suffering from then you will find this movie very depressingThat's not to say CARRIE is a bad film , it's not but it's a very uncomfortable watch and much of this is to do with the cast . Spacek , Laurie , Allen , Katt and Travolta all play their parts with absolute conviction , a fact that is reflected in two of the cast being Oscar nominated and how often do people receive Oscar nominations for being in a horror movie ? Still it's best to bare in mind that this is a horror film because if it was a straight laced drama involving teenage angst on the battlefield of adolescence I would have probably have switched it off before the end credits due to the distressing narrative . But CARRIE is a horror film and a bloody good one which gets eight out of ten from me",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good horror/drama,"""Carrie"" is a movie that launched alot of careers. The movie is based on a novel written by a then unknown horror writer named Stephen King (I believe ""Carrie"" was his first novel). Director Brian DePalma became famous for directing movies with a Hitchcock-style theme (he'd go on to direct ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Blow Out"", and ""Body Double""). Sissy Spacek, who plays the title role, received her first Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance as an unpopular girl who's teased continuously by her classmates but then turns the tables on them by using her telekinetic powers as a source for revenge. John Travolta, Amy Irving, and Nancy Allen would go on to bigger projects (Travolta and Allen both teamed up with DePalma for ""Blow Out"", and Allen also starred in ""Dressed to Kill""). And Piper Laurie returned to the big screen as Carrie's religious fanatic mother (she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). ""Carrie"" is one of the better movies based on Stephen King material. It starts off as a strightforward drama, has a few darkly comic moments in between, and ends as a disturbing horror film. Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, ""Carrie"" is still effective, thanks in part to the good performances by the entire cast, good screenplay adaptation, and good direction.*** (out of four)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent horror mystery thriller! 8!,"I have seen many movies based on books written by Stephen King. In fact, I would consider myself a King's fan if I had read, at least, one of the numerous books he has written. ""Carrie"" is one of the best of them I saw. King's traits are very visible in this story: his sense of humour, horror, supernatural elements, mystery, drama, good performances, etc. The fact that John Travolta acted in the movie and that Brian de Palma directed it made me wish to watch ""Carrie"". Moreover, I am looking forward to seeing its remake. This movie is wonderfully directed with the right pace and duration. Brian de Palma did a very entertaining job with a very good script. The story is about a teenage girl who has telekinetic abilities and is bullied by her schoolmates. She lacks of a social life and is not like most teenagers. Moreover, she lives with her mother, who is a very possessive and mad women left by his husband. I prefer not to tell anything else about the plot not to spoil. The cast is mainly composed by Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie and John Travolta. Sissy Spacek delivered a solid performance, maybe, a little bit overacted. The performances are very correct. The story is original and the capacity of entertainment is really high. The plot and the performances are the strongest points of this movie. There are several shocking scenes which are very amazing. In conclusion, this is a must-see for those like the stories from King. 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stephen King's First and Best Hit,"Stephen King has had an outstanding writing career, and I'm sorry about his accident. His first novel, and my personal favorite was ""Carrie"". ""Carrie"" was an engaging, intriguing story, and I was on the edge of my seat literally just reading it. First of all, I would like to say that ""Carrie"" was an incredibly better book than movie. Still, I gave it a 9 out of 10. The book was like off the scale. 12 out of 10 or something. I loved how the book got to the ending. The movie was still scary, but they took away some of the story from the book. It would've been cool if they'd left some of the scenes alone. Oh well, it's all you can expect from a book made into a movie. I was totally afraid of Carrie's mom. What a freak! She was constantly worshiping God, but at the same time looked like the devil. The only Stephen King movie that came close to this, was ""Pet Sematary"", which was horrifying. Stephen King is a wonderful writer, and I thank God that his wife pulled his first story out of the trash can. Otherwise, we'd have no ""Carrie"". Once again, I give it 9 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is not a horror movie, but one that should not missed.","I find it intriguing that this is quite often put in to the category of a horror film. I saw the movie nearly 40 years after it came out and, surprisingly, enjoyed it very much. This may be a disappointment to those who watch it, expecting a horror movie. It is not.There is no horror aspect in the movie at all, except perhaps for the contrived religious leanings of Carrie's mother. Carrie herself is a victim of her mother's unrealistic faith as well as a subject of her college mate's cruel pranks. Socially isolated and frequently ridiculed by most, except for a few handful who sympathize with her, Carrie hones her telekinetic skills which she initially uses to defend herself and ultimately to exact revenge on her college mates when she is pushed to her limits. Through the length of the movie, you tend to like Carrie for the girl she is, trying desperately to fit in, to belong and you sense the hurt she feels at being rejected or ridiculed. Even as she exacts revenge, it is easier to support her than to condemn her for her actions.Sissy Spacek, as Carrie, did carry the movie entirely on her shoulders and she did a fantastic job of it. From putting on Vaseline on her hair at the auditions for this role to getting her nomination for Academy Awards, this movie belonged to Sissy all the way and she will always be remembered for it.Overall a great movie, and sure not one to be missed.

Don't mess with Carrie if you want to live.,"Brian DePalma does an excellent job in directing this suspenseful tale of a high school misfit who has the gift of telekinesis.Carrie (Sissy Spacek) has no friends and is the butt of every joke. One joke in particular at the beginning of the film lands several of Carrie's classmates in trouble with their phys-ed coach. One of the pranksters, Chris (Nancy Allen) can't deal with her after-school punishments, so the coach bans her from the prom.

But, things seem to look up for Carrie when the high school jock, Tommy (William Katt) asks her to the senior prom.

And from what their house looked like , it fit them just right.My favorite part is when she gets revenge on everyone at the Prom.

Stephen King's spine-chilling debut in Novel's World brought to life on screen as a terrifying and devastating supernatural horror thriller,"Carrie (1976) :
Brief Review -Stephen King's spine-chilling debut in Novel's World brought to life on screen as a terrifying and devastating supernatural horror thriller. Don't just watch this movie; feel it. Your nerves will be cold for a while, your head will be heavy, and your heartbeat will be faster. It is not a movie, but an experience. The director doesn't want you to watch the film and see the details, but he wants you to feel it and feel the moments right there with the cast. You watch this movie, and you might never bully anybody in your school/College. It's that powerful. The bullying factor also brings a powerful emotional quotient to the film, as we can sympathise with the girl and get involved with the tension around her. What a devastating experience it is! Stephen King has done so well without any alien or ghost theories. The film is about a shy teenage girl who is constantly mocked and bullied at her school. She discovers that she has telekinesis. Despite her mother's protests and denouncing her as a witch, Carrie continues to use them and eventually learns a lesson, followed by a destructive climax and haunting anticlimax. The idea of an innocent girl using her power actually makes it look like a white-magic movie. If black magic is used against innocent people, then it must be white magic that can be used against guilty ones, right? And don't we love seeing innocent people beat guilty people in movies? However cute Carrie looked on that prom night, she was equally devilish. Her mother's role was big in making her like that. That was a weird character, I think. I mean, religious beliefs are okay, but the mother was literally mad about them, and she was so annoyingly obsessed. The sexual tension and nudity were mandatory for the context, so there were no complaints about that. The screenplay matches the pace that this script required, despite a few unnecessarily longer shots. Overall, a TERRIFIC FILM!RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favorite horror film of all time,"CARRIE (1976) directed by: Brian De Palma starring: Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, and John Travolta plot: Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a haunted teenage girl. At school she is constantly tormented by her peers and at home she is abused by her fanatically religious mother (Piper Laurie). One day in the girls showers, Carrie has her first period. Having no knowledge of this important event, she freaks out, thinking she is dying, and the girls have no sympathy, they just laugh, chant and throw tampons. While pretty Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels guilty and has her boyfriend (William Katt) take Carrie to the prom, mean-spirited Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen) conspires with her boyfriend Billy (John Travolta) to make Carrie the target of a horrible prank on prom night. What everyone doesn't know is that Carrie was born with the ability to move objects with her mind, and she is pushed too far on her one special night.my thoughts: I love this horror film, and it is my favorite. The story, the directing, the cast, and the score all meld together to make the perfect horror film.The acting is perfect. Sissy Spacek made me really feel sorry for Carrie. She showed us that Carrie was smart, creative and sweet deep down inside and she was actually very pretty. Piper Laurie scared me as Margaret White, very crazy and over-the-top in a scary way. Her dialog at the end was perfect and she was a very interesting character. Amy Irving is great as the popular girl who actually shows some sympathy for Carrie, and even gives up her prom ticket and date for the girl. Irving plays the character very sympathetic yet very naive. William Katt was also very sympathetic as the brave Tommy Ross, the most popular guy in school taking the least popular girl in school to the prom. The guy also has great hair lol. Betty Buckley did good as the gym teacher who understands both Carrie and the mean girls. Nancy Allen, John Travolta and P.J. Soles were great mean kids. Nancy Allen was pretty and whiny, John Travolta was goofy, and P.J. Soles was annoying in a hot way.Brian De Palma is one of my favorite directors and his work was especially great here. I loved every shot he put in this movie, the only complaint is that his work in the opening locker room scene make him seem very peeping tom-ish, a theme he puts in a lot of his films. His camera-work mostly shined in the prom scene.Pino Donnagio provides one of the greatest horror scores ever. It changes mood with the film. It can be scary, suspenseful, beautiful or sad.So if you want a great dramatic horror film with perfect acting, directing, writing and music, then definitely check out CARRIE.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Chilling,"The horror classic, ""Carrie"", is not just a one-dimensional horror film, instead it is a rare combination of high school drama, science-fiction/fantasy, and tragic horror. It is a very chilling film in the way it concentrates on teenagers, sexual repression and terrifying retaliation. Director Brian De Palma did an excellent job unraveling the film`s plot, and attracting attention to its important elements. Sissy Spacek`s performance as the title character, Carrie White, is remarkable, and it is the film`s main highlight. What makes the movie so interesting is that the ""force of terror"" of the story is just a shy, teenage girl who also happens to possess telekinetic powers. Carrie is taunted by her classmates, tyrannised by her religion-frenzied mother (played superbly by Piper Laurie) and still must understand her sexual outbreak of psychic forces. Carrie`s compassion-deprived life is almost difficult to watch, and it makes the viewer feel sympathy towards her. ""Carrie"" is well known for its prom scene climax. Brian De Palma`s famous camera tricks are present here. It may not seem realistic, but that`s because not everyone has psychic powers. The film shows just what might happen if someone gets pushed too far, and the violent retribution they would put in effect. What makes ""Carrie"" such an effective film that it ""fantasizes"" about revenge in a cruel adolescent society, but still remains grounded on how even the most innocent person can be driven over the edge.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unrivaled & Unequaled,"Suddenly out of the blue the other day it came to me, a piece of music that had captivated me to tears on 1st hearing, which I hadn't heard in quite awhile - & on a youtube rehearing (sans the background scenery) had lost not a bit of its haunting beauty. The opening theme of Carrie is so indelibly atmospheric, at complete odds with later tragedy, it's impossible not to be moved by it, if not always to the weeping heart stage. At 1st introduction it took maybe 12 seconds, if that slow, for my soul to wrench & ducts to brim, then just before I set to blubbering like a '50s housewife over a soap opera, cruel reality dashed in - & it was a terrifying rollercoaster ride of angst, laughs, dread, suspense & finally open-mouthed wide-eyed horror. Those who like their guts spilling out of bodies instead of buckets will sneer at such a notion & get their Scream or Saw or other type graphic gorefest on to their liking; but were they faced with the more plausible events in Carrie than the ramped up fantasticals in other long drawn out blood-flood series, they too would be screaming their lungs off desperate to escape. Of course some of those crew tried to inject more graphics into the story of Carrie, for hopefully That'll Show Em! increased profits & greater notoriety, which happily flopped like a school of beached fishes. That Dollyweird colony will never learn when to leave well enough alone - be it sequel or Ree-Boot - so we have only to wait for the next announcement of the latest attempt to breathe new air into a production that didn't need it for another roaring good time laughing at their pitiful projects. (""Poseidon,"" anyone?) Meantime those who love Carrie just as she is, 44 years later & counting, can marvel at how things turned out given the proposed alternatives, e.g. casting & directing, that would have not worked anywhere as well - & suggest that film colony take blind aim at other pieces etched in cinematic history for future laughs.

Carrie,"A shy young girl gets back at her high school bullies using telekinetic powers in 'Carrie'. Carrie White is graduating high school, yet has no one to take her to the prom. She has no friends and all of the girls at school pick on her constantly. On top of all that, her mother is a religious nut who emotionally and physically abuses her at home. After picking on Carrie, fellow classmate Sue Snell decides to make it up to her by having her own boyfriend Tommy ask Carrie to the prom. After much reluctance, Tommy asks her out and they head off for the big night. The bullies fix it so that Tommy/Carrie are picked as king and queen in order for pig's blood to land right on the poor girl. That's when Carrie loses control and all HELL breaks loose at the high school.'Carrie' is an amazing fantasy/horror film. Director Brian De Palma does such a good job with 'Carrie'. We get the flashes of the magical prom mixed in with Kris planning to dump the pig's blood over Carrie. The plot of the shy girl getting back at her bullies is a satisfying one, but with the added idea of telekinesis makes an even more exciting movie. The acting was really well done by everyone! Sissy Spacek puts in a good job as the lead Carrie, Piper Laurie is convincing as Carrie's crazed religious mother, and I REALLY thought Amy Irving was wonderful as Sue Snell. John Travolta, PJ Soles and Nancy Allen were great too as the villains. All around, a really good cast.It's always fun to see bullies get theirs in movies, but 'Carrie' takes it up a notch. I'd recommend this for sure to every horror fan. It's well acted, got a great cast and tells a pretty satisfying but sad story.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Carrie is an interesting, horror tragedy","The first time I watched Carrie I was only in the sixth grade and I was very terrified and shocked that this drama about such a sweet,  innocent girl could turn into such a terrifying horror experience.   When I watched the movie,  I had no idea what to expect and when I saw the bucket,  I was praying that It wouldn't fall--how naive I was.   I just saw how beautiful and innocent Sissy Spacek was and the thought of blood dropping on her was completely unimaginable.  This is one of those horror movies where people would really care about the protagonist,   and this is important for us to Sissy as a tragic figure,  rather than an evil horror killer.   Ever since my first viewing I have grown to love this movie.  I bought the novel, which is much more detailed with Carrie thoughts on discovering her powers and the very detailed account on Margaret White's relationship with Carrietta.   The whole first hour of the movie I was expecting to be scared but after continuously watching it,  I realized that this is just a nice drama with high school kids.  The characters were well developed, even though I do admit that they were pretty much cartoon figures--which I liked.  Sue Snell was the brown haired nice girl;  Nancy Allen was the blond sexual meanie,   John Travolta was the dumb druken bum, Betty Buckley was the nice,  caring teacher,  and William Katt was the blond jockey Prince Charming.  I loved all these supporting characters,   even though I wanted them to show a more loving relationship(sexual) between Tommy and Sue.  The story was wonderful and that is why the Prom scene came as such a horrifying shock,   I didn't expect that such a provocative drama would turn so horrifying.  There are some reviews that say Carrie is not a horror movie,  maybe not in the first hour but the death of Laurie is undoubbly shocking.  I was young and all of a sudden I saw knives flying and I couldn't believe what I was watching. It was so surprisingly fresh,   something that I have never would expect or witnessed before.   The hand coming out of the grave shocked me because I had no idea what would happen.  I was cautious when watching the scene but I just couldn't fgure out what happened and then Boom--the hand.    This was the most frightening moment of the film because it so unexpected,  at least they filmed the knifes flying before they popped into Laurie.  Even before the prom scene,  images as the crucifix, watching Carrie being dragged across the kitchen floor into the praying closet,  the pigs being slaughtered,  Margaret's fanatical lines,   and the bloody horrifying scene of Carrie's first period.  Maybe this is not 90's horror but the scenes are certainly bizarre and entertaining. I give the movie 4 stars because even though I've watched it about 8 times,  it still thrills and entertains me. The music,  the characters,  and Sissy Spacek's prescence cannot be forgotten in this high school drama which is garnered into an interesting and psychological horror film.  Better than any of those Hitchcock films.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbing!,"This is a pretty good schlock horror movie, like the Excorcist but not at all as scary. It is, however, very disturbing, especially with the, ahem, ""references"" to crucifixes (I'm trying not to spoil it here...) It is very well directed and Sissy Spacek is great as Carrie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror classic,"Brian DePalma's film version of the classic Stephen King novel has held up remarkably well as a horror classic. The timeless story of teenage angst gone horribly wrong still manages to scare new generations of a viewers. There are many who can relate to Carrie White's sheltered teen. Sissy Spacek gives a riveting portrayal in the title role. She inhabits the role, and was a smart choice by DePalma. You manage to feel sympathy for Carrie despite her eventual crimes of passion. This is a true testament to Spacek's Oscar-nominated performance. Also great is Piper Laurie (also Oscar nominated) as Carrie's religious fanatic mother. Due to Carrie's repressed life at home, and the ridicule she receives from her classmates at school, she uses her considerable telekinetic powers to wreak havoc on all of her tormentors in the film's frightening final half hour! One of the best of the King movie adaptations, and must see for fans of classic 1970's horror. If you liked ""The Omen"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"", you will love ""Carrie"". 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Miss White Is The Girl Next Door You Don't Want To P-Off A-Must-Watch.,"Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Carrie; here's the breakdown of my ratings:Story: 1.75
Direction: 1.75
Pace: 1.50
Acting: 2.00
Enjoyment: 1.75TOTAL: 8.75 out of 10.00Carrie is one of my go-to films. The reason is simple; the movie is pure class - working class. And, even though it suffered from budgetary issues and De Palma couldn't complete the film as he wanted, the outcome is still one hell of a powerful and memorable picture.Part of the movie's power is down to the screenwriter staying close to the Stephen King novel. Writing an adaptation is a business of what to leave in and what to cut out. A good screenwriter is like a good surgeon - Lawrence Cohen is a splendid sawbones. He keeps King's superb characterisations. Carrie is the shy and repressed teen who is trodden down by her religious zealot of a mother. Sue Snell is the smart girl, though she readily follows the Queen Diva of the story, Chris Hargenson. She quickly realises her mistake and tries to make amends, for even though she got swept along with the nastiness, she has a kindness within. The boys in the story, Tommy Ross and Billy Nolan, are your typical lads. They are happy to play along with their girlfriend's plans for an easy life and demonstrate their love. Even the lesser characters have personas of their own, which add to the realisticness. Cohen then keeps in all the principal elements of the story, as these shape events and individuals' emotions for the climax. I'd say that Carrie is one of the better revisions I've seen. It's so much better than Kubrick's The Shining.Brian De Palma is in great form. His cinematography is superb. In Carrie, he holds back on his trademark filming techniques - the multiple screens, the split-focus. They are here, but he utilises them splendidly by waiting to the story's climax before stretching his imaginative moviemaking talent. Doing so adds more power and emotion to the violent eruption of Carrie's misguided revenge. And, I have to add extra credit and respect; De Palma is one of a few directors who can engagingly film flying knives. The crucifixion scene is perfect - From the set to the flying knives, and the slow reverse zoom at a disturbing angle. Beautiful and disconcerting.De Palma also brings out the best from his cast. Sissy Spacek is ideal as Carrie. She nails the girl's insecurity and naivety in the film's opening sequence. And as we progress, we watch her bloom into your common-garden American Beauty. Spacek displays this brilliantly. We watch as she grows in confidence and strength, and when the crap hits the fan, the anger and distrust are clearly visible on her face. Piper Laurie is as superb as Carrie's God-fearing and child-worrying mother. If she thinks you're a heathen, she becomes brusk and rude - that's how self-centred and convicted she is. But there are times when a softness breaks through her tough exterior. In fact, everyone in the cast appears to go that extra mile, and it works. All of the characters are credible and believable.If you have yet to watch Brian De Palma's Carrie and you're a horror fan, I have one question to ask - Why? Carrie is one of the great horror flicks, and I would highly recommend it to everyone, from the fans to the newbies - It's so good that you should own a copy - I do.Please feel free to visit my Absolute Horror list to see where I ranked Carrie.Take Care & Stay Well.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Strong, Very Strong","For one that was harassed at school, this was strong - very strong. I can relate to being the one everyone were pecking on, being tricked and everyone laughing. I was ""lucky"" and ended up in the nicest class at our school, so I was treated with some degree of respect, but still - I know that feeling and it does make you want to get even.Being a fan of Stephen King and Brian de Palma I must say this movie really has not lost its sting. There are very few movies from the '60s I can really say I like, most of them are trash. This one is in my opinion far more emotional and cruel than most movies today. Not having a standard Hollywood ending does really help too.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Carrie - Movie from 1976,"I love this movie, but as I'm watching it again tonight, for the umpteenth time, I'm always reminded of something that's bothered me since 1976: Why is it that Miss Collins, the teacher who favors Carrie and takes her ""under her wing"", and encourages her to go to the prom with Tommy Ross, is one of the people who laughs when Carrie is spilled with the pig's blood during the prom scene?? Then, she gets whacked to death in the belly with something that swung from the ceiling. This never made any sense to me. If Miss Collins had to die in the film, she should have died more heroically, and not as a villain who emulated the school-girls' hatred for Carrie. Miss Collins' character is completely ""out"" of the character that was developed during the whole film. I haven't read Stephen King's book, and I suspect the screenwriter for the film was given license to create what he/she wanted to. However, it always disturbed me that Miss Collins laughs at Carrie's fate. Also, in this scene are overdubbed verses of how the principal called her ""Cassie"", making Miss Collins as venal and uncaring as the principal. Can someone explain the reason for this?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Prom Night,"Okay, listen. *Carrie* (1976) is the high school movie that every prom should have been: less awkward dancing, more telekinesis, and just the right amount of pig's blood. Sissy Spacek absolutely *nailed* that ""shy, traumatized girl who also might be capable of destroying the world"" vibe. Honestly, I felt bad for Carrie at first, but by the time we hit that climactic prom scene, I was like, ""You know what, maybe everyone *does* need a little telekinetic time-out."" Her ability to flip tables with her mind is genuinely inspiring-Carrie's just one bad day away from starting a very unique career as a wedding planner.But let's talk about that *gym teacher*, the one person trying to inject some sense into the situation while simultaneously acting like she's guest-starring on *Charlie's Angels*. Seriously, her enthusiasm was unmatched, but I can't decide if she was actually helping Carrie or just preparing for her audition tape. And, uh, can we acknowledge the *real* villain of this movie? I'm looking at you, Chris Hargensen. She is like Regina George's final boss. If I learned anything from this movie, it's that the combination of teenage mean girls, bucket technology, and religious fanatic moms should be classified as a natural disaster.Speaking of, Piper Laurie as Margaret White is a *whole* different kind of horror show. Between her intense Jesus monologues and that wild hair, she's like if Cruella de Vil found God and decided to home-school her kids. And yet, amidst all this insanity, there's this weird, tragic heart to the movie that makes you almost (I said *almost*) feel bad for everyone by the end. That last scene haunts me like a bad yearbook photo. But seriously, hats off to Brian De Palma for turning high school trauma into *this*. Moral of the story: always be nice to the weird kid, because you never know when they might burn down the gymnasium with their mind.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A truly harrowing experience.,"Upon the first time of watching 'Carrie' I found it to be the most disturbing and upsetting film I had ever seen. In fact, after having watched it on a number of occasions since, I can safely proclaim it as a masterclass of how to manipulate and emotionally ruin your audience. Certainly, this is integrally due to the performance of Sissy Spacek in the title role. Possibly the most memorable role I have ever encountered, it pushes me to tears at each screening. Certainly, a big ambition of mine is to actually meet the actress, just to prove that she isn't as distraught as her character. Sorry if I'm gushing about the movie, but it is the only film that continues to shock me every time I see it - not due to the bloodbath finale, but at the sheer depth of cruelty forced upon 'outsiders' at school. The graffitti proclaiming 'Carrie White eats shit' on the wall of the sports hall, as she looks through the window, still makes me feel sick to the stomach. Perhaps I was a Sue Snell at high school (never instigating the bullying, but still participating), and I do feel that screenings of this film should take place at all schools - the most effective anti-bullying film I've ever seen. So absorbing is Spacek's performance that it's easy not to notice the wealth of talent in the film - Piper Laurie, Nancy Allen, John Travolta and Amy Irving. Certainly not my favourite film of all time (far too uncomfortable to watch) but certainly one of the most intelligent hollywood offerings I've come across in my short life.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Chilling and spellbinding horror movie from a master of suspense.,"Brian De Palma's Carrie is a unique gem in the genre of horror, made with love to offer a great piece of entertainment. De Palma who is without a doubt has been influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, often uses the great master's edgy mysteriousness mixed with humor to create a masterful character study. Carrie, the young protagonist is a pale faced teenage girl who is shy, quite, strange, weird and anything else that one could describe as a trait of an outsider. She is a sad result of extreme religious oppression, forced onto her by her overtly religious mother. A walking ghost, she wears the same generic clothes with no sense of style, wanders alone in school and hardly ever communicates with people. She is in a mental prison created by her mother, for she is not allowed to go to the prom, talk with strangers or experience the bliss that a young teenage girl meant to. This confinement causes her to tread more dangerous territories. She has a mysterious ability to control objects around her with her thoughts, and the inescapable abuse and hate she suffers causes her to use these powers with devastating results.De Palma, who went on to make a slew of classics after Carrie, is seen experimenting with the trademark visual styles that would propel him to the forefront of great directors. The opening credits sequence which is a slow motion shot of the girl's locker room is hypnotic and at the same time shocking for it's eroticism that makes one think that anything could happen in the movie. The director has an uncanny ability to manipulate images to create a certain emotional depth in the characters, simultaneously building surprise and suspense.The acting in Carrie is another if not the best aspect to appreciate in this movie. Most actors who are making their debut appearances are quite effective. Carrie played by Sissy Spacek, looks as if she had almost worked herself into a state of trance during the climatic scenes, making her portrayal of Carrie more shocking and real. Carrie's mother played flawlessly by Piper Laurie brings humor and craziness to her character. John Travolta, Nancy Allen and the rest of the supporting cast adds vibrancy that makes the movie flow according to its agenda.Carrie is an entertaining horror movie wonderfully made to give the audience the shock of their lives. It avoids all clichés of the horror movies of today which are nothing but gruesome portrayals of human torture. This very reason is why Carrie is filled with humanity, humor, suspense and surprise for it intelligently avoids letting the Butcher make the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carrie .... Innocent OR Supernatural?,"Brian De Palma.... The director of Scarface and MI 1... No a lot of people have seen his another good move which is Carrie.

"Shows us the brutal, twisted fantasy of those tortured by others.","What made Carrie that much more brutal (and some of the scenes are) is the fact that in reality people are like this. The Telekinetic powers Carrie possesses are the dream that comes to a tortured and bullied kid, as they lie awake at night waiting for the nightmare they call life to end. They want to strike back at those who have constantly hurt them. Whether they truly deserved what came to them is immaterial. This is how some people in the world feeluntil all that is left is a rage against everything and anything. It doesn't matter what. When someone is tortured and humiliated that much, you can't expect anything other than pure fury deep down. To blame Carrie for inspiring bullied children to commit such acts is horrific and naive in itself. The true tragedy of Carrie, for me at least, is that this does happen. Carrie shows a reality for some children, in a brutal way. It doesn't show these poor kids what to do. It shows us what they what to do. With bullying, it is the cause that needs to be addressed, and not the symptoms. Stop and think what it must be like for these people.A good film, well directed and written, with some powerful images and acting.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Just a classic,"The most amazing thing about Carrie is that for at least the first hour and change, there is scarcely any indication that it's a horror movie. When the tone shifts dramatically at the end (and the tone does shift dramatically a lot), it packs that much extra punch. This is also a serious downer of a movie, though I'm sure many viewers will sympathize with the outsider's retribution theme. One of the three most successful Stephen King adaptations (The Shining and Misery being the other two), this is helped immeasurably by Brian de Palma's flair. Call him a Hitchcock-wannabe all you want, this film has style to burn and most of its gimmicks work. Sissy Spacek is perfect as Carrie, and Piper Laurie is riveting as her mother. This is #4 on my list of all-time horror movies, if anyone cares.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

MUCH better than the novel!,"Carrie is a masterpiece of 1970s horror cinema.

Blood and Redemption,"Carrie, directed by Brian De Palma, is a chilling and iconic adaptation of Stephen King's debut novel, cementing its place as a landmark in horror cinema. The film follows Carrie White (Sissy Spacek), a shy, bullied high school girl with telekinetic powers, who faces the cruelty of her classmates and the oppressive, religious zealotry of her mother, played by Piper Laurie. The film expertly blends supernatural horror with a deep exploration of isolation, revenge, and the dangers of unchecked power.Sissy Spacek's portrayal of Carrie is hauntingly brilliant, capturing both her vulnerability and gradual transformation with incredible depth. Her portrayal of Carrie's repressed nature followed by her terrifying act of revenge is one of the most unforgettable performances in horror history. Piper Laurie, as the fanatically abusive Margaret White, is equally impressive, embodying the madness of a mother who views her daughter as an instrument of sin.De Palma's direction is filled with suspense and style, utilizing split-screen techniques, slow-motion shots, and a haunting score by Pino Donaggio to build tension and dread. These elements, combined with moments of tenderness and realism, add emotional depth to the film, making the finale even more devastating and memorable.The themes of Carrie are deeply resonant, addressing bullying, religious fanaticism, and the dangerous consequences of mistreatment. The climactic prom scene, which blends tragedy and horror, has become one of the most iconic moments in film history, solidifying Carrie as a quintessential horror film.While the film is powerful and timeless, its portrayal of high school cruelty and Carrie's descent into violent retribution may not be for everyone. The slow build-up may feel long for viewers expecting a faster-paced horror experience. However, the emotional weight and psychological depth make it a standout in the genre.Carrie is a masterful blend of horror, psychological depth, and social commentary. The performances, direction, and lasting impact make it a classic in the horror genre that continues to captivate and terrify new generations of viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Another great Stephen King movie,"I thought that I knew exactly how this movie ended, but it turns out I was wrong. I'm actually glad of it so the ending wasn't quite spoiled for me.

Even in the first scenes, we see Carrie struggle with puberty. We're not sure how many people die in the end. The last scene is truly haunting.The best performance might be Carrie's mother. From a certain point of view, her reaction to her daughter's telekinesis could be considered realistic given her personality. I heard that the actress who played her mother thought that she was in a comedy. She even holds that view up to this day. You feel sorry for Carrie and the few people who sincerely care about her.

Carrie,"I have always wanted to watch this film. I searched the film up on the internet and Piper Laurie starred in it as Margaret White. I thought well i have seen her in another film. She acted with Mel Gibson TIM. She was brilliant in that film. She took a great part as Mary Hotton. That was the first film that i ever saw her in and i liked her. Well when i watched Carrie(my second film that I've seen her in) she was even more fantastic. When i watched Carrie she acted as a religious freak who wore purple cloaks and red fizzy hair.Who always would carry a bible with her and a black bag. She took a brilliant part and her cloak had suited her. I thought that the film was brilliant and i knew some of the actors from previous films. I knew John Travolta from Greese and P.j Soles who starred in Halloween. I had seen this film 10 times now. My dad always complained that i was watching the film too much. But i didn't care. But i have to say that Piper Laurie was the best. But she took a great role. The third film that i have seen her in is Trauma she was the killer and i couldn't believe it. A little brat had killed her. There again she took a great part. At the end of Carrie i realised that she cuddled Carrie.Before she stabbed Carrie and she also cuddled Mel Gibson who played Tim. Carrie fell downstairs and Margaret was walking about with a knife in her hand to try and kill Carrie but it didn't work because Margaret forgot that she had powers and Carries powers. Flying knifes then the knifes had hit M and then second minute you see she was just stood there still with knifes stuck to her hand. What was disappointing at the end was i saw Pipers legs walking when Carrie moved her. But it didn't matter about that because she did well, well she has acted really well in films and she deserves a celebration. But i have read reviews that she has acted with Sissy Spacek who played Carrie in the past. I thought that they acted together really well.Thank you for the good film",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

King Starts His Filmatic Career Right,Carrie was a trip. Even the way the movie started was bizarre but it set the tone for the rest of the movie.

The entire movie was a slow promenade building up to a grand finale. How few are the movies that successfully end with a bang. Carrie ended with a big bang.This movie was so good it would go on to be referenced for the next 30+ years. There was even a remake of it done in 2002 and again in 2013.

The Queen of King Adaptations,"High school is tough. The awkwardness, the alienation, the struggle to find your place among the cliques while also carving out your own identity. It's an uphill battle that never seems to end. Well, high school is especially tough for Carrie White. When she's not being mocked and ridiculed by her cruel classmates, at home her domineering, god-fearing mother berates her on a nightly basis. When a cute boy invites her to the prom, her luck seems to be improving. Unfortunately, her budding telekinesis abilities get in the way and, well, let's just say her night in the spotlight turns into a living nightmare for all involved.Brian DePalma's compassionate and stylish adaptation of Stephen King's iconic novel remains a classic for good reason. ""Carrie"" perfectly captures what it's like to be shunned, ridiculed and alienated. The director brings a certain touch of class rarely associated with the horror genre, elevating the film above a mere splatterfest and into an absolutely heart-breaking character piece. The artsy camera work combined with a touching yet haunting score by Pino Donagio give the film a distinct flavor that stays with you long after the carnage has come and gone. Sure, there's (literal) buckets of blood, but the true heart of the film is Sissy Spacek's fragile and endearing turn as the titular character. As the sequel, TV adaptation and (sigh) remake have proved, Spacek was born for this character and virtually no one else is fit to fill her prom dress.The first of many Stephen King adaptations, ""Carrie"" (along with Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"") is absolute perfection. Not a moment of film is wasted and the entire supporting cast is on point. Karen Allen and John Travolta play the worst of the bunch, but the true villain of the piece of Piper Laurie's bone-chilling turn as Margaret White, Carrie's horrific mother.

What she does here is so special, so untouched by older movie references and so strong, that you wonder how you registered any of the plot, supporting cast or other element that make the movie work (although there are : Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother is amazing, the original novel by Stephen King is one of his best, and that also makes it work).

What more can be said about this classic?,"Of all the Stephen King big-screen adaptations, I find this to be the most entertaining, then ""Cujo"" and ""The Shining"" behind it. As my title says, what more can be said? This movie IS a classic, despite what some people say. Of course, ""Carrie"" is more of a drama than it is a horror movie. The elements of horror are very underplayed until the last 20 minutes of the movie. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie should have won the Oscars in 1976! They were more than deserving and make the movie stand the test of time the most. If we depended on William Katt's white-boy Afro or Amy Irving's platform shoes, ""Carrie"" would be forgotten. Yes, the hairdos, the clothes, and a lot of the lingo is very VERY dated, but fun to watch. Brian DePalma does his best directing, I think. The use of the split-screen is great, I love that technique! And of course the prom sequence. Who can forget it? I think every teenager in high school should be forced to watch this movie, then maybe indifferences wouldn't seem so significant anymore. This used to be my favorite movie when I was undergoing lots of personal problems in high school and I'm proud to say that I've seen it well over 100 times!

Brilliant!,"Carrie is one of the best movies I know. I have a personal rating system, where movies can get between 0 (money wasted) and 15 (increderiffic all time favorite) and Carrie gets a 14.5. There are only very few things that keep it from getting a 15, namely some zooms which disturb the movie a little. But other than that this is a brilliant movie. Brian De Palma plays with structure, he uses the classic 5 act structure instead of the Syd Field 3 act structure. He places the climax far within the movie instead of at the end. After the prom, there is no more turning back. The end is obvious and there is no way to turn it. Brilliant. And the climax scene itself, where maybe 10 seconds of real time are stretched into several minutes of brilliant film time is just breathtaking. A true masterpiece. Brian De Palma, you are a genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
We all want revenge!,"As a Gen X'er its hard to review this film objectively, as I've watched this a few times a year, every year, since I was about 8, so with a 40 year personal history, in a way its part of my life!I'll admit for the last few years, even I think it looks a bit dated, but I try and see it as ""based in the 70's"" as opposed to ""made in the 70's"" and some of the kills have always been a bit cheap and campy from the onset and we all saw that string hanging off the kitchen knife on the first viewing!I'm not rewatching this for the deaths though, Sissy and the story have that covered.Before I talk Sissy, lets just highlight that nobody does a bad job in this movie, every character, even the very minor roles, has the perfect actor acting perfectly for the part, okay a little old for high schoolers, but you can easily ignore that.Sissy, well she doesn't even have to say anything, her eyes alone deserve that Oscar nomination. Bullied to beautiful to brutal to burial, at no point do I not understand how Carrie White feels, as it is conveyed so well.As a gay guy who went to school in the 90's, the story has always resinated with me and not because Carrie is often locked in the closet! Nasty high school pecking orders and emotionally unstable bad parenting were defiantly themes I could identify with and loved watching it wiped out in a vengeful psychic outburst. The paradox of freeing yourself meaning your whole world will collapse in on you, literally in this case, wasn't lost on me either. The more she fights her circumstances, the more physical the damage becomes.So if you combine all this acting talent, solid story line and detailed characters, again even the minor roles are filled with personality traits, with Brian D at the peek of his split screen, camera spinning genius, you have yourself a pretty nifty movie.Speaking of Brian, I don't think he is given enough credit for capturing one event from multiple characters viewpoints, physically and mentally, whilst cranking the pace slowly up to 10. Each character is seeing something different, with different motivations and interpretations and its only Brain's directing that's letting the viewer see the whole picture from all angles at once, there is a method to that double screen madness!Will a modern audience buy into this fairly gore-less flick, dashed in religious goth? Only if they are looking for a chiller as opposed to a horror. Its themes will provide a great outlet to safely live out your traumas and soak in fantasy revenge. The great acting would hopefully detract from some of the garish clothes, (and you could get away with a lot of Chris's and Sue's clothes today anyways), the style and symbolism make up for the old special effects and Sissy nails it so well the real horror is just how tragic everything is and turns out for Carrie.Points deducted for the speedy prom suit bit, the bad car spinning shot that ruined a really fantastic stunt and Chris's impossible conversation whilst orally occupied, point added back on for being nasty enough to kill off characters that would live in any other movie and yes I did nearly poo my pants the first time I saw the ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Movie Ever!,"I say this is the best movie ever because the acting and storyline are the bomb. I think I have already broken the world record for watching it so many times. (I do have a life still, but I live for Carrie). If you haven't seen it, just go and buy it right now because once you see it you'll want it. Sissy Spacek is the best and so is Piper Laurie, I have no idea who these people are because I'm only 13 yrs. old, but I do know how well they act. So just go watch it and vote ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Teaming together helps towards achieving a bigger goal!,"Carrie still is quite a lot of fun, despite the fact that much more violent and shocking movies have come our way ever since it was released way back in 1976. I remember seeing this on TV (probably in 1978) and being pretty amazed by it. I distinctly remember John Travolta slaughtering that pig, and wondering why someone as cool as Vinne Barbarino would do such a thing. Anyways, I'm sure all of you know by now that this is the tale of one Carrie White, a homely high school girl with some tricky telekinetic powers. Her Mom (HILARIOUSLY played up by Piper Laurie) well, is a nit off the deep end, so Carrie can't really go to her when she's developing some, well, developmental issues at school, and therefore picked on mercilessly by the other students. Fortunately, the phys-ed teacher protects Carrie and punishes the girls for picking on Carrie. The girls strike back though, of course on Carrie and not on the Phys-Ed teacher, by developing an ingenious plan which involves pig's blood, rigging the prom balloting, rigging the set of the prom and getting the school jock to invite Carrie to the prom. So while yes, this movie is about Carrie's problems, I just love the film's underlying theme of banding together to achieve a bigger goal! It's like a twisted educational film! ""Chris realized she would need some help in the mean prank against Carrie. So she recruited some friends to help her! Billy got the pig's blood, Freddy got on the polling committee etc etc"" Goofy fun! The only problem I had with this, is the question of WHY Tommy asked Carrie to the prom, it's never explained, and I found it surprising that he nor his girlfriend (played by Amy Irving) wasn't in on what was going to happen. That just made everything confusing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best adaptation of a Stephen King novel.,"I wanted to see this movie when I was 10 (in 2000), but I wasn't allowed because of the nudity. Probably two years later I was allowed to watch it, and I thought that it was great. Sissy Spacek did a wonderful job as Carrie White, the typical tormented teenager...with mysterious powers she is just getting used to. Talk about puberty problems! Anyway, Piper Laurie just plain freaked me out. Her portrayal of Miss White, Carrie's mom, send chills down my spine. She was just so strange. I had read the book, and knew about the prom scene. I couldn't wait to see that part, and when it came on, I was like ""wow"". It was done brilliantly. The soundtrack to the movie was very wonderful (I just won a copy of the CD on eBay). I thought that it was actually better than ""The Shining"". 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
King is possible,"The trivia about this film are often trotted out, but more important is its effectiveness as a piece of sheer terror. Forget the rest of the film - it's the moment after Carrie's final humiliation, when the doors slam shut. It's the look of complete distraction in her face as she does it. It's De Palma's virtuoso use of split-screen throughout what follows. I never thought the famous ending matched up to this.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A massive masterpiece ! A classic in Horror film history !,"I do not usually put a 10 of 10 on a movie. But this film is the perfect way to adapt a Stephen King novel. The success of this classic is based on two main columns : Brian de Palma and Sissy Spacek. Those two just made the movie in such a way that it became a real classic and a reference in the genre. Thanks to Brian de Palma completely inspired and motivated in making this film as a director. BDP is a big Hitchcock fan. The references to Hitchcock in this film, particularly in the score (reference to Psycho's score) is obvious. But BDP used the camera as a good director should do. He used every angles, every shadows.. The camera is moving, showing us the story. BDP understood what cinema means. Remember the famous scene of the blood pig bucket. All is done in slow motion and even put more tension to us. Then he used the sharing screen thing, the ""split screen"". Putting different images, different shots in one screen. But the talent of BDP is above all in his way he directed the actors. This is the job of a good director. The casting is terrific.And Sissy made us speechless.This film had been directed with great talent and intelligence indeed. It deserves to be ranked as one the best horror movie of all time and indeed one of the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel.A masterpiece not to be missed !",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
