The Lady Is A Star,"This is the 4th version of A Star Is Born I've seen - 5th if you count What Price Hollywood - each version had a life of their own and reflected the times of the time in which it was made. The 2018 version is no exception. For me represented also the revelation of Lady Gaga as a phenomenal film presence. She is, quite simply, superb. Moving, powerful and real. Janet Gaynor had brought a form of overwhelming innocence, Judy Garland exploded in heartbreak in a Hollywood that doesn't exist anymore and she was, unquestionably, memorable. Barbara Streisand was tough with a strong sense of self even during her tribulations. Lady Gaga brings a little of each of them as well as something profoundly personal. Kudos to Bradley Cooper. His Norman Maine has a new name and a totally new presence. At times this version seems more about him than about her. In any case, I loved them both - Bravo!",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
I Enjoyed It,"I know some will say this is a manipulative film. Perhaps, to some extent. When Lady Gaga began performing, I couldn't stand her. My old fogieness caused me to find her pretentious and doing anything for attention. Over the last couple years I have grown to really enjoy what she does. At an advanced age, I would love to see her in concert. Being able to here her great range and depth in this movie was a very pleasant experience. Also, the chops of Bradley Cooper were quite amazing. We all know the plot. I've seen all but one of the previous incarnations, so the big picture stuff was no an issue. There were a few slow moments but I think it worked very well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
This old Marines thoughts,"I did not want to watch this movie but took my wife to see it, because we both saw the one with Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, growing up. The crowd was a lot older than we were(we are almost 50) it was the biggest screen they had at our theater and seats a lot but it was maybe half full on Sunday afternoon. Not one dry eye in the place, it had a great tempo and didn't drag on or have any lulls in the story. We were both very pleased and are still engaging in conversations about the movie. It's my opinion to highly recommend to everyone go out and watch a great movie and a heartfelt movie that redefines love in this time and age we live in. That is my two cents, hope you enjoy as much as we have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Star Is Born,"A magnificent movie, captivating performances by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. The ultimate shock was how brilliant Lady Gaga was, we knew she could sing, but didn't have any idea just how far her acting talent stretches!
After watching that I can tell you it stretches far enough to earn her some Oscar gold. 
The movie is outstanding, the music is annoyingly perfect, the cast is great and everything shouts Oscar worthy movie. 
Ten out of ten!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Is it a good film? Yes. Oscar material? No.,"Let me start by saying that the performances are solid. Not mind blowing but solid. For her first film, Lady Gaga did very well but I can't say she blew my mind...but hey it's her first film and I like her, so good for her. That being said, the film seems to be getting WAY overblown by people. The first act is really great and the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is phenomenal but after that it sort of devolves into a melodrama. The character development of Cooper's character is lacking. He is an alcoholic and we certainly see him drunk many times but I didn't see enough struggle to justify his character arc not was Cooper's performance powerful enough to convey the devastating agony of addiction. The film then goes through a few cliches as we see Gaga's character ascend to fame but again, we also don't see enough struggle from her character either. In all, the character conflicts are addressed but the film never fully dives into them in the way it certainly could have. I loved the first song of the film but the rest of the music was surprisingly bland and didn't captivate me at all. Lady Gaga obviously has an incredible voice and Cooper held his own surprisingly. Overall it was a good film, not great, just good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Star is Born Shines (TIFF 2018),"If you're even a casual moviegoer, chances are you have already heard the argument; that originality is dead in Hollywood. We live in an era where even Ghostbusters is no longer sacred. Where you wouldn't be surprised if one of the large studios announced a remake of the Godfather or Citizen Kane. Those remakes might capture some audience members, but those films almost certainly don't capture the audience's hearts. They certainly don't capture the praise critics. They certainly don't take home any major awards.That all changes with A Star is Born.Change, however, is a key word when it comes to remakes. (Or remakes of remakes of remakes...) In order to make the venture worthwhile, the film makers not only have to stay close to the ideas of original film, but they have to have a reason to retell the story. It's a delicate balance. Every version of a Star is Born follows a broken celebrity, in the Winter of his career, damaged by years of drinking who is suddenly reborn when meeting a young ingénue. The two fall in love, but while their relationship develops, their entertainment careers go in different directions.Director and Co-Star Bradley Cooper's film seemingly borrows more from the Streisand/Kristofferson iteration of A Star is Born (the last time this story was retold), as the dynamic between the two lovers hinges on the music industry. When Streisand and Kristofferson remade the film, (for the fourth time at that point) in 1976, they broke one of the aforementioned expectations, as they both took home Golden Globes for their performances. Perhaps Cooper was more inspired by performance, rather than aesthetic, as the acting is one aspect out of many that shines in Cooper's version. The characters of Jackson Maine (Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga) drive the entire story in what is essentially a film with only half a dozen notable characters. Cooper and Lady Gaga have amazing chemistry, and from the moment you see the two on screen together for the first time you feel the connection.First time director, Cooper, deftly creates intimacy between Jackson and Ally, without which the story would certainly not be as successful. In stadiums housing thousands of fans, in small dressing rooms packed with screaming Drag Queens, in a loud dive bar, in the parking lot of an all-night-grocer, Cooper uses tight framing and sound impeccably to make it seem like they're the only two people in the world. You understand his charm, you see her vulnerability, and the two actors give side-by-side stellar performances.That isn't to take away anything from a small, but powerful supporting cast. There were some brilliant and surprising moments from Dave Chappelle as Noodles, an old friend of Jackson's who reiterates how much Ally has revitalized Jackson. The largest surprise came from Andrew Dice Clay as Lorenzo, Ally's father. Both Clay and Chappelle brought great moments of love and humanity in their criminally small interactions with the two main characters. Sam Elliot also surprised me in his role as Bobby, Jackson's (much) older brother. They explain the age discrepancy, but the rest is self-explanatory as he and Cooper truly are brothers on screen, with all the frustration, fights and familiarity that goes with that relationship. Elliot in his similarly small time on screen, often showed the softer side of his craft, hiding touching instants of sadness when it comes to his difficult relationship with his brother, concealed only slightly by his iconic mustache.It begs the question, does Cooper deserve all the praise as director, or does the cast? What I can glean from the film is Cooper definitely had his cast on the same page, as regardless of screen time, these actors made you care about their characters. The audience is invested. There are countless pivotal story beats where these characters may do something frustrating or angering. Instead of merely recognizing that these are hurdles to push the story further, I found myself almost vocally upset, akin to yelling at a character in a horror film to not go in the room where the killer is hiding. This film makes you want the protagonists to succeed, even when dealing with topical subplots regarding celebrity, regret, depression and substance abuse.And that's because you're along for the ride the entire time. You're a part of this love story. The film sucks you in from the beginning with the roar of a raucous concert audience, the hard beat of the drums on Jackson's stage, and his hypnotic swagger as he plays for thousands. If you were one of the millions of people who have seen the trailer for this film, I'm sure you know exactly what I'm talking about (kudos to the promotional department of this film, as that, is an extremely engaging and powerful trailer) but it stems from an extremely engaging and powerful film. The music, much like it did with the trailer gets inside you, not just inside your head where you find yourself humming a gentle country lilt sang by Cooper, it gets inside your heart and soul and rattles around. It repeats over and over until you're the one who doesn't want to let go. While Cooper should be commended for taking his craft seriously and improving his singing, this is where Lady Gaga shines, to no one's surprise.Ally is a perfect role for her. The performer has spoken about how vulnerable and ugly she felt in some scenes when shooting this film, but it made her so real on screen. Ally's career, much like the first half of the film, blasts off, and all you can do is hold on until you realize the songstress is belting a powerful ballad. You wonder, much like her character ""how did we get here"" but at that point, you're just happy to be along for the ride. It is a testament to Lady Gaga's ability, because being such an iconic figure, if it weren't for her conveyance of sincerity and humility, the character's journey would seem forced and unfulfilling. Because of Gaga's performance, however, you relish the moment Ally can finally embrace who she is and bravely belt out her songs with no inhibition. In a film with so many moments that grab you, the music is undeniably one of my favorite aspects. I can't wait for this film to get a wider release so the studio can also make the soundtrack available.If and when Award season comes, and A Star is Born is undeniably a forerunner for several major awards, I think Cooper should be commended simply because as director, he brought everything together. The songwriters, the actors, the cinematography, the sound design was superbly balanced to create the best possible version of this story making it, the brightest star for both critics and audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Starts in exhilarating fashion, although loses steam","It's a story as old as time, and that's evident in the fact that Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born is the fourth (yes, FOURTH) remake of the movie classic. However, with clearly passionate directing and acting throughout, furthered by wonderful music and an efficient portrayal of the classic rags-to-riches story, this proves a thoroughly entertaining and memorable watch that absolutely flies by over the course of nearly two and a half hours.But before we get into all that, I have to start with the film's opening half hour, which is exceptional. Despite its long running time, there's so much packed into the opening act, and it's delivered with jaw-dropping passion and energy, to the point where I felt absolutely exhilarated by the film within such a short period of time.The passion with which Bradley Cooper is directing the movie is clear from the opening scene, and as we see our superstar musician form an unlikely and unexpected bond with a young local singer, the film begins to tell that age-old story about finding fame in beautiful and riveting fashion.In fact, in the knowledge that it's a story that you know like the back of your hand, Cooper ingeniously ramps the dial up to eleven as we watch our young up-and-coming star caught up in an exhilarating whirlwind as she is suddenly transported from a small waitressing job to singing in front of thousands, culminating in a stunningly moving musical sequence that feels like a true epiphany, as you watch this young woman overwhelmed as she gets her first taste of stardom, something that I was absolutely blown away by.That opening half hour is truly exceptional. Full of emotion, drama and moving at a pace that mirrors the dramatic transformation from ordinary singer to superstar, it's exhilarating to watch at every moment, and easily the best opening act I've seen from a film this year, setting up the rest of the film fantastically.Rather unfortunately, however, things don't quite pan out in the same stunning fashion through the rest of the movie. While the remained of A Star Is Born is still good, I was left feeling a little disappointed that it couldn't keep up that same exhilarating energy and emotion from the first act, as things quieten down and become a little more predictable.Of course, there's nobody who doesn't know this story, so being predictable isn't as much of a problem, but what I found frustrating about the film was how it failed to keep delving deeper into the lives of the lead characters as their careers start flying in completely opposing directions.As a director, Cooper did an incredible job with the opening half hour, and his passion for the subject matter remains strong throughout, but the problem comes in the way that he portrays the main points of this age-old story in a rather plain fashion, moving a little too readily onto each new stage in the two singers' careers without leaving enough time for things to settle.In that, the film has a good pace to it that makes it a thoroughly entertaining watch right to the end, but with the exception of the opening act and the finale, there just isn't enough depth to the individuals here, leaving me a little detached from their emotions throughout the middle portion, and having to rely on my knowledge of the classic rags-to-riches story to understand more about what they were feeling.So, a little bit more clarity and patience would have gone a long way here, and I would have been genuinely happy to watch another half hour or so of the film.While the second two-thirds of the movie aren't so profoundly moving, that doesn't mean there's nothing to praise, because along with Cooper's passionate directing, we see two fantastic performances from the director himself as well as Lady Gaga.Starting off with Bradley Cooper, his portrayal of an aging and fading star is thoroughly fascinating to watch. While he doesn't appear as the story's main focus, the quality of his performance is such that I was at times even more invested in his character than the rise of the starlet, as he pulls off the maturity and likability of his battle-hardened character while still putting in a powerful portrayal of his deeper weaknesses, something that makes him both delightfully appealing and still deeply interesting to follow throughout.Alongside Cooper is Gaga, who is a real revelation here. Given that she's never been in a role of this magnitude before, her acting ability is truly stunning, and she gives a performance that's just as profound and striking as any experienced A-list actress. Taking from her own experience of life in the music business and her rise to stardom in real life, the passion that she feels for her character is clear in every scene, with that previously mentioned epiphany-inducing musical number 'Shallow' featuring the best example of her incredible acting.She holds fantastic chemistry with Cooper, and the two make their characters' relationship both convincing and genuinely appealing, even through the inevitable ups and downs of the story, keeping your interest strong as the film moves through the story towards the finish.In the end, I was very impressed with A Star Is Born. It's unfortunately not pitch-perfect all the way through, but after a mind-blowing opening act, and featuring passionate and likable directing and performances throughout, it proves a massively entertaining watch regardless, with some excellent music to boot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Gaga Steals the show...,"This is the time of the year when Oscar worthy movies begin to come out and ""A Star is Born"" has definitely began the season and set the bar.I knew Bradley Cooper can act and he did a great job but Lady Gaga was the one to steal the show with a marvelous performance. The chemistry between the two of them was the driving factor for this beautiful film where so much happens and yet it never feels rushed or forced. The flow is just natural and filled with various emotions from sadness to humor, despair and anger.... As expected, the music is diverse and touching from both Gaga and Cooper who was a big surprise in this department.Overall a wonderful film that leaves a good afterthought after you exit the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The Best Romantic Chemistry Ever Displayed on Film,"I must be on a streak with the amount of excellent films that I have been seeing lately, because A Star is Born is fantastic. If this film does not get nominated for Best Picture or Best Actor, Best Actress, or Best Original Song, then I will literally be stunned, because every single aspect found within the film was perfect. I would really love to see Lady Gaga win the Oscar for Best Actress because she totally nailed it here. She went from poking faces in 2007, to make the audience's heart sink in 2018.Honestly, the one thing that I love the most about this film is the fact that the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is so genuine and authentic. Their relationship is so perfect, so real, and I honestly felt like I was getting a realistic perspective of a couple, with all of their happiness, struggles, and everything in between. It is so funny that I thought Bradley Cooper was absolutely awful in American Sniper, so I was incredibly shocked to see how well he did here. Like in American Sniper, Cooper is also suffering from an alcohol addiction and relationship, but in A Star is Born, it is handled much more brilliantly. You see, we actually get to feel for his character. He is such a likable guy, that even when he makes a horrible decision, we understand why he is doing it, and we sympathize with in throughout it all. I loved both his character and Lady Gaga's so much. They were so damn perfect together.As for the music, on its own it may have not been my cup of tea, but in the context of the film, it was outstanding. From country, to pop, to a little bit of rock and roll, I was sold on every song. Even with the final song, which totally wrecked my heart, along with everybody else's in the theater (who was sobbing like I was), I was hooked all the way through. The music was so perfect and I loved the transition in the tone of the music from the one-man show of Bradley Cooper at the beginning of the film, the duo of Cooper and Lady Gaga towards the middle, and the one-woman show of Gaga at the end. It was just outstanding.You know, as much as I love La La Land, I started to understand why some people disliked that film after watching this one. A Star is Born is far more realistic, grounded, has better chemistry, and is just much more powerful. I loved this film, not only more than La La Land, but more than any other movie I have seen this year. This was excellent, without flaws, and if anything, really started to make me feel that love might be real.So many soundtracks to continue listening to: A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, Mid90s, and now A Star is Born. I love it!",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Just an okay movies. 10 stars or Oscar? Hell no!,"I had high expectation before watching this since there's so much hype and I enjoy Lady Gaga music, and I've left cinema with disappoints.The story is meh, it's way too long, slow, confused and a bit superficial, especially third last of the movies.
Bradly Cooper act is amazing, however it's a bit ruined by unnecessary long and slow story at the end.
Gaga act was so so, story of how main character became the star was so poorly directed and a bit nonsense.And the music, it's mixed, there's some good moment but overall is just ok. Compare to other great musical movie like La la land, this is way behind.I don't get why this get so much 10 stars, perhaps Gaga's fan should stop polluting IMDB with bias reviews.

"A love story mixed with pain, addiction, fame, and tragedy.","Being a film buff I never watched the older takes of ""A Star is Born"" however I watched this latest modern spin with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga(who have great on screen chemistry together). The film is a joy as it touches your emotions and grows on you from the love of the two central characters and the pain combined with fame and sorrow make this musical drama(the songs are uplifting)a wonderful watch.Jackson Maine(Bradley Cooper) is a hard living and hard whiskey drinking western rock singer who lives it up entertaining crowd after crowd. Jackson is a man who's got plenty of personal demons besides the bottle as his family friction with only brother Bobby(the great Sam Elliott) weighs on his heart heavy. Things change when Ally(Lady Gaga) captures his heart along the way the two get to know each other in an intimate way as passion becomes love.Still the love is not without struggle and heartache as Ally becomes famous and well known while Jackson's music and personal life both take a downward path with alcoholism as he just can't escape his own dark shadows. It's like you as the viewer could see the tragedy coming all along.Overall entertaining film with fine and beautiful music and the on screen chemistry between Bradley and Gaga is in top notch form, as clearly this is one love drama to see that showcases the rise of fame and stardom, also while showing a grim personal downfall.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

One star that really does shine,"Had heard nothing but great things about this latest 'A Star is Born' film, with even my own sister saying it was a must see. There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my ""seeing as many 2018 films as possible"" quest.This is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching ""The Man That Got Away""), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and ""Evergreen"" is to die for.As far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.It's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.The final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.What 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.Visually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as ""The Man That Got Away"" and ""Evergreen"" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. ""I'll Never Love Again"" and ""Shallow"" stand out.Dialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.Altogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Cooper Delivers A Potent Directorial Debut,"Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, ""A Star Is Born,"" is a very satisfying and well-made remake of the classic story. While it does have some flaws, the film is generally powerful and thoughtful. In the film, Cooper stars as a troubled country/rock musician who falls in love with a pop star (Lady Gaga.) Viewers will likely be thrilled by the considerable musical talent on display here, as the songs are incredibly well performed. The acting in the film is very strong, with Bradley Cooper giving a wholly convincing performance as such an ambiguous and flawed protagonist. I didn't expect Lady Gaga to be completely convincing in her role, but she did a great job with both acting as well as singing (she has several moments in the spotlight during the film's concert or other music-based moments.) Sam Elliott headlines the film's supporting cast, and he also does not disappoint either. Look for these positive qualities to absolutely be recognized during awards season this winter.While the film's music and acting are superb, some notable lapses are present over the course of the movie's 135-minute running time. The first concern with the film that I have is that it does run a bit too long, and could have easily trimmed 20 or 25 minutes off its running time without sacrificing anything of importance. The film does, from time to time, take the unfortunate route of indulging in some cheesy clichés of romantic dramas. This isn't surprising, but it's a bit unfortunate for a film that otherwise feels fairly structurally unique despite being a remake of a film that has been made multiple times before. But at the end of the day, viewers who see this film are here for strong performances and a great soundtrack. On those merits, they will certainly be rewarded, and I do recommend this film for sure. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

beginning is great,"""Talent comes everywhere, but having something to say and a way to say it to have people listen to it, that's a whole other bag.""My overall opinion of A Star is Born is that it's very safe. I'd never seen the original version, but within the first ten minutes, I could literally predict the entire plot. I don't really mind predictable storylines, but for a movie that received as much hype as this one, I was hoping for something a little more.Everything about A Star is Born is pretty much done by the book. Cooper is solid in his role as an actor and a director, though I found his Sam Elliot impersonation to be a little odd. The music is really good, and I really wish we could have heard more songs from Jackson Maine. There are plenty of celebrity cameos which make fans go berserk.The first half of this movie is much better than the last half. I wish this film would have included time stamps, because there are a few things that are incredibly rushed between the two main characters.I don't really have too much more to add about this one. Sam Elliot is probably the best character. Gaga is impressive, Cooper is too. I just wish the movie didn't seem so formulamatic.

High Floor; Low Ceiling,"After watching this iteration of ""A Star Is Born"" (I actually had not seen any of the others previously), there's no way I could give it a ranking lower than seven stars. It's too solid of a film, featuring so many great auxiliary things happening, to go any lower. At the same time, however, there's also really no way I would rank it higher than maybe eight stars, either. To me, this was one of those movie experiences where the floor is very high, but the ceiling is relatively low.For a basic plot summary, ""A Star Is Born"" tells the romantic tale of Jack (Bradley Cooper) & Ally (Lady Gaga). Jack is an on-the-way-out music star with a drinking problem and a bad case of tinnitus, but when when he chances upon Ally working at a drag bar and is completely enraptured with her voice, the chemistry between the two is immediate. He needs her to keep him out of the bottle, while she needs him to stay true to herself and remember to be confident. The relationship is tested to the brink, however, when Ally's own burgeoning career takes her further and further away from Jack.Perhaps the most interesting part of this film experience for me was seeing Cooper (also the director) produce a very gritty, down-to-earth, ""now-feeling"" flick using a concept ripped from the glitz-and-glamour dramas of Hollywood's Golden Era. Cooper takes this simple, relatively straightforward story and perfectly adapts it for these modern times. Jack & Ally are both characters that feel very relatable to the audience, the types one could find carrying on a similar romance even outside the cinema doors. This part of the equation is done perfectly.Part of the reason why I can't quite call this film a true ""great"" (pulling the punch just a bit), though, is rooted in that very simplicity. I'm not going to say that every film's plot needs to be twisty or mysterious, but I will say this about ""A Star Is Born"": I feel like it was more a labor of ""let's turn this old story into something updated/better"" than anything. An emotional speech from Sam Elliott towards the end of the film really sums this up. While I respect that approach, it just isn't going to vault the movie into my film stratosphere. Hence, the 7/8 star rating is very much subjective to my own personal likings.I don't want to sell the movie short at all, though, because it does so many things right:-The music is indeed truly incredible. If you aren't listening to the soundtrack almost immediately after exiting your theater seat, you may not have a soul :)-The acting is also top-notch. Cooper's performance might be award-worthy, and Gaga is practically just playing herself (which works because she's such an interesting individual even off camera).-Never once did I find myself bored or disinterested while watching, as Cooper always infuses a sense of energy or forward motion into the proceedings. I also legitimately did not see the ending coming that was given to us.So, despite perhaps not ranking extraordinarily high on my ""Best-Of"" lists, there are still a lot of things I will take away from this film, most notably the music and Cooper's performance. As I said in the opener, it's a little odd to see a film with this high a floor have such a potentially low ceiling in contrast.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Now I know How Lady Gaga Looks Like,"Well, seeing Gaga donning a character that's pretty terrestrial like us is something extra terrestrial. Yes, she has acted in most part of this film without her usual overdose of make-up. And she has stolen the show with panache. Its hard to believe that the singing sensation of the decade has been acting in just her first movie. An Oscar-worthy performance I believe. Bradley Cooper as the alcoholic and drug addict singer is brilliant as a director and his subdued performance adds value to this wonderfully crafted movie. The songs are superb and so are the lyrics. The movie centers around the couple and the rest of the cast has hardly anything to offer. Quite surprising to see Sam Elliott bagging an Oscar nomination for the supporting actor job with so little screen presence. He has done a terrific job, though. Overall a wonderful movie which has every potential to be a cult in the coming years. Lyrical and poignant- this musical drama is a must watch of this season.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A strong directorial debut,"A Star is Born was met with a rapturous reception at its Venice Film Festival première earlier this year, and has since gone on to receive near universal critical acclaim (90% on Rotten Tomatoes at time of writing), with much speculation as to its staying-power come award season. And whilst I liked it, and found a great deal to admire, I didn't love it. At least I didn't love all of it.The fourth version of the story (the fifth if you countWhat Price Hollywood? (1932)), this particular version is written byBradley Cooper,Eric Roth, andWill Fetters, and directed by Cooper, who sticks pretty close to the beats of the previous versions. Jackson Maine (Cooper) is a fading drug-addicted and alcoholic country and western singer suffering from tinnitus, who is just about being held together by his tour manager and elder brother, Bobby (an exceptionalSam Elliott). When Maine encounters Ally Campana (Lady Gaga), he's impressed by her singing abilities, inviting her to his next show. During his performance, he unexpectedly invites her on stage to sing one of her own songs, and the crowd love it. Joining him on tour, they soon they begin a romantic relationship, but as Ally's popularity grows, she is approached by Rez (Rafi Gavron), a music producer who offers her a record deal but moves her away from her pseudo-unplugged origins towards a more manufactured style of pop, Meanwhile, Maine begins to voice his disapproval, whilst increasingly indulging in drink and drug binges.To begin with what I disliked. Firstly, the first half is markedly superior to the second, which comes down to pacing issues and editing rhythm. Whereas the first half really takes its time in setting up the characters and their relationship (it's nearly an hour before the first kiss), the second half often feels rushed, offering almost a highlight reel of events spread out over many months, without really giving any of them time to breathe.Secondly, I had some problems with the character of Maine. As is the case with all previous versions of the story, although the woman is ostensibly the lead, the man's troubles are the focus of the narrative, with the template established in 1937 (or 1932) inviting the audience to pity the man more than admire the woman. But with Cooper writing, producing, directing and starring, this can come across as a little self-indulgent in ways which weren't an issue in previous versions, with the film going to some lengths to ensure we never think really badly of him despite his, at times, utterly reprehensible behaviour. Additionally, Cooper's Maine is the least convincing and wantonly self-destructive drunk of any of the four Star male leads, with only one scene where he genuinely seems to be completely hammered (although, to be fair, it's a cracking scene).Another issue, and one which I totally recognise I'm in the minority regarding, is that I found Gaga's performance a mixed bag. I hated her work inAmerican Horror Story (2011), where I thought her sultry and seductive vampire was a mass of clichés and overacting. She's a lot better here, but still nothing spectacular, essentially doing aBarbra Streisandimpression (albeit a decent one). Additionally, her performance doesn't really go any way towards showing us why this young woman would want to be with an alcoholic twice her age (apart from the fact that he's good for her career). Gaga never lets us see her fall in love with him, despite the framework being right there in the script.The gender politics are also (somewhat) troubling; firmly rooted in the 1937 (or 1932) original, Ally is controlled and manipulated by men from start to finish, and the entire story is predicated on the fact that she needs a man's help to enable her to make her breakthrough. In this sense, it might have been interesting to reverse the genders, and instead have the film tell the story of a fading, substance-abusing older woman mentoring a hungry up-and-coming young man. It would probably be automatically criticised by the type of men who downvote anything gender progressive, but it would have been an interesting modern spin on an old story.To counter that suggestion, however, and move onto what I liked about the film, it could be argued that by effectively maintaining the themes of the previous iterations of the story (and, in relation to the 1976 version, actually returning to plot points which were ill-advisedly discarded), the film is simply embracing its histrionic Classical Hollywood genesis, unapologetically retelling a traditional story in much the same manner as it was originally conceived.Which is not to say it tries nothing new, or never goes left when you expect it to go right. For example, the film never once implies that Ally's new style under Rez is any less authentic than it was under Maine's tutelage, or that his is somehow more ""truthful"" than hers. After she has her hair dyed, Ally looks in a mirror and says, ""it doesn't even look like me"", and I fully expected this to be the beginning of an arc which satirised what the industry has cost her, pointing out that the only way she could make it as an artist was by abandoning the art that meant anything to her, in favour of something synthetic. But that doesn't happen. Her new style (which becomes closer and closer to the real Lady Gaga as the film goes along) is presented as simply different from Maine's, in the way that his would have been different from those who came before him. If anything, the film presents the whole thing as a fairly organic evolution, with a lyric of what appears to be Maine's best-known song telling us, ""maybe it's time to let the old ways die.""Another aspect of the film which worked well is that there was genuine sexual chemistry between Cooper and Gaga. Sure, having a good script helps tremendously in this sense, but just because there is chemistry on the page, doesn't necessarily mean there'll be chemistry on the screen (think of the wet fish of a relationship that isKit HaringtonandEmilia Clarke's romance onGame of Thrones (2011)- I've seen more chemistry between siblings). And although I do have some issues with the performances, the element of sexual attraction is very much there for all to see.Copper's direction is also pretty impressive, giving the rock world milieu a sense of lived-in verisimilitude - from the drugs, to the living out of limos and hotel rooms, to the whirlwind nature of it all, the film presents perhaps the most vibrantly realistic portrayal of the music industry sinceAlmost Famous (2000). Visually, Cooper's direction is functional (more the laconic style ofClint Eastwoodthan the hyperkinetic style of Cooper's frequent collaborator,David O. Russell), never drawing attention to itself, and allowing instead the camera to be a fairly passive observer. For the most part, Cooper as director is invisible, which makes sense, given the nature of the story (the ominous nooses seen hanging above Maine on a billboard are a little over the top, however). He also avoids the type of clichés we usually see in this kind of story. For example, to suggest the increasing success of a character, a standard music film will undoubtedly feature either a single scene or a montage of hasty autograph signings, a scene or two of an increasingly rabid fanbase, and at least one, but usually more, chaotic press conferences. Cooper features none of these, relying instead on scenes which illustrate to us Ally's popularity in a more organic manner (for example, we know how successful she has become when she is asked to perform onSaturday Night Live (1975)).Yes, Cooper is trying to make a gritty version of one of the most glitzy show-business narratives, which might strike one as an oxymoron, but, for the most part, he strikes a fine balance between over-the-top showbiz fantasy, populated by larger-than-life characters and cartoonish histrionics, and a more grounded and intimate romance imparting universal truths about the sacrifices one may have to make for the person one loves. To cite just one example of how well he handles this dichotomy, the scenes which introduce the two leads are as far as you can imagine from razzmatazz - Maine is shown alone in a green room popping pills before staggering onto stage, and Ally is shown in a toilet cubicle breaking up with her boyfriend over the phone. These two scenes set the tone nicely, and are a credit to Cooper's directorial choices.All things considered, A Star is Born is an impressive directorial debut, and is probably the best of the four versions of the story (it's certainly better than the 1937 and 1976 versions). Signalling the advent of Lady Gaga as a leading lady, the film also marks the arrival of an interesting new directorial voice. I didn't think it was as good as a lot of critics and fans have made it out to be, finding it a little too disposable at times, but I certainly enjoyed it, and I'm looking forward to whatever it is that Cooper does next.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Stars - even before that,"Both leads can and should be considered stars, even before that movie. But the performances, both in the music and acting department are extraordinary. Unfortunately I already knew the ending - and still it was engaging as it can be. I wouldn't call myself a big Lady Gaga fan - but watching her here!? Wow, she is amazing and what a voice.Again it's not just her singing, but also her acting and it's here that Cooper comes to play to (no pun intended) ... and also direct. Having watched this now, I do understand the struggle some had to decide which movie was better: this or Bohemian Rhapsody ... I couldn't really pick one either. This is original, the other one has Queen.But why choose if you can watch both?

Nothing to go GAGA over..but ok,"I am shocked to see all the Gaga fans rating this film months before it even came out. The film is getting a lot of hype because Gaga is in it. I'm not really a Lady Gaga fan, but I do know her music and respect her as a musician. Here is my take on the film:Bradley Cooper stole the show. I was never a fan of his until now. If anyone were to win an award from this movie, it would be him. He was so good that he made me cry. To me, the movie felt more like the Lady Gaga documentary: part 2. The film is supposed to be about a woman songwriter who never wanted to share her music to the world, and was too embarrassed because she thought she was ugly. It sounds exactly like Lady Gaga's own biography. So it was almost as if she was playing herself- No acting needed. She was not bad at all, but definitely not Oscar worthy. Bradley, on the other hand was so good, but not surprising because he was already a great actor. His directing here is stellar too. I've never seen the original so I can't compare. I'm all for remakes, reboots and sequels, but this one was made too many times. People at the movie theater today were constantly checking their phones to see what time it was. It was a good movie, but nothing extraordinary. Cooper shined and stood out to me the most, though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Throughout you often wonder where you were, what house, what state, what universe.

A Remarkable Achievement,"Sometimes weighty expectations can crush a movie before it has any chance to pop. With ""A Star is Born,"" a moving trailer and excited murmurs from film festivals, created seemingly unreachable levels of hype. Then, somehow, it reached them.In Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, he manages to instill life and a reasonable degree of freshness into a movie that had already been made three times previously. He clearly has a knack for capturing intimacy, and he uses that skill to make a movie that is deeply personal to himself, to co-star Lady Gaga, and to the characters they portray.It's a remarkable achievement that this movie works. Cooper certainly deserves heaps of credit for his directing acumen and committed acting performance (he worked with a vocal coach for months to lower his speaking voice a whole octave). His voice is low, rumbling, and worn. He sounds like someone who has just finished coughing for four and a half days straight. It suits the character, Jackson Maine, who struggles with drinking and drug use, all while still managing to perform nearly every night in front of thousands of fans who adore his music.One night he stumbles drunk into a bar and sees Ally (Gaga) performing. She wows him with her talent and inspires him ways that we sense he hasn't felt in years. In an approach that vacillates between creepy and romantic, he woos Ally by accepting her as she is, not who she thinks others want her to be.The next night when she attends his show, he whisks her on stage to sing the song they wrote together. The crowd goes berserk and soon the two are touring the country together. As her level of fame rises, he warns her that she must dig deep into her soul to create her art or she will lose everything.They each fight their own battles, his with drugs, alcohol and demons from his past, and hers with not letting fame change her. Cooper's character has more to work with, but it's Gaga who shines brightest on screen. We're all well aware of her immense musical talent, and now we know that she's also an exceptional actor, one who could find herself seriously in award conversation later this year.She may not be the only one from this film in the award conversation. Cooper's acting and directing will rightfully garner consideration as well. He aptly handles an ambitious, emotional story that does not hold back in any way. Its lack of humility should probably cause its downfall, but that's not the case. Credit both Cooper and Gaga for pulling this off. It looks like two stars have been born.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Why the hate?,I found this movie excellent. Emotionally moving throughout. Terrific chemistry between Cooper and Gaga. Elliott was great as the older brother.

solid remake,"Famous singing star Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) is tired, alcoholic, and slowly losing his hearing. His older brother and manager Bobby Maine (Sam Elliott) is trying to keep him together. After a concert, he stops at a random bar to drink. It's a drag bar and he is taken with performer Ally (Lady Gaga). She's an amateur singer who is afraid to sing her own material. He pulls her out of anonymity onto center stage.At first, I was slightly annoyed with Bradley's mumbling. I figured it's his poor attempt at drunk acting. It's not until it's revealed that Sam Elliott is playing his older brother that I realized that Bradley is imitating Sam. On the other hand, Lady Gaga is perfectly cast right from the start. She has the vulnerability and quite frankly, her average looks fit the character. The biggest scene is her first time on stage. The tension remains mostly flat for the rest of the movie. Bardley's directing is functional. There is a straight forward style to the proceeding or it may be the familiarity of this often told tale.

A star is - loudly - born,"Two major revelations: Lady Gaga can act! And Bradley Cooper can sing. This is very much a remake of the Barbara Streisand/Kris Kristofferson version (1976) with 'country rock' songs rather than the 'Some Enchanting Evening' sound of the 1954 Judy Garland/James Mason version, which I still prefer. Funnily enough, the ending of this new movie does carry a strong echo of the Garland movie and a fainter echo of 'The Man That Got Away'.The love story works thanks to onscreen chemistry and quality performances. Gaga actually reminds me of Streisand in FUNNY GIRL: she brings that sense of a raw burgeoning talent. I'm not a fan of her singing: she has a shouty style that reminds me, not pleasantly, of Carly Simon. Bradley Cooper sings as well (and in similar voice) as Kristofferson in the 1976 version. He also directs with considerable flair and has an amazing screen presence. Not sure he'll get awards for this, but clearly his star, unlike Jackson Maine's in the movie, is rising.This is a loud, gutsy movie.

A Scar Is Born,"Shrieking, loud, interminable re-telling of a familiar story that didn't need to be re-told. This is nothing but a vanity project for Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper with terrible music.There's no need to recap the story since everyone knows it. Aside from the killing pace that drags this one on to 135 minutes, it's also notable that there's not a likable character in the film. That includes the stars, the grasping manager, the dim father, and the bizarre character played by Sam Elliott. What point was trying to be made my casting 74-year-old Elliott as 44-year-old Cooper's brother? It defies logic.The story was better told in WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD? (1932) starring Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman, A STAR IS BORN (1937) starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, A STAR IS BORN (1954) starring Judy Garland and James Mason, and A STAR IS BORN (1976) starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, as well as several others with the same plot.This one has inane plot points like the tribute to Roy Orbison and a one-word cameo by Alec Baldwin. And what's the point to the drag club? This was lifted from Bette Midler's THE ROSE (1979).This version is about as entertaining as an open wound scarring over. Indeed, a scar is born.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
An instant classic!,"Sizzling chemistry between Jackson and Ally makes for a perfect watch! The cinematography is splendid. Lady Gaga truly might be the greatest musician of this generation. Almost all of the music is written and produced by her along with talented producers and songwriters like Diane Warren, Julia Michaels, Mark Ronson, Mark Nilan, Paul Blair and the likes of it. Rupaul's drag race alumnus Shangela and Willam are a perfect add to this melodrama. Sam Elliott is phenomenal, Dave Chapelle and Andrew Dice Clay give great performances.Bradley Cooper proves himself as a strong director, and Lady Gaga is a revelation. Its like a whole new side of her. I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
I don't care if it's overhyped it's still good GEEZ!!!,"It might have been easier for me to watch A Star is Born not watching the previous incarnations of the story, including the original 1937 film and the two musical adaptations AND the Bollywood adaptation, but honestly there's a ton of good here that I just feel like overall it's just a damn good movie, albeit over-hyped.The acting is great all around, especially from the two leads. While I wouldn't call this Bradley Cooper's finest work, at least compared to performances like Silver Linings Playbook, it's still a solid performance all around. He matches the role of the aged and drunken rock star well, plus his voice sounds absolutely amazing backed by some fantastic country and Americana tunes. However Lady Gaga shines in this role. I'm not much of a fan of her music outside of a few tunes, plus I've heard from friends that she's not all that good of an actress from previous roles (and more specifically her Golden Globe win for American Horror Story), her first leading role here works really well. She's great in this! And while I'm not a huge fan of her singing style, I'm not going to deny that she can sing! Although whether or not she deserves an Oscar for this is certainly debatable (she will probably win because the Academy LOVE to give the Best Actress award to roles like her's *coughcoughGwynethPaltrowcough*)The rest of the supporting cast is great, from Andrew Dice Clay to Dave Chappelle to Anthony Ramos. However the real standout has to go to Sam Elliott, who absolutely kills it in this movie, and dare I say one of his best performances in a film!So let's talk about the music. Largely co-written by Lukas Nelson, son of country legend Willie Nelson, along with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, and including a ton of talented musicians behind the scene, ranging from the likes of Dave Cobbs, Jason Isbell, Mark Ronson, DJ White Shadow, Diane Warren, and (unfortunately) Julia Michaels, the music is some damn great country and Americana songs backed with some fantastic playing and Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's great vocals. Standouts for me include Black Eyes, Shallow (which will win Best Original Song I guarantee it!), and Always Remember Us This Way. There are a few duds here, like Heal Me and Why Did You Do That?, which the R&B style doesn't work for Gaga and just felt awkward when she sings it. And the closing song I'll Never Love Again just reminded me of a song Whitney would have done for the Bodyguard (specifically I Have Nothing, and double specifically because when the song is performed in the movie like that scene was so obvious it took me out of the film) and it's just not that powerful unfortunately, just felt like a pale imitator.What I like about this movie is that, while the story has been told before and the themes are not new, the film makes up for it with just interesting characters for our leads. We can relate and see what each character is going through and feel for their triumphs and their downfalls. The movie benefits not just from the performances, but also from Cooper as a director. It's his first time directing and for a debut it's pretty great! He chooses to adopt a more up close and personal, hand held approach at directing, getting a personal, intimate, and at times unflinching look at these characters lives. This movie is a lot like La La Land in that it might not be original, the effort and care there is with making the film more than makes up for the shortcomings.Speaking of shortcomings, Bradley Cooper is no Damien Chazelle. In terms of visual blocking and film language, Cooper's approach can't help but feel basic at times. Now to be fair not all debut films from directors can be Reservoir Dogs or Eraserhead, and Cooper certainly shows a ton of promise too, but he falls into a lot of other actor-turned-directors when they make films and go for a safe approach to film-making. His directing style is a lot like how Ben Affleck directs a film, in that it's competent and certainly does capture the feeling of a scene well, but also pretty average too in terms of what's being communicated too. Although the movie doesn't help from the editing, which can be jumbled and at times pretty bad too.The script also has some problems too. While the movie does feel fresh with it's themes, that's largely from the performances and the direction, and certainly not from the script. Whenever the movie addresses the dichotomy of pop and rock feels dated and sticks out like a sore thumb. I wouldn't say the intent of the film is to say that pop is a shallow genre, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Plus it's not like pop was always an artificial genre that lacks substance. I mean look at acts like the Beatles or Michael Jackson or Madonna or Prince, or even with the current generation like Lorde and Grimes and Beyonce and even Gaga with her last record Joanne, who are all making some truly excellent pop music with a ton of auteurism. I'm also not a fan of how the film ends, which I won't spoil but it felt so forced and really unnecessary other than to provide some cheap emotional manipulation (which is to be expected given co-screenwriters Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, Benjamin Button, and Extremely Loud) and more egregiously Will Fetters (Remember Me, the Lucky Ones, the Best of Me) it's something to expect).I mean a more cynical me would write this movie off as cloying Oscarbait in the style of Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves, but I'm not gonna lie there's a lot that works with this movie that makes me look pass the flaws. It's just a really great and likable film! Go see it if you are interested!",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

All-time favorite movie,"I haven't been writing movie reviews for ages but I can't be not writing a review for this one. I've seen this movie three times so far and I still haven't move on. I've been reading behind the scene stories and watching the stars' interview footage. That's how good the movie is.I haven't seen the three earlier versions of the movie, and I might, but I should say that the movie doesn't lose its originality. The fact that Cooper is incorporating many details of his and Gaga's personal aspects in life make the movie easier to relate to and very down-to-earth; and making the story very understandable. Cooper is a great actor and Gaga is a great singer; I didn't know until the first time seeing this movie that Gaga isn't just an EDM singer. She sings beautifully while Bradley acts convincingly and they both fulfill each other in their roles; you can feel the chemistry outpouring from both of them. Some stories were simplified yet it didn't reduce the audience engagement with their struggle, and after three times watching, everything just makes better sense on why one thing happened after another.Overall to prevent me from bursting spoilers while gushing you should see the movie yourself, download the OST album (including the dialogue clips) afterwards and sing along.

I wanted to love it!,"There's so much to like about this film, from the opening, the music, the energy felt from the live crowd performances, Cooper singing for real, Gaga belting out her first new song and their love for one another felt so big on a screen this size. I was lost in it from their first meeting, but then it kind of fizzled out for me. I watched it happily and with great anticipation, but maybe I researched it too much before I went to see it, as there were so many frames which I'd already seen in the trailers and some spoilers and didn't feel so connected to it by the end, which did take me by surprise. It's definately a film to see on the big screen, and I was very moved by it, but not enough to feel it's one of those films that stays a favourite with me for a very long time. I'm giving it 7 stars for first time director, casting, the shots of being backstage and what that felt like (which I really appreciated), as well as the strong attraction these two had for one another, but other than that, it lacked depth in the leading characters, and jumped around a little too much for me to remain invested.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Win, for me, especially for the interpretations and the intimsite style that he proposes","A star is born
Directed and starring Bradly Cooper in duet with Lady Gaga form a magnetic couple with a great connection.
The most interesting point that Cooper put in the flim is the intimate touch in the musical numbers that I think is the most impressive of the film. The two protagonists are very well although after the hype that has been given to Lady Gaga, I think the role of Bradly Cooper seems better and more complex.
The conclusion is a film, which is a remake of a remake, which clearly seeks to reach the Oscars. I do not like much the direction that is not that bad, to be the first Cooper film has good ideas but abuses the short shots for all conversations removing the weight to important.

This movie is so good on so many levels, and I know many will champion the performances, which is justified... but this is truly great movie making.
The script is so wonderfully nuanced, I can't wait to see it again to comb through all the beautiful detail. Bradly Cooper has obviously listened well to some of the great directors he's worked with, because he now is one himself. Every scene is so well thought out.
The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard in a film, I couldn't wait to buy it after I walked out of the film.
I'm sure the cast will be garnered with award after award for this, and it's well deserved.. but it's the lasting images they've created that will truly stand up over time.

Emotionally Agonizing...,"I went into this movie not knowing what the storyline was... only that the reviews were great and that it would be a love story. What I saw was terrific acting and good music/singing... but an emotionally agonizing story. I thought I'd be rooting for a new star being born but, instead watched the two main characters suffer through a train wreck of a relationship. I realize that not all stories are uplifting, nor do they all have happy endings... but I left the theater feeling sad and a little depressed. That a movie can have such an affect speaks volumes about how well it was done, but I personally don't go to movies to leave without any positive takeaways, nor am I entertained by watching characters' emotional suffering for over two hours. Many folks enjoy any type of well portrayed story, even sad ones, and most will ""enjoy"" this movie. However... if you expect your movie experience to leave you feeling anything other than sad, then pass this one by.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Dullsville Arizona.,"This story has been filmed three times before: in 1937 (with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March); 1954 (with Judy Garland and James Mason) and 1976 (with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson). In all of these films the story has been the same: an alcoholic and over-the-hill actor (or with Kris Kristofferson, rock star) finds a young talented ingenue to love and develop into a superstar.The modern day remake is a little different in that Jackson Maine, our older star (now played by Bradley Cooper), is a stadium-filling mega-rock-star, recognised and idolised in every bar he goes into.... and he frequents a LOT of bars. Maine mixes the cocktail with drugs in this version meaning that as one star is ascending, his seems destined to be heading into a black hole.At its heart, this is a good story of having self-confidence in your own abilities, no matter how people around you try to put you down. Gaga's Ally is one such person; a waitress who is constantly being told, especially by her blue-collar dad and his boozy friends, that although she has a great voice she's ""never going to make it"" because of the way she looks. In chilled fashion she meets Jackson Maine, who hears her sing and thinks she might be on the edge of glory. Not worried about her big nose, he appreciates she was born that way: in fact he likes her so much he wants to poke her face. (Sorry... couldn't resist it).I appreciate from the IMDB rating that I am probably in a minority here. (At the time of writing this is (imho) a ridiculously high 8.3). But for me, I found the whole thing a dull affair. I can't remember the last time I went to a film when I actively looked at my watch... but 1 hour 45 into this, I did (it had another 30 minutes to run).For one thing, I just didn't believe Bradley Cooper as the rock star character. He just came across as totally false and unbelievable to me. I had more resonance with Gaga's Ally. Even though she is a novice actor (and it showed at times) in general I thought she did a creditable job. But given these two factors together, there are long and indulgent exchanges between the pair that seemed to me to go on in-ter-min-ably. Best actor in the film for me was Sam Elliott as Jackson's brother Bobby. The mellowing of the brothers is a scene that I found genuinely touching.I'd also like a glance at the original script, since there are some passages (the ""boyfriend/husband"" lines is a case in point) where it felt like one of them made an script mistake and, instead of Cooper (as director) shouting ""cut"", they kept it going as some sort of half-arsed improv.What is impressive is that they got to film at live concerts (including at Glastonbury), although most of this footage is of the hand-held nausea-inducing variety. There is zero doubt that Gaga can belt out a song better than anyone. But I didn't get that same feeling about Bradley Cooper's singing: like a lot of this film (with Cooper as co-producer, co-screenwriter AND director) it felt to me like a self-indulgent piece of casting.I know music is extremely subjective, and ""country"" isnt really my think anyway. But the songs by Gaga and Lukas Nelson were - ""Shallow"" aside - for me rather forgetable.Overall, in a couple of years that have brought us some great musicals - ""La La Land""; ""Sing Street""; ""The Greatest Showman"" - here's a film about the music industry that did nothing for me I'm afraid.",4.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Good for Music lovers and who are fans of stars,"Good direction and screenplay, although some people may b find this movie a bit depressing but that's ok8/10 👍",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Like music, for which the way of seeing 12 notes in any octave will translate what the artist has to say, and Cooper sees a emotional love story with wonderful music","At the beginning of the film, we are introduced to Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper, also the director of the feature), a famous singer who loves music, but is frustrated with what he currently does and uses drinks and drugs to ease his turbulent psychological state. On the other hand, we have Ally (Lady Gaga), a young waitress who has a beautiful voice and writes beautiful songs, but who does not get space in the industry because she does not have the ideal of beauty that many record companies' demand. A point that draws attention in these first minutes of projection is how well the direction builds the dissatisfaction of the protagonists with their current lives, each one yearns for something to encourage them to move forward and when Jack watches Ally perform in a drag queens bar, everything changes quickly.In romance films, building a couple's chemistry is something challenging that not always the creators manage to make it work, but here the chemistry of Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga on the scene is impressive. The couple's introduction scene is very well orchestrated and the script's sincere dialogues help to give veracity to that encounter and make us root for the couple. Their immediate rapport generates interesting scenes, as the situation happened so fast that they get to know each other little by little while singing in different concerts around the country, packed with great songs that help a lot in the construction of romantic moments.In turn, the two singing exude love, from those most fervent passions, which make the body tremble completely when being close to the loved one, performing, next to her, something that she also loves. The sound design creeps us out just as much. The songs, at the same time, are contagious. The highlights are ""Maybe It's Time"", for the meaning attributed to Cooper's character, stuck in the past, ""I'll Never Love Again"", for the power contained in the interpretation, and ""Shallow"", for being presented with care, reaching the apex precisely in the couple's first live duet, in a segment in which the montage, as well as a camera surgically accompanying the emotional charge in the number, refer, once again, to the director's ability in this position never occupied, in addition to the singer as dramatic performer.This too is a production of a new century. The modern makeover, in addition to placing the new music industry in this game of versions, which has completely transformed in recent decades, is felt in the misunderstandings. Bradley Cooper, in fact, is not ignorant of what other works have been about - corrosive fame, the dark side of the rainbow. On the other hand, when casting the exuberant and extremely talented Lady Gaga - in an excellent performance -, always surrounded by artifices to compose herself as an artist, for the role of protagonist, a ""mere"" waitress with immense vocal aptitude, the filmmaker ends up assuming a position Dangerous, however, he does not really yearn to awaken a critical heat to his work at this specific score. The feature film, for example, is much more about creativity than about the evils of the celebrity world - living only in the field of ""they say my nose is too big"" and ""I'm not going to dye my hair"", situation that changes later. Bradley Cooper, in a way, wants to talk about the popular artists of today, but, at the same time, he doesn't really try to venture into those parts - his character's arc, for example, has no causality with any other, depending only on yes.When we see the work in terms of the great decadence of Jackson Maine, a character, curiously, with more prominence than the star itself, precisely because he is played by Bradley Cooper himself, A Star Is Born manages to reach its greatest successes, moving towards true emotion from the audience, without dishonesty in handling feelings. The character is outstanding. Before that, the direction could already be considered, in itself, a more than necessary justification for a round of applause, on the part of the spectators, to the work, but the acting is also of a touching sensitivity. Bradley Cooper really seems to care about the construction of this destroyed artist, even because the adapted script, with his participation, is concerned with exploring the musician's present and past in an enormously competent way. The presence of his brother, played by Sam Elliott, enhances the portrayed journey, in which love is a passage in his life, lived with profound intensity, but always returning to the problems that made him known. The allusion to the past with his father, telling the story involving a belt, is enough to make us fear a certain walk to the garage. The director is quite suggestive, delicate and intimate.But not everything is perfect. The film's script works well until the second half of the second act, then loses strength by betraying the complexity of the subject to bet on villainous resolutions, taking away the impact of important scenes. Another big problem is that the protagonists do not have the same prominence, Jack has the most screen time and his problems are much more developed while Ally takes on a secondary role. The character had many layers to work with that are simply addressed in short, simplistic scenes. All the pressure she suffers from her manager and the concessions that the character makes both in the name of her career and that of Jack are not explored, diminishing the potential of the story. As the story progresses, we are confronted with various hardships from the world of music. Addictions, depression, demanding beauty standards, plastered and soulless songs... dilemmas caused by both stardom and the pursuit of it. This is something notable in the film, which always shows the parallel between Ally's meteorically rising curve and Jack's oscillating but always downward curve. Incidentally, these oscillations in the singer's arc, who at times succumbs to problems, at times proves to be resilient thanks to the persistence of his partner, are a harsh portrait of a relationship. Though strong, love does not always heal all. Some wounds, especially those responsible for forging a personality, are almost impossible to heal.Bradley Cooper did a very remarkable job in his first time directing a feature film, the whole camera game is very assertive and works well. In one of my favorite scenes, Jack goes to drink with Ally at a bar and the camera focuses on her reaction to seeing him drink three glasses of whiskey in a row. This directorial moment is for the audience to realize that the problems in their relationship already existed even on their first date. Another great insight was using angles close to the actors' faces to extract all the pain and discomfort from the performances, leaving several scenes much more emotional. On the other hand, he wasn't so assertive in terms of rhythm, the work could have taken at least a few minutes as the second act loses steam after the frantic first part.Cooper is very efficient in immersing us in the backstage and stages of overproduced events, giving several points of view of how these presentations work, but without being too didactic. His guitar has a thunderous presence, in contrast to his vocals, which never get over the point. Add that to the simple performances and the melodious spectacle that the second act turns into, it's almost like we're having a real concert experience. The protagonist director also has his merit for the effort in studying and preparing to sing, play the guitar and behave like a legitimate music star, a necessary care to act opposite Lady Gaga, who already mastered this long before being chosen for the role. By the way, Gaga, as previously mentioned, presents Ally with a fun and captivating figure, as well as responds well whenever she needs to deliver an exciting performance. In musical performances she is radiant, as one would expect from a star of her stature. And the chemistry with Cooper is intense from the opening minutes. Only a very demanding spectator does not fall in love with the story and the couple.Matthew Libatique's photography uses various types of colors in the palette of each scene, giving the film a fluid aesthetic in several blocks. There are moments illuminated with neon, others with light cannons used in shows and also the enhancement of natural light in more open planes and panoramic shots. The montage overextends some passages, because while the first act has more frantic editing, the middle and the end suffer from a slow pace and, however much the tone of the story has changed in this part, there are certainly moments that would not be missed in to the detriment of some better depths, especially from Ally. But the best hit and the biggest highlight is certainly the soundtrack for ""A Star Is Born"". Result of the musical partnership of Lady Gaga and several musicians, such as singer Lukas Nelson, from the rock band Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real, DJ White Shadow and even Bradley Cooper who also sings live with Gaga. The viewer will leave the cinema wanting to watch a real show with the duo.""A Star Is Born"" is the third remake of an original film released in 1937. Even so, it emerges as an original work. Not in your story, of course. It is a fairy tale that reveals the rainbow in all its colors and does not shy away from showing the darker side: a duality that is far from being new. But, like music, for which the way of seeing 12 notes in any octave will translate what the artist has to say, it is what the director sees in the same story already told before that produces the result. And Bradley Cooper, using a technical experience far above average for a first film, saw with his heart. A Star is Born is not just a product, it is a product of rare sensitivity and quality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Truly Wonderful Cinema,"This film is a true gem. It seems all films now have to have massive budgets, massive amounts of CGI and very little acting skills.
This movie reminds me of a classic movie of old. One that doesn't need CGI, just good old fashioned wonderful acting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A star is born...not the brightest though,"A Star Is Born is the fourth remake of the film, which stars Bradley Cooper (Alias, American Sniper) and Lady Gaga (American Horror Story) and it follows how the former, a very successful musician stumbles upon the latter, a struggling singer and how he takes her from performing at a drag show to singing in front of a massive crowd as a featured guest on his concerts which opens the door to her own successful singing career.This is an unpopular opinion so I'll just rip off the band aid quickly: I do not get the numerous acclaim the film is getting. Maybe it's because I've heard so much praise about it but after seeing 6 of the 8 Best Picture nominees side by side the discrepancy is apparent but if I've seen it on it's own I might have a different opinion about it.Aside from Best Picture, both actors are nominated for their respective roles of which for Cooper I get because he was acting every second and he's a disaster when he's drunk, but is the sweetest when sober. His voice had a lower tone, he plays the guitar and sings. I won't even attempt to figure out who will win Best Actor between him, Christian Bale and Viggo Mortensen because they all deserve to up there. As for Lady Gaga, I'm not entirely convinced why she's nominated. Don't get me wrong, she turned in a decent performance, her chemistry with Cooper was there and she had her moments, most notably their bath tub scene. On the other hand, I felt her acting was lacking, like Cooper as Director didn't push her hard enough and for some reason I kept on thinking Katharine McPhee would've done a better job. Maybe that's where the disparity comes from, Cooper was giving 110% while Gaga to which no fault of her own could barely manage to come up with 90%.I also don't get the hype over the soundtrack (Shallow has surpassed Michael Jackson's 'Thriller for the most number of awards won,) with most of the lyrics I found basic and trite. I'm sure it will grow on me with multiple listening, same as the movie, which brings me back to my statement that I expect more from a Best Picture, Actress and Song nominees.

Deeper than Shallow,"From the moment I heard the opening notes of Just Dance for the first time as a 15-year-old sitting in the back seat of her Taekwondo instructor's car on a trip to Burntisland, I fell in love with Lady Gaga. Her talent and shine upon this world left me in awe, and I had always hoped to see her make the transition to the Silver Screen. This movie is everything I had anticipated over the last 10 years and more. Every scene in this movie seems as though it came naturally to everyone involved, as if they were merely filming a day in the life of whoever is on screen at the time. With Mr. Cooper at the helm, it has become a clear contender for this year's Oscar nominations and deservedly so. The music has such passion in both lyrics and delivery, the story is compelling and emotional, and the cast could not have given a greater performance. Ms. Germanotta has succeeded where Madonna failed, by transitioning from global superstar to on-screen megastar.

Because there is so much authenticity in Gaga's character that I couldn't help but wonder if it's not the first time we're seeing the real her, unfolding, depleted of any mask. Also, there is so much happening in their eyes it seems that they're made for each other, displaying one of the most ravishing, if not the best chemistry in film history.

But all in all quite a standard story, that is definitely well executed but lacking in deeper substance.I do struggle with determining whether that great execution and the coherent storytelling can in fact allow me to look past its lack of a deeper meaning and originality; but, unfortunately I don't really think so in this case.

Bradley coopers 6 months of rehearsals have seriously paid off, and i find his presence as a worldwide artist very convincing. The downfall of this movie comes from it's jumpy storyline. There are many sections where it feels like one scene is cutting to the next and the viewer has too fill in the sections between scenes to be able to understand the principles of the following scene. This is obviously something that happens in many films, as you can't fit years of time into a 2 hour video, but there are definitley sections missing that need explaining just a little bit more without the viewer having to make assumptions.

Bradley Cooper is the Star,"Movie is good, slow moving, so much so that my husband was making the snoring sound more than once. Music is good, Gaga's voice is great, as always.

I rarely if ever thought about it being him playing the role of Jackson Maine. He WAS Jackson Maine with all the pain and suffering that person holds on to. Wow! Truly set a new highbar for himself. He should win an Oscar. He is the reason to go see this movie. Also, fun to see Sam Elliott again.

"Amazing performances, great music and moving story","I just saw A Star is Born and enjoyed it very much. It is a remake of a few other movies by the same name but with some differences. Jackson Maine (played by Bradley Cooper) is a middle-aged singer who meets the younger Ally (played by Lady Gaga) after she sings at a bar and he immediately notices her talent as a singer and songwriter. He asks her to perform with him at a concert, and they begin to collaborate musically and end up falling in love; however, as Ally's star is on the rise, Jackson's is fading as he increasingly struggles with his alcoholism.Lady Gaga is not only an incredible singer, her acting was very good and natural as well. And Bradley Cooper has an amazing voice, along with being a very talented actor. It is also a very impressive directorial debut for him. You could tell that they were both very much invested in their characters and the story itself and were both incredibly believable, and moreover they sound really great together. There was some very strong work by supporting actors as well, most of all Sam Elliot as Jackson's much older brother, Andrew Dice Clay as Ally's father and Dave Chapelle as Jackson's long-time friend. The script is smartly written, at times funny and other times heart-breaking. It is very moving without being cheesy, and it features some great music, namely the song ""Shallow"". It is sure to garner some Oscar nominations next year, and I highly recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Mesmerizingly good,"Gaga is terrific and I wasn't surprised. The big surprise for me was Cooper's performance, not to mention his directing. Here's hoping he directs again. I did not expec a remake (let alone a remake of A Star Is Born) to keep me guessing.It has been updated intelligently and with respect to its predessors. For me, no one can top Judy Garland as the ""Star"" but Gaga comes very close indeed. Cooper as the doomed husband is simply unforgettable. The last half hour is gut-wrenching and I admit I wept.The music is excdllent and Cooper has cast the supporting roles to perfection. Particulary great are Sam Elliott as his brother and Andrrew Dice Clay as Gaga's father. Dave Chappelle is terrific as Cooper's best friend. The movie is very well acted down to the smallest roles. The meet cute in the drag bar is wonderfully charming.This film excels technically on all fronts. It will get many Oscar nominations. It is a lock for Best Song.Go see it.

Keep my ticket money but please give me back the over two hours of my life back.,"Okay. I went and saw it because of the soft side in me (or, in other words, my wife wanted me to go see it with her .... I love her so much). I didn't know what to expect so I went in with an open mind. The first hour showed promise but the rest of the movie was kinda like the movie the ""Titantic"" -- You knew the boat would sink at the end.I found the F word so often said that it took away from the film. I say that word from time to time but not 74 times in two hours. And, I'm 33 years old. And, I'm not bashful.Lada Gaga is the reason for the crowded theater. If they said Stephanie Germanotta was the actor in it, the theater would have been empty. I personally like her and admire her for opening up about her mental and physical struggles. That is a great help for so many! But, this is a movie and not a lipped sync'd video. The Lady Gaga marketing didn't make up the difference for this film.One poster asked a good question: How many 10 out of 10's can fans give a movie when it isn't even released?

A fine addition to the Star is Born canon.,"""Maybe it's time to let the old ways die."" Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper)After three previous versions at A Star is Born, director/co-writer/star Bradley Cooper has added a version worthy of the best of them. Cooper's Jack is a charismatic rocker whose flaw is substance abuse, and Lady Gaga's singer/songwriter, Ally, is an ingenuous talent who remains innocent through all the shenanigans required to be a star, not born but made.Her opening number strutting on a bar singing La Vie en Rose clarifies why Jack fell for her immediately and why she is headed to glory. As the opening lyric might suggest, they are change agents for each other, not always in easy transitions.Although the two first movies were about Hollywood, and the dangers of stardom we all knew even in 1937 and 1954, then Streisand's (1976) and Cooper's are all music, with Cooper's superior take a lived-in rock atmosphere. In that way, Cooper's is even better than Almost Famous.Streisand and Kristoferson seem to exist for Streisand where Cooper's couple is deeply in love but not strong enough to save Jack.
Although I tire of Jack's incessant drinking, a tedium to watch after a few minutes, I accept it as the tragic element of a cliched story about the glory and the hell of the biz. Both Cooper and Gaga sing with such depth of feeling it is hard not to shed a tear at the sad outcome.The film is also strong about the challenges of that road to stardom, uncompromising as it displays the forces changing Ally from a wholesome natural singer to a manufactured pop singer and marginalize Jack for being a substance abuser and too old. The resonance today with the #MeToo emphasis on male domination is only too obvious. However, Cooper transforms Maine into a loving, not jealous lover.The times they are a'changin'.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Good, but needs more","Full of great songs and performance by Lady Gaga. Feels so great as a musical movie. But as for script, not so strong enough.

Overall, a film worth watching, but I highly recommend checking out the other three 'A Star is Born' films too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Heartbreakingly Beautiful.,"This year is a difficult one for my Oscar choices, because so many incredible movies were made this year already and there are still more to come, but what I really love about this remake of ""A Star is Born"" is that it stands on its own, in a complete and original way. It's heartfelt, it's funny, it's traumatic, it's real, it's what I would call, beautiful trauma. The original sound track is incredible and I love how Lady Gaga has stayed with what she calls, ""This girl"" - which she states with love in her 5'2 documentary about her life--saying she needs to stick with this side of her, because she is the hold (as in, not hiding her beautiful voice behind heavy tracks and beats, like she used to do), and yes, oh yes, she was right. She believed in herself and the world is her Oyster now. She has slowly but surely found confidence in her own vocal range and strength in her acting ability which we saw come to life since her Emmy win for her role in American Horror story. She is incredible and is definitely my pick for next years best female Oscar win. Bradley Cooper is also growing in depth as an all rounder in the entertainment industry. It's no easy feat debuting his directing skills at the same time he debuts his own singing skills (which blew my mind) and keeping in tune with his broken and soulful character in this movie as well. His character holds love and pain in such a harmonious way, which makes you want to reach out and help him, because you want him to clean up his act, you want him to get better, you want him to win, which makes it even worse as the movie goes on, knowing he is like a beautiful meteorite flying through the sky, which will inevitably find land and destroy everything it comes into contact with. A beautiful tragedy of the modern world. A movie to learn from. Music that won't be forgotten. Beautiful in every way. Definitely a few Academy nominations for Best Director, Best Actor and best musical/drama. Brads going to have it tough with Rami Malek who stats as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody in the Male Actor catagory, but since Rami isn't singing, who knows what might happen...",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Really damn good movie,"A Star Is Born is without a doubt one of the best films of 2018.Credit has to be given to Bradley Cooper for not only directing, but putting in a wickedly understated but fantastic performance. Lady Gaga I also give supreme credit to for bringing a very stripped back and raw take on her character to life on the screen. They really just clicked on screen together, and I think credit has to be given to them both for being able to create that and pull me in.Directing, acting, music, pacing I give a 10/10. What I will say however is that while I loved the story, it was clunky in some places, and also used a few cheap tricks to try and move you through the story in places. Was not distracting to the point of detracting from the overall high quality of the film, but was noticeable in places.End went full bodyguard vibes, and was a bit glaringly obvious, but totally still worked. Kudos to Gaga for having the credibility and range to bring the movie home. Highly recommend you check it out.Hands down beats most of the main stream rubbish being churned out in 2018.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Best movie of 2018.,"I can't decide if I'm more shocked by Lady Gaga's acting abilities or Bradley Cooper's innate directorial talent.The movie is fantastic, and features some of the most moving music I've ever witnessed in a motion picture. A very powerful experience which will linger within the viewer for a long time thereafter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
An Impressive Directorial Debut From Bradley Cooper,"Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, A Star is Born, is, well, a beyond impressive directorial debut. This is another one of those amiable films, that has that charisma, that emits rare, unworldly sensations of comfort, welfare, and empathy. Heart and soul, it's solely touching.By far, the most memorable aspect of this film that heaps of cinephilia's will be commending for years and years from now, is the on-screen junction between Bradley Cooper and Stefani Germanotta's-AKA Lady Gaga's-characters. It's unreal how real their love felt as unreal as that may realistically suggest. Cooper's devotion to storytelling and character absorption is not only laudable, but also, genuinely authentic.Hats off to you once again Cooper. You are an acting master. Getmanotta you are also an acting master, which I was shocked to find to be true, in the case that you are indeed an acting master of the mastery of acting and whatnot-I don't look into the proper terminologies I just ""say""... Oh, and Sam Elliot-no surprise; the man is a legend-killed it. The man is turbulent in his role as an old but dismayed friend.The dialogue is ""spot-on."" This is like, Silver Linings Playbook dialogue leveled ""spot-on."" We can assume that Mr.Cooper and his writing team have learned a lot of calligraphy skills from David O. Russell. I appreciated the accessible amount of F-bombs as well. Don't judge me.And that climax. There's a very very particular sequence towards the finale that was perfectly edited, perfectly lit, and just wow, for sure, perfectly executed. Without question a cinematic highlight of 2018.And yessir, the music is absolutely chic-minus the song, ""Why Did You Do That?"" which I assumed was initiated in order to mock our typical ""Pop Music"" standards of today (if it's not, forget what I just said or don't @ me). It's inviting, electrifying, and notably appealing even to a rock-and-roll finatic like myself.This is not sponsored, but I felt as if this service is vastly relevant to one of the major, presented topics in A Star is Born, so I'll self-sponsor it. If you're currently dealing with substance abuse issues or disorders or you know of somebody close to you that is, I highly recommend visiting atoncenter. They are a profoundly sufficient drug and alcohol recovery program that is on duty 24 hours a day. You can't start helping others until you begin learning to help yourself.Is A Star is Born a bit predictable at times? Yes. But despite this, being able to witness an early-screening crowd of theater members who were verbally locked-on, inflexiably engaged, warmly reactive, and sentimentally invested in this angelic story, was such a feast-especially when you know what one film can do to one's life. It's always pleasing to behold the reaction of numerous of viewers experiencing an out-of-the world ordeal. Cooper, you did a damn good job. You devious man, you almost made me tear and I hate you so much for it. (Verdict: A-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
no stars were born during this movie,"Gaga is one of the best voices there is but the songs are as terrible as the laziest pop songwriters can go, so there goes the voice. first 30 minutes was a bit watchable, Cooper was being a overly deep, sympathetic drunk, gaga was..gaga? ..then the plot deploys and removes the watchableness..not worthy of paing money to watch, watched bad times at the el royale last friday because this was sold out and that was by far a more enjoyable movie",2.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Great movie for those that love good acting and a good story (and music),"Wow! I can't remember the last time I saw a movie at the cinema that I greatly enjoyed. Most of the time I feel that Hollywood movies nowadays are very ""Meh"". (To the lay person, this means so-so).
This movie moved me. Bradley Cooper was amazing. He should win Oscars for his performance and for directing. Never have I seen a better example of ""showing the audience and not telling them."" The plot was great. The editing was sharp and well done. The dialog was realistic and endearing. The characters were flawed and beautiful and engaging. The music was amazing as well!
Lady Gaga also deserves a mention. I don't know much about her acting chops but I've seen her in a few little things here and there (mainly American Horror Story) so I wasn't sure what to expect. She exceeded expectations. I could feel the audience fall in love with her.
There was a theme running through the movie about how the industry can ruin lives - drinking, drugs, changing who you are to succeed and make money. In a way, this movie is a cautionary tale.
I could almost give this movie a 10/10.
I feel like Lady Gagas' character didn't really have a satisfying arc. I've seen other reviews that imply it's because Bradley Cooper focused his directorial powers at his own character. But I don't think it is that. Without giving anything away, her character was trying to maintain her integrity but ended up compromising to succeed. This wasn't fully realised by Gaga and therefore not resolved. So it felt a little unfinished.
Still a great movie! Very entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"About creativity, staying honest and learning to trust","Bradley Cooper's directorial debut marks the third remake of this particular story. Fourth, if you count the 2013 Bollywood musical. The story is about an aging country rock singer, whose career is at its final stretch. Then he runs into a girl with an amazing voice and becomes instantly fascinated, if not outright smitten.The film stars Cooper in the leading role and Lady Gaga as Ally, the girl with the voice. And these two are magnificent. The role of Ally is of course practically tailor-made for Gaga, but I'm still blown away by her acting talent. The same with Cooper, except that with him I'm blown away by the fact that he can actually sing really well. These two approach the same point from different directions and this build some amazing chemistry between them.And it's good that these two work as well as they do, because the movie would absolutely fall apart if they did not. Mind you, the story itself has some depth to it. I especially like its point of view on talent and what you should do with it. Does an artist have a responsibility to use their talent to say something meaningful or is it simply enough to make people enjoy themselves? But in the end it's the love story, the evolving relationship between these two that keeps the movie going.Now, I have to admit that I did not enjoy the ending. It's the same as in the previous movies, but it still didn't feel honest to me. The movie was not building towards such an ending. I felt cheated.Still, a very good movie. Borderline great.

wow.,"A Star Is Born is, first of all, acting. There are very good performances : Cooper is very great, Lady Gaga... for first time I see her play a character in a movie of that caliber... he really surprises me. Both of them make you believe of their relationship. And that's very good. Sam Elliott... damn... he can be responsible of bringing some tears in your eyes actually.Second, the directing. This is the first time that Bradley Cooper directs a movie, and for his first time, it was a very good first time. Cooper knows exactly how filming scenes, particularly throughout the gig parts. He puts the camera just in front of the faces to vehiculate emotions. The lighting and colors are very vivid and it's pleasant to watch.Third, the film editing. There are very smart editings in this movie. He cuts right at good moment between scenes. There is one scene at the end, a penultimate cut, that just blown me away. And those who watch the movie knows what I am talking about.And fourth, the soundtrack. The majority of the songs feel authentic, and that's the core force of A Star Is Born, thanks to Gaga and... Cooper. Again. This guy have a beautiful voice. ""Shallows"" is the favorite for the best original song in the Academy Awards. Easily.The minor flaw I can see is that the second part can be a bit predictable. And I wanted to see more of Sam Elliott in this movie.At the end, this movie can be a classic. Just watch it.Final note: 82/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Doomed Love Story with an Incredible Score,"This is a movie where everything - plot, acting, characters and soundtrack - comes beautifully together in a whole that is so much more than the sum of its parts. Despite some choppy editing in the second half, the great acting, minutely measured plot and the sheer beauty and tragedy of the love story, combined with a score that somehow reflects what is happening on the screen to the letter, is bound to leave you with a ball in your throat when the credits roll.Even though the movie is called 'A Star Is Born', it could have easily been named, and just as appropriately, 'A Star Goes Out'. The ascension of Gaga's character to stardom is a mirror reflection of Cooper's own spiralling descent into oblivion. Cooper seems to have landed the role of a lifetime, delivering a poignant and heart-breaking performance as a masculine, yet extremely vulnerable ageing country rock star.By the time Ally comes into the picture, the only thing that can fill the hole in his soul and keep him together is an enormous amounts of booze and pills. Ally's advent will shake him out of his vegetative state, but will also give him something very dangerous - hope. The decline of his own career, the ascent of Ally's and his own battle with addiction will create such strong centrifugal forces that his already fragile mental stability will soon start flying apart at the seams.Lady Gaga also delivers a good - perhaps not stellar, but good - performance the is most striking by its sheer contrast with her on-stage persona. Her vocal prowess is remarkable, the songs are a sure Academy Award contender and the chemistry with Cooper's character is electrifying.But the guy who steals the show is Bradley Cooper. It takes nothing short of a battle with addiction of your very own to be able to give such a credible performance of someone who is as damaged and broken as Jackson. I am perplexed by the number of people who have been bashing him for being over-the-top. You are lucky to have not seen mental illness or alcoholism up close, otherwise you would not be moralising this way.Despite an enormous success with audiences and to some extent with critics, I do not expect the movie to rake in any Academy Awards, except in the music categories. These days, you either have to act in an autobiography or turn yourself into a monster (like Charlize Theron) to even get a nod. In this connection, Lady Gaga might as well get a nomination - just because this is perhaps the first time we ever see her without make-up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

The MUSIC Lives On,"Real review: 7.5/10From the onset of A Star is Born, I knew I was in for quite a ride. That opening scene was AMAZING. Bringing an incredible blues heavy guitar riff to the silver screen in surround sound with the crowd going wild was absolutely what I needed to see. I felt like I was there and Bradley Cooper was beyond impressive.I thought A Star is Born was a great movie. Slow at parts? Yes. Some cheesy lines? Absolutely. But, I was so entranced by Bradley Cooper's character and how believable he was, that I sort of forgot I was watching a movie at times. He was that good in this. And, Lady Gaga was pretty damn good too for her first ever acting role. And her singing? It's out of this world. Her voice gave me chills throughout the movie, especially the song she sings at the end of the film.The movie had a lot of hype but overall, I thought it was a great movie. It was an experience. From the incredible music to the love story to the battles with fame, self-identity and addiction, Bradley Cooper nailed his directorial debut and I'm excited to see him do another one.

Just didn't resonate,"This is a bit of a rant, I'll go ahead and apologize ahead of time. I'm watching an old 80's flick about a form of dancing, (came out in '84, figure it out) and while this wasn't what would be considered a great movie, boy, was it memorable. Because it had moments in it that you'll always remember, and I know it wasn't just me because I've read reviews here that have said the same thing. My point is, while many older movies didn't have the greatest or most believable plot, they were ENTERTAINING. They made memories with you. They found a way to tug on your heartstrings somehow. Many of these movies made in the last 10 years or so, they just can't pull that off. No matter how great the editing, cinematography, lighting, WHATEVER. And this is coming from someone who worked in that world and has a ton of respect for it, so I'm not bashing what Hollywood is about. I'm just bashing the level of quality it has fallen to.This movie was just a snoozer. Made me appreciate La La Land that much more. Whatever made that movie click, this movie didn't have it.

Great acting but ultimately plot is just too predictable,"A Star is Born (the second remake of the 1954 musical) is an OK movie experience but ultimately has too many of the plot clichés you seen in this type of movies throug the years.Without spoiling it - the successful musician that takes a younger, talented female singer under her wing and then they have a romantic relationship is essentially the plot of A Star is Born and it doesn't sound familiar only because it is a remake, it sounds familiar but it has been rehashed many times before...Still, the movie stands out versus most movies with the same story mainly becauseThe songs are good. Bradley Cooper's character reminds me almost of Eddie Vedder (obviously with due differences) and the songs played by Lady Gaga's character were a huge commercial successBut more importantly, the acting. Bradley Cooper pulls off a hell of a role, as a very believable emotionally damaged singer. Including over a year of a vocal training for the singing parts.

Alright,"Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga were fantastic in the film. Cooper showing the struggles of substance abuse while Gaga blesses us with her exquisite voice and performance shines of the girl with dreams of being a singer. Both Gaga and Cooper really outdid themselves and showed true raw emotion throughout the film. While their performances were indeed incredible, I felt the overall script was somewhat mediocre. The first half covering Ally's success was rushed and didn't show a clear insight of the the star (Ally) being born and rising to the top of stardom. The second half was extremely slow. Some scenes being extremely hard to follow and simply not necessary for the plot. In terms of cinematography, I felt there wasn't enough use of technique and could easily turn a simple scene into something more special. I feel because of Lady Gaga's name being attached to the film and it being her first big motion picture, the film was overhyped and praised more than it would have been have it had been a more commonly known actor portraying Ally instead. Overall, I would say I was pleased with the film. Not blown away but not completely disappointed.

Maybe the Best of the Four Versions,"When Streisand made A Star is Born (1976), she was already a star. So was Judy Garland (1954) in the earlier and second version.

Streisand and Garland crossed generational boundaries in a way that Lady Gaga has only begun to do (with her Academy Award night tribute to Julie Andrews).Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. Who would have come up with this cast? Cooper directed and he and Gaga wrote some of the songs. I have not mentioned the first version (1937) with this title because Janet Gaynor and Adolphe Menjou played actors, not singers.You should cry. Really. It is that good of a movie.

I was on edge for most of the day and cried myself to sleep.This is also not a good movie if you're dealing with depression or have suicidal thoughts.

2018 Must See,"Bradley Cooper does a very good job both as director and actor, but frankly that's no surprise. A really big surprise was his singing, for someone who is not a professional and had never performed live, he did pretty great ( and by that I mean he managed to hold his own against a powerhouse voice). As for Lady Gaga, well, I really don't know what to say. I admit I'm a bit of a fan of her, but when she shocks me with a hell of a performance like that and delivers some of the best live vocals of her career ( I really consider her voice to be one of the most charming and powerful ) there's not much I can say except for ""WOW!"".

Great performances but nothing new to add -,"I wish this had been the same stars Bradley Cooper and Lady GaGa in a different movie because they both are incredibly talented and are great together and yes the chemistry is there but this fourth remake (two to many) of a Star Is Born as far as I'm concerned has nothing more to add to the story of successful star meets and falls for struggling singer who's career eventually eclipses his and his addiction extinguishers his star forever.
I don't usually give spoilers but this scenario has been done before and better. Saying that ,if this is your first Star is Born you'll love it I'm sure.
I didn't like Streisand's and Kristofferson's version much either in 1976 and I'm still of the opinion that Judy Garland's 1954 A Star is Born is the best .
I can understand why new generations of movie stars are attracted to the story and want to put their own stamp on it but it's not Shakespeare and it has become a little cliched to say the least when you know the entire plot in advance and nothing new except new faces foul language and pop music are added to the same story written in 1936.
I noticed Barbra Streisand's one time boyfriend and producer of her version of this story , the very controversial Jon Peters ( they call him the Trump of Hollywood) is a producer of this latest version and remember some critics cruelly said his and Streisand's version should have been retitled A Star is Still Born .
In my humble opinion this 2018 version is as good as the 1976 version and it didn't come alive for me either and Streisand is one of my favourite stars.
Some good songs lifted it for me , especially Lady Ga Ga who is a true superstar and wrote some of her songs ( so did Streisand and won an Academy Award for Evergreen )
Ga Ga has a great voice range , like Barbra Streisand and they admire each other's talent.
Lady Ga Ga's little tribute to Judy Garland early in the film singing the introduction to Somewhere Over the Rainbow,which Judy never sang herself wasn't lost on me .
Bradley Cooper has a very good voice plus gives a great performance but I just wish that I had seen them in a new original story , I'd love to see Ga Ga in a film with a terrific new script telling the amazing story of Amy Winehouse , almost a reverse role for her to this film. Amy Winehouse was another incredible talent lost to the world in her prime due to addiction.

Overrated but decent,"This is a little overrated. Just because a movie jerks a few tears doesn't mean it's anything great. Many average films have evoked sadness, but that doesn't mean they are special. While the end was much better than what came before it, it didn't elevate it enough to raise the overall rating. I had mixed feelings about the movie:The Good- Pretty good pace (if you're not into love stories or musical type movies, it's not that hard to sit through due to the decent edits and cuts) although at times I uncharacteristically could have used longer scenes at times, by the end of the movie you have to give credit to Cooper as the director (I didn't realize he directed it as I was watching), Lady Gaga's voice is an asset to the movie, and it does evoke emotion at times.The Bad- It misses on some notes, especially early on how the formation of the relationship feels rushed and almost not believable in a way, despite some aspects of charm which were decent (the scene where Gaga hits the guy at the bar wasn't buyable and isn't that assault), unfortunately even though I appreciate actors taking risks, it's a little bit masturbatory throughout the first quarter of it with regards to Hollywood stars celebrating themselves, I thought Cooper overacted just a little bit in this with his voice that reminded me of what Tom Hardy does and despite it I never saw anybody but Cooper in the role (in other words, the staple of a great acting performance is you don't even recognize the actor anymore but even with the voice focus, it didn't make me see Cooper any less than ever), it is comparable to a long music video at many times (but it's a movie), and it was somewhat superficial at times when it could have used more depth to increase the quality (for example, the way her career was able to develop and take off was done well enough to make you invested in it, but at the same time it happened so fast and what seemed like somewhat easily, which is hard to believe with the difficulty of that industry, so by the time the final quarter of the movie arrived, I didn't feel as much as I should have felt for Ally's journey).On an end note, the film does have charm and Cooper's character's story was poignant and lead to a place that had some power. While the movie is overrated, it's not bad at all and is slightly above average. I would recommend a watch, but don't expect anything super sensational or an elite classic or anything that you would want to watch again or over and over. ""Walk the Line"" is a similar movie that is probably a little bit better than this one is overall.6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Too Cautionary,"Let me preface this by stating that I was really excited to see this film. I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper and was stoked after seeing the trailer. The casting of Lady Gaga intrigued me, and I wondered if they could pull of what 8 Mile had accomplished. To my disappointment, they could not.The film certainly had some brilliant moments. Bradley Cooper was phenomenal, as expected, and I thoroughly enjoyed a couple of their duets. I even cried a few times at the Cooper's depiction of the broken troubadour. But the film never closed the sale that they spent over two and a half hours pitching me.In the end, there were just too many cliches. While I admire their attempt to go big with the story, it came off less Crazy Heart and more cautionary tale, brought to you by Live Nation. I couldn't help myself considering the irony that the industry this film is warning us about is the one that was selling us this film.I wish they would've let the film be smaller.

A must watch.,"Remakes, reboots, re-imaginings, modern updates - whatever you want to call them, they've been around almost as early as movies themselves. In the last couple of decades they've attracted a bad reputation due to an increasing over-reliance by studios on letting brand recognition do the heavy lifting, quality be damned. Retelling this old-age tale for a new audience, first-time director Bradley Cooper has hit a home run. This is no thoughtless cash-in for the twitter generation. This is good ol' fashioned storytelling with intelligence and maturity. Cooper plays Jackson Maine, a country-rock megastar with a drinking problem from hell. Sparks fly when he meets Ally (Lady Gaga), an inspiring singer who hasn't been able to catch a break. We already know Cooper is an extremely versatile and engaging actor (who's a bloody decent singer as it turns out), but Lady Gaga, in her first notable acting role not playing a version of her on-stage persona, is an absolute revelation here. Stripped of all the flare and over-the-top theatricality associated with her musical career, Gaga delivers a tour-de-force performance of raw emotion and soul-bearing, more than holding her own opposite experienced actors like Cooper and Sam Elliot (always gripping). Ambitiously shot in close-ups with a roaming camera, the concert sequences are suitably amazing. Ally's impromptu duet with Jackson in front of tens of thousands of fans is a contender for most powerful scene of the year. At times the drama veers into melodrama (perhaps even intentionally, this is a modern day rags-to-riches yarn after all), but there's so much goodwill generated throughout that those moments of heavy-handedness can easily be embraced. Knockout performances, a compelling story and a great soundtrack combine to make A Star is Born a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
about what I expected: mostly good with overwrought stuff,"So the fourth incarnation of ""A Star Is Born"" is here, this time featuring Bradley Cooper (also the director) as the burnout star and Lady Gaga as the aspiring star whom he marries. The role of the aspiring singer was practically made for Gaga. This version is grittier than the previous ones, giving it a more realistic flavor.The obvious downside is that the movie comes across as a star vehicle for Lady Gaga (much like the 1976 version did for Barbra Streisand), and a lot of the tension between the characters seems overplayed. Even so, I found the music quite impressive, and the cast members all turned in fine performances. So, I recommend it, even though I consider the 1937 version the best of the four.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga have the most authentic chemistry I may have ever seen on film, or perhaps even off.

A great directorial debut for Bradley Cooper,"Bradley Cooper does a fantastic job as a first time director - the scenes are beautifully shot and the way the atmosphere is built around them, largely through sound, is very strong. Lady Gaga similarly shines in her first role as lead actor. She, of course, showcases her fantastic singing voice but also portrays her relationship with Bradley Cooper's character incredibly well.The music in the film is great throughout and, while this may come as no shock given that Lady Gaga is a seasoned musical professional, it is a pleasant surprise to see that Bradley Cooper, who reportedly took 18 months of vocal training prior to this role, really committed to the role and sang his songs himself. It must be said that he doesn't sound half bad either!The film itself explores a lot of the big issues that those in stardom, especially the music industry, often suffer from. It's sad to see that these problems have persisted through the ages as one can easily draw comparisons with modern day artists. The original film was made just over 80 years ago yet the issues presented in this remake have stayed prevalent throughout the decades.

"Apparently serious, actually glib approach to serious subject. Lady Gaga steals show","Bradley Cooper took on the tough task of directing, singing and acting in, the latest version of A STAR IS BORN. To be honest, I have never found this story particularly interesting, and in fact I suspect that the 1954 version with James Mason and Judy Garland borrowed quite a bit from Charlie Chaplin's LIMELIGHT (US 1952), and the 1976 version, with Streisand and Kristoferson was a mishmash that relied solely on starpower and deservedly bombed with critics and box office alike.And now, this third version which I do not find any better than its predecessors. Lady Gaga singlehandedly keeps the film interesting. Her unusual beauty and wonderful voice kept me wanting to see her, eagerly waiting for her to come back on screen.Sadly, the character who plays her father comes across as very uneven, unintentionally funny, and it is hard to decide whether he is just greedy, or a liar, or both... and at one point he seems willing to beat the stools out of Maine but, before you know it, he is conveniently doing something else.
Bradley Cooper took on too much: he should have directed only. Although be begins well enough. he is far too long on screen, giving the impression that he cannot have enough of himself.Ally's manager is also played by a completely unremarkable actor.To make matters worse, Jackson Maine, the character he depicts, is a drug addict and an alcoholic who feels continually and annoyingly sorry for himself. In the end, his decision to cop out of life makes him a real loser.I do not know if Cooper sings his songs in the movie. If so, perhaps he should have sung only, because his voice is quite pleasant.Photography is generally very good, the second saving grace after Lady Gaga, and dialogue is rather patchy.Even after he has died in script, Cooper does not go away. At the slightest opportunity, everybody remembers and cries over him. It must have been tough for Cooper to get rid of himself - which is a pity because this film could have done with about 20 minutes less (overall) and 30 minutes removed from Cooper's performance would have hurt none at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

4th incarnation,"And for its fourth incarnation unless you count What Price Hollywood, the story
of A Star Is Born is getting its fourth remake. Back in the 70s when it was made
for a third time by Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson the setting was changed from the motion picture industry to the music industry.It remains so in this film which stars Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. Cooper is
a country/western singer who is starting the downside of his career and he
meets a young aspiring performer Lady Gaga who works in a hotel restaurant
and has just about given up her aspirations for a singing career. But when
Cooper and his entourage hear her she becomes a project for him.If you've seen any or all of the other A Star Is Borns than you'll know some of
the key scenes already. The plot follows the same path it did with the other
three versions.The beauty of this and the other films is that the story and the performances
in all of them are so good that even if you have seen the other versions the
film still grabs you. If you haven't seen other versions so much the better.Lady Gaga was hired as a singer primarily, but she does show enough acting
chops to warrant a nomination for Best Actress, matched by Cooper for Best
Actor and Sam Elliott as Cooper's manager for Best Supporting Actor. A Star
Is Born also was nominated for Best Picture and a flock of other nominations
as well. It won for the original song Shallow.I doubt this will be the last remake, but it will do well until another in the
next 10 to 40 years comes along.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Overwhelming, will see it again before it leaves theatre","Our movie plans for this weekend was to see another concert/musical movie that has just opened in the theaters, Bohemian Rhapsody. We grew up in that age of music and Queen was and still is one of my most favorite bands. Seeing as though movies come and go very quickly, we decided on A Star Is Born instead. Never being a real fan of Lady GaGa, but appreciating her voice, and my wife adoring Bradley Cooper, I knew this was the correct choice as soon as Cooper started singing. Lady GaGa's singing as to be expected was exquisite, but her acting was totally unexpected, it is deserved of an Oscar nod. The acting between the two was so natural. Bradley Cooper's singing was unreal. I forget the previous renditions of this movie, and that's OK. I have read everything there is to read on IMDB and any other source in order to soak up the artistry of this movie. I will see it again, this time at a theatre with an enhanced sound system, get the soundtrack and of course the DVD when it comes out. I usually don't rate movies 10. Eight or nine are my highest ratings, after all, what really rates a 10? A Star Is Born does.

Shining Stars,"Life has a funny way of making things happen. Such is the case with movies I was convinced I would never see. I was once convinced A Star is Born 2018 would be that instance. Firstly, I never saw the original 1930's classic and the two remakes that followed afterwards. Secondly, when the trailer surfaced, it reeked of Hollywood self-aggrandizement and schmaltz. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a musical romantic romp. Look at how beautiful they are compared to us slobs! Cinema lovers are sick of this game. They want something new. So imagine my surprise that the reviews turned up well above the 90% fresh rating on RT. Some of the most trusted names in the business even hailed it as one of the year's best. Could it be that Hollywood has found a way to make tired formulas relevant and exciting again? After all, I am many things, but a betting man I am not. I like to admit when I'm wrong. Cooper and Co. brought me into the reclining seats last night. Kudos to him for that.A Star is Born is, above all else, an aesthetically pleasing motion picture. It's shiny and beautiful without purposely doing so. It's sweet and sentimental without being condescending. It's sad, without becoming sappy. It was everything it needed to be to work, and It's a great thing that it does work. Bradley Cooper is a natural charm and practically loses himself as country music icon Jackson Maine. A fine study in method acting. I'm pleased to tell you that beyond looking like Cooper (at least after not shaving for a month), he's the farthest thing from a role we would expect to see him in. Jackson is a demon riddled, suffering alcoholic and we believe him. His muse, Ally, the Star of the picture is played by Lady Gaga herself. Or perhaps, we ought to refer to her in respect to her true person, Stafani Germanotta. A Star is truly Born as a pop superstar is taken apart from her wacky costumes, and returning to her roots as your average, beautiful Italian-American girl trying all she can to make it by and hopefully make it big. She is a dream come true and the precise reason to see this thing if you want to. To the unassuming eye, you couldn't tell that this is a role tailor made for Mama Monster. Does she properly fill the shoes of Streisand and Garland? You know, I think she does and I think she can be as big as the two of them put together.But granted these two very positive things, I wasn't knocked out of my socks at any given point of the film. It's beyond anything remotely grueling about a superstar celebrity vehicle, but don't expect a life-changing experience that leaves you talking about it for days after. This is just a satisfying, if not unforgettable, musical journey.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

good update on the classic story,"I enjoyed the movie as well, its a nice update on the old story as i love the Judy Garland one. Story is depressing as ever, maybe more. I wish it would have been a more pointed attack on pop music as a whole, as it is hinted at but not really fully destroyed (i guess with Lady Gaga as lead the movie can only go so far.) I thought Cooper was amazing as an actor, and pretty much nailed the self-destructive alcoholic musician persona. Gaga held her own, though she was a little stiff in some scenes and im not quite as in love with her as some people are. Ending seemed sort of rushed, but i loved Sam Elliot. in all, worth a trip to the theater just prepare your self for some emotional trauma. 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Lady Gaga Steals the Stage,"A modern remake of a timeless classic tale, Bradley Cooper's ambitious project in his directorial debut will be and should be heralded as nothing less than a masterpiece. The writing, the directing, the acting and above all the singing were spot on. Who would have thought Bradley Cooper could sing and, even more pleasantly surprising, that Lady Gaga could act. At the minimum Cooper deserved nomination for acting and directing and to date Gaga deserves the Oscar for Best Actress. Personally I think Cooper also deserves the Oscar for best director.One of the best movies of 2018!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Star Is Born: Compelling and Insightful,"I'm not going to lie; I came in to this with a bad attitude not knowing really what to expect. Is it going to be a ""chick flick"", a Bradley Cooper drool session for the 18-35 female demographic, or just a garden variety love story mixed in with musical elements?It was neither of the above; this movie both defied and exceeded expectations.The strongest element by far was the plot. Being Bradley Cooper's directing debut, he did a very good job of sticking to the basic elements: the introduction, the rising action, the falling action, the rock bottom, and the conclusion all in three acts. The story was capable of standing on it's own and immersing an entire audience with an incredibly real and compelling timeline of trials and tribulations. Each transition from one part to the next was made with the masterful effect of building anticipation, leaving us wondering what was in store for us next. It did the job of carrying the audience through a 2 hour, 10 minute roller coaster.The acting on it's own was top notch as it featured a few heavy-hitters such as Cooper, himself and a strong supporting cast featuring Sam Elliot and Dave Chappelle. Though the choice in casting Lady Gaga begs a question: was this role made for her or was the script written for a generic female lead for which she just so happened to fit the bill? Either way, Lady Gaga's breakthrough acting performance hit the mark; it wasn't bad, but there didn't really seem to be that much room to see if she had gumption for acting.By and far, the weakest element was the character development. I get it, there was a lot of story that had to be told and only so much film in which to do it. However, I feel that a little more investment in character development would have allowed the audience to feel much more of an emotional impact for our two leads as they just so happen to find each other and later face adversity as a duo.Overall, I say that this film is above average. Many moviegoers will come with the expectation of an incredibly strong soundtrack and name recognition. Where Lady Gaga's acting hit par, she made up with her voice. However, they will not only stay, but glue themselves to their seats for the storytelling. I don't see this film being at a competitive, ""award-winning"" level, but it is one of a handful must-see movies of 2018.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Do you think professional critics get backhanders? Possibly, lol.","Cooper's painfully earnest depiction of a (very unlikeable and greasy-haired) addict is far too heavy for this frothy material. As one reviewer said, more 'A Star Goes Out' than 'A Star Is Born'. At least the self-indulgent focus on him spares us much of Gaga's precariously near-wooden acting. If Cooper was insistent on giving it the heavy-handed treatment he should have had the character's addiction stem from the pressures of fame and not from his family background. The resulting premise makes the music industry setting redundant. Subsequently, there is no palpable reason for tension between the leads, which makes for a very lacklustre experience. This might have been saved by a crackle of sexual chemistry but there is none. Cooper looks good without his shirt on but so what? Nobody wants to stare at those two weird faces for two and half hours. Some of the gruff-voiced dialogue is embarrassing (Sam Elliott, anyone?). Following in the unfortunate footsteps of 'Mother!' and 'Hereditary', it's unintentionally funny in parts and boring in others. The songs aren't bad but they're not in the same league as those from the 1976 version. Gaga's performance on the stage is, of course, good but not that good. She screeches out the songs from the beginning and consequently has nowhere to go for the denouement. Let's face it, she has about a quarter of Streisand's talent and none of the charisma. I can see the effort, but mediocre results. Next!",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Music fueled drama, that excels at its integrity","I went to this movie with very little background knowledge on the story and/or most of the actors. I had heard of Lady Gaga, but since I hardly listen to radio I was unaware what she sounded like. As far as Cooper goes, I might have seen one movie with him and that was it. Still the trailer looked good, Lukas Nelson (yes son of) helped to write the music, and all time favorite Sam Elliott played a part in it. Reason enough to go check it out, and I wasn't disappointed.The story line is very well executed, and although based on the original and its remake, there were plenty of unique touches, making this story stand out from the others. Script wise we see a well balanced movie that alternates between music, dialogue, and that was is left unsaid. It is hard to believe this is Cooper's writing and directing debut, and he should be given high praise for doing an excellent job.Being a story about two singers, this movie wouldn't be much without its music. Of course music is always a matter of taste, and whether or not it's to someone's liking comes down to personal preference. That said, the music does have a high standard of quality which I like. Not all songs met my personal preference, but the three main songs did. Reading an interview after seeing the movie, I was mind blown to learn Cooper had learned to sing and play the guitar from scratch for this movie. Now that's what I call dedication.The last part of this review leaves me with the acting. To my surprise Gaga turns out to be an excellent actor, that plays her part convincing yet seemingly effortless. The same can be said for Cooper, who transitions between being a jerk and being extremely vulnerable in moments. Although the two leads know how to put down a strong and realistic character, the real surprise in this movie is Elliott. It's said that some things get better with age, this definitely goes for the actor who is in his 70's by now. In the role of Cooper's big brother he plays the emotionally charged scenes with a heartbreaking conviction. I'm not exaggerating when I say I saw over half the visitors leave the cinema that day with red eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

It's clever and intriguing. I find this film a powerful experience.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Great renewed old story.,"There's already too many reviews on this film so I'm going to keep this short. A Star is Born 2018 version is perhaps the most popular of them all, because it represents our current times, while still respecting previous versions. It doesn't mean it's better, but it is still a fine effort. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's chemistry is undeniable, so much that it even trascended the screen. Their musical performances are quite good, although nothing really spectacular, but I must say I was truly impressed with 'Shallow' and 'I'll Never Love Again', two great songs that will be remembered for years to come.If you haven't seen it, break yourself free from all you read about this film and just experience it for yourself.

6 Stars for great performances and music but the tempo is just too slow,"""A Star is Born"" has been done now with a big budget production over the years since William Wellman's 1937 version a total of four times. And each version over the years is worse than the one before. Except for the fact that Bradley Cooper's version is better than the 1976 Barbara Streisand version, the pattern continues. To compare the Cooper's 2018 version to Wellman's movie staring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March is unfair. And to compare it to George Cukor's ""Star is Born"" starring Judy Garland and James Mason is again too much to ask. With this being said Cooper did a good job directing Lady Gaga. He also brought a performance that might be one of his best in his career. However the movie drags on too long as the editing could have helped keep the scenes shorter and sharper. Although we might not have had the performances, we would have been able to watch it from beginning to the end without having moments of losing interest.
The performances of Lady Gaga, who won an Oscar for her performance, and Cooper are not the only reasons to watch this film, Sam Elliott is another reason to check this movie out if you haven't already as he is excellent as the older brother to Cooper's character. Finally the music in this film brings up the level of its rating. Lady Gaga shares the Oscar for Best Original Song, ""Shallow.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A refreshing musical and melodrama,"The fourth remake of the 1936 classic with the same title, ""A Star Is Born"" is a refreshing musical, that has won a tonnes of accolades lately including its inclusion in one of the highest grossing movies of all time and the critics' favorites of all time. Those high on emotions and melodramas will definitely opt for it. But more than the drama or the story, what matters most in this musical are its fabulous songs and tremendous performances of Brad Cooper, Lady Gaga, and Sam Elliot, all worthy of the Oscar nominations they were merited with. The screen songs shared by Lady Gaga and Brad Cooper are not to be missed.Undoubtedly the film feels refreshing for the treatment it receives and is technically flawless. The beats have the right touch and characters get into the skin. But there are flaws which bar me to keep it into a classic of recent times. First of all, the film somehow lacks the engaging attribute and overall, the film packs all what we have seen before. Overall, it deserves a watch and attributes the singing and acting talent of Lady Gaga along Brad Cooper, who sets his acting talent following ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Sniper""Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
These 10 ratings are BOGUS,"As a huge fan of Lady Gaga, I must admit that I thought she was dreadful. I don't recall an actress that tried so hard to be natural that it came off totally fake and forced.

This film besides the large budget .In short GaGa cannot play Vulnerable and Naive. Besides chewing scenery she looks like she could chew Bradley.
 had the worst costume design work recently in any film large budget or small. Bradley Cooper certainly has no eye for design. As for the film generally speaking it was paint by the numbers.The first bar scene where Gaga sings, it is mentioned that they do this Drag thing once a week.Moments later we have a Drag Queen say Something to the effect that she does not want to lose her alcohol license. This is not a gay bar. It is a straight bar that has Female impersonators once a week. There was not one original moment in this ASIB. For a women like Ally who claims to be insecure performs diva like from the start singing La Ve en Rose. Then we have Boring Montage's and flashbacks that did nothing. Where this film really fell apart was in the SNL number. It was quite possibly the worst musical Number in a film ever. I should have seen Venom with a real talented actor.

Another star is born,"This is the fourth version of A Star is Born. It is an adult orientated blue collar musical drama.Lady Gaga plays Ally, a waitress who sings part time in a drag bar. She writes her own songs but realises she will never get that big break because of her looks, especially a prominent nose.One night country rocker Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) walks in looking for a drink after a concert. Maine is still famous touring with his past hits.Maine is enchanted by Ally. He invites her to see him in concert where he asks her to sing one of her songs with him onstage that goes viral. They have a whirlwind romance which perks up Maine's life.For Ally, the future is bright as she is pursued by record executives. For Maine, it is a life of booze, drugs and tinnitus.As Ally achieves success, Maine's life spirals downwards. It is a question of whether Maine is hindering Ally's success with the drugs and booze.Cooper stars, directs, produces, sings and co-wrote the screenplay. For him it is a labour of love.What caught my attention was that it was a working class drama. The film does not show the glamorous side of LA. It is a blue collar look of Ally's life and family.Even Maine lives a humdrum life. Probably why he need drugs and booze to keep him going.The romance might had been a bit too quick but it needed to be make the film tick. It is overlong and some of the songs are not that memorable. Lady Gaga gives a good performance but she is not stretched by playing a singer. Although it is interesting to see her face without her normal heavy makeup. It is also brave for her to show some nudity even a glimpse of going full frontal.The film is muddled regarding Maine's backstory, his relationship with his much older brother and some of the dialogue was muffled.

Powerfully-acted and moves you to the core,"It is hard to believe that this is Cooper's directorial debut, especially with the way he directed himself in such an empathetic character as rock star Jackson Maine. Even though Jack's addiction is affecting everyone around him, you could not resist but still care for his character. On the other hand, a movie star is literally born with Lady Gaga as Ally. Although her character was relatively underwritten compared to Jack, Gaga does the most of the character's rawness and authenticity. Gaga transcends the most in her musical numbers, specifically in ""I'll Never Love Again.""Cooper and Gaga's chemistry in this film is the most genuine I've seen in a romantic movie in a while. Their relationship felt so intimate and deep that I felt like I was intruding in their personal space. The supporting cast shines as well, with comedians Dave Chapelle and Andrew Dice Clay providing an effective dramatic turn, and Sam Elliott's poignant performance proving to be so impactful given the limited screen time he got.Cinematographer Matthew Libatique used a striking, saturated colors in a variety of shots, and his unique choice of filming the dialogues and musical scenes close to the actors situated the viewers in that same spot where the actor is. The music narrates the story of the characters well, and the songs hark back to 1990s Hollywood when ballads elevated the film. The songs in ""A Star Is Born"" are ready to be considered as classics.The pacing and writing issues sometimes made the film feel both too long and too rushed. That said, this is a screenplay that almost avoids every cliché in this story. Even if this is a story that was told a number of times, Cooper managed to give a fresh and effective take on it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"A realistic, devastating, beautiful, superb, and memorable musical masterpiece that surpasses the remakes and the original, and serves as a contemporary modern classic","Without any further doubt, Bradley Cooper truly delivers a topnotch, riveting, and outstanding directorial debut and performance that clearly speaks of magnificence and greatness. Despite the fact that A Star is Born has been retold several times in its iteration from 1937, 1954, and 1976, the excellent screenplay and direction clearly shows an effective and superb storytelling that can make an devastating and powerful impact while making itself as fresh as its own that serves as a contemporary modern musical classic for the modern generation. Even its depiction of depression, addiction, mental issues as well fame are well accurately portrayed. Clearly, this film blends well with emotion, love, inspiration and sensibilities.Lady Gaga is also incredibly remarkable within this film. Her knockout acting performance clearly blew anyone's minds and with her fantastic singing voice, elevates the great quality of the film. Sam Elliott has also given a memorable and exceptional performance. Even the chemistry of Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are really off the charts and skyrocketed into a spectacular and amazing experience.Another remarkable qualities that the film presented with is the realistic and colorful cinematography and masterful editing but what truly shines above it all is the music and the songs as it's considered as the heart and soul of the film.This is definitely of the year's best film and will be worth remembered as a memorable musical masterpiece that will be a part of the classical musicals such as La La Land, Moulin Rouge!, and etc.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Worth watching,"Lady Gaga is no Barbra Streisand and Bradley Cooper no Kris Kristofferson but they make a good stab at this. Well paced and well acted. Musically not up to the previous version and I can't help feeling Ally's character sold out too much to the demands of modern, manufactured pop music, in a way her character wouldn't have, which weakened the film for me. Hopefully the next remake will have the best of all the previous films and we'll see a perfect version. But this one is certainly worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Give bradley cooper an oscar,"I guess in this movie you can see how multi-talented bradley is, to direct such a movie with these much emotions that you can definitely feel and get touched by is not an easy thing. 
Another thing to notice is LADY GAGA ladies and gentlemen, she is a beast! An unbelievable acting performance, you can feel that there's a massive acting talent had exploded from inside of her, besides her marvelous voice that had blessed everyone listening to her music in the movie.

Good enough,"A seasoned alcoholic rock/country star called Jackson Maine meets and falls for a young aspiring singer called Ally. Ally has always been told that she has a great singing voice, but her looks have prevented her from becoming a star. Maine gives her that opportunity to show the world what she can do; and after some initial nerves, it's an opportunity that she grabs with both hands. As her career progresses however, Maine's begins to decline; which, along with his personal demons, places a strain on the couple's relationship.The character of Jackson Maine is very well developed, as well as the love and jealousy aspects, that makes up the main plot. We also discover that the character has hearing problems, as well as an unusual and difficult upbringing. When all put together we can see why Maine is so self-destructive. The acting, singing and even look of Cooper was extraordinary. Lady Gaga is a good choice to co-lead this movie. She was so natural, both visually and emotionally. Elliott is also fantastic in this movie. His character's relationship with his brother has an underlying stormy nature. There's clearly love and respect for each other, but events from their past have a strong influence over that relationship. Obviously two of the major themes of A Star is Born are music and romance. As far as the romance is concerned I thought the on screen chemistry between Cooper and Lady Gaga was great. It was sweet when it had to be, it was passionate when it had to be and it was so well performed. I was convinced by them as a couple.
As for the music, the soundtrack is terrific, I believe one won an Oscar, so good for them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Good and nice,"A Star Is Born (2018) is a heartfelt and engaging film that earns a 7/10 for its strong yet somewhat flawed presentation. Bradley Cooper delivers a compelling performance as Jackson Maine, and Lady Gaga shines as Ally, bringing authenticity and emotional depth to her role. The cinematography effectively captures the intimate moments of the characters and the grandeur of their performances. The story, while moving and well-executed, occasionally follows familiar tropes and lacks some narrative originality. The soundtrack is a standout, with powerful and memorable songs that enhance the film's emotional resonance. Despite its strong elements, the film's predictability and pacing issues prevent it from achieving its full potential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Fantastic Directional Debut from Bradley Cooper,"I'm beyond impressed that the man who starred in The Hangover over a decade ago is the same man who directed & starred in this fantastic film. Bradley Cooper did an amazing job directing this film, he & Lady Gaga both give Oscar worthy performances. The film is cliche in many respects but what keeps the film unique & engaging is their performances, Cooper's direction, and the stellar writing which Cooper also had a hand in doing. Watching this makes me excited to see more films directed by Bradley Cooper, he's going to have a great future as a director. The film is long but never to the point it feels like it drags, the film does a terrific job with the pacing and structure. The music is actually very impressive as well, apparently all the songs in the film were shot & recorded live which makes the experience all the more mesmerizing. Lady Gaga does a great job with this role, this is obviously a role catered to her abilities just like Eminem in 8 Mile but she does an astonishing job, to the point I forgot I was even watching Lady Gaga. I know the film will get nominated in several categories at the Oscars, everyone will remember this film for Lady Gaga's performance but for me this film will be remembered as the year a great director was born.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Remake not Rebirth,"I remember the 1976 version of this story, starring Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, and this version, though the background setting and music is updated, feels very much like a retelling, rather than adding any extra dimension. Even Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are made to look remarkably similar to the Kristofferson and Streisand of that era. The novelty factor is the casting of Ms Gaga for the role; she is competent, though hardly exceptional in her performance. As we plough through another mid-paced country rock ballad, one can't help feeling that her own stage persona and back catalogue are actually a lot more interesting than the character in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Cinematic Echoes: A Familiar Tune in a New Arrangement,"In the ever-evolving world of cinema, certain narratives seem to find a way to resurrect themselves time and again, much like a phoenix rising from the ashes. This brings us to the 2018 rendition of A Star is Born, a film that inherently echoes the timeless adage: ""a star has to die for a star to be born."" With its fourth incarnation gracing the silver screen, Bradley Cooper's directorial debut brings a new spin to this old tale. While the movie emerges as a decent production, it can't quite shake off the lingering sensation of cinematic déjà vu.The core of the narrative remains a poignant and heartrending exploration of love, ambition, and the toll that fame exacts on the human spirit. Cooper adeptly steps into the shoes of Jack Maine, a seasoned musician wrestling with personal demons, whose fateful encounter with Ally, portrayed with gusto by Lady Gaga, acts as a catalyst for both their lives. Their magnetic chemistry and palpable emotional connection lend authenticity to their tumultuous journey, as fame's spotlight threatens to unravel not only their relationship but also their individual identities. It's in these performances that the movie finds its saving grace, as they breathe life into the all-too-familiar tale.However, despite these commendable performances, it's difficult to ignore the sensation that we've walked this path before. The film's predecessors, dating back to the 1937 original, followed by the 1954 musical and the 1976 rock-centric remake, have left an indelible mark on cinematic history. This 2018 version, while sporting a modern aesthetic and a twang of authenticity in its depiction of the music industry's inner workings, still struggles to break free from the shadows of its past incarnations, diluting the impact of its emotional punches. It's a good endeavor in its own right, but one can't help but wish for a fresh narrative constellation that ventures beyond the well-worn skies of previous versions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Best ""A star is born""","I have seen all the versions, and the direction and music was the best (the musician as opposed to acting ""star"" makes this have more emotion. This was Bradley cooper's best acting and probably directing this enabled his heart to be in this (far more than anything I have seen him in). Lady Gaga is clearly devoted to her craft and takes the film to a higher level.The award scene was a bit too much/ unrealistic but helped get the message across and that might have been Cooper's biggest directing error. But his clarifying Jack's story of being alone and fearful of failure was well done and allowed Jack to be the tragic character that was engrossing (for the viewer and his brother/Lady Gaga's characters)",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Gaga for Gaga?,"I suppose if you live on the moon or are one of those people who's never seen a movie from a previous decade, ""A Star Is Born"" might seem like something special. But for the rest of us, who've had at least three chances to experience this story in the past, the newest version is a pedestrian retread.I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting, except that it was something more than I got given the ravenous audience response to this movie. Everyone is going gaga for Gaga, the Lady that is, and she's pretty good, but I think the praise she's getting is driven more by surprise that she might actually be able to act and less by her actual performance. Cooper is decent too, and they both do have tremendous chemistry, I'll grant them that. The first half hour or so of the film, and especially the scene where Cooper and Gaga perform together for the first time, does promise to be special, and if the whole movie had been like that I could understand the film's reception. But midway through the movie it settles into a dull routine, and the ending, which clearly thought it was going to move me to tears, made me feel nothing at all.In a culture clamoring for more stories about women, and with a female personality as out of the box as lady Gaga to work with, I don't know why this movie decided to be about a white man and his -- let's face it -- not very interesting demons. Ok, so I know why -- Bradley Cooper starred and directed. But how much more interesting the film would have been, and what a greater departure from its previous incarnations, if it had instead been about Gaga's character and her own struggles with stardom. But no -- her working class broad makes the leap to international sensation seemingly without a hitch, and any nuance her character might have had, like some initial worries about losing herself and being true to her art, are quickly ditched by the screenplay so that we can instead focus on Cooper's moping. What we're left with is a dude who's sad because his best years are behind him and a lady who's sad because's he's mean to her in a bathroom once and embarrasses her at the Grammys. Well, let her Grammy be her consolation, and remind me why I'm supposed to care about any of this.Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Could have been so much better - too trite and clichéd,"What's surprising about this second remake of ""A Star Is Born"" is not just the strength of Lady Gaga's performance, but the weakness of Bradley Cooper's.Even if you haven't seen any of the previous versions of this story, you'd be familiar with it: an aging, has-been star locates a young up and comer and gives her their start, ushering them on-stage as they exit stage left.This version makes the has-been not only aging but also drug-and-alcohol addled, which feels like an attempt to side step anything interesting about the other side of fame.You don't need to mess up on drugs and booze to stop being famous. That's what's so cruel about it. Fame is fickle. You can lose the interest of your audience through no real fault of your own. So why was it necessary to make Cooper into a druggie and alcoholic? Did the filmmakers not want to depict what show business really is?Cooper's character is a boring stiff. The movie only comes alive with Gaga. He speaks in a weird low groan which is maybe supposed to sound southern. The movie never, ever convinces you that he is a great artist. Gaga is so dynamic that you wonder why she had to be discovered by a loser like Cooper. It would have been much more believable if the reason why he was an alcoholic and addict was because he knew his music sucked and that he didn't deserve the fame. The movie expects you to take it for granted that he is a big star, but doesn't give you any reason to believe it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I mean Jack goes missing because he gets drunk and then in the next scene Ally is ready to marry him. She obviously was disapproving of his drinking but is ready to marry him even though he is no where near ready to give up the bottle. And the movie doesn't portray her is money hungry and going after him for fame. She wouldn't have married him. And when Jack gets drunk at the Grammy's that would not have happened. Directors or producers would not let an act go on stage completely hammered like that. Neither would have Jack's manager. And I don't buy Jack deciding to off himself when Ally was sticking by him.

"wow, just wow","Two movies about music in the span of a month and both amazing.A star is born is a remake of a remake of a remake of a movie made in 1937 about an actress that rises to fame after meeting an established and out of fame actor who fights with alcoholism, the movies through the remakes that followed changed a bit from actors to singer and actor and eventually two singers which was the 1976 movie with Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson and this new movie is a remake of the 76 film.Here we are introduced to Jackson Maine a famous rock icon that has a lot of demons that haunt him and Ally an amateur singer that Jackson discovers by pure luck.
They hit it off and Ally enters this world of destructive roller coaster that Jackson has while struggling with his addiction problems.This time around too the movie has changed somewhat in comparison to the older movie to reflect the society and time period it is set in better.The sound in this movie is rich and full of life which is good because it is a movie about music and musicians so it needed good sound.
The color pallet used in this movie is warm and vibrant which I loved, the images felt alive and I appreciated that since it is very easy to fall into that simple trap that is if you have a sad story have a blue tint and cold colors and grey etc and if it is a happy comedy make everything bright.
No this movie does not do that, that is not to say it is unrealistic, on the contrary, the colors are very life like not overdone.Bradley Cooper has his directorial debut with this film and I am amazed by how good the work he has done was as a director but that all pales in comparison to his acting in this film.I didn't expect to see amazing performances going in specially considering how old this story is and I already knew it well through the 3 other films and yet I was left speechless by Bradley Cooper!
It was very good to see that Lady GaGa can perform good but I certainly did not expect to see Bradley Cooper shine so bright.
His work was on par with Rami Malek in Bohemian Rhapsody and that makes it interesting to see how the award season plays out this time around.
Bradley Cooper of A Star Is Born is unlike anything you have seen from him, his voice is deeper, his mannerism has changed and he can sing, oh my he can sing so very well I wish he was not an actor and was a singer.
It was crazy to see this actor that I knew so well and loved so much be so different all of a sudden.I have to give props to the costumes department, a lot of a nods to Barbara Streisand's Ester Hoffman character from the 76 film in the clothes chosen for GaGa.
And the makeup did a great work too, I did not even recognise Bradley Cooper at first and I had not even read up on who is in the movie for the leading man so my surprise was even bigger when I realised it was Bradley Cooper.All in all I give this movie a 9 for an amazing well done film with really good acting and music.
Look out Rami, Bradley might end up stealing your thunder!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Rise and fall in all the right places.,"The story is familiar and predictable with the freshness delivered by Bradley Cooper's excellent directing debut and acting, and Lady Gagas second to none vocals along with the comfort she has in her own skin. Granted she's perhaps a little old to actually find herself in the situation she does in the movie and should have been 10 years younger to be doing the moves and songs she does, but she still delivers on every level, in fact on occasion through the movie she appears so natural you'd believe she wasn't acting at all, I did find that sometimes her confidence in front of the camera removed some of the vulnerability that again a younger actress might have delivered. Whilst some of the story does leave the viewer frsutrated it only adds to the rise and fall the 2 leads suffer, this rise and fall is found throughout the whole movie and in the songs, it's delicate and brutal in equal measure. Whilst some of the songs won't be memorable for most, the story and performances will be and I thoroughly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Screaming is/as Singing,"""Scream,"" as an explosively loud voice, is a part of the modern music industry. Just try listen to Lorde, Adele, Gaga. TV Talent Shows also admire the artists whose primary vocal attribute is a powerful vocal range (Kelly Clarkson, David Cook, Tessanne Chin). ""Scream"" was a typical feature of metal culture, but ""A Star is Born"" shows us how new artists can gain fame by ""screaming"" in pop music. The movie plugs in to this idea in several ways. One way is the brilliant casting choice of an artist and her lyrics with a strong voice and the ability to be vocally explosive. Another way is a dramatic line ending metaphorically with ""scream"" as feedback on the tragic events (substance abuse & suicide). From a directorial point, the movie had some dramatic ellipses which are never resolved. Throughout the movie, the sound department perfectly complements the mood and drama of the story. Lady Gaga (Stefani Germanotta) in the role of Ally never transcends her own established persona. She never creates a sovereign, unique character. However, for Bradley Cooper his character portrayal is a real breakout in his career as an actor. He has transformed himself visually on the screen, as well as vocally and psychologically. Cooper expresses this transformation amazingly. It is a great achievement for him. His character, Jack, fantastically portrays the dilemma which comes with fame and the easy access to illegal substances. The way the picture is presented it is difficult to tell whether Jack downfall is the result of his wife's enormous success or of his inability to control his alcoholic and drug excesses. Probably, Cooper's character would rather express a typical infirmity which some talented artist struggled with (Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse and others).",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
It's Great,"There's nothing special about it but there's really nothing wrong with it either. Overall A Star Is Born is a great film and a very nice directorial debut from Bradley Cooper.I basically walked into the theater hoping for some good music and decent film. The music was fantastic and the movie itself was also surprisingly good. Cooper not only does a good job at directing but his singing was certainly a pleasant surprise and as far as acting goes, this could very well be one of his best performances ever. Lady Gaga, as one would expect, absolutely kills all the music performances she does but her acting was also fairly good. What I liked most about it, was how natural it felt.Then I want to briefly touch on the structure of the film because there is a very significant shift in tone about midway. The first half is mostly fun and I couldn't help but smile on multiple occasions. It celebrates the story between the two main characters as well as the music. However, come the second half, the film becomes much more grim and serious. While this is quite cliché, it works and sets the tone for the ending.As I said earlier, there is nothing special about A Star Is Born. It is exactly how you would expect it to be but it manages to do everything well. Strong performances and the brilliant soundtrack are definitely the highlights. Whether or not this will win any Oscars, which is what it's trying to do, remains to be seen, but it is most certainly a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
When you don't know how to end,"Such a good beginning, no I mean it- the first 1 hour was so cool. I was diving deep into the atmosphere. But then things started to get ugly. To begin with the characters, we have two people who doesn't seem to change or develop/or regres for that matter. The male character seems to have more layers but still lacks struggle. The female is so 2 dimensional that she even looks heartless. I'm using strong words here because we never actually see her actively caring about her relationship. All she does is singing.
Other problem is the conflict - by 1:30 I was wondering how they're going to end the movie. Nothing seemed to move into this direction. No problems were solved, nor characters changed. And then 2:00 Tolstoy threw his Anna under the train with no reason to do it other than a need of finale.
Good songs, but far too many far too often.
What I lacked most was connection with the characters, they seemed cold and distant and the only connective tissue were the songs.

Exquisitely acted and directed,"Yes, we all know the story. Yes, it's been done many times before under many names. However, none are as expertly and emotionally performed and directed as this one. Bradley Cooper manages to pull everything the cast has to give out of each and every scene. The actors blend into the characters so seamlessly that you actually begin to wonder if they aren't just playing themselves. Obviously they are not, which is what makes the performances so astounding. It slows down a little in the final third, but I enjoy a movie that isn't afraid to let the story breathe a little. That doesn't feel the need to rush headlong into the inevitable conclusion. While far from a perfect movie, it is the touching an emotional performances from Cooper and Lady Gaga that make the film, and watching him doing an amazing Sam Elliot impression in scenes with Sam Elliot is just glorious. Good thing they play brothers in the film. Add in the excellent music and you have while not the best movie ever, certainly the best of this breed, and a movie that far surpasses any of its predecessors.

Ga Ga Land,"Well, here I am again not getting it. I didn't hate this movie. It was okay. Did I miss something? Yes, Lady Gaga can act. (It is an impressive debut performance.) And Bradley Cooper can sing. But is there anything 'oscar' worthy in this film? I went through this same problem with 'La La Land'. I guess I just don't like musicals. I found the music to be innocuous, Bradley Cooper's voice annoying and Sam Elliott as ""big brother"" too much of a stretch for me. I liked the dog though. Not to mention that this premise has been done and done to death at least five times. (And they weren't very good pictures either.) And like 'La La Land' I felt that all the hype about the movie was a bit manufactured. And another thing, didn't people get tired of Cooper's character ""mansplaining"" everything to Ga Ga's character? I thought it was 2018? Look, I didn't love 'Black Panther' either.

A ONE STAR IS BORN !,"This film has little emotional feel to it. You would get more emotion from an episode of hollyoaks. Lady Gaga is pretty good in the lead role but Bradley Cooper is quite frankly a poor acrtor who has only made it because of his looks. He was just not a convincing alcoholic / drug addict. As for his direction, words fail me.

Lady Ga Ga cannot act,"I know she received an Oscar for her performance, but she really can't act.

The story did not accurately depict alcoholism. Any remake should be disqualified for an Oscar.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Bradley Cooper stuns, and that's It.","I give it ip to Gaga for taking on such an ambitious role as a non-actor (apart from her role on AHS, which I feel is more of an extension of some of the caricatures she has created for herself). Unfortunately, when she and Bradley Cooper are together (and of course they have many scenes together), it is obvious who the actor in this duo really is. She has stage presence, which comes through in the film's concert scenes, but otherwise doesn't fit. One can tell that they have genuine chemistry, but that is not enough to fill in the relationship development that should have occurred during the first third of this film. I disagree with the reviewers who have stated that the film runs long. I found that I kept thinking, ""Oh, we're already to this part?"" The relationship is taken for granted with no development whatsoever. Scene 1: They meet. Scene 2: They are already madly in love and on their way. I'm oversimplifying, but the lack of development in this area really took a toll on this film given that the relationship is essentially what the entire story is about. Good directorial debut by Cooper, and he does an amazing job with the role. He makes it look as though he's been singing, songwriting, and rocking the guitar his entire life, not merely just the months before filming. (I want to hear him sing more, in fact, but only if it can be in that gravelly Arizona twang he pulled off so well.)
Still and all, the script is so thin it cannot be overlooked. Sam Elliott raises this to 6 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

As her rise to stardom , riches and fame ,ascends quicker than a rocket, her partner, who discovered her, sinks into and gets destroyed by alcoholism and drug addiction.Bradley Cooper's performance is somewhat annoying because his scruffy, ugly facial hair never changes (he is actually a handsome man dressed up to look like Kris Kristofferson in this movie...ewww ;/), and he often mumbles through his lines. But hey, that's the way substance abusers are.Lady Gaga's timing and expressions, singing are freaking amazing.The motto of this movie is: There is nothing cool about alcohol/ drug addiction. Apparently, many in real life refuse to get the memo.Before Lady Gaga appeared in any movies, I already knew she could act based on her appearance in one of her music videos with Beyonce a long time ago. What may be a pleasant surprise for some is the display of her musical singing versatility here. She is quite the skilled entertainer who has the whole package, similar to Madonna.

Easy A,"Going into this movie with my dad and brother, I did not expect to be making conscience efforts to hold back a tear or two. Bradly Cooper plays an absolute rockstar with all the addictions of one too, but was able to show a side to him that reminded me of Chris Kyle from American Sniper (also had to hold back a tear or two for that), a side that not many actors have and it was truly impressive.Lady Gaga, to me, came out of total left field with her performance to say the very least. Unaware of her previous acting stints, I asked myself how she was chosen for this part but I honestly left the theater asking if it was her or Cooper who deserves a nomination more. She is as talented as the best of them and at parts this is one of those movies you catch yourself totally tuned into scenes and forget for a few moments youre in a theater watching actors (maybe sitting in row 2 played a factor too).Overall, the writing, tempo, actors, songs(!), and ending is an easy A. Definitely recommend!",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Overrated,"I expected something more given the many positive comments he received. The actors are extraordinary even though the thickness of BC far exceeds that of LG. Which on the other hand, in the scenes on stage, is really in its element. Wonderful the songs, especially the ones that in the film sings BC (the pure melodic accompanied by the piano I find it a bit ""whining"" even if the text is remarkable, I need the guitar and the drums !!) and I was really impressed by the fact that the songs, in addition to being written and performed by the protagonists (but LG could expect nothing less, his talent is unquestionable and names like Mark Ronson appear among others), were recorded live. What I strongly lack in this film is the script. It is true that it is a remake but with today's eyes, it knows everything already seen, predictably, sincerely missing pathos. Even the final drama seems almost false and not the natural evolution of the path of a well-defined character: do events precipitate but do they serve the characters or the film?

Fourth Time Around,"I've recently watched both the 1937 non-musical version of this well-worn riches-to-rags / rags to riches story which starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March and the first musical version with Judy Garland and James Mason from 1954 while the most recent Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristoffersson vehicle is also fairly strong in my memory. This version, directed by and starring Bradley Cooper as the ageing country-rock star whose career is about to hit the skids but who introduces current pop star Lady Gaga as the rising talent he accidentally runs into seems to very much be a remake of that Streisand showcase rather than the other two.Like Kristoffersson, he is a bearded, grizzled rocker, with a more rock-oriented name of Jackson rather than Norman Maine and more drunken, drug-addled episodes it seems than sober ones, who when we first see him is out of his face at an arena gig but just about holding it together. After the gig he crashes in a bar where it's of all things, drag night, but the one true female singer is part time barmaid Ally, played by Gaga who naturally wows the crowd and in particular Maine with her solo spot. So they hook up afterwards, he finds she writes her own songs and invites her to sing one of them as an encore at his next gig. As you'd expect, she goes over big, they become a couple afterwards and the whole cycle of her inexorable rise crossing with his inevitable fall drives the rest of the film.In all this and more, like the lovers' bath scene, it strongly resembles the 1976 version and obviously can't fail to include the bathetic scene where he drunkenly ruins her Grammy Award presentation night but makes a big mistake I feel in not ending on one of cinema's best ever finishing lines which served its three predecessors well enough, as here Gaga sings a heartfelt piano ballad he was working on before he died. I also missed the ""Mr Ally"" jibe from the earlier films which helped fuel Maine's self-destruction, not that I was expecting a scene by scene remake but in omitting it don't feel it was replaced by anything substantial, certainly not the hackneyed relationship between Maine and his brother.Both leads are strong in their parts with Cooper displaying suitable rock star credentials and Gaga proving a natural, when speaking as well as singing her words. However, a fair bit of the dialogue fell on my ears as cliched and the songs themselves, though serviceable, don't scream out classic to me, certainly nothing to rival ""The Man That Got Away"" or even ""Evergreen"".I know I keep returning to the three preceding versions but can't help myself and perhaps it would have been better if I hadn't seen them so recently. Anyway, to me it was about on a par with Streisand's version which ranks it below the first two versions. Wonder when the next remake will take place as it inevitably will?",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

That's a lot of things done right for Mr. Cooper!I would never imagine I will ever see Lady Gaga with no excessive makeup or fashion but her acting in this movie is amazing. Her voice is simply otherworldly, her final song was so powerful tears streamed through my face (more like being emotional than sad, really) when she belted ""I'll Never Love Again"".The chemistry between Cooper and Gaga is so good it's hard to believe this is the first time ever Gaga has co-starring role in a blockbuster movie.

A Star is Born (2018),"Whilst my review is very late to the party (almost three months since it's opening) I am nonetheless excited to say the hype and build up was worth it. A Star is Born is emotional, hefty, warming and ultimately triumphant.Bradley Cooper feels like an assured director and his snub from the Academy Awards is quite frankly a disgrace considering how expertly he directed himself and his co stars. I fell completely in love with Jackson Maine and this was all due to Cooper's gut wrenching and emotional performance.I have to admit I was left feeling underwhelmed with Lady Gaga's performance, yes she was great and completely deserving of her accolades but I couldn't help feel (especially in the more grief stricken scenes) she could've perhaps produced more. Maybe that's me being picky but nonetheless she is still a star and worthy of the recognition she is getting for her surprisingly at times subdued performance.Sam Elliot, Dave Chappelle and Anthony Ramos provide strong back up from the co leads with Elliot being considerably on top form worthy of an Oscar win, he brought gravitas and a steely heart to the picture.The cinematography was just gorgeous, as was the editing. Both played with one another creating a documentary like feel whilst immersing you into the world of Jackson Maine.The themes, references to the modern day music business and emotional beats were all brilliant, one particular scene had me genuinely gasping between Cooper and Gaga.I don't really have much more to say which is odd considering how long some of my other reviews have been. This was a considerable effort by Cooper and he was heavily snubbed by the Academy, one gripe I might add is that I felt maybe the first twenty minutes didn't feel earned, the meeting of Ally and Jackson felt a little TOO Hollywood but this feeling soon went away.Overall, an emotional, stunningly shot, impeccably performed remake that has something genuine to say, which is a rarity in modern day cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Great performances - not necessarily great story,"I liked most of this film but I just couldnt fall in love with it. One notable problem for me was that Jackson wasn't likable to me. Right off the bat, he comes across as very pushy when he meets Ally. Not only was I uncomfortable, but even Ally looked uncomfortable. He's very clearly shown to be a messy alcoholic at the beginning too. And Ally also acknowledges this early on. Its made clear that she doesnt care about the whole celebrity culture so its not like shes attracted to him because of that, and he treats his brother like garbage and so it just felt hard to understand why she so quickly fell for him. There was a disconnect there for me. There was only one moment towards the end where I felt a shroud of compassion for his character. Another movie I saw this year was Beautiful Boy (which featured an addict) and I thought it did a better job of humanizing someone with addiction. I dont know I just think it might have worked better if we as an audience had a chance to see him in rose tinted glasses as someone might when they're starting out in relationship and you're in that honeymoon phase. Or if we had more instances where he knew was effing up.It was also a little cliched at times and I thought the end song was very cheesy. And while I liked the characterization of Ally better, there were times where I felt she was making decisions that didnt make sense. Like one minute she would be very no nonsense not taking any of your crap and the next a walking doormat.Despite this, I cant say I hated the film. I thought the acting was great. The only person in the cast who I wasnt impressed by was Sam Elliot. He was doing the usual thing he does. I thought Bradley did a good job at his directorial debut. The song ""The Shallows"" really stood out to me and is my guess of what will be nominated at the Oscars. I also think its the most pivotal song. Lady Gaga has a killer voice and so it was great getting to hear her sing. I thought her and Bradley worked well off each other. It was moving (more towards the end though). There were parts and things I liked, and Im sure there will be some nominations for it. But, not my personal fave this year.I rated it a 6, but I think in actuality it would be more a 6.5",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Mixed thoughts! But at the end I thinks is dissappointing!,"After watching this movie I have mixed thoughts and feelings. On one hand, I agree with those that think this film is overrated!!! I mean, we have been hearing a lot of this movie and watching the interviews and the publicity and the expectation was really high!! But, after watching it, it came like a sensation of disappointment. Lady Gaga seems Lady Gaga in a Bradley Cooper's film... that's it. And, even thought she persists saying that the character of Ally doesn't seem anything on her, it really does!! And, I also agree with those that say that these actors just kept their performance in the surface! These characters had too much to give and they just didn't explore their different facets!

How did she not win an Oscar?,"There were times during this movie that I felt it was just one of the best I'd seen in a while...and then Bradley Cooper would appear in a scene, or open his mouth, or do anything. This brought the movie's quality down a little for me. He tries very hard to look and sound like a combination of Sam Elliott (he even modeled his character's voice after Elliott's) and Jeff Bridges' character from Crazy Heart, but he doesn't have the gravitas to pull it off. And although it was exhilarating to see Lady Gaga's Ally transform from unsure songstress to confident siren, Cooper's Jackson never really had the same kind of journey. The movie is supposedly about the crossing of paths, with one on the rise and one on the decline, but here Jackson is in decline and a bad egg from pretty much the get-go, and he never really wavers from that. He's the same throughout. I haven't seen the other versions, so perhaps this is how it should go, but it just felt to me that Cooper couldn't bring the right amount of pathos for his character. His chemistry with Gaga was terrific, but I think a lot of that had to do with her passion for the role. Cooper just felt kind of there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

The negative reviews on here reflect trolls who don't like this genre...so why would those people watch then give a bad review??!!??In honest reflection, this film is excellent! 
Gritty, funny and big hearted! 
Yes, there are a couple of 'cheesy' screens where Gaga bursts into song etc. However, in the main - Gaga's performance is great! She brings you into Ally's journey and you believe she is Ally! 
The music is good but plays safe...I guess to appeal to as many people as possible.Now, Bradley Coopers acting and directing are outstanding! 
The film addresses zeitgeist subjects with heartfelt sensitivity. 
Coopers exploration into Jackson Mains mental state and how this is portrayed on screen is exceptional! 
There are screens where the camera looks into Jackson's eyes...and you know exactly what the character is thinking and feeling. This has the effect of immersing you into the film and emotional journey! These screens are an exceptional peice of film making and acting!!!

Nothing to Rave About.,"Started off decent with potential and went downhill rather fast. It felt like the Hannah Montana Movie. Could hardly understand Gaga's lyrics and Cooper's southern drool. Gaga's character was spineless, ending up going along with whatever was said in the thinly written plot. The only redeeming qualities were the supporting actors and the general feel of how you feared for Cooper and his deep-seated problems that he portrayed, erupting into alcoholism. Most Definitely not movie of the year, nowhere close. Just goes to show we end up watching what they tell us to. Least I didn't pay for this mediocre film. I understand it to be a re-hashed idea anyway, perhaps 5 times previously. When will Hollywood come up with original Idea's? If it's not a Bio-Pic, a Superhero Movie or a dumb comedy, then it's a bore of a re-make or a pretentious slog.

First great movie of 2018,"So I watched the new adaptation of a Star is Born at the theater. I walked into the film with high expectations. I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper, but the 1954 Judy Garland version of a Star is Born is one of my favorite movies. I'm happy to say this was one of the best movies of 2018 so far.The movie has a simple but rich and compelling plot. In a fairy tale like beginning a talented struggling young singer meets and falls in love with a popular musician after a chance encounter and begins her ascent into music stardom. Of course what makes the movie so compelling is that it is also a precautionary tale about stardom and the impact it has an individual. The film also masterfully combines a tragic love story with a realistic depiction of alcohol abuse and depression. The film also manages to squeeze in a condemnation on modern manufactured music pushed out just to sell records. The movie had a lot to say, what did a great job saying it.Acting wise I was very impressed with this movie. Bradley Cooper has really demonstrated his range over the years, but this was one of his most memorable performances. Of course he aptly played the role of a charismatic and popular celebrity well, but it was his human depiction of substance abuse and depression that stole the show. I should also mention that this was one of Sam Elliott's best performances in years.On top of that I was absolutely floored by Lady Gaga's performance. Of course she was competing against a high pedigree of past actresses who have also portrayed this role, but she was outstanding. She managed to play both the mild-mannered insecure struggling artist and the rising pop musician in a believable manner. At times it felt like she was really living the role instead of acting. She also had a genuine chemistry with Bradley Cooper which really helped to sell their love interest.Of course speaking of Lady Gaga I have to mention the incredible music performances in this role. I'm not normally a fan of her genre of music, but her voice was so powerful and layered it added an emotional intensity to all of her performances. The range and depth of her voice really added quite a bit to the movie. I will be very surprised if this film does not get nominated for best original song at the Oscars.It should also be mentioned that Bradley Cooper not only starred but also directed in this film. It is quite brave to take on one of the most memorable stories in Hollywood as a first-time director. Bradley Cooper all around directed the hell out of this movie. The cinematography was great, the changes to the story were perfect, and he really captured what makes this such a compelling story. I look forward to his future endeavors as a director.My only real criticism being there were a few scenes that seemed to drag on and repeat them self. The film could have been cut down by at least 15 minutes or so which would have helped to tighten the flow of the plot.Overall I absolutely loved this movie. I think it was one of the best of 2018 and is the first serious Oscar contender of the year. It not only perfectly captured what makes the story special but added an additional element to make it feel original. Highly recommended, a 9.25 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Self love from Cooper & Gaga,"I'm not even sure this deserves the 6 I've given it, but I'm trying not to be too harsh.This film smacked of two 'stars' completely in love with themselves. Apparently Gaga didn't wear makeup for her role (shock horror) - clearly deserving of an Oscar in that case.
Coopers put on husky voice was ridiculous but overall he was ok.
The singing of course was good as Gaga really does have an amazing voice. Cooper was v impressive too.It really did however feel like a completely self serving film for the both of them. Even seeing Gaga's face when she didn't win the Oscar proved that. Over hyped over acted and over rated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Sorry...I don't find depressing movies entertaining!,I was looking forward to this movie... Previews make it look like a feel good movie. It was anything but!Second half of the movie really drug on and on! Wondering when the movie would be over.Left the theater feeling depressed. The person I went to the movies with told me she still felt depressed 24 hours later. .I love Bradley Cooper and I love Lady Gaga but I have no interest in seeing depressing movies.,1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Best movie of the year,"The chemistry of the couple is perfect and the songs are incredibly beautiful, hopefully the roles of Gaga and Cooper have the recognition they deserve, as it is noticeable the delivery they have made to their characters, a true story of love and drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A breathtaking tale of love and struggle,"A Star is Born was a wonderful journey to follow with its characters. Bradley Cooper gives the best performance of his career, and delivers a movie directed so well it's hard to believe this is his debut as a director. Lady Gaga was just a HAIR less impressive than Cooper, but she was unbelievably great. Every moment from the fun moments to the dark moments audiences will be glued to the screen and excited to see what happens next.
And all the music is original and incredible.
This film also takes a very real and eye opening take on addiction that feels more real and even more genuine than other films do when they contain some sort of addiction.
A Star is Born is a must see, and quite possibly my favorite movie of 2018 so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born,"As it is plainly visible from the homepage on this site for the new film, A Star is Born, there are so many user and critic's reviews for this new movie, that I can safely say that I can't say anything that hasn't already been said, or written about it, but in my effort to try and review most of the new films I see at the theatre, I will certainly try my best to do a worthwhile review, even if the majority of the people who usually read these reviews have had enough reviews of this new film already. As, I think it is also pretty clear, this new version of this story is nothing new as it has been made already three times and I also have to be honest and admit that I have never to this day seen any of the other versions, so how closely this new film follows them, or if they have a certain sequence, or story arc between them I do not know, but from what I understand, writer/director Bradley Cooper borrows a little bit from all versions, but also certainly makes this film his own with his own unique stamp on it and also a very unique and worthwhile debut as a writer and director as well also in this case as a singer and songwriter as well. I think over the years having seen many films about showbusiness and the lives of either actors, singers, or people in the entertainment industry in general we as an audience have come to expect certain things from these movies. Usually they feature a celebrity of some kind who can not deal with the various pressures from being famous and this causes them often to go off the deep end with either alcohol, or some kind of substance abuse, or abuse of their bodies in some excessive way. I think it would be something new and even perhaps refreshing to have a story about a celebrity who avoids these pitfalls and basically can hold their own both while performing and keeping a handle on their personal life, but perhaps I am being the naive one here and the many deaths of musicians and people in the entertainment industry just goes to show that success and fame truly can be a hard act to juggle and maybe more credit, or understanding is due to those who in some ways we know very little about outside their public persona. The substance abuse issues are certainly on display in this new version as well and jealously, power hungry managers and agents and the various pressures that stem out of and because of this is all here. It is handled in an interesting if not altogether entertaining version and the performances can be very powerful here even if at times it does border a little bit on melodrama. I think a lot of questions people had about this film include how is Cooper as a writer/director/singer and how is Lady Gaga in her first starring role for the big screen? I can safely and assuredly tell you that Cooper directs and writes like he has been doing it for ages and he truly is a wizard behind the camera and his writing as well as singing is all well done also. For his performance I can also say that I think it is the strongest as well as the best performance of his career thus far and I think choosing to write and direct films and to only direct films he has written himself is a wonderful career move and gives hope to Hollywood as we have another true auteur in the making and a good one at that. Lady Gaga who I know has appeared on American Horror Story, which I have never delved into, but here for her big screen debut she is certainly very impressive not only with her singing and songwriting, but also a emotional performance and a moving one at that. I think it is pretty much guaranteed that both Cooper and Gaga will be up for acting Oscars as well also with Sam Elliott in a wonderful supporting performance. The songs where Cooper and Gaga accompany each other are well done and should also be up for nominations as well as writing, directing and even Best Picture. The film is certainly not my favourite film that I have seen this year, but that is not to say it isn't worth seeing because it certainly is and I was impressed at how many people at my theatre came out to see this film in it's second week and overhearing how much they loved it. For a mainstream outing it is as good as it can get in a time of remakes and cliches being done countless times, but I look forward to seeing more from Cooper and Gaga and what they have left us with is certainly impressive and worth the time out at the theatre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Not my thing,"This film seemed to be a contrived story meant to also seem like a tale of the tough relaities of life. If it didn't hit you already, that is a contradiction. This film had a few of these.For the record I have not seen any of other versions of th film.For what the story was it was presented pretty well by the actors and crew. Solid acting from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. However the pacing was awfully slow, but for that I blame the writers and editors.With the exception of musicals, I'm rather terrible in following song lyrics when facing unfamiliar songs within movies. I suspect most people are like this but few admit it. Musical songs seem successful because their single purpose is providing story narrative rather than provide story narrative and acting as a commercially written song for a movie character. This movie seems to try to make hybrid songs which lie somewhwere imbetween. I was mostly bored while a lot of the songs were playing. Particularly near the middle and end when it was getting old.The manager character and his interactions with the Lady Gaga's character were too inconsistent from moment to moment for me to take them seriously in the end. His motivation came off as for the purpose of the story as oppose resembling the characteristics of a real human.Lady Gaga's character also went through some inconsistencies from moment to moment which bothered me. I couldn't decide if she wanted to be a sellout singer or an authentic musician is the middle to later part of the film. Much of her act later on seemed awful to me. And seemed awful by her own established standards early on. It was all rather difficult to follow seriously even though they tried to play those inconsistencies as part of the story, they just didn't provide enough justification for her to take conflicting opinions so often for me to buy it.There were a good number of chick flick romantic gimmicks which were annoying. Although I can hardly say I was surprised about those given that some of them were in the trailers.I'm sure plenty of people will like this one anyone. And say that many of the things I noticed were strengths rather than weaknesses. Well to me they were weaknesses.So 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Say Something So People Want to Hear It,"What do you have deep inside that you want to say? In Director Bradley Cooper's ""A Star Is Born"" his fading rock star Jackson Maine holds in his arms Lady Gaga's rising star Ally as they gaze at the billboard of her record album cover. Gravelly voiced Jack says, ""Dig down into your soul... Say what you wanna say, because what you say is the stuff of angels."" Director Bradley Cooper's feature debut poignantly asks what do you have to say to the world, so people want to listen.""A Star Is Born"" is uncompromising in discovering one's voice in the world acknowledging the darker humanity of addiction and depression. Bradley and Lady Gaga, in her first starring movie role, are authentic and genuine: strength and frailty. Sam Elliot is eloquently powerful as Jack's older Manager brother Bobby, who loves his self-destructive baby brother.Not only did Bradley direct ""A Star Is Born"", he wrote the screenplay with Eric Roth and Will Fetters. He learned to sing for a year and a half. He wrote songs for the movie with Lady Gaga. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Lady Gaga said that she was blown away by Bradley: ""He sings from his gut.""As country rock star Jackson Maine, he is so convincing singing, ""Maybe it's time to let the old ways die."" He pops painkillers going on stage. He downs a bottle of Jack Daniels in the limo ride from his concert. Bradley embodies Jack's weary numbing suffering.Looking to get a drink, Jack drops in a dive drag bar in Los Angeles. His eyes widen listening to Lady Gaga's Ally singing a French song classic. Ally is special.Over drinks Jack discovers Ally, who works as a restaurant server, is a songwriter. He asks her why she doesn't sing her songs. Ally says that people like her songs, but not the way she looks.Lady Gaga is ""unplugged"" in natural brown hair, sans glam makeup. Gaga inhabits Ally's insecurities like a glove. Yet like Jack, we see her greater within. Jack tells her, ""If there's one reason we're supposed to be here is to say something so people wanna hear it..."" That's the beauty of ""A Star Is Born"": It says something we want to hear.Predictably, yet naturally Jack and Ally fall in love in their star-crossed romance. Ally's star ascends when she sings her song ""Shallows"" with Jack in concert. Sadly, Jack's star tragically descends in drug and alcohol addiction. Ally and Jack are truly in love: They see the greater within each other. However, love alone may not save Jack from his addictions.Bradley and Gaga are fearless compassion in the kind of poignant sadness that can heal. Director Cooper trusts his actor's humanity in stark authentic conversation. Ally cries to Jack, ""You hurt me!"" Jack breaks down to Ally, ""I'm so sorry..."" When Jack confesses to Bobby about ""stealing his voice"" I cried.Lady Gaga is the star. She is so fierce in Ally's vulnerability. Her singing amazes. And you never catch her ""acting""; she is just being. She and Bradley don't romanticize the suffering of loving a drug addict; loving someone suffering from depression. You can only do your best. Responsibility is often a two-way street. That's the eloquent message of ""A Star Is Born"".Listening to Gaga's closing song moved me. Being in love is perhaps most important in life. Yet, we can't know what goes on inside another, even ones we love. ""A Star Is Born"" reminds us that we must also have forgiveness in our hearts. I truly loved ""A Star Is Born"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
My wife left me for Bradley Cooper but he doesn't know it.,"So my superhot wife and I had a date night on Saturday.Nice little night, used some gift cards to The Outback then went to the theatre to watch ""A Star is Born"".I didn't know a whole lot about this movie. I knew that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga were in it and it had music.This is exactly the type of movie formula that I do not want to go to...As we sat in our seats we got about 3 minutes in and I saw why Amy was so excited to see this....Bradley Cooper, a beard, and he sings rock music real real well.So what's in it for me? More than I thought.I barely knew anything about Lady Gaga. I knew that she was kind of a popstar and wore a dress made out of tacos or meat or something. That was about it.So 10 more minutes into the movie and Bradley has sang another song, is wearing a cowboy hat, and playing the guitar.I look over at Amy and her pants are all the way off.Then Lady Gaga starts singing. I did not really find her attractive until then. My goodness what a voice.20 minutes after that Bradley McCowboyPants and Lady Gaga sing about the most impressive duet you will ever hear. Amy is smoking a cigarette and has lit candles in the theatre.Next thing I know both The Bradley and Sam Freakin Elliot are in the same scene. That's right. Sam Elliot from Roadhouse. All I can think of now is Patrick Swayze in his boys size medium sweats and lions mane head and no shirt karate kicking his way into my 17 year old heart.Now my pants are off.Anyway...I laughed, I cried, and I had confusing feelings.This was one hell of a movie.

"One more take on the long-established story, and a very fine one at that.","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. It is a 2-disc set, the second disc has several interesting extras, including a 30-minute glimpse into what all went into making the movie. Cooper studied voice, guitar, and piano for 6 months in preparation for his role.The long-established story is of a worn out performer, existing on booze and drugs, coming upon a young singer and sending her on a trajectory to stardom. Gaga (real name Stefani) is perfect for the role of Ally because in many respects it mirrors her own early life as she fought for recognition. This is her first role in a movie and she performs it as if a veteran of movies.Bradley Cooper has had an itch to direct and this is his first movie. He also is the second featured role as Jack, the grizzled and famous singer and guitarist. His training paid off, his songs, both solo and with Gaga, come off very professionally. In addition some scenes were actually filmed before live audiences at festivals, the film acts were sandwiched between the regular acts.It is a story with both heartbreak and triumph, they pull it off very well. I was totally entertained, I will watch it again before I return the DVD to my library. As we would expect, grizzled veteran Sam Elliott is good as Bobby, Jack's much older brother who mostly raised him after their dad died when Jack was still young.Edit Feb 2022 - I just watched it again, much of it was fresh after almost three years, I probably rate it even a bit higher now, one of my favorite movies over the past few years,",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Not altogether ""shallow""; an impressive debut","When a film is as thoroughly worshipped as A Star is Born, I tend to see two possibilities. One is that it's that kind of rare, well-made picture that hits the spot for almost everyone and so will evolve into a classic. The other is that it's a bland, stupid ordeal that nevertheless ticks all the right boxes to be marketable, accessible, and relatable to mainstream consumers on a shallow (no pun intended) level. A Star is Born has some of both.Directed by Bradley Cooper (a stupendously impressive debut but not as indicative of great taste as Gosling's Lost River), this is actually the fourth iteration of A Star is Born. It is also the only one that I've seen but I don't think it matters. I doubt the Judy Garland film featured music (or clothing) that was this approachable to Gen Z and Lady Gaga fans.Cooper and Gaga star in the film and they are both nominated for Leading Role Oscars this year. Obviously I think the latter can wait until Olivia Colman has gotten her dues for shining (more than any ""star"", born or unborn) in The Favourite, but both leads do well here. Cooper is a drunkard rock musician; Gaga is the nightclub performer who impresses him with her singing talents and beautiful nose. He falls for her through music; one scene later she does the same for him.He invites her to go on tour with him, after letting her perform one of her own creations at a concert of his. Other faces emerge. Emotions evolve. You know how it is.Dave Chappelle, Andrew Dice Clay and the rightfully Oscar-nominated Sam Elliott make for engaging supporting roles, and the likes of Alec Baldwin, Halsey and an assortment of chattering drag queens perform as themselves. The actors are all well-directed by Cooper, and the chemistry of the central couple is sweet and believable. The humorous moments work (I chuckled at a scene where some older gents muse over the YouTube view counter) and the music is mostly good, my only real gripes being with the not-always-cohesive editing and oft predictable romance beats. The camera work is pretty generic but Cooper will get there.The most ""notorious"" issue with A Star is Born is the ending, which, without revealing too much, is allegedly a glorification of something that ought not be glorified. For my part, I've seen the abyss; the abyss being 13 Reasons Why. This isn't quite so dark.We'll see how the film does at the ceremony this Sunday but my confident estimation is that it will take multiple statues home (I've come to accept the reality that it will most surely win Original Song over The Ballad of Buster Scruggs). Hollywood doesn't seem to gush over THIS musical romance quite so much as they did 2017's La La Land, but it's a clear favorite all the same. It may be funny if it is falsely announced as Best Picture, only for the real winner to be Black Panther.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"I'm a man...I don't cry...okay, I cried.","There are some directorial debuts that are just fine and there are others that are complete train wrecks. Bradley Cooper knocked his debut right out of the park because this film is one of the best I've seen all year. I loved this movie and it even pulled some legitimate tears from my eyes, which is saying a lot because I've also seen the 1976 adaptation of ""A Star Is Born"" starring Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand; a film I also love.If you haven't seen any of the previous iterations of ""A Star is Born"" or don't know the plot then here is a synopsis; Jackson Maine is a drug addicted alcoholic musician with his career going on a steady decline, one night runs into a girl named Ally in a bar who is an unknown singer with the potential to really do something with her talents. From there a love starts to bloom as Jackson helps Ally start off her career while he battles his own demons of depression, regret and addiction. I have to say that this film is an emotional powerhouse. There is some real impactful human drama here that is made all the more poignant by the actors who do an incredible job.With a film like this, pretty much everything can fall apart if the romance isn't believable. Luckily with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in the lead roles, the chemistry is amazing between the two and one hundred percent believable in every scene. From the start of the movie it is apparent that these two people are somewhat of a mess, but in completely different ways; Cooper's character is a hardcore alcoholic that is squandering his music career away while Gaga's character lacks motivation and confidence to do anything more with her singing. However, when they find each other it's clear that they supply a lot of positivity to one another, such as Jackson finding a rekindled love for creating music and Ally finds the confidence to put herself out there. However, with those positives also comes consequences. These two actors, without a doubt, convey a truly authentic feeling love that can be seen clearly throughout the film; because of that it is easy to be charmed by their romance and route for them when things hit a down swing.Every conversation in the film feels real, I don't just mean the ones between the two romantic leads, but the entire cast. There's just something about the dialog that comes across as discussions I could picture myself or anyone having, rather than something cleaned up and manipulated to fit the Hollywood world. When Jackson and Ally are talking about music or just getting to know each other, it feels heartwarming but never cynically ""cute"". Or if two characters are fighting, it could have come across as melodramatic, but here it feels legitimate and relatable. Speaking of characters in conflict, Sam Elliot also plays a supporting character in the film as Jackson's older brother and Elliot is brilliant in the role. There are scenes where Elliot doesn't even have to say a word, but the performance that he gives just in his face alone says everything you need to know and it hits hard; especially in one scene in particular between Elliot and Cooper that really tugged at the heart strings, I don't want to say too much as to what is said but there is a moment of silence for Sam Elliot after Cooper leaves the scene that was really emotionally difficult to watch because of his performance. And I mean that in the best way possible.That reminds me, there's another silent moment in the film involving solely Bradley Cooper that really delivered such a strong emotional response for me. It was towards the end of the film, again, I won't say exactly what is happening but the whole scene starts with a somber tone that ramps up with suspense in anticipation as to what this character is going to do. Then with one look on Cooper's face, you understand everything that is going on in this guy's head and I couldn't help but get choked up. It was terribly difficult not to simply cry through whole scenes because of the tragedy going on in these people's lives. That's one of the great things about this movie, I forget that these are even characters, I feel like I am getting a peek into real peoples' lives. The movie really hit me right in the gut with one of its final shots involving Jackson Maine and Ally. When it got to that moment, I'm not going to lie, I shed a lot of tears...I mean...I'm a manly man, I don't feel feelings. Feelings are stupid...I need another tissue.One brilliant thing that I would like to touch on is the cinematography; as a whole it is terrific, but there is something specific that this film does that I absolutely love. Throughout the entire romance there are these really specific moments that happens between these two characters that are made to feel even more significant because when they happen it switches to Jackson's point of view. Such as when they look directly at each other for the first time, the camera switches to Jackson's point of view staring right at Ally's face. When it is their wedding day, Jackson and Ally are standing at the alter and say 'I do', the camera briefly looks right at Ally's face. And then at the end it does it again, but in a slightly different way that I won't say. For me, this was a genius way to help the audience fall for this girl and understand exactly what is going on with these characters internally. Another technique the cinematography takes is how it films Jackson when he's intoxicated or high; a lot of the time it takes a while for the camera to give a full look at Jackson's face and everything feels just slightly off kilter. I thought that was a cool way to make certain scenes feel kind of odd and even on edge, much like how it is when you're in a room alone with someone who's completely drunk and you're sober. There's just a different vibe in the room, I think anyone who's been there knows what I'm talking about.The music of this movie blew me away. I was in awe of how much character and story could be fleshed out in just a single song. But again, the actors pull it off perfectly. Whenever they have to perform on stage or they're just simply playing along together in a private setting, it is made wildly clear how these people feel and what is going through their heads. When Lady Gaga's character is somewhat coerced into singing live on stage with Jackson for the very first time, you get everything going on with her in that moment. The terror of failure, the excitement of singing to a crowd full of thousands of people, the joy in finally letting go, back to fear, back to excitement. It's a flawless performance honestly that's made even better with the use of very long takes. Instead of constantly cutting, the editing is very minimal while you get a full look at everything going on with her. Lady Gaga really was a bright spot in this already great film, I loved her in this movie and cannot wait to see what she does next.A funny little tidbit about this movie is that it has a lot of supporting cast members who are comedians; Andrew Dice Clay, Dave Chappelle, Alec Baldwin, and Eddie Griffin to name the ones that I noticed. Andrew Dice Clay plays Ally's father and he's surprisingly really solid. I've never seen him outside of comedic roles before and I've certainly liked him in those, but never in a dramatic role like this and I think that he nailed it. Dave Chappelle, while briefly in the movie, also does a fantastic job and I actually kind of wanted to see him more in the film interacting with Jackson.Overall, I think this is one of the best remakes that I have ever seen. A bold statement, I know, but this is a bold movie. It doesn't pull punches or ever feel manipulative, it's raw and heartbreaking and beautiful. I said it before, I'll say it again, I love this movie. The acting is perfect, the editing and cinematography is outstanding, and the story solid; possibly more so than any of the other adaptations quite honestly. If you're emotionally stable enough to make it through a heavy romantic tragedy then this is well worth your time. Check it out as soon as you can, if nothing but to feel something great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Bitterly disappointing and doesn't live up to it's hype,"A fairly good movie, but not great and the hype it received from its original release just doesn't match what I saw on the screen. I'm not a fan or familiar with Lady Gaga's work, because I find her too commercial and gimmicky for my personal taste in music. But I was surprised that she has such a good voice and vocal range and if it is true these were live performances and not recorded in a studio setting and them lip syncing then I was impressed. I was not impressed with Bradley Coopers guitar skills and singing voice. When you compare the previous incarnation of this same movies this one pales in comparison. Why make another movie when the original was so much better and has received 5 stars, this is mediocre at best. I don't see enough of a struggle or the downward spiral in Bradley Cooper's performance.His addictions issues are glossed over and to me it felt like Bradley was holding back in his performance, he's a much better actor but wasn't committed to this performance as an entertainer on his way down and out or being a fall down drunk. I've watched this movie three times hoping I would see something different that I might have missed in my original viewing of this movie, but each time I got the same results. His character was to have spent too many years of concerts, managers, self-indulgent behavior, just very tired of being on the road for decades and life on the road was to have made him very cynical and the monotony was to have taken its toll on him vocally and physically. Jackson was supposed to resent his wife success and become very bitter and an embarrassment. I didn't see a character in self destruct mode.I just didn't see him struggling with his alcoholism and drug abuse addictions issues, his character is supposed to be an alcoholic and eventually succumb to his addictions in the end. He just seems to be a self-indulgent and very narcissistic man. I have no sympathy for his character as I did in the Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand versions of the same film. Isn't the audience supposed to have empathy and compassion for the male lead? I did love Sam Elliott's performance and he was committed to his character and he was the sole reason I kept watching. Some of the songs and soundtrack were good but only two of the song stood out. Shallow and Always Remember Us This Way are the standouts.I really wanted to like this movie, but I was greatly disappointed in it because of all the hype the media gave this movie, I was expecting to be blown away by their performances and I wasn't. Maybe for Bradley he was dealing with too many balls in the air. Producer, director, screenwriter, writing songs, singing, learning to play the guitar and lead actor, something fell between the cracks and sadly it was his performance and lack of commitment to his character. It's a promising start to a new directing career. Why was Bradley's face so red? It was a distraction to me and he sounded too much like Sam Elliott. Overall, I will give this movie a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Dreary Expose With Unintentional Real-Life Parallels,"A dreary expose on fame and dysfunctional relationships that lacked depth and character growth. In a strange meta-mind-twist, one of Ally (played by Lady Gaga)'s major insecurities is the size of her nose. Ally talks about how she didn't give in and get a nose job to satisfy the industry. Except, Lady Gaga's current nose is NOT big. So what kind of message does that send? Or am I supposed to suspend disbelief and pretend I'm looking at a huge nose? And, everyone knows that Lady Gaga DID have a nose job in real life, so how strange for her character to go on and on about the size of her nose and she how didn't have a nose job when the exact opposite is true: Lady Gaga DID have a nose job and now her nose is medium-sized, not large. Meta Mind Twist, I tell you.Which in a weird way perfectly illustrates one of the themes of the film: that fame is unhealthy and creates falsehoods in one's life. Side note: please no more casting of leading ladies who have so much botox and fillers that their faces don't move. It should go without saying but in acting, showing facial expressions is important.It does attempt in the last part of the movie to address a very serious issue (saying more would constitute a spoiler), but in a weird way, it felt like one could interpret it as a glorification of the issue, as if Bradley Cooper's character did the right thing. And sadly, he did not.",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Director is Born,"A Star is Born, contrary to what the title might imply, is not a Christmas movie. It is in fact the newest remake of a story that's been told several times over the past century, beginning with the 1937 original starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. The most recent version prior to this year's edition was released in 1976 and starred Kris Kristofferson as a drunken rock star whose career is in the beginning of its decline. He has a chance meeting with an aspiring singer, played by Barbra Streisand, and works to launch her stage debut in his place.
This year's adaptation follows a similar story, and features Bradley Cooper in his directorial debut, also channeling his inner Keith Urban as rock/country artist Jackson Maine, who becomes infatuated with Lady Gaga's character Ally after watching her sing at a hole-in-the-wall drag bar. This is easily the best I have ever seen of Bradley Cooper onscreen. He inhabited this character so completely that Cooper himself was gone and Jack was all I saw. Cooper, who hails from Pennsylvania, put on the most authentic southern accent I have ever heard from a non-southerner. Actors typically put on a hillbilly twang when they attempt to portray this type of character, but there was nothing artificial going on here in the least. Lady Gaga, while not on Cooper's level, still surprised me with her acting talent. I would argue that she mostly played herself, but this is exactly what the character called for, and she did it well. Sam Elliot was a surprise -- I didn't expect to see him in this movie, but as Jack's (much) older brother Bobby, he gave a very subdued, yet powerfully emotional performance. If I could, I would absolutely nominate him for best supporting actor, and he was a consistent highlight to the movie.
A Star is Born is a romantic drama, first and foremost, but the music is absolutely central to the story. Most of the music, particularly the country style, was thoroughly enjoyable, and sounded like something I'd throw on to listen to while driving with friends. Once the movie delved into pop music, it lost its charm and came off as some of the more rote stuff I'd expect to hear from Bieber, but I think that was part of the point, as it helped us understand some of Jack's frustrations.
The movie is pretty long at roughly 2 hours, 15 minutes. The story, unfortunately, seemed to meander a bit and got a little slow in parts, but I would still say that each scene helped to build and develop the characters and the relationships defined over the course of the movie. We really got to know these people, and it also provided an interesting look into stardom to help us see celebrities as fellow humans with real problems and real flaws.
I'm very glad I finally found time to watch this movie before it left theaters, and I'd encourage others to do the same. If this is any indication of Bradley Cooper's future as a director, I'll be there day one to see his next movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"""Bad Romance"" made Lady Gaga a Pop Star, a Good Romance will make her a Hollywood Lady...","""A Star is Born"" is a cinematic contradiction. It reveals a lot and yet doesn't reveal much.There's a moment that caught my attention and doesn't feature any of the two lead actors. Ally's father (Andrew Dice Clay) tells his colleagues about people who had enough talent to compete with the likes of Sinatra (with Sinatra actually) but didn't have their big break or didn't believe in themselves enough. Point was: it's not enough to have what it gets, it also takes to believe in getting it.Now, let's get back to my contradiction: Lady Gaga is an international star, as soon as she popped up in the pop scene, it was quite obvious she was the true heiress of Madonna and a star in her own right. It wasn't just about her talent but also her eccentric looks, her unique sense of fashion, and the fact that an ordinary-looking Italian girl-next-door could become a legitimate icon. So everyone thought she was the new Madonna but who would have thought one second she would also be the new Barbra Streisand?What Lady Gaga delivers in ""A Star is Born"" is a performance that shines through its straight naturalness wrapped up in an artistic talent that blooms under the comforting direction of Bradley Cooper, the director and his character. That an established star would be able to get back to her roots and play a shy newcomer (with an uncanny resemblance to Sofia Coppola) slowly overcoming her insecurities is actually more impressive than any of your routine Oscar-bait mellow-dramas.So Lady Gaga is Ally, a girl who's got the talent but has entrapped her motivation behind the bars of a nose complex (can't help but see the Streisand parallel). It takes the encounter with Jackson Maine -an aging rocker played by a handsomely bearded Bradley Cooper- to realize that she's got it after all. It's not just the talent but that she's got something to tell. It might sound corny but the film is actually immune against such criticism because one can't ignore the self-referential aspect.Now let me open a parenthesis: I was looking forward to watching ""A Star is Born"" before that version was even in the talks, I wanted to watch the Judy Garland then the original and the 1976 remake. It ended up with Cooper's being the first version I saw. It's obvious that the titular star can't not-be played by a complete artist with a few personal demons to slay and Streisand and Garland must have a great deal of adversity in their lives. It is obvious why some confessions from Ally hit the right chord acting-wise.Indeed, being Ally allows Lady Gaga to open up about her insecurities in the kind of bravura performance that goes deeper than making yourself uglier, it's about undressing your soul. Ally represents Stefani Germanotta before all the ""Roma-Romama"" and ""Ga-Ga Ou-lala"" started spreading all over the radios. I discovered her at the end of 2009 and at the beginning of 2010, Lady Gaga was a brand-name already. So yes, a star can be born that quickly because there's something about talent.Hips don't lie, said Shakira, I would say talent is an even worse liar, which takes me back to the initial contradiction. The show reveals that Lady Gaga is not only musically gifted but can play her heart out and is worthy of more demanding roles than Madonna or Beyoncé... but I wasn't surprised, it wasn't just her Golden Globe win that rang a bell but the fact that some people just got what it takes. And for that, even Bradley Cooper deserves some credit, that he recycles material and works on a timeless story doesn't mean he couldn't fail, he jeopardized his credibility on this directorial debut but proved to do half the job well by having the right cast.Lady Gaga was perfect for the role and so was he as the lead role, the fading star Jackson Maine who discovers accidentally Ally singing Piaf in a shacked up bar and decides to take her as a protégée. It doesn't fool us one second that what go between these two persons are vibrations that venture in the realm of love rather than any dream of musical achievement, but it's through music that they find a way to seal their romance, through the future Oscar winner ""Shallow"", a song that I would have kept humming outside the theater if it wasn't for ""Bad Romance"" interfering with it.The beauty of ""A Star is Born"" is that it works as much as a romance than a music film and combines these two aspects expertly. It's the kind of love story that doesn't need any artificial plot device, no cheating, no prison, only the ascension of a young woman and the descent into the hells of alcoholism of a man. The film opens with their romance and the rest is all about how one slowly rises above her demons while the other sinks into. It's a love story and the process of a separation going through scenes that are rather painful to watch and one so embarrassing I couldn't stare at the screen.To think that I suspected Bradley Cooper would give himself a very grateful role but he's got perhaps an even more challenging one as he goes against his charming persona and is surprisingly good at conveying pathos without never being totally pathetic. For a directorial debut, the result is quite impressive and I envision at least four Oscar-nominations with a few technical nods such as Sound and Editing. I'm not sure Sam Elliott would get a nod but he was also a highlight in a film that full of them.And beyond these Oscar considerations, even without watching the predecessors, ""A Star is Born"" does justice to the story, if not a masterpiece of originality, the performances are sincere and draw you into caring for every character and the songs memorable.

Too much hype for a mediocre movie,"The trailers for this movie were very misleading. I thought it was going to be about how a famous country singer finds a girl and inspires her musically, challenging her, and falls in love in the process. The movie seems to be more about his demons and how she tries to help him while starting a challenging music career. The trailers looked like this was an inspirational movie. Honestly, one of the saddest movies I've seen in a while.Just a little forewarning: there is a lot of drinking, drug use, and cussing. Every other word was the f bomb. At least there was no nudity. Bedroom scenes were very brief. I really don't like Lady Gaga, but The acting was great and the music was incredible. Was the movie overall good? Yes...good, not great.

Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in a remake for the ages,"When I first heard about this, I did not know quite what to expect. On the one hand, Bradley Cooper had never directed a film before and I had no feel for Lady Gaga's acting chops. On paper, it was hard to know if this would be any good.Needless to say, my doubts were answered and put to rest forever by the time I left the theater. This age-old story of a young woman who meets a celebrity on the downward spiral of his career and who becomes the next big thing is wonderfully revived here, with Lady Gaga as a young waitress and singer who meets the legendary country singer Jackson Maine, whose career is beginning to slide amid his drug and alcohol addiction. Sam Elliot is dynamic as his long-suffering older half-brother and manager.What makes this film so memorable aside from its stellar performances? First off, there are a handful of amazing ballads sung by both Lady Gaga and Cooper. Their vocals bring this film to such grand heights, that I might now have a couple of new favorite songs. Lady Gaga's stirring delivery anchors this film and then rockets it to the sky. Just thinking about it makes me misty-eyed. Equally realized besides the music, are the themes of holding onto love and discovering your true potential. In that regard this film had an amazing flare for insightful dialogue.If you're looking for a film that comes from the heart and is as good as people think films used to be and offers some hope, then this one most surely is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Timeless classic redone the right way for this day and age,"""A Star Is Born"" (2018 release; 135 min.) brings the story of Jackson ""Jack"" Maine and Ally. As the movie opens, Jack is hitting the stage at a massive outdoor show. After the show, he boozes up in the getaway SUV, and orders his driver to stop at a nearby bar. It happens to be the place where Ally, after her daytime kitchen job, performs regularly. That evening, she brings ""La Vie En Rose"", stunning Jack with her singing. He meets Ally after the show, and they hit it off... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the 4th incarnation of ""A Star Is Born"". The previous version starring Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, from 1976, is the version I grew up with. While that movie's flaws were obvious, I nevertheless quite liked it. Now 42 years later comes this up-to-date remake. This marks the directing debut of actor Bradley Cooper, and what a debut it turns out to be! Cooper also co-produced, co-stars and co-wrote the script. Cooper's challenges/risks were formidable: would he be a credible ""rock star""? More importantly, would he be a credible singer? Answer to both of those questions is a resounding YES. Even more surprising is Lady Gaga as Ally. Who knew she'd be able to give such a nuanced acting performance (obviously we already knew that she has the singing talent). The on-screen chemistry between these two leads is palpable, making the movie such much more believable. But wait! there is more! For me arguable the movie's best performance comes from Sam Elliot, as Jack's road manager (and elder brother). What a stage presence! The musical performances are generally speaking outstanding. Cooper's backup band features Lucas Nelson (son of Willie), who co-wrote most of the songs, and the Promise of the Real. It's fun recognizing some of the venues and festivals where the concert footage was filmed (I spotted both Coachella and Glastonbury, among others). The only criticism I have is that the movie, which is pretty much flawless in the first hour, is a bit overly long, in particular towards the end. But all in all, kudos to Cooper for taking on what could've been a disaster, but instead ends up being a remake of a timeless classic that is just right for this day and age.""A Star Is Born"" premiered at the Venice film festival in late August, to immediate and universal acclaim. The movie opened wide this past weekend. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED. Yes, on a Monday! I am going on record already that ""A Star Is Born"" not only will get multiple Oscar nominations early next year, it will in fact win the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress, among others. I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"What is the price of fame, and how far are you willing to go to achieve it?","In Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, we see him take on the lead role as the haggard and disturbed Rockstar, Jackson Maine. Whilst Jackson's career has begun to falter he finds inspiration in a gifted dive bar performer, Ally, played by Lady Gaga (Stephanie Germanotta). The chemistry between Cooper and Gaga is incredibly genuine, their love and admiration for one and other radiates from the screen. This adds a relatable human element to their journey, helping to engage the viewer. Which results in an engrossing journey, watching with baited breath and dizzying exhilaration, the subsequent cost that so often goes hand in hand with fame.Cooper portrays Jackson as cyclically wretched but always convincing; his complex life has taken its toll with alcoholism and hearing loss now damaging his reputation. Gaga turns in a fantastic display as a budding but unlikely waiter/performer who stumbles upon success, and with it the complexities of stardom. Gaga not only highlights her outstanding voice but also her deft acting ability. There is a refreshing emphasis on the importance of talent over superficial looks. However, Gaga's character struggles against shallow image issues from the music industry throughout.The character Ally mirrors Gaga's own rise to pop-celebrity status. Light is not always shed on this in a positive manner, with jabs at producers and a flurried celebrity lifestyle corrupting her originality. Which in turn compromises Jackson's morals, whose ardent stance causes him to slip behind in a changing world. This further drives the story as Jackson's fall reflects the rise in Ally's career. 
Despite the premise of an uplifting and heartwarming drama, A star is born is much more than that. The storyline tackles themes of addiction, loss and love. Particularly shown in Jackson's character, ever bleared eyed and slurring his words. This at times can be hard to watch as addiction is ugly, frustrating and often, it's tragic. These flaws in his life help to flesh out a memorable and thought-provoking character. The narrative doesn't shy away from the darker complexities in life culminating in some deeply moving scenes. The meaning and lyrics behind the songs bolster overarching themes in the film; such as the pursuit of happiness and the pain of loneliness in life. This is effective as it creates an authentic and approachable feel to the character's turbulent lives.Gaga's insistence on the music scenes being live thoroughly pays off, providing not only convincing shows, but scintillating ones. Combined with masterful sound design and genuine sets, the viewer is immersed and pulled in amongst the crowd. The, decision to go to venues such as Coachella and Glastonbury, and play in front of a roaring audience, brings power and realism to the screen. Cooper's singing ability and general demeanor on stage, combined with Gaga's powerful performance are levelling. The song 'shallow' is sung with particular reverence: ""In all the good times, I find myself longing, for change."". It's difficult not to get goosebumps when you hear the opening riff and Gaga unleash her fantastic voice on the chorus.Expect a whole host of Oscar nominations, including Best actor/actress/song. A star is born, is a fulfilling and powerful watch that seeps with humble authenticity. An instant classic? I have no doubt about that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Worthy of Goosebumps & Tears,"A Star is Born, a Sette review......Yes, it's a fact that there are past versions of this film, but you must dismiss the word 'remake' from your thoughts.This film was compelling & epic, and clearly forges its own path, A fabulous script that tells a story of passion, love, determination, romance, and consequences of substance abuse.It's Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, and he provided an up close & personal, in your face flawless performance directing an outstanding cast, he also was absolutely amazing as an aging rock star, this completely changing his speaking voice & his overall disposition to one who is battling the perils of alcoholism.Then there's Lady Gaga, who completely owns the screen, she plays Ally, a waitress breaking up with her boyfriend, who can write & sing, but she considers herself not worthy enough for stardom.Gaga's acting is simply outstanding, and her singing worthy of goosebumps, excitement & tears...They meet by chance as Cooper the aging rock star needs a late night drink after performing a gig, and they spot a bar off the road which is a gay bar, hosting a drag night.Their meeting was so real & Gaga's cabaret-style performance to ""LaVie En Rose"" was the beginning of the brilliance you will see & listen to throughout the movie.All the other songs are original & made for the movie, the screen sound is just ridiculous, trust me when I say this, Gaga will take your breath away, and Cooper sings well too.The soundtrack will sell millions.Their romance is sexy and extremely emotional, good stuff for sure, and I thought it was interesting how they hid all of Gaga's tattoos for the role. The close-ups to Gaga's eyes are just fabulous.The co-stars were fabulous too, albeit in limited parts, have crusty veteran actor Sam Elliott who plays Cooper's brother, who has worked with him over the years, their differences are clear, but they love each other & Andrew Dice Clay (as Gaga's father) who provides a performance you've never seen out of him, way different from his stand up foul mouth ways, and he's even funny & at times, rather dramatic too.Lastly, Dave Chapelle did a nice job too as Cooper's longtime friend.There's no doubt in my mind that this film will win numerous Academy Awards in the Spring of 2019, and if Gaga doesn't win the female best actor in a lead role, they better conduct a thorough investigation.If you have a great appreciation for Lady Gaga and the gift of her brilliance as a musician & vocalist, you will simply be overwhelmed, call me overly sentimental, but my eyes were glossy several times, and once I was completely drawn to tears.I Love Love Love her.....If you never understood or believed in Gaga, you will have a new found appreciation for her, I promise.Go and see the movie, and do not be late, get your popcorn & be in your seat for every minute of it....

Half a very good movie,"As we're thrown into the great country/rock song ""Black Eyes"", co-written and performed by writer/director/producer Bradley Cooper, before going along into a drag bar where Cooper's drunk character is moved to tears by Lady Gaga's rendition of ""La Vie En Rose"", the opening of A Star Is Born feels immediate, raw and true - not at all like a remake of a remake of a remake. The two leads' romance is made believable through simple, humble writing and acting. Cooper has half a very good movie down before cluttering it up by becoming too self-centered and sentimental on behalf of his own character. The final third is an unbridled spectacle of self-pity. There's power and resonance in the movie's two main character relations (Gaga/Cooper and Cooper/Elliott). And Lady Gaga demonstrates that she can act almost on par with her singing. The problem with Ally isn't that Gaga cannot pull off the early dramatic segments, but rather that the character is a complete package, artistically speaking, from beginning to end. There's no need or room for development. Luckily the fine music works as a nice distraction. Sam Elliott steals the show as Cooper's older brother. And so does Andrew Dice Clay in his few scenes as Gaga's father.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A solid retelling of the classic tale,"""A Star is Born"" may be the definition of Oscar bait, yet the film does enough to differentiate itself from previous versions and is legitimately enjoyable on its own. Well-crafted and emotional, ""A Star is Born"" is well worth the watch for cinephiles and average movie-goers alike.The movie is beautiful in so many ways. The most outstanding is the cinematography; the visuals in the movie are captivating and gorgeous. This makes sense, as a movie about musicians is free to play around with bright colorful lighting and energetic camera work during the musical performances. Even outside of the music scenes though, every frame in the movie is a work of art. An absolute pleasure to the eye.The acting is also a major highlight, specifically the chemistry between the leads. I remember being surprised at the casting of Lady Gaga in a big dramatic role (I'd guess I'd never thought of her as an actress), and even more surprised that she got an acting nomination, but after finally watching this movie long after awards season came to a close, it became clear to me that there was no better choice for the role. Her chemistry with Bradley Cooper is incredible; both leads do their absolute best to make this relationship real, emotionally charged, and heartbreaking in the end. Sam Elliott is also a standout, of course, as he is in any role.And of course, one can't talk about ""A Star is Born"" without mentioning the phenomenal music. The soundtrack is also incredible, and the way that the individual songs mirror the action taking place on screen is even better. The soundtrack album is one of those where, if you listen to it before even watching the film, you're likely to go into it liking the movie before you've even seen it.Regrettably, the only thing standing between this movie and near perfection is issues with the script. The time frame for the movie is not made clear at all, it could have taken place over a month or a few years and we wouldn't know the difference. This muddles Jack and Ally's relationship a bit, although clearly they are somewhat instantly attracted to one another, it's not made clear how long their tour together is, or how long it takes Ally to record and release her debut album, or how long after they met they get married, and as such their relationship lacks some depth as the audience has no idea how long it took to develop. In addition, there's too much reliance on plot conveniences (for example, why was Jackson's driver waiting for Ally outside of her job when she gave him no indication that she would be going to Jack's show?) and these can distract from the narrative.In the end though, ""A Star is Born"" is heart wrenching, beautifully made, and a musical gift, making it a worthwhile watch for anyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Some Things are Hard to Get Past,"Because we are (unfortunately) familiar with some of the things Lady Gaga has done in her past, seeing her in this role was really difficult. Gaga is an exceptional singer and performer and in recent time has made an effort to be a bit more serious in those skills. As the film develops her natural expertise overcomes the effort to play a newbie on stage. But that just makes for us a more enjoyable time watching her sing and is soon forgotten.Bradly Cooper is simply superb. He carries the role of Jackson precisely and so convincingly. If he can really play and sing that well it is amazing we haven't seen more of him doing so. Without a doubt, this time around was much better than the previous one with Babs and Kris Kristofferson.

One of the good musical romance films and a great directional debut for Bradley Cooper.,"The movie is based on and is most powerful at tremendous moving music written and the beautiful songs that of course is winning an Oscar this year no doubt. The story is solid and Bradley really had a great and well studied vision of it with great effort and lots of singing and one hell of a performance among with Gaga who did a great job for her debut as an actress with the chemistry between both which was amazing too and how the screenplay matched with some line that happened in the ending scenes and how all was leading to the end and Bradley gently did the scenes with no trauma but were shocking including the end. However, the story's side of drugs and addiction wasn't much powerful and could say I have seen a lot similar but not performed as good as this one that despite being an important plot for the film It separates me from seeing it as a unique picture and hoped it was another thing and plot. The rhythm of the film decreased towards the end and from what I saw I didn't find a reason for the shocking ending though it seems appropriate for the conditon of Jack but how suddenly the love wasn't a factor in split of a second and what he fought for. Also Ally's rising was fast for me and wasn't clarified much and thought with a movie like that that cared about details should haven't made it as other films when you see the other person standing on stage winning an award. The film devolved into a melodrama so quickly in the end with their fast relationship and felt like it lost the whole thing and just focused on ""Music"" The live singing was so powerful and good. The cinematography was good too. But I lost it with the whole matter near the end and felt it was weaker than the beginning until the end arrived.Can't understand much love and overrating and can't understand much hate. I understand that you shouldn't miss the film. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Bad,"Just a bad movie. The filming wasn't good, the acting was not good, the songs even weren't good. They had a few funny scenes at least, but only at the beginning. Then the movie just dragged on.

Moving story,"What a fantastic effort by Bradley Cooper and Gaga. The time just flew by as I was drawn into the story about one star helping a new one to rise, all the while unable to help himself keep rising. It may help that I don't remember the earlier versions, I'm not sure. I do know I liked both characters and was moved by their underlying loyalty and care for each other - despite their faults or fears that ultimately needed to be overcome.

"Good, but not great","Okay, the elephant in the room first. It's a remake, of a remake, of a remake. There have been four versions of ""A Star is Born"" and I've seen all four. My favorite is Judy Garland's, since it is truly a great showcase for her as an actress and the amazing singer that she was.It's not an original story, of course, but I give high marks for the music first and foremost. Secondly, Lady Gaga is a very good actress. I didn't really expect to be impressed by her, but I thought she was the right fit for this part. Just like Judy Garland, it showcased her as both a singer and a good dramatic actress. Also, she is quite pretty, naturally, without all the crazy makeup and costumes that she always wears.I was less impressed with Bradley Cooper, to be truthful. He's a good actor, but I thought this film was slightly overrated as a whole.

So much more than a musical.,"A Star Is Born tells the story of aspiring singer Ally(Lady Gaga) & famous rock/country singer Jack(Bradley Cooper). Jack has full confidence in Ally's singing prowess. However, his addiction to alcohol might hinder Ally's promising singing career.A Star Is Born is a masterpiece. It is right up there with the other recent romance/drama/musical, La La Land(2016). Bradley Cooper has outdone himself in his directorial debut, both in front of & behind the camera. The songs co-written by Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper & others are unforgettable. My personal favorite is 'Shallow' sung by Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper. Lady Gaga excels in her big screen debut, as Ally. Bradley Cooper has given us the best performance of his career, as Jack. Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga share this raw & electrifying chemistry, that is the highlight of the film. Sam Elliott is spectacular as Bobby. Andrew Dice Clay is brilliant as Lorenzo. Rafi Gavron is outstanding as Rez Gavron. Anthony Ramos is great as Ramon. The supporting cast is good. A Star Is Born is a must watch for romantic musical fans & Bradley Cooper fans.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"A Star is BornThe best things about sleeping with a famous singer are the costume changes and pyrotechnics.However, the vocalists in this drama are both gifted so sex gets pretty smoky.After a concert one night, rock-star Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) inadvertently catches a performance by emerging artist Ally (Lady Gaga), and is so impressed by her vocal range that he offers to help refine her singing and song-writing talents. But as Ally's star begins to rise and she garners accolades and awards, her mentor - now husband - descends into drink and a deep depression.Although this is the fourth remake of the 1937 original, first-time director Bradley Cooper and his leading lady Gaga both make stunning debuts, which helps the dated material feel relevant. While it's darker than previous versions, this adaptation has the added bonus of original songs.Incidentally, marriage is a lot easier for rock-stars because they have roadies.

A heartbreaking love story. Gaga is phenomenal.,"I was very excited to see the new A Star Is Born remake when I first heard that Lady Gaga was going to be in it. She and Bradley Cooper have amazing chemistry. This is a great story about the fall of one star and the rise of another. Her voice in the songs gave me chills and made me feel so emotional. Especially I'll Never Love Again. (the Oscar winner for best song this year in my opinion) She was a great choice for the role of Ally. It was almost like watching Gaga's own story on screen, rising to be a big star. Her acting is just as exceptional as her singing. Bradley is very good. Unlike anything he has ever done. You actually forget that it is him playing the part in the movie. It's as if his character Jackson Maine is a real person that we are watching on screen. And his direction was very good as well. Impressive. 
 I have seen some negative reviews by trolls on here who have no life. They just live on being negative jerks with no feelings who like to put things down. I guess it makes them happy to be the trolls they are. Pathetic. They were probably written by Marvel fans.
If this movie doesn't get multiple award nominations, I'll be very surprised. It is funny, touching, emotional and heartbreaking. Be sure to bring tissue with you when you go to see it. It will make you cry. Can't wait to see Bradley and Gaga on the red carpet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A Raw Look into Stardom,"Well, since stealing a satellite feed, I am able to watch movies that are in between the theaters and DVD outlets. Looking at all the ratings for this movie, I tried it on for a spin. The movie doesn't disappoint. Cooper and Gaga really bring their characters out to the front and allow us into their world. The movie hums along well, with supporting cast members doing their jobs. It's a simple enough plot, but Gaga's and Cooper's performance will really stand with you for awhile, as they are that good.

The opening fifteen minutes are cringy. There is a lot of weird dialogue and scenes that don't make much sense. Then the movie gains some momentum, but can't keep it up for more than twenty minutes, because everytime something starts developing the movie hits you with some boring stuff. Lady Gaga turns out to be OK for the role, Bradley Cooper tries a bit too hard and the movie itself goes for all the easy tricks to make your eyes wet, but falls a bit short of doing so.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Not what I expected,"The movie might be called ""a star is born"" but it is much more of a love story than a story about fame. Gaga and Cooper both shine and sound brilliantly, the Music is incredible and delivers instant classics and ballads that resemble the greatest ballads of the 90s. This truly is Gaga's Bodyguard moment and she proves once more to be one of the most talented singer and songwriters of our decade. I absolutely loved the first part of the movie. However, things start to change in the middle of the film and I was missing some depths to understand how the characters, especially Ally, feel about it or how this change came to happen. Some scenes seemed to repeat itself and in the last part the movie was kinda slow. The end however blew me away.Overall, the movie was a lot different than I expected but it was still a good movie that will cement Gaga's legacy as one of the greats.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"BEAUTIFUL, CLASSIC DESPITE SOME IMPERFECTIONS","A Star is Born is far from being the best movie of the year. The screenplay is kind of ""very basic"", and without surprise ""guessable"", but tells a lot and perfectly about the romance of Ally and Jack. Even though the first part if thé film is truly an ""excessive succession if storytelling"", the music on it brought easily tje emotions that the director wanted the audience to have, hence the first hour seemed too short. It's in the second part that we can find how damn talented and brilliant is Lady Gaga as an actress. Her voice and face expression make us enjoy a lot that simple classic story which is A Star is Born. However, the original music written for the film fits perfectly with the story and brings instantaneously the emotions to the audience, so are the cinematography and the brilliant first directing from Cooper. The ending is truly BREATHTAKING and EPIC that the final scène only won't let you forget the entire film si easily, and how beautiful it was to experience watching it. The film won't win ""Best Picture"" at the Oscars (unless there is a miracle) because of the lack of originality in it I Guess, but there are so many chances for it to win in other categories.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"""A Star is Born"" (2018) - the fourth adaptation of the ""Rise and Fall"" story.","Bradley Cooper plays Jackson ""Jack"" Maine, a country singer who suffers from a severe alcohol and drug addiction. After a show he visits a bar where he discovers Ally (Lady Gaga), a waitress who enjoys performing a song once a week, since her big dream was to become a singer. Falling in love with her, Jack invites her to a gig to perform ""Shallow"", a song Ally has written. At first she is to shy to even show up, but as Jack starts playing her song she has enough courage to sing it with him. But as one star is born, another starts to fade.What makes the fourth and probably best installment of ""A Star is Born"" work is the amazing direction of Bradley Cooper and the stunning acting and singing performances from both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. And ""Shallow"", my god what an incredible song.No part of this movie is as strong as its first third, which climaxes with Jack and Ally performing Shallow on stage. You can see the courage building up on Ally's face, as Jack starts playing Shallow - incredibly well acted, especially by Lady Gaga - what a scene.The second third is still great. It highlights Ally's career taking off and Jack's personal issues becoming more and more of a problem, which results in their relationship breaking apart step by step.The last third is definitely the weakest, as both the musical part and the storytelling take a big hit. The ending is better than the rest of the last third, but it is still unable to reach the quality of the first hour and a half, at least in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Loved this film Bradley Cooper IS Amazing,"The movie exceeded expectations, which were high as it was, I was tearing up watching the trailer!
I've always thought Bradely Cooper is so underrated. His roles are so varied and he is an incredible actor who doesn't really get the recognition he deserves. In this role, he completely transformed into Jackson Maine. You are not watching Bradely Cooper play Jackson Maine... You are watching Jackson Maine.,Nice surprises with David Chapelle and Andrew Duce Clay, who just may get a supporting actor nod.

I always believe love can conquer all, sadly Jackson is battling his demons and is troubled. He meets Ally and you can see he falls instantly in love as she's so humble and seeing Gaga without makeup shows her natural beauty.
Both are so talented, the music is fabulous and the love they have is something we can only dream to find once in a lifetime.
Ally is so compassionate and supportive, she shelters him and I love how she stands by her man and he is so proud of her.

Best movie of the year by far!,"First off, the acting in this movie. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper had great chemistry in this film. Of course, everybody at this point knows that Cooper's a great actor, but not a lot of people know that Lady Gaga is a fantastic actress as well and it shows in this movie. She deserves to be nominated for -hell, she should win- an academy award. She came across so genuine and like a real person that you can relate to. In every scene, she stole it. Bradley Cooper just turned himself into Jackson. He took voice lessons to work on his singing and he learned to play guitar. Bradley Cooper also directed this movie. It's his first time and it doesn't show. His directing in this movie seemed so professional like Krasinski, and I hope he keeps directing. Now, this film is a musical, and the music in this film is fantastic. I love all the songs in this film. The lyrics and tone were both meaningful to what was happening in the movie. When a scene was sad the song would be sad along with it. The Cinematography in this film was also stunning. The lighting, like the music, helped set the tone of each scene. If it was going to be crazy the lighting was more intense but it was calm the lighting was calmer. The last thing I want to talk about is the realistic relationship between the two main characters. It doesn't show a constant happy couple but shows how couples go through ups and downs but stick together no matter what. In the end, ""A Star is Born"" is a great movie that you should check out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Dramatic and natural love story, just prepare your tissues to cry","Dear Lady Gaga fans, I am with you. A Star is Born is a proof that Lady Gaga can do both acting and singing. Her acting is great, so natural, funny, full of meaning, and memorable. Bradley Copper is also fantastic. The main story of the movie is so simple, about how an ordinary singer girl named Ally finds her true love, coincidentally, a famous singer, then they build up an empire together, but the problem of the man is embarrassing Ally in her career. The scenes and plots are dramatic and natural, because all tended to create the love story. I really like the Director and Screenwriter idea to make Lady Gaga to be herself while acting and to replaced her own story to have role as Ally. I believe in every scenes she played, there contained also her entire true life; about how being in love, being in success, having international award, being famous, having trouble, then being sad, and being holding everything she believes to be happy after all.

"Great surprise, to me...","What a surprise! I approached this film, with a slight hint of romantic stupid for the mass ... and, instead, surprise! The actors are true, in the clear and, if desired, banality of the type of characters; but they are true, the life described is true, and there is not much of exalted or fake. Lady Gaga (i do not listen, but i know how to be a singer of absolute talent, sold to the world of pop music) is endless: beautiful, real, meaty, shameless to be seen beautiful in his adorable physical imperfections, good! Beautiful character; Cooper is able to carve out the role of shoulder and give her the stage, and this is from mature actors. I would say that as a first director has got it right on everything. We are not facing a masterpiece, but a film certainly mature and aware of its ""normality"", as normal we are, ordinary people, and they, famous people, basically we are all people, who try to go beyond their own ""shallow"". A word on ""Shallow"", in fact... it's been about 30 years that a song did not make me cry.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A Star was Always Here,"And the Oscar goes to...!!! This is the first thing that will come up to your mind once you have finished watching this treasure of a movie. The second thing is guessing the category, and I bet you will go for all of them.This movie is the fourth version of the same story, where each of the ways it has been told (each one of them) has something different that identifies itself: #1. The original version wasn't a musical, #2. Was something Over the Rainbow, with Judy Garland on it, #3. Felt like you were at Woodstock and rock and rolling and #4. It feels like a real story adapted to today's times.Bradley Cooper directs, produces, writes, acts, sings and performs. He is simply fantastic on his role as a singer who is going through a rough path. That is, until his path crosses with the one of Lady Gaga. Then, you forget about him and sorely focus on her. All your attention is drawn to her, because she is the movie. She is basically playing herself, and it is here, while you are watching this movie, that you truly realize what an amazing singer she is (even more if you are not a fan of her work) and also that she is not a bad actress. On the contrary, she can act, and if you think that as she is playing a singer role it's easy for her, go watch the fifth season of American Horror Story and check for yourself what she can really do in front of the camera.Then (of course) there is the music. The forever actor in this kind of movies. Real, up to date music. It doesn't mind if you are not into country or pop music, you will definitely enjoy this movie and once you leave the theatre, you will go to get the movie's soundtrack as soon as possible.

One of the best films of 2018,Must admit to not having great expectations of a star is born. Pleasantly surprised to report that it is one of the best films of 2018.The film tells the story of Jack (Bradley Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga) who are surprisingly thrown together. Jack is an aging rock and roll performer whilst Ally is a down trodden singer. The film is made by the performances of the two leads who are both outstanding. You feel very little empathy for characters in so many films nowadays. With Star is Born it as if you become the characters who go through a roller coaster of emotions during the movie. In addition to this many of the supporting characters are also very rounded and interesting. It also makes you realize why so many celebrities struggle with the demands of fame.If you don't catch it at the cinema make sure you take a look when it hits the small screen.,8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I'll Always Remember Them This Way ♥,"There is something magnetic about this movie. I don't know if it's the amazing musical performances, the love story between Ally and Jack or the incredible chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga both on screen and outside which makes me feel that way. Probably the combination of both 3.Let's start with the musical score first. It's needless to say that each time Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper start performing, you're entering in another world. Of course I already knew that Gaga is a very talented performer but in this movie, she blew me away. She trades her eccentric costumes and make-up for a natural look making her almost unrecognizable and much more attractive. All we have left of the Gaga we all know is her incredible voice. And that's all we need.Bradley, on his end, blew me away as well. I know he's a talented actor but I never imagined how a lovely voice he has or how great of a guitar player he is. I know he took lessons to become Jackson but you need to have already something within yourself to be able to reach that level. That huge load of work paid off!But what makes this film so amazing is the amazing chemistry between each other. Some may say that's just acting but no. Each time we see them together, you're feeling a connection which cannot be faked. And this relationship gives so much strength to the love story between Jack and Ally. It feels authentic and raw, never fading away. When you see the interviews, you can feel there is a huge amount of respect and care for each other.

I enjoyed it basically because I like Bradley Cooper,"Ok i'll be honest. at first I didn't know this movie was a remake for about the hundredth time.... This in itself definitely costs it brownie points.I've been a fan of Bradley Cooper for a number of years now and I really liked the idea of him directing his own movie as well as starring in it especially with someone as notable as Lady Gaga.But what did I think of this film? well... i'll be honest... i thought it was ok overall but that's it... it's just ok..... the only thing i truly found oscar worthy of this movie was Lady Gaga, she was nothing short of exceptional as she always is when it comes to her singing especially the final song she sings ""i'll never love again"" or whatever its called... it's a pretty emotional singing scene but all the other characters i found were just flat and one dimensional, especially Coopers character who is just drawn up as a very generic style of rock musician and a typical drug user with a serious drinking problem.... it's nothing we haven't seen before so therefore it's nothing unique or memorable....The biggest problem I have with Coopers character is he is sometimes very hard to understand over all the background noise in alot of his scenes and it may be plausible being so drug and alcohol induced as his character was portrayed but trying to watch him on screen was at times just frustrating trying to work out what he was saying.As a guitarist myself and the owner of a Gibson Les Paul I couldn't help but notice the abundance of Gibson product placement on display here.... almost EVERY guitar you see in this movie is a Gibson of some kind.... I don't know what kind of deal this film company had with Gibson but you can't tell me there WASN'T a deal made between the two.... that many Gibson guitars appearing in one movie is no co-incidence...Overall I didn't mind this movie but it's not one I would probably watch again, it's basically just a remake dulled up as a modern day chick flick. if you're a fan of Brad Cooper or Gaga you will enjoy it and probably have tears in your eyes by the end but if neither of these two stars interest you, you are going to be pretty bored with this one.... Not a bad movie but definitely not Bradley Coopers best film by a long shot....",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Just about the perfect film,"I've only ever given 3x 10* ratings. The only reason this is a 9* is due to minimal multiple re-watchability.It's a dichotomous 2 hours of gut wrenching beauty and pain. Cooper and Gaga's chemistry is on another level, both delivering outstanding performances. The acting all round is exceptional, the cinematography superb, and the music world class.I cannot recommend enough watching this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Not engaging,"Lady Gaga can sing - this we know. She has penned some memorable hits - this we also know.
Unfortunately this film lacks enough evidence of this. I didn't leave with any tune stuck in my head and neither was enough time given to showing her character to be a real talent who could wow audiences.
I didn't buy that her character and Bradley Cooper's were really head over heels besotted and in love. It just did not emotionally engage me and for the last half hour (remember we know how this is going to end) I just wanted the credits to roll.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Simply Amazing,"The often recreated and now 4th version of this film hit theaters on October 5th and I have to say, I was completely blown away by this movie. Bradley Cooper (also his directorial debut) and Stefani Germanoti (better known as Lady Gaga in her movie debut) play the star crossed lovers of a troubled rock star's descent and her meteoric rise in this modernized version of the film. Cooper plays Jackson Maine, an aging and burned out rock star who tours with his band, and drinks heavily. He is emotionally void and his life just takes him further into the bottle every day. After one of his concerts he hastily rushes off in his limo and stops at a bar to further his drinking. Unbeknownst to him it is a drag bar. The door man at the bar recognizes him and sets him up for further libation, telling him to stay for the show as his friend Ally will be performing. We are introduced to Ally in a previous scene. She is a frustrated limo driver with the musical talent and voice to rival anyone. When she performs The French song En Vive en Rose in full glam makeup and fake eyebrows, Jackson Maine is taken by her performance and realness as well as her amazing voice. You can see he is truly smitten with her even though she feels completely flawed by her looks and points this out to him as a defense mechanism especially her nose. ""I think you're beautiful"" is his honest response. They continue the evening by going to another bar, getting in a bar fight shopping for an ice pack and sitting on the ground of an empty parking lot, where Ally makes up a song on the spot and belts out a few lyrics. Their quasi date ends and she is taken home to a where she lives with her loving father (brilliantly played by Andrew Dice Clay) But before she goes in Jackson asks her to come to his show later that night. After some coaxing and the fact that she hates her job she is then whisked away on a private jet to his show. It is there he tells the audience that he met a girl and she wrote a song that he wants to perform for the crowd. This is one of the most powerful scenes of the movie. The ballad ""Shallow"" which I predict will be sung in every Karaoke bar from now to eternity is the best song in the movie. Cooper can really sing too.Seeing Lady Gaga stripped down from the glamour, make up and glitz of the red carpet that I am so used to seeing is what sells the movie. It's as raw as we get to see her and she completely runs with it, her talent on full display. To his credit, Cooper directs the movie with a steady cam and close ups showing the realism of their budding relationship. Their chemistry is real. The constant strain and mistakes he shows as the flawed Maine makes him damaged yet empathetic. You really root for him to gain control of his life after every tumble.The second half of the movie delves further into their relationship as they get married. Ally's career takes off like a rocket as her talent is too much to be just Jackson's sidekick at his concerts. She puts out her own album with her new Manager Rez who to me, was a caricature of every British English pompous music producer (think Simon Cowell) Ally does everything she can to support Jackson as her star continues to burn bright, but his reckless ways, continual drinking, drugging and gradual hearing loss makes the downward spiral even sadder to watch.This culminates in the most cringe inducing moment as she wins the Grammy for best new artist and he drunkenly stumbles on the stage as she is giving her speech and....well. Let's just say, the audience I saw it with let out an audible gasp at what transpired. He has finally hit rock bottom. He checks into a rehab facility. He is full of remorse and after completing the program returns home to the support and love that Ally has for him. But it is still marred by his uncertainty. He feels he is not good enough for her. Ally's manager tells him as much and is just waiting for him to wreck her again in the future. I won't go into the details of the end of the movie. Jackson does what he thinks is the best thing for Ally. But, the ending left me gutted. I looked around the theater and could see wet glistening eyes and heard soft and muffled sobbing all around me. I can't remember the last time a movie pulled me in emotionally the way this one did. I predict Oscars for best picture, best director, Best Actor and Actress and best song at next year's awards. Deservedly so. This movie has stuck with me for the past few days and I have been listening to all the songs on Spotify. That's as great a compliment I can give this wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Viewer Is Bored,"Lady Gaga is quite good, in an 'Oh, she can act as well as sing' sort of way. But she sacrifices her edginess.Bradley Cooper is one of those American actors whose name sounds like a corporate lawyer and whose performances have about as much charisma. Perhaps writing and directing as well as learning to play the guitar really badly was a bit of a strain.In the end this is no more than a 'tribute movie'; a tribute to the Streisand/Kristofferson version.

Extraordinary!,"I started learning English (as a foreign language) listening to good rock and roll music and watching movies, and today I am an English language and literature teacher.

But this movie, oh my God, I am trying to find the right words, is unbelievably real, emotional, filled with heartbreaking relationships, great acting, even greater singing. So many talented people at the same place. I knew Lady Gaga was an amazing singer, and Bradly Cooper, great respect to you man, and thanks for this movie, and for those wonderful songs. I truly love it! I am looking forward to see you receiving Oscars for every nomination! Love, Vesna",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
This movie truly uncovers new material,"""If we've been around long enough, we think we know 'A Star Is Born.'"" Uh uh, not this time. Here, both the actors (including the supporting actors) and the screenwriters have uncovered new material.First, we see a juxtaposition of entirely different musical genres - country-acoustic and techno-pop, both in the hands of masters. Actor and Actress demonstrate their respective abundant skills. We enjoy seeing the ever-versatile ""Lady Gaga"" in three ways: out-of-makeup, in her chosen element, and in evening cocktail dress. We see a glimpse of the highly-choreographed and well-rehearsed processes which bring her shows to us. Likewise we see a ""talented audience-connecting guitarist, doing the same with nothing but a guitar.""We enjoy a plot-line that carefully never throws the ""descending arc"" character under the bus - never shows him as ""washed up"" - but instead shows an auditorium full of people attending his memorial service ... after a death that you never actually see.Most of all, this movie centers very realistically upon the human tragedy that is substance abuse - including very-sincere efforts to escape from it which sometimes don't succeed. It shows the reality of interventions by others, which once again sometimes don't succeed. It shows, also, that sometimes neither ""the love of a spouse"" nor ""the love of a brother"" - - - succeed.At the end of the movie - I grieved for, and with, both lead characters, and with the many supporting characters who were in their own way caught up in the tragic story-arc. And yet, I still felt hope. Substance abuse is a tragedy that we probably will never manage to get rid of in our society, and here - masterfully staged and executed on all points - is an illustration of just what it costs. Oscars® were richly deserved.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Electric and Real,"One of the reasons this film sticks out to me and has remained a favorite of mine for years, is that I saw it for the first time about a year before it was released. I remember original shots from the movie that were taken out and the times that doors closed on screen without any sound effect accompanying... But most of all, I remember the twelve months between October of 2017 and October of 2018 where I was completely unable to hear the soundtrack again and how I thought about it every single day for a year.I should preface this review by saying I'm aware that it's the fourth iteration of an old movie from the thirties... And no, I don't have any interest in watching any of the previous three.From the opening shots, introductory lines of each central character, and high vibrational musical interludes, this film's personality is present from start to finish. Each character comes onto the scene in screams, drowning in alcohol or defying authority and effectively commands the screen. The electric performances from every actor cannot be overstated. Where Bradley Cooper was hiding his insane vocal talents all these years remains a mystery, but my god did he rise to the challenge of playing a believable rockstar.The film boasts a substantial run time at 2 hours and 16 minutes, and uses every moment to showcase a burning bright, whirlwind romance that descends into a tragic tale of the dark side of fame and wealth. The organic musical performances of live vocals in front of real crowds bring a realism to the story that makes it feel incredibly real. When there are clips of the characters performing on Saturday Night Live or attending the Grammy Awards, celebrity cameos by Alec Baldwin and Halsey playing themselves enrich the world by tenfold.The music of the film really acts as a third main character within Lady Gaga (playing Ally) and Bradley Cooper's (playing Jack) love story. They share incredible moments on stage together while singing at the beginning as Jack skyrockets Ally's career, but also share tender moments at home writing songs together where no one can see them. It's a language they use to speak to each other and as their sounds change throughout the film, it signifies changes in their relationship as well as their journeys as individuals.A Star Is Born is truly a masterpiece and I will always go back and watch it. And if I'm not watching it, I'm listening to the soundtrack. I would recommend this film to lovers of live music and dramatic love stories of artists. Be aware there is heavy drug and alcohol use and abuse, as well as themes of suicide and addiction. Bring tissues!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
weak script and clunky direction from Cooper,"I may be in the minority but this film was extremely mediocre in my opinion. The acting in this film however, was phenomenal, though sometimes Cooper's character mumbled his lines which made him very hard to follow especially when his character was so dialogue heavy, the music is also very well done. However, that's all the positives i can think of for this film.
This film seemed like it had great potential but Cooper just wasn't the right director for the film, his style just didn't bring the best version of the film out. The script itself felt very oddly paced, the first act was fine and probably my favourite portion of the film, however after transitioning into the second act, the pacing felt extremely clunky, perhaps on paper it was perfectly fine, but editing ultimately messed up the pacing of the film. This could've been in large part due to the high amount of time jumping throughout the film, these all felt very sudden and clunky for the most part as the passage of time was basically negated in the film, there were so many major events during each time period in the film but there was just such an uneven distribution of focus for specific key moments in both the main character's storylines in each period. (some key scenes are ridiculously short while some just refused to end) i didn't feel like i got enough screentime in some of these key scenes to really buy into Gaga and Cooper's character's issues, and fully empathise with their situation. The result was a film with potential for greatness but ultimately left me feeling disappointed, due to seemingly sloppy execution of what could've otherwise been a fantastic film with a great script.
Cooper's direction had me incredibly confused, perhaps i just don't understand what he's trying to convey, but his style felt all over the place, his shot composition felt very ugly and strange, i never really felt connected with his style, this meaning how in tense moments of the film for example, his direction just didn't seem to correctly capture the emotion it was supposed to be going for. There were also some awkward editing, you'll know it when you see it as it happens pretty frequently but it was very distracting and took me out of the experience, and some strangely short scenes (like 5-10 seconds a piece) which honestly added nothing to the film yet kinda just got left in, i guess it was Cooper's idea for transitioning from one scene to another but it just felt silly and useless. I honestly just didn't think he was the right guy to direct this film, his style just didn't emanate the tone of the film and the clunky pacing of the script/film just took me out of the experience too.

An Expertly-Crafted Okay Story.,"The directing, cinematography, music, and, especially, acting are flawless in this modern update of the classic story. There's a nice infusion of humor in there as well. But a movie can only be as good as its script.And therein lies the problem: the story isn't very good. It's engaging and fast-paced, but one question lingers in the mind of the viewer once the credits roll: ""What was the point?""Nobody learns anything in this film. No one grows as a character. Is there commentary on society? Yeah, a little bit.The ending is emotional, but I believe the overabundance of music is manipulative in that sense.

Lady Gaga can act,"Here's my review of ' A star is born ' . The movie is directed by Bradley Cooper starring Cooper and Lady Gaga. Both of them were brilliant in this movie esp Lady Gaga considering how this is her debut from what I heard. The story is about this celeb singer with alcohol issues who then meets another singer at a bar and takes her to stardom while getting romantically involved with her. This movie felt like a fusion of '8 mile' and 'Begin again'. After 8 mile this is probably one of the best songs made for a movie. The music is just amazing , like go back and download right away sort of amazing. It has a lot of dark themes such as identity crisis , ego , jealousy and some good morales so either you're a person who gets them or you can just have fun with the songs . Either way it's pretty entertaining. However there are some scenes where the dialogue is too long and you're waiting for those convos to get over but it's only in a few scenes.In the end I felt Bradley Cooper's a great director especially with dramas and a ' star is born ' comes with great characters , an amazing list of songs , morales and everything a good drama requires.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

NOT BAD FOR WHAT IT IS...!,"An okay remake (the fourth by count) of the perennial favorite starring Bradley Cooper (in his directing debut) & Lady Gaga. Working better as 2 lost souls coming together to make music than a love affair (ultimately I didn't buy it since she had ample examples around her growing up for her to not fall for this loser), the musical sequences win out just barely. I still hold the original from the 30's starring Fredric March/Janet Gaynor as the best version but this one has enough to satisfy audiences who will probably only know this copy.

This film from the beginning has you enticed and brought straight into the storyline. Jack (Bradley Cooper) plays the part of the troubled individual with a heart of gold so very well! You instantly feel the connection when Jack and Ally (Lady Gaga) meet and it's magic from there. The emotions that you feel from that film all the way through is real and you take it away with you even after watching. For me the situations were relatable! It was an incredible film and I cried lots throughout and even leaving the cinema. The music is just out of this world! Some strong ballads there! Both Bradley and Lady should be so proud!

An Emotional Rollercoaster,"This movie might not be the best directed or best scripted film of the year, but it is the best acted and most powerful of the year. I could feel the instant connection between Jack and Ally, and I felt the tension in Jack's heart as he tried to not mess life up.This film had a lot of pre-release intrigue because it was Coopers's director debut or maybe people liked the idea of seeing Lady Gaga act for two hours without makeup or flamboyant antics. A Star is Born totally delivers on the hype. It is funny, chill-inducing, powerful, and heartbreaking. Bradley Cooper shows his diversity as an actor when you compare this role to his roles in Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle, or American Sniper. He really makes you believe he's a rockstar with an addiction that eats at him. Jack's happy, carefree personality is instantly contagious, and by the end of the movie, I felt like Jack was my best friend. He is a good singer for being an actor and Lady Gaga is a phenomenal actress for being a singer.A couple nitpicks. The dialogue sometimes feels a little cliche and the story lacks complexity beyond Jack and Ally's relationship.

Bite Size review!,"JUDGEment: A Star is Born - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517451/9/10Drama and movies with emotions don't usually get to me. I am normally disconnected with movies which is just how I view movies. This is one of the first movies in a long time that has naturally evoked the emotions of happy, sad, and excited by just watching the movie. Not knowing about the source material I came into this just know what the trailers were about. The movie is very well paced, edited well, and the story is top notch.Cooper and Gaga were amazing together and the whole cast played their parts very well. The story is quite predictable but that doesn't hurt the story at all. It is so well acted that it is worth it. I saw this in Dolby Digital Premium Format and it was the right decision. The concert sounds and the musical moments are accentuated greatly in the premium format. This movie has a feeling that it will be a classic, one that we will look back on like we do movies of the past and say this was a classic.TL;DR: Saw this in Dolby Premium Format, SEE IT THIS WAY. (If you can that is) The movie is much better with the large sound format. The story was amazing, it hit all the right notes, story was great but a bit predictable, but it is one of the few movies I've seen that made me feel the emotions of the movie and that doesn't happen often.

My problem with the movie, though it's just me, and might not be for everyone, is that towards the end, the focus turns more to Cooper and his unraveling, rather than the rise and 'maturing' of Gaga's character.Apart from that, the movie is great. It's got a couple of songs that are worth a relisten, Bradley really gets to show off his acting skills, and more surprisingly, Gaga shows that she can act as well.Good movie, recommended if you love tearjerkers...and still recommended if you aren't.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Too many storylines,"As predicted, the music was great. Bradley Cooper was fantastic as ever and his voice holds up well and makes him a believable music star. It was great to see Lady Gaga sing in a different style than we are used to and to see her act as a non-celebrity. Of course her singing is flawless and beautiful, but she's really not a strong enough actor to make Ally multi-dimensional or to bring enough depth to her character to illustrate a journey through the story. Cooper's character, though more detailed and interesting, suffered a similar lack of character arch. This was probably due to the inherent difficulties acting in and directing a film at the same time. The story also had two slightly conflicting points of view (his addiction and her rise to stardom) and neither was able to speak loudly enough to create a real sense of depth or sympathy to either character nor did it allow there to be a palpable sense of chemistry between the two. However the movie had it's terrific moments too, though mostly between Sam Elliot and Cooper. Both seasoned actors, possess the skills to create a backstory that carried all the way through to their current conflicts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
An enjoyable movie,"It is a good movie, well directed and with nice ideas. Good script, even too tragic maybe.

All Cooper,"After watching this film seven times I come to the same conclusion. Bradley Cooper gave an Oscar worthy performance in this film.
Not to mention he directed amongst other titles. His performance as a intoxicated musician was remarkable. He is the highlight
of the movie. True talented professional. Bradley your performance touched me. Thank you",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Lady Gaga knocks it out of the park,"A few years ago on the radio in the UK, the DJ (Paul O'Grady) announced he was about to play a new duet released by Tony Bennett with Lady Gaga. He was somewhat dismissive of it before he played it, basically saying that we wasn't expecting it to be very good. But to be fair after the song had finished, he publicly ate his words and said ""How wrong I was - that was fantastic!"".That's pretty much how I think a lot of people might react to this film. Anyone who's followed Lady Gaga's career will know she's massively talented and fearless. If you haven't seen it, I would recommend viewing the youtube clip of her singing ""Gimme Shelter"" live onstage with the Rolling Stones a few years ago, quite amazing. So I fully expected her to belt out the show-stopping musical numbers in this film and knock it out of the park (which she does). The surprise is the depth and subtlety that she brings to her acting performance. Her transformation from waitress and part time club performer to Grammy winning superstar is eminently believable. The scenes I enjoyed most were the earlier ones where Jackson Maine (Cooper) gets her to believe in herself and her talent. The scene where he gets her onstage to duet with him for the first time was wonderful. Their early relationship is beautiful to watch and even the sex scene (I think there's only one?) is cut commendably short. My only criticism is the scene where Gaga is in the bath and as Cooper storms out of the bathroom she is seen briefly standing up naked - was that really necessary?The music and singing from both leads throughout is outstanding. The rest of the supporting cast put in great performances too. There is nothing to fault in this film, so 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

The Best Version,"I saw the trailer for this movie and I was in. I had never seen the previous versions but Gaga's voice had me. I don't always care for the subject matter of her songs but her voice always captures my attention. I knew that the trailer is always cut to give me that excitement for the film so I fully expected the movie to not land quite as well but I thought, as the buzz machine started, that this might be a solid 3-4 star film for me.Bradley Cooper is a decent actor. Gaga is a phenomenal singer. This movie already had me more interested than its predecessors.Then I start hearing that even though this is Cooper's first outing a director, it's super well done. Not only that, I hear Gaga is quite the talented actress. Hmmm. Is this the Hollywood hype machine trying to sell a big movie or is this real buzz?Suffice it to say, I was feeling excited as I headed to theater on Monday night.When I think back on the film there are a few things that jump off the screen at me. However, there is one thing that didn't jump off the screen at me. The direction.In some ways, as I look back, this may impress me just as much as the things that did stick out as great. There are directors whose work is in your face. Tarantino is that kind of guy. You know when you are watching a Tarantino movie because of the way his camera moves and the way the violence splashes around the frame.In ""A Star Is Born,' Cooper shows a restraint that I imagine is very difficult for a first timer. He doesn't lean on a lot of in your face movement or overly indulgent 'artsy' shots to make armchair film critics feel like the cinematography is good because they noticed it. Instead, he lets his scenes play out patiently and doesn't let the camera be a distraction from the portrayals of emotion the actors are giving.As a result, you barely notice the camera at all and you get to feel caught up in the moments that are being shown to you. Snappy and unreal dialogue can be fun in the right setting but here we get conversations full of the moments where people mumble a little, have to think of their next word, or choke up in all of the nuanced ways we do as humans.Because of this focus on the performance, Cooper goes further with the subject of love and self destruction than most other movies with such a broad appeal. Far from a Romantic Comedy, this film treats love as a serious matter. It understand that the waves that catch us up also draw us out to sea where we can't seem to fight the current. That is nothing to crack jokes about.Serious couples know this and will see it echoed on screen not, perhaps, in the specific circumstances of the film but in the dynamics of the films main characters. Just as there are no 'and then they lived happily ever afters' in real life, this film doesn't mess around with happiness untinged with fear or doubt.It doesn't pretend that mental illness is easy to live with for either person or that a twelve step program is a magic cure all. It rests solidly in the knowledge that issues like that are lifetime issues that need lifetime commitments and lifetime love to match.It revels in those sorts of complexities and rather than alienating people with a story of hard love it draws them in because we all long to love and be loved like that.Luckily for Cooper, every actor in this cast is batting a thousand. Sam Elliot as the older brother is frustrating and heartbreaking in his normal salt of the earth wisdom and stubbornness. Bradley is a fine actor and with something real to play, rather than the less emotional and pretty boy characters, he really shines.The real stand out though is Lady Gaga. What a powerhouse performance. Obviously, drawing on her own life and career helps but people who have never acted or been around actors don't realize that the vulnerability she gives into in this film is not easy. It means drudging up your worst experiences and dearest moments and holding them in heart; not in secret, but right out there in the open to be documented and analyzed by a world of people they do not know or have any reason to trust. This performance is power.Of course this movie is more than acting. None of this works if the music isn't good. I knew I would like Gaga. I usually do. What I didn't expect was Bradley Cooper standing right next to her and not being outclassed.The music in this movie is so wonderful because they aren't merely musical performances you are watching. They are acting moments where you can see their thoughts behind their eyes and the ways that the music reinforces those emotions and rise up from them. They are songs that don't feel like they are being sung by a grammy winner and a movie star. They end up feeling more like duets between the characters they are portraying and that is a huge accomplishment in a film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Not great, but good","This isn't really my kind of movie, but the wife really wanted to see it and it has good reviews so I thought why not?The movie is enjoyable, very good at the start then dips towards the end but certainly worth a watch. I'm surprised with the amount of praise Gaga is getting though, her acting was pretty ""meh"" for the most part, she absolutely shines and was very emotive when singing, but as a singer you expect that, the rest of her performance was pretty average although not enough to take you out of the story. I was really impressed with Bradley Cooper though, he plays his role very well and I wasn't expecting it at all.The story is a fairly standard ""rags to riches"" tale for Gaga and fairly standard ""aging rocker addicted to everything"" tale for Cooper and while they do it well enough, the pacing seemed off, it seemed to drag out certain moments and rush past others, leaving the ending a little disjointedWithout giving too many spoilers, the scene at the end with the dog was just classic tear baiting and really dulled any emotional impact for me, completely unnecessary and rather than being engrossed in the film I could only think ""classic Hollywood""In summary a good film, certainly worth a watch but not quite worthy of the glowing praise it seems to be getting",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Star Is Born succeeds on the back of great musical scenes and performances,"While I'm not sure it's a complete or well-rounded picture, it's easy to get lost in the numerous things it does very well. Cooper and Gaga are excellent as the leads and play off of each other well in terms of energy. Cooper is the heart of the movie, as it's really a character study masquerading as a musical romance, and he plays the role with subtlety and a great range of emotions. Gaga frankly stole the show for me, as her expressions and reactions to Cooper felt so real and gave us a baseline for their relationship. I didn't think her character was written well and wasn't given enough distinctive characteristics, but she adds significant and needed depth in her line delivery and high-energy performance. The script on the whole didn't impress me, seeming predictable and cliche at points and not having consistency in focuses throughout. It could've been a more coherent and emotionally devastating rise to the climax if it had been more intentional in how Jack's alcoholism affected his everyday life and the psychology and struggle behind the addiction, but instead it just felt like an undeveloped plot tool. I thought Cooper's direction was on the whole excellent, particularly in the musical scenes where his shot selection and lighting were phenomenal. The musical scenes didn't just pause the plot to play music, but were shot in a way that continued to develop it, and the songs themselves were very good. However, the scene where he proposes was completely jarring to me and felt ridiculously unrealistic. I found the movie to generally improve as it progresses, with the early scenes requiring serious leaps of faith in Jack latching onto this specific girl and the unexplained and immediate attachment they have (as with many movie romances, their relationship and why they're in love is never explained). I also found a few early scenes bordering on an uncomfortable power dynamic where Ally was a toy for him to feel alive and excited and he could pluck her from her life and have her love immediately. The realism and emotional attachment picked up as the movie went along, and the late conversations between them and final song both held serious emotional weight. It's a good, skillfully made movie with excellent headlining performances, but a few inconsistencies keep it from being a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"I came for the music, but everything as was slow","A Star is Born stars Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. Bradley Cooper plays a washed up rock star who is a drug addict and alcoholic who accidently meets Lady Gaga and he is so captivated by her singing voice that he decides that she should work with him. First thing I want to point out is that Bradley Cooper can sing. The very first scene when he starts singing for everybody I was surprised because all of his movies I haven't heard him sing, so for him to do his first movie where he we hear him sing is impressive. He also directs this as well and he has an idea of how he wants this to be made and what should happen in this scene, so I appreciate that he stuck with his vision. And as a first time director he pulls it off and I respect his admiration for his work. The soundtrack is terrific and I loved every song that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga did together, but I kind of had a suspicious feeling that it was more Lady Gaga singing then Bradley Cooper. Don't get me wrong I find Lady Gaga to be a really good singer, but I would've liked to see Bradley Cooper sing more because he does have a good singing voice. However, the pacing of this movie is so slow as I was checking my watch a couple of times and finding some scenes to be incredibly long that they just dragged forever to make a point. While I appreciate the directing the script could've used some improvement as there were some scenes that had great dialogue and some that weren't so good. I cared more about the singing than I did for the script, as when certain areas kept dragging and dragging and then we get to the singing aspect of it, that's when I became fascinated. But after the singing stopped, I was wondering when we might get another song. It isn't until the ending that caught me off guard cause I had an idea of where this might be going. I had a completely different idea of how this would end, but they went with another direction that was totally unexpected that left me shocked. Overall, I will say that this has a great soundtrack with amazing vocals from Bradley and Lady Gaga, but as a story it could do with some improvements.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

My Movie of 2018.,"I was ignorant to the storyline of A Star Is Born and the previous renditions of it when I went to see this last night. I went to watch it mainly because I was curious to see how Lady Gaga would perform in a full-length film, having enjoyed her performance in American Horror Story. 2.5 hours later, I emerged from the depths of the silent cinema, tears still rolling down my face. This was such a powerful film and a triumph for Bradley Cooper. He can act, direct, sing, play guitar - what a talent. As for Gaga - she is a revelation. I'm sure this is the first in a long line of main acting roles for her, and it's not hyperbole to say her performance could be Oscar-worthy. Cinematically it was also a delight - close camera angles put you into the intimacy of the scenes, whilst the final fifteen minutes had the entire audience holding their breath (and crying). When the credits rolled, everyone in the packed cinema just sat motionless, stunned into silence. I drove home with tears still rolling down my face!This is the best film I've seen this year by a hundred miles, and possibly the best film I've seen in the past five.

This opinion has not altered after viewing this latest version.It would help it I were a fan of Lady Gaga's music, but I have never understood her appeal. Like a lot of modern music and films, there is something about this film that fails to engage me. The scenes with constant swearing, put me off as it has done with so many other productions. This has to be a real low point in Sam Elliot's career.The one real positive of the film, is some of the music, especially the rock songs. But even the soundtrack couldn't prevent me from switching the film off half way through.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Maybe I have a life,"But I'm sorry, the music- the actual songs were terrible. The film was so shallow, really lacking depth In some really important parts. Trying to sell GaGa as having a large nose and too ugly to make it in the business nowadays is a hard sell- to say the least . Her pain over that also a hard sell.
The character development really lacked .. it was hard to believe in a once in a lifetime love that I couldn't see ... I mean the chemistry of these stars is off the hook. ( everyone tapping foot waiting for Bradly to get divorced and hook up with Gaga)
But the script didn't back up what we saw. The plot also didn't back up what we saw.
We are supposed to believe so many things - and it just was not there in the writing or the scenes.
As far as acting goes- I was stunned by Bradly. I mean, he steals this show in every way possible. He outshines Gaga in every single scene. He is just brimming with charisma and talent.
His direction! The direction of this film is Oscar Worthy. There are some stunning moments as far as direction is concerned.
The script is beyond terrible and so is the music.
The 70s version had like four #1s ... the music is played on the radio still today!
It would have been cool to say the same about this film.
Gaga didn't have the same kind of depth.... as Bradley here. Their characters are mismatched and in that way- the love isn't believable. For this film we needed to see a really remarkable and unique female lead with real depth, not just vanity and immaturity. We needed to believe she was worth his chasing and we don't.
Bradley got my attention so hard here though... I never thought of him as really talented or having that depth as an actor and he really changed my mind.
I wish they could have worked on other aspects of this film to make it one of the greats.

A love story that is founded on some truly great chemistry between our two leads. It is a good story of success. Troughout the film we see these two grow apart and grow back together, Lady Gagas character becomes increasingly more famous, leaving Bradley Cooper in the back, who is a character who I was curious about, as we know little about him but are let in on the fact that he is a very sintmental person and a highly tragic one with a backstory of depression and drunkenness. You did feel sorry for him. You feel sorry for him as you feel good for her as she gets that success. When they are together, signing or simply hanging about, things get to a rather tender sate, to a rather sweet time. It is a movie of moments like that. It has a classic quality to it to from that.Also being expertly directed, Cooper also serves as the man behind the camera here, and he frames and puts all the passion and vsison right in front. At the end it proves a sad tale, a tale of making something special, having something to say, never getting lost in an image. It is far to charming and enduring in its message and in its execution for me to not it to much for a bit of predictability now and then. Everything that works works much to well. The songs also, are truly beufiul, original, and real. Cooper set out to gives us this story, and it proved well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A Good Movie,"Jackson -aka Jack- Maine (Bradley Cooper) a popular rock star takes Ally (Lady Gaga) a waitress and singer in a Drag Bar to accompany him on stage and basically this is where a star is born. The song sung by both of them in this opening was the best song in the film. Very enjoyable. I mention this because the rest of the songs in the movie were not as good, no real hooks which is to say the melodies were not there, and, at times, it was hard to understand the lyrics. Oh, and sometimes the songs went the distance and we heard the whole piece. Not enjoyable. Song selection wasn't good.We see Ally's star rise and Jack's star diminish as he is way into alcohol and drugs, and he has a case of tinnitus. The chemistry between Jack and Ally is quite good and one would think there is something here worth preserving and leaving the egos behind. Doesn't happen that way.Oscar-wise, there is much talk about this movie. I would award the Best Actor Oscar to Bradley Cooper as he has done probably his best work ever. Lady Gaga was okay, but needs some acting help if she is to continue in the acting business. And generally, I am not smitten with her singing. Bradley Cooper directed this movie and did pretty good and we know this because we have long been told that to act in and direct the movie is not an easy task. In here Cooper's directing and his acting went smoothly and who knows maybe he'll get an Oscar for directing. That's okay.Notables: Sam Elliott as Bobby, Jack's older brother, who works for Jack; Dave Chappelle as George Stone who tries to give Jack sound advice that Jack ignores as he is too restless to settle in one place; Andrew Dice Clay as Ally's father, Lorenzo; Anthony Ramos as Ramon, Ally's close friend; Ron Rifkin as Carl who talks to Jack about his tinnitus; Rafi Gavron as Ramon, Ally's manager who changes her look and he tells Jack to get his act together because he is tired of cleaning up his mess; Greg Grunberg as Phil, Jack's driver.All in all this is a good movie, but not an Oscar worthy movie although Bradley Cooper deserves Oscar for Best Actor (7/10)Violence: Not really. Punches thrown.
Sex: No.
Nudity: Yes, but brief.
Humor: Yes, some good lines.
Language: Yes, but not much..

A good movie with nice music,"A Star is Born is a romantic musical drama movie directed by Bradley Cooper and stars Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Sam Elliott and Rafi Gavron in the leads.The movie is directorial debut for Bradley Cooper.The movie has it's own strong and weak points. The acting by Bradley Cooper is amazing, Lady Gaga was also ok. Sam Elliott was good. Music is beautiful and mesmerising but to some extent slow screenplay and halfhearted attempt from the co characters are the weak points of the movie. Slow Screenplay might bore certain viewers. The movie is not for everyone. The climax is touching and emotional.Cinematography is another strong aspect of the movie. A must watch for all romantic musical movie lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Am I the only one that wasn't so impressed?,"I just finished watching the last half hour of this movie after watching the first part last Sunday (but had to turn it off cause it was getting too late), which is now 5 days ago. I actually almost forgot I hadn't finished it yet.. Which is not a good sign!
Honestly the acting wasn't bad or anything, Cooper, Gaga and Elliott were believable and the chemistry between Cooper and Gaga was definitely there. Only thing with Gaga was I didn't really buy her first ""oh I'm an average girl on a big stage, now I'm getting shy"" performance, but ok she gets away with that.
Real problem for me is the movie itself, it just didn't capture me cause the storyline was too thin and to me it just felt like they filmed a bunch of scenes and then just pasted them together. It jumped from one moment into the other! Also it annoyed me that Ally was constantly soooo understanding towards her husband. He acted like a miserable a*hole with way too much selfpitty if you'd ask me, but I only saw them arguing once. And last but not least, I'm assuming that the 'star is born' part is supposed to be about her, but in the end it basically wasn't about her reaching fame, it was mostly about his decline..",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Lust, loss, and languish all rolled into this gem of a film.","I waa dubious at first about the Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga pairing at first, but I left the cinema looking when I can next come to see it. Lady Gaga embodied her character unbelievably well, but I think she could have had a greater transformation from start to finish. Bradley Cooper, what a performance as the drunken star everyone loves to hate! From start to finish, Cooper's character develops and you gradually see his downfall caused by alcoholism and drug addiction. For me this film touches on important issues such as the silent killer of men that is rarely discussed, suicide. I look forward to seeing another film directed by Cooper and hopefully we'll see Lady Gaga in more musicals, she certainly has a voice that far exceeds her pop songs.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Too long,I liked the movie but I didn't love it for one reason: it was way too long. The second half of the movie reminded me of a drawn-out soap opera with too many scenes that were just plain boring. Bradley Cooper is amazing and Lady Gaga lived up to all the hype around her performance - but the screenplay was the downfall of the movie.,,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Anything but dull, if you understand empathy and true love.","This film touches on some very under appreciated facts about alcohilism and mental illness, such as recognition that alcoholism is a disease. So many people through lack of empathy and understanding have a negative attitude towards issues, such as alcoholism and mental illness and that is gently but definitely touched upon here. The way Ally loves Jack is real, true acceptance if who he is and loves him anyway, it was regeshing in a climate where if you so much as cough at another human being you are severely reprimanded for being a terrible person, well the trutb is people are not perfect, not robots and I found it refreshing to watch a film that highlights the fact that people are not infallible and that says that is ok, it says that Love is worth more than fame and fortune and success and it is true. the references to Ally not looking appropriate based on individual appraisal points out lacking in society's attitudes to people in general rather than wanting to take raw talent as it is, there is always someone wanting to mould someone else into their own vision for their own ends. it does have a bit of a commercial feel, but at the end of the day the creators need to make their money, so they want it to appeal to the masses. I have not cried at a film like I cried to this literally in years. It really touched me. I disagree that it was entirely predictable. I think had it been predictable drivel like a lot of romantic films are, you would not have had the highs and the lows of the relationship. The story itself is slightly cheesy in places, and I can understand some of the criticism with regards to it being airy fairy and overtly fairytalesque. None of that however took away from the overall message, moral undertow and heartfelt intentions for me. What really resonated for me was the depth of the love between Ally and Jack. It was a wonderful reminder of the importance of true love in what is now a fairly materialistic and emotionally controlled time to be living in, it veered away from all the traditional views of how we should all behave like robots and concentrated on the beauty and uniqueness of being human and accepting flaws as being wonderful beautiful.

Incredible,"I heard about this movie over the summer, I knew my wife would want to see it, while I was open to going, it wasn't a ""must see"" for me. We went this afternoon, I was absolutely blown away! Bradley Cooper was absolutely amazing, his singing was spectacular but it was how he carried himself and expressed his character using non-verbals that really set him apart. Lady Gaga.. well, she proved to everyone that despite being an incredible musical talent, she truly is a star! She was vulnerable yet true to who she is, and just absolutely nailed the role!I was personally touched by several scenes, some I don't think really were meant to hit those chords when written, but the authenticity of the characters just came through and spoke to me.I rarely give a movie 10 stars, but they hit this one out of the park! Now I can't wait to see this one again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Moving Film,"I'm a huge Lady Gaga fan, so naturally I was incredibly excited to see this film. Her performance didn't disappoint. Her artistry can't be beat. She can sing, dance, and is a decent actress. There were some awkward moments with her parts, but she's a singer first, so I forgive her.Bradley Cooper was great, but I wish he didn't direct it. I felt like 90% of this movie was filmed with the camera in everyone's faces. Just huge faces everywhere taking up the whole screen. The script was strange at parts, with awkwardly long pauses and unnecessary melodrama. A lot of the story was underdeveloped, with Ally going from hating Jackson one minute to being madly in love with him the next. Some characters just pop in and out of nowhere, with no history or closure (Dave Chappelle is somehow one of Jackson's closest friends, yet we have no idea who he is, and aren't given a chance to find out).Unfortunately Bradley Cooper's directing abilities may just lose the Oscar, but I really want it to win, as Gaga was phenomenal.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Ally & Maine 4ever,"I can tell you this; I have a lot more respect for Lady Gaga now then ever. I knew she could sing, but I was not so familiar with her being an actress. In this film she totally proves that she has that potential. That might even be thanks to Bradley Cooper, who's not only an amazing actor in this film, but also a great director. His directorial debut was absolutely flawless. Hell, he can even sing flawlessly.What I love about this film is that ""A Star Is Born"" has been done before earlier, and this film does it very best to not copy anything from them, but only mimicking instead. It's still the same story, but the elements and the nature of the previous iterations is not the same here. And that's how you remake a film. Only mimicking, not copying.The main characters portrayed by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga has some of the best chemistry I've ever seen. I don't see two actors pretending that they're are in love, I see two human beings who genuinely love each other. These two sweethearts just shines together, and I love seeing them being together. Their chemistry is beyond precious. Even Sam Elliott has his bright moments in this film.I also love the songs they sing in this film. I was surprised to see Cooper being able to perform, and he's a very good singer. Gaga I knew could sing, but this time it's very refreshing to see her performing not only as an singer, but also an actress. Every emotion I see in her is just perfect. I don't care if she always had that talent or if it was thanks to Cooper's direction, she's just amazing in this film. Cooper proves once again that he can act as a champ, and considering that he's directing himself for the first time in a motion picture and handless it without a single problem makes me appreciate him as an real artist. There is no difficulty to understand why some of the viewers next to me were sobbing while Gaga was performing. It was literally nothing but pure beauty.An absolute outstanding musical romantic drama! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Well Made Hollywood Movie With An Interesting Insight Into The Lives of Successful Musicians,"I finally got around to seeing this movie and I am happy that I did. All the actors do an amazing job; I am especially impressed by Lady Gaga as she is first and foremost a singer. Bradley Cooper also make a stellar performance as always.One of the things that I like the most about the movie is that I feel like it depicts the life as a successful musician in an honest way. It shows both the good parts (thrill of performing in front of people, wealth) as well as the bad parts (people bothering you and taking pictures of you, risk of substance abuse, managers pushing you to become someone you're not and not having your best interest in mind).The thing I like the least about the movie is that it is such a typical American, Hollywood movie. That's just not my taste, and it made me pretty bored at times, even wishing that it would end. During the final scene I even looked at how much of the movie was left, which is not a good sign.I got a bit bored by the singing all the time. The songs were good, for sure, I just don't find it that entertaining to watch a musician perform on a stage without anything else happening.My favorite scene was when Jack brought Ally up on stage for the first time. It was really well done and powerful and actually brought tears to my eyes.I will most likely never see this movie again, but I understand that people like it and I am happy to have seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Lady Gaga the Lion Star,"I always thought that Lady Gaga is a bit exaggerated.
But not because of her clothes or hair, but because sometimes she exaggerates in doing something or thanking too much when it's not necessary.
Obviously she is very talented and gifted and what I wrote above is not criticism, but more like a guy who sees a young woman who might overreact things, but the fact that she is more talented or sexy sometimes, it makes you forgive her exuberance :)
In this movie overall she was cute, she acted great and her voice was the cherry from the top of the cake.
You can obviously see that despite of her hair or exaggerations (sometimes), she is a great character and soul.
A real lioness in my opinion.
The sound, music and voice were perfect in this movie.
But let's talk about other aspects as well.
I thought the scene from the beginning when she sings the French song is bit overreacted.... maybe if they would have polished that scene, everything would have been perfect.
Also the punch she gives to the guy in the bar is again another unnecessary embellishment because even though she is a lioness with great heart... she is still a sensitive woman.
Plus that in real life, maybe that guy would have reacted in some way :)
As a subjective opinion I also think blue, blonde and dark curly red hair suit her very much, but not light red :)
Her voice is a true power, voice of sensitive great lion with a big heart.
I think though in a few years she will be a perfect star from every point of view.
I also watched the Golden Globes where I saw she overreacted again with too many thanks and gratitude she has to everyone :)
I mean it's clear she is great and she is aware of that, but a simple gesture of gratefulness is enough I think.
Those who helped her and at some point launched her are just regular people in the end and not Gods from Mount Olympus.
She sang after all with all those great stars until now and she is already a personality in music.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Flawless and Extraordinary,"There are few films that have caused my anticipation level to reach the point of buying advance tickets and counting down the days to the premier.

I do believe Lady Gaga will earn an Oscar for her performance--she deserves it! And Bradley Cooper deserves an Oscar for directing and acting as well. I absolutely love everything about the artistic choices in this movie! From the moment Ally first went on stage with Jack, I decided I had to see this movie again on the big screen.I also pre-ordered the soundtrack and was happy to have it available to play this morning.

One of the best movies I've ever seen,"I can't remember the last time I expected to dislike a movie and ended up loving it to this extent. I actually had no intention of seeing 'A Star Is Born' but got invited along to it and decided to give it a chance. In exchange I was treated to 136 of the most enjoyable minutes of my life. I actually thought to myself at one point in the movie that I would be happy if this movie never ended. It was just so perfect in every way. The music sounded great, it was heart-warming, heart-breaking, inspirational and relatable in every aspect.There was so much to love about this film, but the thing that was simply the best for me was the love story between the main two characters 'Jack' and 'Ally'. I can't remember the last time I saw chemistry this good between two actors (you may have to go as far back as 'Titanic'). I didn't even recognise Lady Gaga until about the halfway part in the film when her character takes a visual transformation. Even now, knowing that it was her, I still have to ask myself was that really Gaga the entire movie? She is completely different to how I've always seen her. I can't remember a transformation this big since Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight'. Her acting also blew me away. She was truly incredible. Her singing was always going to be great, but it was her emotional range that blew me away. She even out-acted Bradley Cooper overall in my opinion, and that is no mean feat because he was also absolutely incredible. She unquestionably deserves the Oscar for Best Actress.Cooper has outdone himself with 'A Star Is Born'. He wrote, directed and starred in the film and did all three to an incredibly high standard. His character broke my heart. You could see in his eyes how much he loved this woman, and yet he was facing so many demons that it wasn't allowing him to be truly happy. The story arc of his character is a work of art. He is also much deserving of an Oscar win for Best Actor.If you haven't worked it out by now I absolutely loved this movie. There isn't a single fault I could come up with. If this film doesn't have you glued to the screen and drag emotion out of you then you are made of stone and film is simply not for you.

Impressive all around,"Wow!To say the least, A STAR IS BORN truly lives up to its hype and deserving of its rave reviews that had people talking.Bradley Cooper, in his first directorial debut, really directed the heck out of the movie and the film turned out to be pretty impressive for the actor-turned-director.Every aspect of the movie was given meticulous details and no stone was left unturned in making sure that movie was made really well.As for the performances, I was truly blown away by Cooper, of course. Taking three roles in the making of the movie (as actor, producer and director), Cooper add an extensive part in his acting role, that is as a singer. Although I'm not surprised that he could sing and play music (specifically playing the guitar), doing all those jobs was by no means an easy feat to pull off but he did all of them that ought to deserve the Academy's attention and recognition. Otherwise, the Academy is truly blind.And even more impressive was on the part of Lady Gaga. Even though this was not her first acting gig as she had made quite impressive performance in the TV series, American Horror Story. But Lady Gaga truly shone her acting chops in a leading role that demanded a lot from her.Lady Gaga stripped away her renowned celebrity status to showcase a vulnerable yet powerful role that demanded of her.All in all, I could confidently say that this new rendition of A STAR IS BORN could easily be up for Oscar consideration in the following categories:Best Motion Picture
Best in Directing - Bradley Cooper
Best Actor - Bradley Cooper
Best Actress - Lady Gaga
Best Supporting Actor - Sam Elliot
Best Cinematography
Best Editing

That was annoying, but there was so much that was just boring, boring, boring. I preferred Lady Gaga in Desperately Seeking Susan and Bradley Cooper in The Big Lebowski.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
