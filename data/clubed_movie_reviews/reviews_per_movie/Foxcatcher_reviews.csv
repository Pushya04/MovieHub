Foxcatcher: A Slow Burn to an Explosive Climax.,"Foxcatcher is a movie for those who value patience as a virtue. There is not a lot of dialogue and not even a lot of wrestling (which is bold for a movie centered around Olympic wrestlers) but rarely have I seen a film that had a constant buildup of tension throughout. One phrase that you will see a lot when reading about this film is that it is a ""slow burn"" which is accurate. It makes you uncomfortable and anxious to the point of frustration because you are constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.The story centers around Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) an anti-social, brooding athlete who seems to be constantly living in his older brother David's (Mark Ruffalo) shadow. David and Mark have both won gold medals at the 1984 Olympics but more people are drawn to David because he is warm, charismatic, and open...everything that Mark is not. We watch Mark as he seems to go through life with a chip on his soldier, trying to forge his own path without the help of his brother. Mark receives a call from a representative of a John Du Pont (Steve Carell) who wishes Mark to visit him on his Foxcatcher farm and propose the idea of him and the entire USA wrestling team to make Foxcatcher their official training facility with Du Pont bankrolling the entire operation. From there, we watch an initial positive relationship sour as the we learn more about Du Pont and his intentions.The cast is lights out here. Tatum gives the performance of his career in a dark turn as Mark and Ruffalo might score an Oscar nomination for being the one ray of light as his older brother David, who only has the best intentions for Mark and his future. It is Carell though, who steals the show. You always read about how comedians, whom Carell is more popularly known as, all have a ""dark side"" in them which is where they get there comedy from that allows them to make shockingly effective transition into drama (think Jim Carrey in ""Truman Show"" and Robin Williams in ""Insomnia"") and he will go down as another prime example of that here. Du Pont is a man of privilege who, like Mark, is trying to find a way to make his mark on the world and seek the approval of others. He is socially awkward, maybe even a coward and uses his money and family ""dynasty"" as its referred to in the film, to give him a sense of entitlement to gain respect from others.From the point they meet we wonder why Mark would fall into a relationship with Du Pont but we see they do share similarities in terms of their personalities and both feeling the need to prove themselves. So it's no surprise to see the relationship eventually sour because in the fight to become the more relevant one, Du Pont will win due to his already established social status and wealth. Du Pont is always trying to seek the approval of his mother (Vanessa Redgrave), who sees wrestling as a ""low sport"", and Du Pont tries to create this deluded fantasy of what he is trying to do with this wrestling team to please his mother. Du Pont calls himself a ""coach"" of the wrestling team, when it seems he knows nothing about the sport, he claims his athletes see him as a mentor and a father figure when in reality, he is just the guy signing their checks. The tension comes to a head once David gets involved and begins to see Du Pont for what he really is and the climax catches you buy surprise and leaves you devastated. .Director Bennett Miller has only made three films (Capote and Moneyball the other two) but it's safe to say he is three for three with this being his most ambitious work yet. Foxcatcher is the type of film that has failed in the past due to its' modest pace but the performances keep you engaged just enough to be blown away in the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Never heard of this story and that was a bonus,"Foxcatcher is a long movie but it never gets boring and that's something. As a Belgian I never heard of this story so for me it was all a surprise. I like movies based on a true story, certainly one like this one. The make-up crew should also get credits because what they did to Steve Carrell and Channing Tatum was very well done. It's because Steve Carrell as a specific voice that I recognized him immediately but with his changed physics I could have been fooled. He plays a really annoying character, one of those rich guys that thinks you can buy anybody or anything. But he did a very good job playing that arrogant prick. Channing Tatum looks like he came out straight of a cavern. He also did a good job, like all the rest of the cast. The story is interesting to watch and the end was surprising to me. I'm not a big fan of the wrestling sport but for this story it doesn't matter if you like it or not. Certainly worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What the Hell Am I Doing Here?,"John du Pont has more money than he knows what to do with. He is a miserable man who has spent his life trying to be something he can never be. He is pathetic as an athlete, so he brings in a man who suffers from an inferiority complex despite his earning a gold medal in the Olympics. Mark Schultz should have the world by the butt but he is caught in an aimless quest to earn enough to survive. His brother Dave, who has also been an Olympic champion, has gone on with his life. His love and affection for his brother keep the poor guy going, but it also overshadows him. DuPont decides to create a wrestling club and enlist the help of Mark Schultz and pretty soon the poor schmuck becomes his right hand man. Steve Carell is brilliant as the schizophrenic du Pont who imagines himself the savior of the country. He believe he is a real wrestling coach, even though he knows very little (he is able to look good because he gives huge sums of money to his stable of athletes). Carell's sickness pervades the entire picture as the men he commands begin to see his irrationality for what it is. There is also the classic Freudian stuff. This movie makes one uncomfortable from the get-go and yet we can't take our eyes off the sick man.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Haunts with Uneasy Themes and a Deliberate Reveal of Information,"BY RYAN C. SHOWERSHearing reactions from people who saw ""Foxcatcher"" made me instill a mindset in myself to defend against the ""slow pacing"". (Feeling the discomfort from a long running-time is a movie pet peeve of mine.) However, my experience of ""Foxcatcher"" was largely different from most everyone else who has discussed the film. I did not want to take my eyes off the screen. The direction from Bennett Miller felt in tune with the story and the characters in a mellow way. He built scenes at a gradual pace, but each scene has a path and reach a distinctive point of impact. Because ""Foxcatcher"" is so muted, it haunts with the uneasy themes being explored in the screenplay and a deliberate reveal of information in the directing.The ominous representations of the real-life people by the actors contribute substantially to the outcome of ""Foxcatcher"". Steve Carell amazed me in his portrayal of John du Pont. It's not the most expressive work of an actor this year, but it's certainly one of the most potent. The comedic actor is transformative and in more ways than the physical ones prompted by the make-up prosthetics, which visibly add to the creation of the mysterious figure. Carell's eyes cut deep into the viewer and sting like a sharp razor blade impaling the warmth of your flesh.""Foxcatcher"" begins as Mark Shultz's story and continues into the film's second act led by Channing Tatum's irate temperament. But the closer the end of the film nears, du Pont begins to consume the story. Carell's performance feels extraordinarily subtle as your start the film, but as ""Foxcatcher"" endangers the viewer deeper into du Pont's mind, the severity of Carell's performance begins permeate throughout the picture. There's an eerie presence he creates, a torment that does not internally leave you after watching it. (Not to suggest that du Pont is evil, as understood in Miller's direction, there's an nuance of tragedy that looms over the man that makes his story such a grave one to experience.)Mark Ruffalo's Dave Schultz becomes a driving figure in the last act, along with Carell, as Tatum's importance begins to lessen. The simple, small-town guy with a beacon of knowledge realized by Ruffalo is impressive. Tatum also gives his most accomplished performance to date.Bennett Miller steps back tonally to his work in somber ""Capote"" after making the lighter (and forgettable) ""Moneyball"" in 2011. ""Foxcatcher"" is in the same quality league as ""Capote"", but in film he has a peculiar manner of creating the action of the plot. Some may say ""Foxatcher"" contains too few and far between events in the narrative, but I think Miller creates a drama palpable in the air of every scene, and we, the audience, are parked in a burning tension for two hours.""Foxcatcher"" is a superb film that, as it sits in your mind, grows from the seeds Miller plants in your head as you watch his detailed recounting of events on the du Pont estate. It will disturb you with its bleak vegetation and seduce your flames of darkness.Grade: A-* * * 1/2 / * * * *",,Anonymous,Biography
"Too slow for many, but the patience pays off--Olympic pressure redefined","Foxcatcher (2014)Based on fact, a movie about Olympic wrestlers training at the estate of tycoon family du Pont near Valley Forge. Even though it's about sport and sports at the highest level, this is the opposite of an action movie. The central figure is mean to be one of two actual Olympic level brothers who wrestled in the 1980s, but in a way the tone of the movie is dictated by the patron, wealthy heir to the du Pont fortune, John du Pont. He's played with impeccable, disturbed restraint by Steve Carell.The brothers are of course important, and slightly different in their makeup. Mark (played by Channing Tatum) is seemingly simple, almost slow, and he gets sucked into du Pont's plans rather easily. Dave (played by Mark Ruffalo) is more savvy, an older and more experienced wrestler.. And easy going, a family man who everyone likes. Except John du Pont.Don't let the patience fool you. Carell is uncanny—his performance seems to be a non- performance, but it never flags. Tatum is right on with his feeling for an athlete devoted to his ability above all, but missing the larger picture. Ruffalo, though in a small role, ends up the most sympathetic character, and by the end, if you agree, you'll be in tears.You sometimes wonder about how Olympic athletes get their support and what the price is to them personally. Though a long way from Communist bloc versions of control and abuse (and obsession), this is a perfectly horrifying and insidious American counterpart. Not to be missed if you like sports, sports movies, or the Olympics on any level.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting but UNINSPIRING sports drama.,"Surprisingly the performances of tatum and CARELL👏 are impressive and mark ruffalo always delivers in a serious role, based on true life events about a troubled rich eccentric who souly took charge of the american olympic wrestling team in the late 80s, the movie hits the mark in regards to the story its telling and the characters and events are apparently accurate but it feels like an overblown tv movie with a tragic story that fails to inspire. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wrestling With A Demon,"The saga of John du Pont is one of the more bizarre and tragic stories from the mid-1990s. In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is almost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of which are given by men who are better known for their work in other genres.Channing Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first meet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal. But the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his older brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants more. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the bills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that changes, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who offers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on his Pennsylvania estate.Like Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly enviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has family issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a team of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just want to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely wealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants to be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave arrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du Pont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great leader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's shocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.As du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and prosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely have audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light. Action/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense and driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du Pont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.Foxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
a quantity and quality issue,"I saw Foxcatcher months ago, I went to see it with very little idea of what it was about, I knew that it was based on a tragic true story and stared Steve Carell, Channing Tatum & Mark Ruffalo, other than that I knew nothing more and that's how it should be if you want to see this film.Once I saw the movie I was baffled, it is undeniable that the performances are brilliant, the three leads brought their A game. It's a very psychological film, which means you should see it rested and ready to think, you have to pay attention to the nuances and the progression of the characters. It's not delivered on a silver platter, as a matter of fact it's a very solemn film, very simple with no tricks.I recognize that the performances are mind-blowing, the story is very interesting but boy I was bored. There are a lot of long silences, I mean long, it works for the psychological drama that it is and I get that it helps set up the tone and pace but it's slightly too much for me. The same goes for the cold, bleak, chilling atmosphere, it suits the movie well and makes total sense but I was not into it.Foxcatcher has all of the right quality ingredients for such a story but maybe, just maybe there are slightly too much of the quality stuff. It also definitely did not help that I wanted to pee the whole time but I did not have the amazing experience most people seem to have had.@wornoutspines",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
One uptight man,"Before watching and writing about Foxcatcher I did a bit of research about John DuPont and it confirmed what I saw in this film. Before any of the action of this film takes place, DuPont already had been accused of making improper advances by one man. He was also ever so briefly married, just like Rock Hudson.Steve Carrell plays the uptight and repressed gay man John DuPont with a minimum of dialog and emotion, but with facial and body language that tell more than 20 pages of script could. He well deserved to be nominated for Best Actor.John DuPont is from one of America's richest families and he's a man with a lot of money and a lot of time on his hands. He's developed an interest in wrestling and not the kind that Vince McMahon gives us three night a week. He decides to develop and finance a team of wrestlers that will win all championships including Olympic gold. Carrell is like George Steinbrenner with an open checkbook in the free agency market.Two of his wants are the brothers Schultz. Mark is played by Channing Tatum and he is dazzled by the world that Carrell wants to invite him into. Carrell is crushing out on Channing Tatum big time which is understandable. David the older and more successful brother is played by Mark Ruffalo who got a Best Supporting Actor nomination is harder to get, but he does succumb. It leads to one unspeakable tragedy.Foxcatcher also got nominations for Best Director, Best Makeup, and Best Original Screenplay. It didn't come away with any statues though.I should also mention Vanessa Redgrave as Carrell's grand dame of society mother who is as uptight as her son. She too with minimal dialog conveys this branch of the large DuPont family is one uptight limb of the family tree.Foxcatcher is a deeply disturbing, but very good film to see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A chilling, quiet psychological drama about men striving for greatness","""Foxcatcher"" is anything but a wrestling drama. Although based on the true story of Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz and his brief years of training under multi-millionaire John du Pont, ""Foxcatcher"" expands well beyond the wrestling ring into the minds of two men longing to find greatness.So those expecting anything close to director Bennett Miller's last film, ""Moneyball,"" should be forewarned. This is not a sports movie, but a slow-burning character study (like Miller's first acclaimed film, ""Capote"") in which the wrestling serves as the visual, physical expression of the psychological struggle between the characters.When we first meet Mark, played by Channing Tatum, whose versatility continues to amaze, it's 1987 and he is living in the faded glory of his 1984 gold medal. Despite his success, he is living a rather lonely life and itching to accomplish more; his brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also won gold and Dave feels that leaves him with something to prove. So when John du Pont (Steve Carell) contacts him about paying him to come train at his top-notch facility on his family's estate, Foxcatcher Farm, he sees his opportunity.Mark and du Pont's philosophies about striving to be the best align, and the two form a close, almost father-and-son bond, though more so because they both feel pressure to live up to others' expectations. Du Pont, in particular, wants to prove himself to his mother (Vanessa Redgrave), who breeds world class horses and finds wrestling barbaric. John's desperation, bottomless checkbook and unresolved family issues make for a dangerous combination, and his relationship with Mark slowly begins to change for the worse. Further complicating the matter is Dave, the only man capable of saving Mark from his demanding expectations of himself and whose coaching expertise intimidates du Pont.The often unspoken psychological warfare between the three (and, perhaps most importantly, du Pont and his mother) is the driving force of the story more than anything that actually happens on screen. Mark's ups and downs as he competes at the '87 World Championships and '88 Olympic trials are symptomatic of his mental state and the state of his relationship with the other men. As such, ""Foxcatcher"" is a long, at times brooding film that can drag in spite of the brilliant character development and internal drama.E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman's script is quiet and doesn't have a lot of big juicy moments for its actors to lean on, so the fact that Carell is totally haunting and captivating in this role says a lot. Du Pont is an incredibly complex character whose back story is mostly implied so as to keep him as unpredictable as possible. Even with all the makeup on, Carell gives the epitome of an understated performance, something you would never dream possible from a guy who has made a career out of big acting and abrasive characters. Undoubtedly some credit goes to Miller, who has churned out acting nominations and wins for his previous casts, and gets Carell and Tatum to pause and linger at all the right moments.With those two in transforming roles, it's easy to overlook Ruffalo (who always seems to get overlooked). Dave is the comparison point for both these men. He's a family man who is smart, has accomplished a lot and knows what it truly means to work hard. Ruffalo brings his trademark authenticity to his part as the ""good guy"" and does it so well.Even when it's too quiet and languishes, ""Foxcatcher"" is a fine piece of cinema and Miller has established himself as a true auteur. It certainly does not satisfy in the mainstream sense, but its purposeful use of imagery, total avoidance of melodrama and magnifying glass on the human condition make it an undeniably sharp and intelligent art film to be sure.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Olympic silver,"This movie is based on the true events of Olympic champion wrestlers Mark and David Schultz and their odd relationship with eccentric millionaire John Du Pont. The story centers around Mark (Channing Tatum) who is first to develop a relationship with wrestling enthusiast Du Pont (Steve Carrell). Du Pont wants so badly to be the coach of the next Olympic gold medalist and takes Mark under his wing. Mark's older brother David (Mark Ruffalo) has always looked out for his younger brother and begins to worry. Du Pont convinces David to join them at his estate. Once there David realizes his brother isn't the same and has questions the validity of Du Ponts actions. After a loss in the '88 Soule Olympics things really take a turn for the worse, which tragically ends terrible for the brothers as Du Ponts grip on reality slips away. I went into this movie not knowing any of the actual story and I found myself wanting badly to step in and do something. It really is a tragic and odd story. Overall the movie is well put together and Carrell is outstanding as John Du Pont. Ruffalo and Tatum were fantastic as the brothers Schultz. They trained so much you'd think they actually wrestled in school. That being said, this one isn't for me. I can't place my finger on it but I just couldn't get into it. The story crawled along at a snails pace and the development of the characters was choppy. Happy the writers and director cut the film from the original 4 hours of tape. See it if you must but don't set valued time aside for it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Missing a True Emotional Core,"I'm usually on the same page as movie critics and fans when it comes to awards season flicks. But, I just don't get the massive acclaim for ""Foxcatcher"", Bennett Miller's based-on-a-true-story drama about the fractured relationships between two Olympic wrestling brothers, Mark and Dave Schultz (Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo), and their mentally disturbed benefactor, John du Pont (Steve Carell). Do I think it's a terrible film? I won't go that far. But, nothing about it emotionally moved me or made me think too much. I think it's just one of those movies that come off as so ""serious"" that the knee-jerk reaction is praise.Here's my main problem: the storytelling and characters are so hollow. I don't know if this was Miller's point but there's a way to depict emptiness and hollowness without the film feeling empty and hollow itself. Many people describe this as a ""slow burn"" that requires patience and concentration from a viewer. I have plenty of both and tend to usually enjoy slower films. But, it's not the slowness that some people are reacting to. It's the deadness at the center.We get no deep insight into any of the characters, except for John in rare moments, besides what they say superficially. What was it that really ruined the relationship between Mark and John? Jealousy, insecurity, betrayal, suppressed homoeroticism? What did Dave really think of John? And why exactly did Mark spiral so dramatically?Now, I do appreciate ambiguity in characters and film very much. Not everything has to be obvious, cut-and-dry. But, if you're going to make the characters an enigma, at least give us more to work with to be able to figure them out. Instead, ""Foxcatcher"" disappointingly stays on the surface, making us guess way too much instead of diving deep into these people, who, given the fact that they're real, leave plenty of room to explore.Because of this, the tragic ending left me pretty cold. John is such an empty shell throughout that we're never fully let into his inner world. We never get to completely understand his insanity. We're always on the outside of this character, looking in. As a result, his actions just feel disconnected and unexplainable. And the fact that the film ends so abruptly, without making us fully feel the impact of this horrible event, makes it even odder to digest.Luckily, the performances of Carell and Ruffalo save the show and made it somewhat watchable. Carell joins the lengthy list of hilarious comedians capable of moving dramatic work. Known to audiences as a lovable, heart-warming goofball, he totally transforms and channels a still, unsettling intensity. I squirmed watching some of his scenes, as he was so palpably awkward and in pain, while making the aloof way the character was written work. Ruffalo is a great character actor yet always brings his own brand of sweetness and groundedness to every role. He has a way of making his characters seem totally real and recognizable. Here, he stands out as the most relatable, appealing member of the bunch. Their Oscar nominations were well-deserved.Now, as far as Tatum goes, I did not see the brilliant, career-changing performance many were raving about. He was more or less his same one-note, depthless self, except he was given a few ridiculously showy scenes here. But, he still underwhelmed me. This part is really the central role and a truly gifted actor could've done so much with it. Mark is naive, ambitious, intense, obsessive, immature, and vulnerable. Yet, in Tatum's hands, who seems to be under the impression that stone-faced staring is great acting, he generally just comes off as dim and foolish, missing all of the emotional layers that should've been there (which could be another reason why it just failed to resonate with me).If I had to recommend this, it'd only be for Carell and Ruffalo, who both act circles around Tatum. I can understand what Miller was trying to do with the film. Yet, I don't feel compelled to revisit.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well Made and Compelling, but there's a Problem","This is a fine film, but the story isn't told correctly, or more to the point, it tells one story but concludes with the climax of another, different story. The Mark Schutz's time at Foxcatcher began in the mid-80s and ended after the Souel Olympics of 1988. After that, Mark is no longer relevant to the narrative.The story of Dave Schulz at Foxcatcher mainly takes place in the 90s. In fact, his murder in. 1996 took place 8 years after the main story of the film. 8 years are glossed over. Dave Schulz's murder had nothing to do with Mark. What went on in those missing years? The film tells us nothing about it. This is a problem for otherwise fine effort.The cast is outstanding and Carel shines, but if you watch ESPN's fine 30 for 30 documentary about the Foxcatcher years you will see that DuPont the man isn't accurately captured in this film. The real DuPont was a lanky, thin man who actually smiled a lot. He had a goofiness about him that is nonexistent in Carel's stark portrayal. Ruffalo and Tatum do fine work even though they are nowhere near the physical specimens the Schultz brothers were.I still recommend this film for its psychological study of a man-child like Dupont and how dysfunctional the lives of heirs to great fortunes usually become.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Performances, Disappointing Film","Foxcatcher (2014)** 1/2 (out of 4)Olympic gold-medal winner Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) receives a phone call ordered by billionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) who wants the wrestler to come to his home and form a wrestling team to compete in the 1988 Olympics. Soon Mark's brother David (Mark Ruffalo) is brought on as a coach but soon both brothers start to see that something isn't quite right with du Pont.FOXCATCHER is without a question a very somber little picture and one that's incredibly depressing and rather hard to watch at times. It seems a lot of people are either finding it to be a masterpiece or praising the performances but finding the film itself flawed, which is the group I'm going to fall in. For the life of me I can't remember the last time I walked out of a movie wanting to like it a lot more than I actually did. A good half hour after the movie had ended I was still debating with myself the qualities of the picture but after much thought I just felt there were way too many flaws for me to fully praise the picture.The one thing that can be praised are the performances with Tatum actually stealing the show. I was really shocked to see how great he was here but he's got quite a bit of emotions to play and I thought he did them perfectly. Early on the character just strikes you as a rather dumb jock but slowly we start to see the emotional problems that this guy is suffering with. Tatum has no problems at pulling off these emotions and there's no doubt that his physical shape made him very believable as a wrestler. Ruffalo has always been an underrated actor and he too really gets to shine here, although his character doesn't come into more focus until near the end. As for Carell, he appears to be getting the majority of the credit and there's no doubt that he's excellent but the psychological nature of the performance doesn't really get to shine until the final twenty-minutes when the actor really nails the role. Just the look in his eyes and the way he carries himself is quite chilling.As I said, I thought there were quite a few flaws with the film and of course what I didn't like about the picture is the same thing that most love. I really didn't care for the style that Bennett Miller brought to the picture. Again, this is one of the most somber movies I've ever seen and I don't mind the pale, cold and distant feel of the picture but at the same time the first eighty-minutes just seemed to add up to nothing much. The biggest problem I had is that it was all style and very little character development and even by the end of the movie I thought there were more unanswered questions about these characters. For the life of me I thought the development should have been a lot better. I thought the actors, especially Carell, could have been better used earlier in the picture but the actor doesn't get to shine until the end.Another problem I had with the picture is that it just moves along way too slow for its own good. Again, I understand what Miller was going for but I just didn't think it worked as well as it needed to be and I thought a lot of emotional was missing from the picture up until the ending, which I won't spoil. I think one could argue that the slowness at the start of the picture was meant to lead up to the shocking conclusion but to me the start just didn't work. Technically speaking the film features some great cinematography and editing but this here just can't overcome the flaws I had with the story and direction. FOXCATCHER features some great performances, which makes the film worth viewing but it's still a disappointment.",,Anonymous,Biography
Human weakness is a harsh territory,"This is one of the movies that made me seriously think even a while after I watched them. There are several psychological ""planes"" that are successfully addressed and intertwine in the movie. But the one about the weaknesses and how they make us allow to reach for the ""straw to cling after"" is really the harsh one. In this case it shows how even the natural and logical order of values crumbles beneath one's complex, pride or fear. And how such emotional irrationality paves the way for terminal decisions that might eventually have serious consequences not only for the one involved, but for the people around incl. loved ones. As I said, this is a complex movie, where mentioned is only one of subjects that wander through the internal labyrinth of human psyche and external inter-human relationships. For me, it was a hard psychological drama, far from a plain sports movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bennett Miller's latest is a building block of passion and tension with a righteous performance from Steve Carell...,"A film that takes its time presenting its case, Bennett Miller's wickedly brutal ""Foxcatcher"" entices audiences to learn more about the questions around us, and where they could lead. Seated firmly in the center are a trio of dazzling performances from Channing Tatum, Steve Carell, and Mark Ruffalo, all of which make a compelling case for their career best works.Written by Oscar-nominee Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye, ""Foxcatcher"" tells the story of Mark Schultz (Tatum), an Olympic wrestler who befriends billionaire John Du Pont (Carell) in the mid-1980's. Along with his brother Dave (Ruffalo) and his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller), that new relationship leads to unforeseen consequences.At the core of this morality tale is Bennett Miller, the Oscar- nominated director of ""Capote"" and ""Moneyball."" He allows""Foxcatcher"" to study its subjects, and give the audience an in-depth understanding of all the motives involved. With the help of Cinematographer Greig Fraser, and composer Rob Simonsen, the movie's melancholy atmosphere is truly compelling. Miller's brilliance isn't in things he chooses to show, but in the things he chooses not to. He draws out scenes that offer so much to the narrative. There's still so much left on the table that we do not know, which in itself, is perfectly acceptable. Life never gives us all the answers we seek. Miller, Futterman, and Frye understand this. Material like this calls to be made into a film. I'm so glad that these three answered the call.What Steve Carell achieves as John DuPont is not just a performance by a full embodiment. With strength and precision, he understands DuPont, a man with an extreme outlook on reality. Carell doesn't just ask us to sympathize with John, between his awkward behavior and his constant yearning to impress his family's legacy, he demands our understanding. If I didn't already know about the film for the past two years, I wouldn't have recognized him. His performance is completely focused and profound. Looking at the way he carries himself through the film, you are witnessing one of the purest creations of a character this year. When he's not on-screen, you're secretly wishing he was.When it comes to Channing Tatum, I have to admit that I never FULLY understood the appeal. Discovered the young ferocious actor in Dito Montiel's ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" nearly a decade ago, and afterwards was only mildly entertained by his presence in films like ""21 Jump Street"" and ""Side Effects."" What he does in Miller's film is something beyond anything I could have ever thought he could do. Tatum doesn't just do an imitation, he channels the inner workings of a man desperate for more. His peculiarities are richly on display as he yearns for a father figure outside of the shadow of his more successful brother. He embraces the odd DuPont, against all logical instincts, but you can see exactly why he would feel so compelled to do so.Mark Ruffalo gives Dave the ticks and beats of an original creation. Picking at his beard (something I know all too well), constantly engaging in team leadership, and hugging his younger brother whose more of a son than anything. Ruffalo mounts himself on the perch of a loving brother just trying to create success for himself and his family. This is another solid outing for him.Co-star Vanessa Redgrave, as John's fragile mother, is marvelous in her short scenes while Sienna Miller adds a needed dynamic to understanding both Mark and Dave. The two women both offer compassion and balance.""Foxcatcher"" is terrifying, disturbing, and utterly engaging. A slowly unraveled piece that is risky but pays off immensely. It's cautious yet strictly well-defined as a character study. Like all great films with great performances, its element of truth is plainly apparent. On the gray-skied farm, we will get to know three interesting men, some of which, we'll never truly understand.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fox hunting is a bloody sport and so is wrestling,"Fox hunting is a bloody sport and in the case of Foxcatcher, so is wrestling. You can hear the thud and almost feel the pain as heavily muscled male bodies pound each other. It's almost like a ritual. John DuPont, billionaire and unbalanced eccentric, offers a talented young wrestler the kind of sponsorship that one can only dream of. Why then does Mark Schultz, ensconced in a luxurious guest house with a state-of-the-art training facility, feel so uneasy? Mr. DuPont, played by Steve Carell as you've never seen him before, has some disquieting qualities. I can't avoid thinking that if the characters in this movie, and men in general, had been more articulate about their feelings, a tragedy could have been avoided, but that is irrelevant. The ending of this movie, based on a true story, was in the headlines some years back. If you don't remember what happened, I won't spoil it for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
If you want to see an Oscar performance from Steve Carell...,".... you have 2 options.You can, first option, watch this film.Overlong at 2+ hours, and based on a true (but horrific) story, directed not only like a horror film, but actually BETTER DIRECTION than most horror films today, this quasi-documentary give you an almost unrecognizable Steve Carell playing a man with enough psychological issues to keep an entire med school graduating class of shrinks busy for years.(Note to reader: did you ever notice how, when ordinary people exhibit mental issues, they are mentally ill, but when the super-rich exhibit THE VERY SAME SYMPTOMS, they are merely 'eccentric')Carell steals the entire movie from very capable actors, including one of the most subtle performances ever given by Mark Ruffalo, and Mark's picture, I think, actually appears under the Wikipedia entry on ""Subtle.""Anyway that is your first option. The film is a work of fine craftsmanship, but frankly as entertainment it is as depressing as a visit to the cemetery.Your other option to see Oscar work from Carell -- and I think this is the only IMDb review that actually mentions this -- is to get a copy of the animated treat OVER THE HEDGE and watch as Carell is robbed by NOT getting an award for playing Hamilton the squirrel.Not kidding.

A harrowing and disturbing character study with excellent performances,"Foxcatcher tells the fateful story of John Du Pont and the Olympic winning Schultz brothers. Directed by Bennett Miller, Foxcatcher taps into the psychology behind Du Pont, examining his psyche in the most disturbing of fashions. Steve Carrel delivers a performance that many will find hard to swallow. He is dry, he is awkward, and he is completely insane. To keep it simple, Steve Carrel is absolutely terrific and truly shows his range as an actor. It is an amazing performance that is bound for Oscar glory. The other half to Carrel's Du Pont is Channing Tatum as Mark Schultz. Tatum completely drowns into his character, leading him to turn in a vicious, unapologetic performance that is so perfectly executed that you will soon forget that this is Channing Tatum. When he is on screen, he is Mark Schultz. It is the best performance that Tatum has given in his career and stands to grab a possible Best Suppoting Actor nod at this year's Oscars. The voice of reason for both Mark and Du Pont lies in Dave Schultz, played brilliantly by Mark Ruffalo. Dave serves as this mediator in between Mark and Du Pont especially when their relationship starts becoming more and more intense and violent. The rest of the cast featuring Vannessa Redgrave and Anthony Michael Hall also turn in very sound and great performances as well. As far as acting is concerned, Foxcatcher is a hard film to beat. Every actor is on top of their game here and it really shows how good of a director Bennet Miller is. He takes a seemingly dry script and turns it into an emotional roller-coaster by way of his actors. One scene in particular haunted me involving a simple glare from Tatum's Mark Schultz as he peddles faster and harder upon seeing Du Pont. That scene on paper isn't that interesting but with Miller's uncanny ability to make even the simplest scenes intricate and layered, it works and remains one of the more memorable scenes from the film. The other highlight from this film has to be the cinematography. Everything is filmed with a slight tint of dread and gray, it creates the mood immediately and balances the story perfectly. Overall, Foxcatcher is a great character study featuring top notch performances that push this film into the top ten of the year easily.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Less I Knew, the Better","Now this movie is getting a lot of hype. Particularly because of Steve Carell's performance, and it is career defining. It's downright creepy. I mean it gives me chills just thinking about it. Most people are saying he will get likely nominated for an Oscar. He might and if he does it will probably be for lead actor (since that's what category he's been nominated for mostly in this role). However, Channing Tatum playing Mark Shcultz is technically the lead role. Tatum did a fantastic job, definitely my favorite performance from him since now we can see him doing comedy and serious dramas. It's the same for Carell's performance, but he getting more notice because he is a comedy actor doing a serious role so it is more understandable why Carell is getting more buzz. However, I do think Carell's performance was the best in the film. Mark Ruffalo also did a good job! He's definitely an actor I would like to see more of. I hope he eventually wins an Oscar because he is just so damn good at what he does. All of these actors deserve Oscar nominations for this movie, and the movie would be completely different if they weren't in this movie. Unfortunately, Tatum will most likely not get any nominations.Now I did not know anything about what actually happened in real life with these people. I did not do any research on the people and the story because I just wanted this movie to be a surprise. I won't spoil what happens because you might be in my shoes where you didn't know anything about these events. The movie does try to explain what happened and according to many people, nobody really knows why this happened. It really tries to show emotion on why this happened, but it wasn't really explained. I mean after looking through the whole movie, I can sort of see why this happened (I'm not saying I know why, I'm just assuming), but the movie could have shown a better way a showing these emotions and character motivations, because we really don't know what happened, this movie just tried to give a good explanation of it.I did like the direction of this film. Some people say it is awfully slow, but I disagree. This might only be because I didn't know anything about Foxcatcher, so I was just intrigued with what happens. I can see why people thought it was slow, and who knows, maybe it will be slower the next time I see it, but I was just fascinated with it. My complaint about this is that I wish there were maybe 10 more minutes. The ending was just abrupt. Also it is well shot and the music is very enjoyable. It had a creepy vibe but it was just well written and very calm/relaxing. I'm hoping this soundtrack will get released soon.I've waited over a year for this movie and I'm glad I was not disappointed. Performances from all three actors are Oscar worthy. Carell's performance just gave me chills from beginning to end. It is a very well shot film with great music as well. I just wish there was a bit more after the climax, because I was so intrigued with the story. Also since we really don't know what happened, the movie has a struggle of expressing some character emotion and motivation. Despite that, Foxcatcher is well made dark/creepy film that gave me chills and kept me fascinated from start to finish.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Vastly overrated,"Without Mark Ruffalo, this film would have been a failure. He holds it together through sheer force of will. Carell is competent but nothing surprising, just another case of a good comedic actor shocking everyone with an average dramatic performanceTatum looks like he's going into a coma at times. The story is a good one but the film fails to set up the ending, by failing to develop the characters sufficiently.It's well directed. Leaves you wanting more in terms of seeing the actual bouts. Does a decent job of making wrestling interesting.Could have been better with a different actor in the Tatum roll and more character development.

"Foxcatcher is described as an ""electrifying thriller"", but let's not get ahead of ourselves.","Based on the true events of John du Pont forming a wrestling team with the Schultz brothers for the 1988 Olympic Games. It's a story of both power and control, as the struggle for constant authority creates tension and paranoia within the team. This eventuality leads to an unforeseen tragic event. Foxcatcher is what I would class as an interesting character study, on both Mark Schultz and John du Pont. The constant desire for victory and the goals for patriotism. Du Pont having unlimited money, can do pretty much whatever he wishes. That in itself is control, but yet seemingly he consistently loses that authoritative presence to Dave Schultz. Was really interesting to watch. Transformative performances for both Channing Tatum and Steve Carell really aided is portraying their characters realistically. Both of them were outstanding and deserved every recognition they got. Their physical prowess was extraordinary. Mark Ruffalo was consistent yet again, however Vanessa Redgrave was criminally underused. The wrestling scenes that they actually contributed in were well filmed and exciting to watch. It's not a sport I'm familiar with, but I've taken down some notes...y'know, in case I need to decimate a thug or something. Bennett Miller's direction was very precise, he took his time with the plot and the long static camera shots evidently showed that. This leads me to the massive negative of the film: pacing. This was slow. Far too slow. 134 minutes of character development that leads to a 1 minute event at the end. Although, that final event was executed to perfection and full of tension. However, I can see why people dislike the pace. Intriguingly, the execution of the dialogue was at a snail's pace as well! Waiting for Carell to say a sentence takes about 2 minutes. Sure it's captivating if you truly focus, but for those who actually don't have any interest in this will surely fall asleep. An ""electrifying thriller"" it is not, but a very well executed character study it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good But The Pace And Depressing Subject Matter Will Turn People Away From It,"I don't know about you about but the one thing the awards season does is make me want to watch what films are in the running and see if they're worthy of the acclaim and awards . One thing about this years films is the front runners were dominated by independent features . There's nothing wrong with this of course it's just that as the film started I thought to myself ""Hmmm another indie movie"" and FOXCATCHER wears its indie credentials not just on its sleeve but on its whole shirtThis is a problem with FOXCATCHER especially in its early stages . We get a cut to a character not doing anything or saying anything , then another cut to a character not doing anything or saying anything and you might be forgiven Gus Van Sant has changed his name to Bennett Miller . By the time Mark Schultz gets contacted by John Dupont you'll be wishing it was Hulk Hogan who contacted him . As the slow paced story continues Mark no doubt wished he got contacted by Hulk Hogan too!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!This is understated , subtle film making directed in a realist manner . It's also a poignant , painfully and rather disturbing film too . What's it about ? Sexual abuse . It doesn't come out and say so but it has the dubious credit of managing to portray the subject without ever referring to it by name . A sequence halfway through the film doesn't show male rape per se but that what it alludes to""Hold on are you trying to tell me some middle aged rich man is capable of forcing himself on a big muscly wrestler ?""Yes I am and sexual abuse is not only done to a young woman at the edge of a knife in a dark alley . As shown here it starts off with manipulating the victim by dangling a carrot in front of them while showing charitable kindness in much the same way as giving candy to a child . ""Why didn't the victim complain ? "" you ask ? Well here in Britain people were making complaints to the authorities about philanthropist oddball TV presenter Jimmy Savile and the authorities didn't want to know ""Anymore of these lies and you'll find yourself in trouble . Jimmy Savile wouldn't do that ,,,or Rolf Harris ... or Stuart Hall"" in other words when you've a no one accusing a someone , especially a patriotic multi-millionaire then no one is going to listen to the no one . I also recently read an article on sexual abuse in music schools which is probably far more common than the constant court cases indicate . The victim gets brainwashed they can't succeed without the abusers help same as victims of paedophile priests think they can't enter the kingdom of Heaven without that priest's guidance . Let's also not forget The Stanford Experiment where people are so easy to comply to being victims when they're abused by those holding authorityThis is a well made depressing film on a topic that is still taboo in many quarters . The problem is such a weighty hard hitting subject means it's all rather difficult to like in any way a fact that it picked up a lot of Oscar noms but went home empty handed and once had a IMDb average vote of 7.8 which has crashed down 7.1 . It is a very difficult watch and now that I've seen it I doubt if I'll be watching it again . You have been warned",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
exceptional,"far to be a comfortable film, it is one who propose a lot of questions. about ethic, about success, about madness and ambition, about sport and about force of money. in same measure, it is a great movie who, for many viewers, could be a surprise. because each actor does his best to define his role in right manner. because the script is not only adaptation of a real case but analysis of a process, step by step, with predictable final. because Channing Tatum gives more than a decent character. and Steve Carell represents, almost, a revelation. a film about sport but in which it is only tool. because the purpose is exploration of the fascination of illusion. and the hard impact with the truth.",,Anonymous,Biography
"A different look at wrestling, in a good way!","My first night at the Stockholm Film Festival turned out really great thanks to Foxcatcher. A movie I didn't expect much from, but it was in fact one of the best movies of 2014. Foxcatcher is a movie that doesn't have that much action and will surely disappoint those who loves wrestling and wants to see fights. This is not a movie about the good side of the sport, it's about the bad one we don't get to see when Hulk Mania and The Rock performs nowadays.The film is based upon a true story. Mark Schultz is an Olympic wrestler. His relationship with his sponsor, John du Pont and his older brother leads to very unlikely circumstances between both. John du Pont turns out to be a bit different than the man he first seemed like.What I first wondered when I read about the film was, ""how could they pick Channing Tatum for such a dramatic role? Isn't he that guy who just shows off his abs so the girls can look at something?"" Well, in this movie Channing was someone completely different. He is superb as Mark Schultz, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing him after seeing this film. And this is partly what makes the film very watchable and good. Steve Carell (who usually stars in sex comedies) also did an amazing job as John du Pont. I could barely recognize him at first, and forgot that it was him 10 minutes after he first appeared on the screen. In the end, I also forgot what he looks like in real life. Great job on the make up there!The good performances is definitely what I enjoyed the most. I'm not into wrestling, and Foxcatcher didn't really make me interested. It's a very deterrent example of how some Olympic athletes are trained and treated when they're not on TV. The movie will be out in theaters later this month, and I suggest you to go watch it. If you're not a fan of wrestling, that's even better. I don't like the sport but loved this movie.However, pick your theater carefully. Sadly, some people in front of me waited to see Channing Tatum naked during the beginning. They were just annoying, but quiet when they realized that they weren't watching a teen comedy. Which was, around thirty minutes into the film. So I didn't really mind! The movie is a bit over two hours long...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A meticulously crafted if dry study of the American dream.,"It's been a long wait. After a year and a half of hype, Foxcatcher is  finally among us. This isn't really the type of film that earns such  excitement. It's a cold, hard, slow burn, but one that's meticulously  crafted. It's a film easier to appreciate than to enjoy. It tells the  true story of the relationship between Olympic gold medalist Mark  Schultz, played by Channing Tatum, his brother and also gold medalist  David, played by Mark Ruffalo, and a wealthy entrepreneur investing in  their future to become World Champions, Jan Du Pont, played by Steve  Carell. For a story of such tragedy and exposure to the world at large,  it's surprising that we're only hearing of it now, but the film's weak  spots do make it clear why director Bennett Miller needed an extra year  to work on it, having been initially anticipated as a 2013 release.   It's clear from the style of Capote and Moneyball that Miller is  concerned with capturing raw authenticity with a voyeuristic (and  grimly saturated) eye on the characters. It gives Tatum and Carell some  of the best artistic environments of their careers for them to play  around in. Tatum in particular is impressive unlike what we've seen him  in before. In his previous films he's seemed so disengaged but here he  has tunnel vision focus, constantly fighting imaginary foes. We're  often given shots of him just staring out windows, but he makes them  rich with subtext, with both his fulfillment of his ambitions and  tedium of his stripped down life. It's a physical role with great  sensitivity, showing his selfishness and self-deprecating side.   Although there's a strong bond between the brothers especially with  their sport, Ruffalo is the antithesis of Tatum. Where Tatum still  seems to struggle when engaging with people, however appropriate for  the character, it all comes natural for Ruffalo. It's a very subdued  but loose performance. Internalizing a lot of different emotions,  frustrations and conflicts that Tatum and Carell have but with a whole  heap of charm. He's comfortable in his own skin compared to them. I  missed him when he wasn't on screen, but it's unfortunate that during  his portion of the film in the last third, events become too jumbled.  Especially in its final twenty minutes, which does unfortunately drag  the film down for me that it doesn't land on two feet. It does find key  moments bubbling under its psychological tension, and you often have to  be very patient for them to reveal themselves.   Carell however was a slight disappointment. The most hyped up aspect of  the film since we first got excited 18 months ago, it's certainly  transformative but the character is too sparse and distant. Granted,  this is part of Du Pont, he's a man who doesn't make have a presence  when he walks into a room so he has to compensate with money and  weapons. He's good, but suffers due to this nature. His character  blossoms under Miller's direction and the makeup (his nose looking like  the 'eagle' he wants himself nicknamed after), but his strength in his  prolonged sinister stares. The film has some very interesting themes to  say with him about the American dream and patriotism, ironic as his  last name is evidently foreign. It's quietly powerful. Carell is best  as a fascinating contradictory poetic figure, rather than a  performance.   It's a great film thanks to Miller's methodical approach in setting up  the triangle of characters, and the anguish of their motivations. It is  cripplingly restrained in every facet, which is good to express the  repression that the characters go through; the joylessness of Mark's  success, how David's family weigh him down, the way people  underestimate Du Pont, and then the ultimate dissatisfaction of the  glory they chase. There's a lot to delight from its allegories and the  way the relationships develop. However, the way it puts the viewer at  an unsettling distance and how dry and somber it is hints that it might  not do too well at winning awards, though certainly show up on ballots.  I'm sensing that we may find a Carell snub in a stacked category, but  Ruffalo is assured. Miller may have to fight for that 5th spot in  Director but I wouldn't be surprised to see him there. I'm not eager to  watch Foxcatcher again so soon but it's a film that burrows deeply in  fraught places.   8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Drama Day for Frankenstein, Igor and Wreck-It-Ralph","The do-over for Steve Carrell is exactly how Frankenstein would end up if a make-up artist wanted to make him look human, and likewise Tatum Channing <=> Igor.And if for some reason Frankenstein and Igor HAD to go plodding into a drama, then this movie would be the hilariously boring result. Mark Ruffalo's character did remind me of a bearded Wreck-it-Ralph, but at least there wasn't any weird prosthetics or forced facial movements.Steve Carrell's immovable poorly done pasty-coloured forehead and Tatum's forced protrusion of the lower mandible  coupled with their very awkward posturing and walking movements (probably thanks to over enthusiastic 'theatrics' coaches) plus minced marbles-in-my-mouth dialogue, are all constant distractions . even unintended entertainment  which soon drags on and on in this uninspired movie.The real John du Pont and Mark Schultz have vastly different facial looks from the forced caricatures of what you find in this movie. Since the faces of both real men are hardly well-known, the actors should have been allowed to have their natural faces  and that's where the talent of each (if they had one) would be allowed to shine. And yes, the real John du Pont's forehead did move and his face did look like a proper living person, and the real Mark Schultz was not a protruding-jaw klutz. So why the odd prosthetics and make up here??I am all for slow movies with panning scenes in a slow-burn drama  when it allows you to get immersed in the entire experience, but here in Foxcatcher the snail and tortoise races to be the slowest in a totally insipid and inane who-cares frame-by-frame.After watching this movie, I read up on the real back-end story, and it is in fact more interesting reading about it then watching this extremely forced and unnecessarily stretched out and poorly executed 'dramatization' of events.It is like watching our three actors starting out on their idiocy SNL routine  and then the audience having to wait for the punchline that never came even after over 2 hours!Should have watched SNL instead :(",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great but slow,"Foxcatcher is a fantastic true crime drama with excellent acting by Mark Ruffalo, Channing Tatum, and Steve Carell especially who is unrecognizable. Foxcatcher suffers from one thing and one thing only, length. For a film that is the standard 2hrs and change, there is really nothing filling that. Without getting into spoilers, while the descent of Steve Carell's character is definitely there and the ending, while shocking, makes sense for him, the extremely slow pace of the movie makes that payoff feel unearned. For something to take so much time just to have the most exciting part last for a minute, leaves at least me personally somewhat unsatisfacted. I would recommend watches this if u enjoy slow paced character dramas, but be prepared cause it is extremely slow.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Silence of The Wrestlers,"The film is so quiet, much like ""Capote"" of the same directing hand, Bennett Miller. Miller seems to like a thin story, sometimes close to none, and digs deep into a few characters he chooses to reflect the society at large. It takes great skills to give the viewers so little, to be quite reluctant in giving any leads, and to grab them by the heart as this film shows. A lot of films depict drug assumption as a part of their stories, but you feel as if you took the cocaine yourself while John and Mark did so. You feel so much for the characters, so the final shooting scene makes you feel like a true story that happens in your own neighborhood. There are larger points in this film, for example homosexual repression, mother-son relationship, classes in America, etc., but they seem effectively belittled by our feelings for the characters. We do care about them so that we do not care about what they are, have become, or may be anymore. Not many films of today's chaotic world can give us such depth. Bennett Miller should be careful about choosing his next projects, as his depth of filmmaking power should not be wasted. I will suggest a non-American theme like the mystery around Thailand's King Ananda assassination in his own chamber or a portrayal of China's brutal Cultural Revolution. He will make a nice placement for those histories.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Even if you're not into wrestling it's worth watching,"Even if you're not a fan of wrestling this movie is worth watching. I'm myself not a big fan of that sport but the movie is interesting and captivating. It's based on a true story, a story that I as an European had never heard of, and that makes it even more interesting. The make-up artists deserve a lot of credits in Foxcatcher because if it was not for the distinctive voice of Steve Carrell, that I immediately recognized, his physic transformation was stunning. You could hardly recognize him. Channing Tatum's make-up was also good. He looked like he escaped from his cave and he did portray the image that I had of a wrestler very well. The story is easy to follow and the outcome was not what I thought it would be, that was a bonus. The character of John Du Pont played by Steve Carrell is the typical rich guy that thinks everything is for sale and the guy that thinks he can get away with anything. He's a repulsive guy to watch but very well done from Steve Carrell. So even if you're not interested in wrestling give this movie a chance, you might like it like I did.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The comic actor(Steve Carell) shows his dramatic chops in an awesome way!!!!!!,"FOXCATCHER is a psychological drama directed by Academy Award nominee Bennett Miller (MONEYBALL) and starring Golden Globe winner Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo, Academy Award winner Vanessa Redgrave and Sienna Miller. The film was written by E. Max Frye and Academy Award nominee Dan Futterman. FOXCATCHER tells the story of Olympic Gold Medal-winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Tatum), who sees a way out from the shadow of his more celebrated wrestling brother Dave (Ruffalo) and a life of poverty when he is summoned by eccentric multi-millionaire John du Pont (Carell) to move onto his estate and train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Desperate to gain the respect of his disapproving mother, du Pont begins ""coaching"" a world-class athletic team and, in the process, lures Mark into dangerous habits, breaks his confidence and drives him into a self-destructive spiral.

"Watch it for Carrell, Tatum and Ruffalo's performances alone","I enjoyed Bennett Miller's Moneyball despite my lack of interest in baseball and Foxcatcher is another sports drama directed by him but it's one I like even more.Foxcatcher follows Olympic wrestlers Mark and Dave Schultz who join Team Foxcatcher led by the rich John du Pont but eventually the relationship between these three turns sour.I strongly suggest NOT to read anything about the story as it may spoil a lot of crucial details.Miller's previous film Moneyball was decent and had some great dialogue and performances. Whilst Foxcatcher is another sports drama, this one takes more of a dark turn. I really liked the dark and unsettling tone to this movie as I felt it fit perfectly with the story and its characters. The atmosphere created adds so much to the experience and makes the ending of this film even more surprising than it already is. Unlike Moneyball, where the dialogue takes centre stage, Foxcatcher has lot more quiet scenes where you soak in the melancholy feeling of it all with the great music and cinematography. The pacing is quite slow and the slow burn aspect may not work for some people but the story and characters kept me invested and made the runtime not feel as long.What will keep people interested in this film are the fantastic performances by these three commendable actors. I've always loved Steve Carrell as a comedic actor and to see him play a more serious role was very surprising and I have to see Carrell is truly amazing here. The prosthetic makeup was really good as it helped sell the fact that we were seeing John du Pont rather than Steve Carrell and he really managed to make du Pont a creepy and mysterious individual. Mark Ruffalo gives another great performance. He played the role of a loving and caring brother really well.
Last but not least, Channing Tatum was extraordinary. I've known Tatum through comedies like the Jump Street films but he really shows what he's capable of in Foxcatcher. Tatum fully embodied the troubled nature of Mark Schultz and there were a couple subtleties in his performance that really elevated it.I really liked Foxcatcher. The performances by Carrell, Tatum and Ruffalo are the highlights and despite its slow pacing, the compelling story and ominous atmosphere kept me engaging through its entirety.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Don't waste your time. Terrible movie.,"I registered with IMDb just to write a review of this movie because it's so bad that I feel I have to warn people about it before they watch it. Just like Birdman, it's another 2014 Oscar nominated movie that is boring as hell and I keep wondering how it got so many good critic reviews and awards.First of all, like many ""Based on a true story"" movies, most of it is factually wrong, like the Schultz brothers living at Foxcatcher at the same time, which never actually happened. The disclaimer should read ""Loosely based on a true story"".But what irks me the most is that the true story is actually fascinating, in fact if you google John du Pont you will find lots of details on the life of this deranged lunatic. However, director Bennett Miller chooses to focus on just a small portion of du Pont's personality, mostly his arrogance and giant ego. As such, the movie ends up being over two hours of coma-inducing storytelling and visuals.Miller had a large amount of elements in the real story to make this a really good three hour movie if he wanted. John du Pont was a fascinating lunatic, cokehead, drunk, you name it. He would drive a tank around his estate. On two different occasions, he drove his car into a pond. He thought he was the Dalai Lama. He tried to kill his wife. He had treadmills removed from his gym because he thought they were taking him back in time. And if you do some research on this lunatic you find lots of stories like this. Then why would Miller not use them, instead making this awfully boring movie? I just don't get it.Save your money and time, this movie is just not worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
An interesting death...,"Foxcatcher is an interesting death of me. I start out the movie thinking it'll be great. The name entitles it to a sports team, that is a wrestling team. Started by a billionaire, John Du Pont. In the movie John-Steve Carell- portrays a billionaire-a crazy one-that starts a team for wrestling. Inviting younger brother, Mark Schultz-Channing Tatum- of the olympic wrestler Dave Schultz-Mark Ruffalo. Both are olympic wrestlers, and great ones at that. Even in the movie they train as if it's real. The coordination that they use, makes me feel that they are brothers in real life. Though the ""movie"" isn't even about sports. It's about a billionaire, that takes one olympic brother wrestler, after another. This movie, made me sleep a couple times. The ""movie"" can be anything but a movie. Theaters must be losing money of how sadly, this movie is portrayed. Although some parts may be good. And I am saying 'Parts.' The movie is a discrimination. And a total, waste of time.

This 'fox' is a little too sly for it's own good.,"Bennett Miller is a top-notch director. Mark Ruffalo, Channing Tatum, Steve Carrell are very good actors.So, there you have it. A fine director and three very able actors. And a true story to drive it all home.This is first off, not a 'Sport' movie. The wrestling is significantly sidelined. It does follow the story of Mark Schultz, the 1984 Olympic Gold medalist in wrestling, but focuses a lot more on the turbulent and downright obnoxious relationship that Mark shared with Coach John Du Pont. This is primarily, a psychological drama. And as most such movies go, it is slow. So if you are looking for a sport movie, this is not likely to appease you.Now, knowing the nature of the film, we move onto the performances. Channing Tatum shows commendable acting prowess, and plays his role very seriously, having no doubt put in a lot of effort into immersing himself into the character. But, I did feel that he was ineffective in showing any wide range of emotions, and had a constant 'pout'(if I may call it that) throughout the film. From the very first frame to the very last, his expression hardly ever changes, so he does rub off as pointlessly grumpy. Steve Carrell steals the show in this movie, hands down. He plays a disturbed and maniacal old man to perfection. Mark Ruffalo as Dave Schultz is the 'life' of the movie. He's fun and engaging and nails every emotion there is.The direction is meticulous and it is easy to see that a lot of thought and effort has gone into the making of each scene. Silence is used very effectively in this film, especially one scene involving Tatum exercising furiously in a black hood, is silently impacting.What works for this movie is its direction and performances. What doesn't is its unrelenting desire to be dark and brooding at all times. At one point, I literally felt like shaking Tatum's head and shouting at him to just speak a few words and tell us what his pout is all about. At the end, the story takes you by storm, and is undoubtedly the most impactful moment in the film. But still, too much is left unclear. You might say that the director deliberately abstained from coming to any conclusions or taking any sides, but to have seen two hours of slow character build-up, with little to nothing actually happening on screen, we're left with the distinct feeling that there was more to the story than was revealed to us. You're left wanting more because nothing much happened for a lot of the movie, and too much happened in the last few minutes. It leaves the actions of the people involved open to interpretation, but is ineffective in having a lasting impact on the observer. I think this movie was too subtle, in everything from the conveying of emotion, to the elucidation of each character's inner thoughts, to the portrayal of deceit and deception, all of which inhibit the viewer from actually being a part of proceedings.And so, I felt a little bit let down. There's hardly any wrestling. There are no feelings of triumph and glory associated with sport. There is an end that could have provided closure and rounded off the movie well, but it is deliberately left for dead.Foxcatcher is a good movie, but not great. It wants to show, but not tell. It wants to reveal, but not actually make us feel. That is both the reason for it's success and the ultimate reason for it's demise.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The American dream slowly turning Grey,"Calling Steve Carell character (John du Pont) creepy is me being to nice. This guy is just chilling, unsettling, disturbing and can't stand to watch sometimes.The film Foxcatcher is Based on the true story of Mark and Dave Schultz - brothers and Olympic championship wrestlers, who found themselves involved with John du Pont - their sponsor and eccentric multimillionaire. This relationship would eventually lead down a path to murder.Foxcatcher had a lot of hype not because of the director or the other actors like Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo. The hype was for the comedy star Steve Carell has he takes a different performance from his usual comedy performance and how unnoticeable he is in this movie. There was a lot of Oscar Buzz about Carell performance for months after months about it and after seeing the film I can see why being are raving over this but I think it's a little bit to over hyped.This movie may have stepped up Steve Carell career as not just a goofy comedy star but a serious actor as well, because in this movie his disturbingly and disgusting to the point were I forgot Steve Carell was playing this character.Mark Ruffalo gives a great performance in this movie as he always do, because even when he's in a bad film he still gives it his all and in this he dose.Probably the most over looked performance in this movie is actually Channing Tatum. I remember back in the day where Tatum was a bad actor and the movies that he was in you know these stupid comedy's that flopped at the box office, yeah those movies, but in this movie he gives a Oscar worthy performance that got so over looked that I'm actually shocked about. Tatum is good actor and I this he did brilliant.Bennett Miller has proved himself to be a brilliant film maker when it comes to drama or Biographical films, and his previous films Capote, Moneyball and now this film totally shows his brilliant's in that. In this film Miller shows when the American dream of wining and being the best can turn Grey and really dark. He directed this movie with slick and passion and you really felt that in this movie.The make-up in the movie was pretty well done. Now I don't normally bring up this in my reviews but in this movie every actor in this movie has make-up on, and it didn't look rubber like Cloud atlas make-up was.For problems I have some like: The movie can be very slow at times now don't get me wrong I like slow paste movies because it's building up to something big, but in this movie they are scenes were it could have been cut out. The senses were you supposed to feel sad or shocked to kind of felt hollow for me.Overall Foxcatcher is a good time first watch film and what I mean is the film is good but I don't want to watch it again. Why would I re-watch a film that make me feel disturbed deep inside, I'm sorry I just can't... still a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Channing Tatum is in his best performance I've ever seen him in as a quiet, overtly nervous, mistreated, lonely and angry-under-the-surface adult who feels dangerously inferior to his older brother played by Mark Ruffalo.

Brother's Grimm,"It's award season everyone! On the day I am writing this, the Golden Globes is set to descend upon us with the majestic two-hour red carpet special lying in wait along with my pot of coffee and sugar- filled lemonade. Cheers time zones. Of the films listed in the ""Best Films"" category, Foxcatcher, Selma, and The Theory of Everything, are the only ones I hadn't seen when the nominations were announced so I decided to catch up when they were released in UK cinemas, starting with Foxcatcher. Foxcatcher brings to life the true story of Jon Du Pont, played by Steve Carell, and his efforts in hiring the Olympic wrestling champions Mark and Dave Schultz, played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo respectively, to train under the ""Foxcatcher"" estate and ready a team for the 1988 Olympics. Although, from this short synopsis anyway, Foxcatcher seems to be primarily a sports film, the reality is that Foxcatcher is a different monster entirely.When I first watched the trailer to Foxcatcher, I was astonished at the transformation of Carell, whose unrecognisable performance as Du Pont is undeniably the best feature of the film, with his character's eerie presence and ambiguous nature symbolising the tone I felt the film was trying to convey throughout its' two hour run- time. Both Carell and Tatum portray characters that are undeniably against type, and I felt this only enhanced the film's strengths, as it's dark and grim tone was unexpected, due in part to the fact that I had no previous knowledge of the events surrounding the story.Another strength of the film is Ruffalo's performance, who, like Carell, is nominated for a Golden Globe, yet what stuck me most about the film was it's clear emphasis on the notion of family, with themes throughout focusing on brotherhood, paternal and maternal instincts, as well as feelings of isolation, particularly in relation to Du Pont, whose Gatsby-esque wealth and fame, brings with it a sense of loneliness and despair, helped only by his unusual love for his very own Daisy Buchanan, in the form of Mark Schultz.Overall, Foxcatcher is a dark and twisted tale of one man's isolation which engaged me throughout. Its' grim nature and rather depressing feel may be too much for some, but in my opinion, Foxcatcher is a solid and surprising piece of cinema. Roll on the red carpet.Overall Score: 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Did the positive reviewers watch the same movie I did?,"I seriously don't understand the positive reviews for this movie. I created an IMDb account JUST to write this review - I feel that strongly about it.It doesn't matter how well an actor portrays a real person - a bad movie is a bad movie. The actors are not at fault.I tried so hard to have some kind of emotional response throughout the whole film, but it was so dry, so slow-paced, and so long that by the time it was over I was truly upset that I just spent more than 2 hours watching it.This would have been more interesting as a simple documentary. It SHOULD NOT have been made a major motion picture - not this one anyway. It's possible it could have been made into an interesting movie, but this was NOT it.I really appreciate good dialog - meaning I don't need a comedy or action, or special effects to entertain me.

"Kept me interested, but I am a little disappointed","This film tells the story of a Olympic wrestling champion who is offered to be trained by a multi-millionaire on his estate. Things start to get sour when the champion's brother complicates the picture.""Foxcatcher"" tells the story of the Schultz brothers and the millionaire du Pont's story from the perspective of Mark Schultz. Mark gets attention and adoration from du Pont, but soon his limelight is robbed by his older brother. There are ups and downs, but I find the ups and downs not engaging enough. The road to Olympic glory could be inspiring and touching, but I guess this is not the focus of this film, therefore this journey to Olympic glory is very understated in ""Foxcatcher"".The many subplots are not adequately explained, such as the appearance of military vehicles and firearms; and more importantly the homo-erotic undertones of du Pont's wrestling training. The ending is abrupt and has no build up to it. Though the film kept me interested, it did not manage to thrill me as it potentially could.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Well executed, but if you're looking for more than just an internet article, you will be a little let down.","The performance by Steve Carell as Du Pont was award winning. It was hard to tell the difference between the actor, and the late Du Pont. Tatum and Ruffalo were also fantastic. But we never get inside the head of Du Pont, or his family history.

"A very creepy and unsettling performance by @SteveCarell. Very much worth seeing, if for no other reason than his performance.","""I want more than anything to win a gold medal...and I think you and I working in tandem, we can get him there."" John du Pont (Carell) is an eccentric millionaire who loves his country and wrestling. He wants nothing more than to my the coach of an Olympic gold medalist and thinks he finds the perfect candidate in Mark Schultz (Tatum). What starts off as a perfect paring begins to strain when Mark's brother joins the team. There is no way to talk about this movie without talking first about the performance by Steve Carell. He is known primarily as a comic actor so he was an interesting choice to play someone as off kilter as du Pont. The fact that it was him though made the character that much creepier. The make-up is so good that it is easy for you not to think of Carell in the role and it adds to the impact of the movie. The way he plays du Pont is so unsettling. Prolonged stares and pauses really make you feel uncomfortable for almost the entire movie, and that is a good thing. I remember when the actual events happened but that did not detract from the enjoyment of the movie at all. I also have to admit that Channing Tatum did a fantastic job in this and I really think it should have been him rather then Ruffalo who should have been nominated for this movie. The movie is very creepy and very well done but not as good as I was hoping for. Overall, a very good movie with great acting, the only downside is that is seems to slow down a little toward the end. That said I do still highly recommend this movie if for no other reason than to watch Steve Carrell. I give it a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Intense drama with brilliant acting! 6/10,"Review: Although the acting in this film is superb, I did find it quite dull and really slow. The true story is about the wrestling Olympic gold medalist, the Schultz brothers who have a really close relationship until Mark Schultz gets taken in by a wealthy John du Pont who wants to mentor him through the Seoul Olympics. After convincing his brother, Dave Schultz, to come on board, he moves his family to the luxurious du Pont estate were the rest of the USA wrestling team are training. After certain events, Mark starts to distance himself from du Pont which causes friction in the once happy household. It also affects Marks performance in wrestling and John starts to breakdown after the lose of his mother. The storyline has enough drama to keep you glued to your seat and the fact that it is a true story, it does make it quite interesting but the tone and mood of the film made it quite depressing. The performances from Carrell, Ruffalo and Tatum were brilliant and I loved the chemistry between the brothers. The director chose not to delve into why John du Pont had such a weird state of mind so you have to come up with your own conclusion, why he done half of the things that he did. I know that he had a issues with pleasing his mum, who seemed disappointed with everything that he done, but he did have a touchy aura which put everyone on edge. Anyway, it's a watchable movie which gives an insight into the secret world of wrestling but for entertainment, I did find it quite boring it parts. Watchable!Round-Up: I really can't believe that this movie made a lose at the box office! For the performances alone, it should have made double the budget but the audiences must have found it a bit much to watch. It is full of intense drama and there are some emotional moments so you do have to be in the right mood to watch it. The director, who also made Moneyball and Capote, has only made 6 movies in his career so he's done quite good for his short time in directing. I did think that the film ended quite abruptly because you don't get to see how they done at the Olympics or what happened to them after they left du Ponts estate. Anyway, the main element which made this movie watchable was the acting. Apart from that, the storyline was interesting but it seemed to hit a brick wall after a while.Budget: $24million Worldwide Gross: $16millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biopics about the famous Olympic gold medalist, the Schultz brothers and there relationship with the wealthy John du Pont. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
You really have to be in the mood for this one....,"Very serious and rather demented....the perfect makeup for Academy Award nominations (have you ever seen a comedy get the Oscar).John DuPont (Steve Carell) has no idea how to make a dollar or how to spend it. He's an amateur birdwatcher (even wrote a book on it), let loose a dozen prized horses, bought a military tank with extras, lives in a remote mega-mansion, flies by helicopter everywhere, pays for a wrestling team (calling himself coach even though he is high school level at best), pays for a flattering documentary of basically himself stating my athletes look to me as a father / mentor, pays to win a seniors tournament, pays to have the entire US team train on his premises, has to be visible as coach at the Olympics and never gave a crap about his own mother...self absorbed to say the least. This is a new thing for Steve to play a character who is basically not sane.While Mr. DuPont is the focus of interest, we are compelled to identify with Dave (Mark Ruffalo) but not Mark (Channing Tatum) who is supposed to be the main character. You see, Dave is the voice of reason whereas Mark is just another dumbass athlete. In the near end, a shooting occurs to which I say stupid Americans with guns....sorry but you had it coming (I'm Canadian). At the very end, reality again sets in for Mark (Channing) which is a further depressing note.As for the story, you kinda already know it: two brothers achieve Olympic gold (must have been different weight classes), one gets recruited to train with DuPont, the other is brought on board and Mark achieves gold again. Tragedy is omnipresent throughout the entire film. I give this move a 6/10, as opposed to higher, as it's just not uplifting at all. At the conclusion, I just felt depressed and not motivated to ever watch it again (I define watching a movie more than once as a good movie). See it for sure, but be prepared for a downer if that's your thing.StevePunchard.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, slow-burning drama","Based on a true story, in 1987 a Olympic Gold Medal-winning wrestler, Mark Schultz (played by Channing Tatum), is approached by a billionaire, John Du Pont (played by Steve Carell). Du Pont offers to coach him and a group of other wrestlers with the next Olympics in mind. They will stay at his estate, Foxcatcher. Soon, Schultz's brother, David (played by Mark Ruffalo), is also brought onboard, as an assistant coach. However, Du Pont may be harbouring some personal issues and demons...Intriguing drama though quite slow in its development. Not dull - there's always enough happening to keep you interested. You get the feeling that something is going to happen, but you don't know how calamitous it will be...This said, it does come close to being too slow and there are are signs as to what the conclusion is going to be, just the victim(s) isn't certain. The slow pace also gives you time to think about where everything is going, and this is a bad thing, as you can foresee some of the conclusion.Surprising casting, and it works! Mark Ruffalo was no surprise as David - intellectual, character-driven drama is his bread-and- butter. He put in a solid performance and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.No, the surprises are the inclusion of Steve Carell and Channing Tatum. Carell tends to do comedies and his performance here as the very complex and creepy Du Pont is quite a departure for him. Good work by him though, for which he was rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar nomination.Tatum usually stars in cheesy comedies, one-dimensional action movies and/or as eye-candy for females, so a serious drama is a leap for him too. He does get to play a slow-witted meathead here, so maybe not so much of a stretch for him. Good work in the role though.Overall, intriguing though maybe a bit too drawn out.

"Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo at the peak of their careers","When you see Steve Carell in a movie, you expect him to be the funniest thing in a movie. When you see Channing Tatum, you expect him to be buff, and be the hot hero of the movie. When you see Mark Ruffalo, you expect to see comedy-drama movies, and he's just a side character. With Foxcatcher, you see none of those. Instead, you see a very ominous picture. The musical score is scarcely used, which makes it even better. The best part of the picture, no doubt, is Steve Carell as John E. DuPont. Holy Hell! He was frightening just to look at. And him talking without yelling is actually what sells it. Channing Tatum was absolutely phenomenal as Mark Schultz. Not only did he nail the role perfectly, he took it to the next level, and actually managed to even stay in character even when he injured himself with the mirror. Mark Ruffalo was rather quiet as Dave Schultz, but even then, it's necessary for the character development. Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher is an underrated gem that people overlooked. With a sports movie, you get to know the players of the team, you have them lose first, but along the way they win the games, and eventually come closer as a team and family. With Foxcatcher, none of that happens. Instead, you get a chronological series of events, and Steve Carell being rather reclusive toward his team, and his mother, played by Vanessa Redgrave. It doesn't have you watching, and enjoying it. It has you watching a reality with actors, who are usually cast in stereotypical roles, breaking that streak, and having the people they're playing come out instead of them. This movie easily made it to my top 20 list.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Eagle has Crash Landed,"Greetings again from the darkness. The 1996 newscast remains vivid in my mind. It was captivating due to the bizarre circumstances and the tragedy involving an athlete whose Olympic career I had followed closely. Initially, I had trouble reconciling the story of this popular world class athlete and the mentally troubled billionaire who was part of one of America's richest and most iconic families. This movie fills in some of the gaps.Director Bennett Miller (Capote, Moneyball) is a meticulous filmmaker and is never in a hurry as a story teller. He allows the characters to develop on screen at their own pace ... and this time the pace is excruciatingly slow - in a brilliant, yet painful to watch manner. The lead characters are a diverse trio of men. Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) won Olympic Gold in 1984, but he is shy and withdrawn to the point of being socially awkward and unable to capitalize on his victory. His older brother Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) also won a Gold Medal in 1984, and is very engaging family man who helped raise Mark, while building endorsements and job opportunities for himself. The triumvirate is completed by the incredibly odd billionaire John DuPont (Steve Carell), who proclaims himself a wrestling coach after building a state of the art training facility on his family estate. The ultra rich can do such things.John DuPont was never able to live up to his mother's (Vanessa Redgrave) standards. She even paid the chauffeur's son to be John's friend as they were growing up. With Mark always in the shadow of his more popular brother, DuPont seizes the opportunity to capitalize on Mark's vulnerability and invite him to lead his Foxcatcher wrestling team (named after the estate which is near Valley Forge). DuPont's ultimate goal is to also have Dave join them, but it's a tougher sell for various reasons.The mommy issues and brother issues drive the need for validation and are at the core of story here, as are ego, ""patriotism"", and ultimately delusion. Steve Carell sports a nose apparatus that captures the reason DuPont nicknamed himself the ""eagle"". He also kicks his head back, while slumping his shoulders, in physically capturing DuPont's unorthodox movements. But that's nothing compared to the eerie aura he puts off whenever he must deal with another person. He sends up red flags to anyone even minimally aware of their surroundings, but to a lost soul like Mark, he becomes a father figure and ""coach"".A wrestling movie would figure to be male dominated, but even with that, Sienna Miller (as Dave's wife) and Vanessa Redgrave (as Jean DuPont) are almost non-existent as the only female characters. Anthony Michael Hall has a brief supporting role, and it's nice to see Guy Boyd back on screen as well. However, most every scene is some mixture of Carell, Tatum and Ruffalo, and they each deliver. It's a side of Carell we have never before seen (many of the greatest comics have a dark side), and Tatum is spot on as the hulking, sulking Mark, while Ruffalo captures the easy charm and sensitivity of Dave.The story offers further proof that life can be stranger than fiction ... especially when it involves an insecure and mentally unstable billionaire who envisions himself as a leader of men.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Superbly Acted, but Lazily Paced!","Based on the true events, Bennett Miller's 'Foxcatcher' has some great performances, but as a film, despite some powerful moments, its uneven, thanks to a lazily paced narrative.

Max Frye & Dan Futterman, attempts to re-tell a true story with honesty. But, as mentioned from my summary itself, the film is is very slow. I was engrossed by du Pont's ambition, but the sub-plot involving the estranged brothers, is far from impressive. And lastly, I couldn't feel for any of the characters.

He deserves brownie points for justifying a part, that's completely opposite from his general on-screen persona. Channing Tatum as Mark Schultz, is very sincere.

"Ornithologist, Philatelist, Philanthropist","When you have a movie based on a true story, where the producer is one of the characters in said movie (in this case, Mark Schultz) then one must be cognizant of fact that the contents of the film may be skewed in a way so as to not upset the producer's credibility. That said, with the help of some momentarily interesting (but highly flawed) filmmaking from director Bennett Miller (Moneyball) ""Foxcatcher"" does go places that I didn't think it would go; to the tune of some very obvious sequences of homoerotic innuendo.Synopsis: This is the story of Olympic gold medalist, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) a man who constantly lived in the shadow of his older brother David (Mark Ruffalo). In the mid 80's, Mark gets a call from a representative of John du Pont (Steve Carell) an unstable but extremely wealthy man; who touts himself as a bird watcher, patriot and leader of men. Du Pont initially recruits Mark to head up his wrestling team he has prestigiously dubbed Team Foxcatcher. But as du Pont takes Mark under his wing, he forces himself into the role of father figure (a role previously held by David) and then some weird stuff happens, resulting in sequences where Channing Tatum is doing drugs and sporting frosted tips. OK, so while this is a watchable character study, it's not much more than that. Even with its ending, which is highly eventful but so jarring that, for some, it may seem to come out of nowhere, ""Foxcatcher"" meanders around for a majority of its 134 minute runtime, likely losing most of its audiences along the way.The biggest issue with ""Foxcatcher"" is most definitely the pacing. Olympic wrestling is an odd sport to watch on film if you don't know what is specifically going on. Before going into ""Foxcatcher"" I'd questioned how Miller was going to film events pertaining to the sport itself in a way that would come across as entertaining to all audiences. But then again, some critics used to think the same about filming boxing, since (aside from momentary flurries) boxing would seem like a fairly uneventful sport to film. But since the 70's with movies like ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"", it has become obvious that boxing can be shot in a way that is highly theatrical. As for ""Foxcatcher"", Miller seems unable to solve the problem of translating Olympic wrestling into something theatrically entertaining. Thus, every wrestling match shown hangs there, lifeless, especially if you have no clue how matches are scored or how one wins and loses. This flaw is clearly on Miller and his bland technique of filming these sequences. Also, it doesn't help that about 1/3 of this movie is wrestling matches and training sessions, which I suspect will put some to sleep. The second part of this pacing problem lies with the decision not to add a musical score. Yes, at times, near the end, there is a score. But most of this film is filled with silence and the sound of wrestling shoes on mats. Now, I can see what Miller was going for (with a lack of music brings on feelings of solitude, which represent how Mark Schultz is feeling during most of this movie). But this experiment comes across as awkward at best.The acting is one of this film's only ""bright spots"", so let's focus on that for a moment. Tatum and Ruffalo do some of their best dramatic work here, as visually they become these characters; down to the wrestler mannerisms; the way they carry themselves and simply walk around. As for Carell, his performance will be the one everybody focuses on, since he plays a character so far removed from the slap-stick realm, with more prosthetics on than a Lord of the Rings character. And while he does do an excellent job portraying du Pont, would I say, give him the Oscar right now? No. Maybe the most complimentary thing I could say about his performance was that at many times I forgot it was Carell under all of the makeup; which may predictably be the reason he wins the Oscar this awards season.Final Thought: As wrestling is more of a psychological sport than a physical one (even though it may appear otherwise) so is this movie. That is to say, though there is not a lot of action, there is clear and continuous psychological conflict between the three main characters within ""Foxcatcher"", which is an interesting take away.

"Overall, an excellent watch.","I prefer my movies to have a faster pace than the slow moving Foxcatcher, but when this film hits the mark, it does it with a bang.Possibly does not hurt that I knew little about the true story of Mark Schultz, A gold metal Olympic wrestler who gets offered a free ride to train with a man named John Du Pont, and eccentric millionaire attempting to stroke his own ego through the achievements of others.Steve Carell has dabbled with drama in his Indi comedies like The Way Way Back, but this time he goes full on leaving the jokes behind and putting on a vast amount of make up to hide his face and get into the character.Steve and Channing Tatum together were good but I really liked Mark Ruffalo in the movie. That was worth seeing.The movie drags in a way that makes me feel the filmmakers were like "" I don't give a crap"". It could have been shorter but still a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
actors stretching out,"Based on a true story, it's 1987. Both Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and his older more revered brother David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) are both Olympic gold medal winners from 3 years before in L.A. Mark is struggling to make ends meet. David is offered a job to coach in Colorado. Mark is flown into the impressive estate Foxcatcher Farm where the eccentric John du Pont (Steve Carell) offers to train him with all expenses paid. He tries to get David to form a world-class team but David is settled with his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller) and kids. John du Pont is driven by the need to impress his disapproving mother Jean (Vanessa Redgrave) who views wrestling as a low sport.This is Tatum and Carell stretching out their acting skills. Ruffalo is doing his normal good work. It's a quiet character study. The most interesting part of the movie is watching these actors inhabit these characters. However there isn't much tension in the drama. It doesn't play up the competition which a sports movie usually does. It doesn't push hard enough on the homosexual question either. The movie needs something to amp up the tension.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Like Watching Bugs Eat Each Other in a Jar,"In ""Foxcatcher,"" director Bennett Miller goes for a slow-boiling sense of building tension, but he keeps such tight reins on his film that he ends up almost suffocating it. Its clinical restraint works well at the beginning, but as things progress and something rotten begins to emerge from out of the film's bizarre true-life story, he refuses to change the film's pace and it begins to drag when it should be moving toward a conclusion.I couldn't find much fault in the film's acting though, especially in Steve Carrell's uber-creepy portrait of a member of the DuPont family who serves as a nightmare version of the sense of privilege and exception that the super-wealthy can have about themselves. Channing Tatum hasn't completely convinced me that he's not just a flash in the pan, but he went a long way to earning my respect as the block-headed wrestler who wants to get out of the shadow of his brother and falls for DuPont's spell. And Mark Ruffalo brings his scruffy naturalness to the role of Channing's older brother, the biggest victim of the film and the only thing that comes close to giving this twisted and sordid tale something warm and normal to anchor it. Indeed, my biggest problem with the film is that it's like watching bugs in a jar -- it's so clinical and detached that I found myself morbidly fascinated watching these particular insects eat each other but not caring all that much about the outcome.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Tragic sports story,"Interesting story, not as easy to follow some of the timelines when I looked up them on the internet but then going over a ten year period. The two brothers in this are very well played as the tragedy of the event unfolds with the pressure and the madness surrounding all of this. The film does give a good idea as to the sheer commitment made by these athletes. Interesting as well to take such a story to a larger audience as one I didn't know about. Such a story has probably being played out many a time in sports across the world (Iraq football team springs to mind). I did think they could have done a bit more with the film as the film flowed along telling the story as best they could given such timelines into a two hour film, but it's not a film I would watch again in a number of year's time.

The Tedious Process of Foxcatching,"In Foxcatcher Channing Tatum plays real life Olympic gold medal winning wrestler, Mark Schultz. In the early 80's, Mark is hired by Billionaire John Du Ponte (Steve Carrell) to train him and a team of Olympic hopefuls for the upcoming summer games. John's ulterior motive is to hire on Mark to eventually convince his brother David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), a better wrestler, to join their wresting organization and coach. Mark is lured in to the eccentric world of money, drugs once under John's wing. After John is able to buy David into joining the team; Mark then begins to fall apart and the real life events of this odd bit of history play out for our viewing horror. I think I was either too young or just not interested enough in news a young kid to remember this story. Of course a lot of the story was amped up for the sake of a good narrative but the major events are true. I will not spoil the ending for others of you who do not remember the outcome. A lot of time is spent in this film with tedious character development. My hat is off to Channing Tatum for branching out on more challenging roles, this is a much deeper departure from Magic Mike 2. Although he is still a big frat guy; he just plays a bigger, dumber frat guy with a prosthetic nose and cauliflower ear. There is one big climactic scene toward the end where he shows some promise. I love how filmmakers always seem to visually represent a cocaine addiction spiraling out of control with a douchey haircut. I wonder how that creative process goes. ""Okay, cocaine addiction is spiraling out of control at this point, besides dark circles under the eyes how can we get our point across?"" ""Douchey, haircut?"" ""Yes, yes spike the hair and frost the tips, DONE!"" Steve Carrell's performance is very complex and should gain Oscar recognition. He has obviously done some working on nailing the John du Ponte look and mannerisms. Although from the footage I have seen of the real John du Ponte , Carrell is playing him a little more ridged than the actual person; kind of Frankenstein-esq. Perhaps as a means of really selling the sinister nature of the character. Sienna Miller plays David's wife Nancy. This is the second Bio-pic this year for Sienna who played Chris Kyle's wife Taya in American Sniper (2014). The overall message of this film is that we all are seeking someone's approval in life, be it a mother, father, brother, friend or employer. This movie is a very slow burn and requires some patience. If you were aware of the story, then this will be a very interesting watch. Even after seeing the film having not known, it's interesting to go back and see the actual people and real life story. Aside from seeing Steve Carrell outside of his comfort zone and pushing hard on a new dramatic character (that's what she said), this movie offers little until the end in the strait entertainment department. Artfully done, just not one you need to see more than once.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic acting,"I want to start off by saying that I don't think the descriptions of this being too ""cold"" or ""detached"" are warranted at all. I mean, for a story like this, how else did people expect it to be told? Bennett Miller's directing is fine, could be really predictable in some scenes and the way the music soars over them, but could be really inspired and precise as well. It's the screenplay and the psychological dilemma between these three lead characters that drive the film and make it incredibly compelling. All three main performances are fantastic. Carrell's could've felt like a complete gimmick, but he makes it work to unbelievably, but quietly, intense heights. Ruffalo provides the effortless naturalism that he's so great at, and Tatum works in ways I would've never expected. It's a very understated performance, and whether everything he did was thought out or just came off that way, it was truly great work from him. Very intriguing film overall, but definitely sort of difficult to truly and deeply love.",,Anonymous,Biography
A movie that throws you on your back and holds you down,"Every comedian clearly has a burning desire to be seen as a ""serious actor"" at least once in their career: Jim Carrey had his ""Truman Show""; Steve Coogan wrote himself into ""Philomena""; and (whilst he has denied that he is desperate for this sort of attention) Foxcatcher is Steve Carrell's turn. and boy does he do a good job.Foxcatcher is not a feel-good sort of movie. It is made all the more harrowing when you realise that it is based on a true story.Carrell stars as John DuPont, heir of the enormously wealthy DuPont family, who made their fortune in chemicals and CFCs. Growing up in a cossetted environment on the family's Foxcatcher ranch, under the guidance of his manipulative and controlling mother (Vanessa Redgrave), DuPont strives to find ways to impress the elderly matriarch. Vanessa Redgrave in fine form as the DuPont matriarch.His latest attempt is to act as Olympic coach to the US wrestling team for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. To this end he throws money at the problem 'recruiting' the gold-medal winning Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and trying to recruit his family-man brother and fellow gold-winner David (Mark Ruffalo). But the road to Olympic glory in this case is not easy, and the relationship between the driven but self-doubting Mark and the erratic and eccentric DuPont becomes progressively more strained.We have seen two films in recent months that portrayed bullying justified by the goal of achieving excellence in performance: JK Thompson's portrayal in ""Whiplash"" did it through old-fashioned shouting, demeaning comments and violence; Carell's DuPont delivers it in a much darker and more odious way, eroding the souls of his victims through the vicious application of his power and position. In this sense, you could effectively position the character of John DuPont as one of cinema's greatest villains.Carrell's performance is excellent and his Oscar-nomination (albeit as a bit of an outsider behind Keaton and Redmayne) is well-deserved. It is a startling deviation from his previous screen persona, and (looking at archive video footage of Dupont) it is also a remarkably good impersonation of his mannerisms and delivery.The quality of the lead though shouldn't take away from the supporting acting of both Tatum, who gives a career-best performance as the brooding and increasingly disillusioned protégé, and of Ruffalo in the quieter and more nuanced role of his brother. Only Ruffalo has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, which seems something of a shame. However, the latter's performance in a video ""tribute"" to Dupont is toe-curlingly embarrassing. In fact, a number of the scenes in this film fall into that category reaching its zenith in a seat-squirming demonstration of Dupont's coaching skills in front of the unimpressed Redgrave.Oscar-nominated direction is by Bennett Miller, best known for another well regarded 'sports' film ""Moneyball"" and the earlier ""Capote"" which was also Oscar nominated for direction. The tight and effective writing is by E. Max Fry and ""Capote"" writer Dan Futerman, and one of the impressive things about this screenplay is that it never completely fills in all of the blanks in the relationship between Mark Schulz and DuPont: some of the scenes are left deliberately vague (notably in the night-time 'training session' scene).Whilst not being much into 'sports films' of the baseball/boxing variety, the film positions the wrestling as something of a side-line to the emotional drama. You should certainly not be put off from seeing this film because of that. It comes with my recommendation.(If you enjoyed this review, please see past reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email on the site to receive future posts).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Unsettling silence,There's a sense of foreboding that runs through the entirety of the film which leaves you unsettled by the end. A superb performance from Steve Carrell who in addition to being nearly unrecognizable has a very creepy screen presence throughout. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are good as well but didn't really exceed other dramas I've seen them in.The wrestling scenes looked great and you could tell they trained hard to get them looking right. This seems like a small detail but when it's done well it really adds to the immersion.There's not a lot to the story but the way its shot and the dark tone it invokes really raises it up from being a simple character study. It feels more about family and that fear being a failure in their eyes.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressive. But drags.,"Director Bennett Miller is no stranger to creating successful films, with Moneyball and Capote already on his filmography – both heavily nominated with Oscars. Plus having the credit of leading (the late and great) Phillip Seymour Hoffman to his best lead actor award as Truman Capote. Miller's newest film, Foxcatcher, is heading in the same direction with Oscar-bait written all over it. But is it worthy?Foxcatcher tells the true story of the dark and fascinating relationship between an eccentric multi-millionaire and two champion wrestlers. Portrayed by Channing Tatum, Olympic gold medal winner, Mark Schultz is invited by wealthy heir, John du Pont (Steve Carrell) to help train a team of wrestlers for the 1988 Seoul Olympics at his state of the art facilities.Schultz jumps at the opportunity, hoping to focus on his own training and to finally jump out of his older brother's shadow, Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo). Fuelled by paranoia and alienation, the trio is propelled into an ultimatum of tragedy.Given the nature of the story, the film is reflectively creepy and can be rather uncomfortable viewing – but all in its favour, as it sets the atmosphere in a dark psycho palette of entertainment.Clocking in at just over two hours, the fruitful story does not urge to ripen quickly, but rather methodically and frustratingly; pacing is slow, some silent scenes drag as the narrative progressively builds to a devastating melodrama. It's seems like a long journey.To its advantage, and probably one of the main discussions of Foxcatcher, is that all of the lead actors physically transform for their characters. Which, as well as being impeccably mounted are performed incredibly.Steve Carrell, who stars as John du Pont, is in fact, almost unrecognizable as he covers his face in prosthetic and artificial aging. It's a performance unlike Carrell has ever done before, given his comedic background and often silly roles. It's odd casting, but he is serious, mesmerizing and just wonderful throughout.Likewise, Channing Tatum is also committed to the role of transformation as he adds Hulk-like biceps and triceps to his already overly-toned body. He shuffles, not walks, and adjusts his Hollywood-lovable face to a bulked and bullied jawline that looks remarkably like the real Schultz.Overall, it is impressive work - yet drags as the Shakespearean level of story slowly takes place and develops.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The bleak side of the Olympic dream,"The film is based on the true story of brothers Mark and Dave Schultz (played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo), American wrestlers who won gold medals in the 1984 Olympics. The film begins after their wins as they are pursued to to live and train in a sports community owned by eccentric mega-millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell).It is easy to distinguish this as an independent film as opposed to a typical Hollywood film. A Hollywood film would likely have ended with the Olympic glory with the final victory in slow motion (including the audience jumping to its feet) with a blaring orchestra. Instead, ""Foxcathcher"" shows a very deglamourized life (especially Mark's) post-Olympics, bravely showing the flip-side of the Olympic dream.Director Bennett Miller uses a story-telling style that is deliberately bleak and emotionally distant. This mood is best shown in Carell's performance which is subtle and repressed as he portrays someone who, most of his life, was given too much money and not enough love. The only warmth in the film comes from Ruffalo whose character has found happiness with his young family.The bleak style is fine but up to a point as the movie feels too long a 2.25 hours. Also, despite the length, there still seems to too little background of some characters. It's still praiseworthy, though, for its unique approach to sports biographies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Battle of Ego, Power, and Wealth","After the gripping character studies and intelligent social commentaries that Bennett Miller has become such a master of, there's no better filmmaker to tackle this shocking true story—a tragedy about people who ambitiously chased the American Dream and actually fell for its seduction. Coming off of a championship win, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is near the top of Olympic wrestling but lacks the proper wit, ambition, and strategy to further himself until he is fatefully invited to meet John du Pont (Steve Carell), a member of the most famous and wealthy dynasty in the country, who instills him with athletic fury, drive, and infectious motivational philosophy. Mark truly wants to be the best in the world, but his lacking astuteness has now led him away from his fatherly and encouraging brother, Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo)—a respected coach and wrestler who Mark enviously realizes is a whole level above him—and into the psychologically unpredictable hands of a creepily uncanny, eccentric stranger who he admittedly hasn't even heard of.With the help of absolutely convincing make-up that shapes the noticeably wicked/large nose and eerie teeth, Carell delivers a powerfully haunting performance as a socially isolated and awkward man, raised in an out-of-touch environment all his life, who is struggling with numerous egoistic and trust issues that endlessly vex him from within. However, this is also Tatum's show as we follow the rise of this naïve meathead (how can I more politely describe him?) who is clearly vulnerable to being essentially puppeteered by exploitive, power-hungry men. It's worth to point out just how Tatum's childlike, innocent personality here infuses us with total pity for his character while Ruffalo's usual warmth makes us sympathize as well. In fact, Ruffalo's performance is most subtle of all; he's obviously not as flamboyant as the other two and is instead relied on to reflect a certain human quality in an otherwise utterly cold picture. Dave Schultz is a big brother who's undoubtedly talented in the sport, but unlike the other two, his pride doesn't get the better of him since he continually seeks to improve his brother on that path to fame and success as well.Here is where it gets worryingly complicated though because these three personalities develop a paranoid, unreliable dynamic that sees each other vie for that ultimate glory. Foxcatcher thoroughly utilizes the sport of wrestling as not only a point of critique but also as a stark metaphor for this dangerous power struggle between complex individuals behind the scenes. There's no better feeling than being called a winner—being recognized as a man who achieved tremendous victory and success. The fierce competitiveness and the frequent sense of disappointing failure that is so inherent in the very essence of sports has produced an abundance of psychologically and ideologically conflicted, twisted men that are battling with intolerable arrogance and blindness. In the case of John du Pont, the feeling of invalidation and complete disrespect beleaguers him through his days, including the sharp disapproval from his own mother (Vanessa Redgrave) who only views wrestling—her son's sole passion—as a lowly sport. As he witnesses the admiration people express towards the actually capable coaches like Dave and the brawny athletes like Mark, he's sort of put in between—in a position where people recognize him as that one lucky, wealthy son of a gun but nothing more.Through the use of deliberately-timed editing, the constant grapple of jealousy—the lingering sense of betrayal; the sense of unrelenting determination to shine above the others and escape each other's shadows —between these three is realized. The film also paces itself so slowly with countless scenes of dead silence and the absence of a score that would've just easily manipulated our impressions of the people on- screen. It's almost as if Foxcatcher intends to remain as cold and distant from its subjects as possible. Perhaps—gasp—it means to take a more objective perspective of its protagonists (unlike most biopics in recent memory) and allow the final consequences to make its ultimate point.From scene to scene, we witness the amusing awkwardness of du Pont in the wildly slow intonations and recurrent pauses of his speech. In fact, seeing du Pont's erratic behavior and the uncomfortable homoerotic undertones throughout, there's a hilarious black comedy lingering beneath the surface, to the most deceptive extent where laughter seems wholly out of place once you recognize the sheer bleakness of this material. The history of his childhood—of his fortunate birth into and the inheritance from an insanely rich family, is incredibly fascinating. He was born into money without a single clue how to best use it or what to really do with himself.Most of all, what I most admire about Foxcatcher is the perfectly uncompromising, dark direction that Miller takes with this tale. The exceptional cinematography makes sure to emphasize the arrant somberness of the fog that encompasses its characters as the chilliness of a colder winter closes in. There's no tenderness to please mass audiences with here; there's only brutal honesty. Using the frustration with the typical cop-out approaches most biopics take nowadays by becoming a little too close to their subjects and portraying them as completely perfect specimens (hello, The Theory of Everything), Foxcatcher never gets scared away from showing just how flawed and disturbed its characters really are—how frightening and enigmatic the mind of a real human being can eventually become. The film takes the advice of du Pont in absolutely exhibiting its confidence and never backing down from depicting tragedy and human nature at its worst. Now, excuse me: I'm going to go read up some more on these peculiar people and the system that brought them together.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Based on a True story with more to offer,"Foxcatcher begins as a relatively slow drama then begins to take place rather quickly. In a scene which is shot at a distance, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) fills the room with physical force that doesn't stop when the workout ends. This is his home, the only place he's alive and himself. He has an upstairs apartment and a beat-up car and an Olympic gold medal that he puts around his neck before he speaks to bored kids at a school assembly, but his life is in the wrestling room and nowhere else.Suddenly when Schultz gets a mysterious invitation to meet a rich man at a country estate. The man, John du Pont (Steve Carell), he wants Schultz and his older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also an Olympic champion, to move to the estate, Foxcatcher Farm, and start an elite wrestling team that he will bankroll. Du Pont woes Schultz with patriotic bromides and pricks at the younger man's pride and vanity with his words and his checkbook.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Slow-burning, cerebral character study - not for those with a short attention span","FOXCATCHER is a film that is easier to admire than to love, and I mean that in the best way possible. While the slow and deliberate pacing will put a lot of people off, its disturbing subject matter, psychological depth and outstanding performances make it fascinating, if not riveting. For those unaware of what the story is about (like I was), the film mostly revolves around Mark and David Schultz, two Olympic gold medal-winning wrestlers who become involved with eccentric millionaire (billionaire?) John Du Pont, specifically in preparation for the 1988 World Championship and Seoul Olympics. But wrestling is just the conduit for a deep character study of people who looked to overcome personal weakness by achieving greatness. It's really hard to say who gives the best performance out of the three leads because all of them do so well. Mark Ruffalo (who plays Dave Schultz) usually does well, and this is no exception. Steve Carell was barely recognizable as the eccentric Du Pont, greatly aided by prosthetics in his physical transformation, but also quite different in the way he spoke and carried himself compared with what roles he usually plays. I suppose the biggest surprise of them all is Channing Tatum (playing Mark Schultz) who manages to hold his own against these other two acting greats. Although he didn't have a whole lot of dialogue (and really, the film as a whole doesn't), the physicality he brought to the role was incredible in its own right. As for the wrestling scenes, they were shot well, if unspectacular. Basically they did what they needed to do for the narrative, i.e., serve as guideposts so that one didn't get lost in the pacing (and also because they were factual). What interested me the most, though, was the curious relationship that develops between John Du Pont and Mark Schultz. Du Pont takes Mark under his wing, provides him with living quarters, a training facility, and pays him, yet his status as the team coach (and quite a rich one at that) makes it where the relationship is rather one-sided. In real life, John Du Pont was the black sheep of his family and a very lonely man, and taking on Mark Schultz was a way for him to indulge in his interests and to have a friend. Now, as interesting as I find true crime, there usually has to be some stylistic choice or a scene or two which get to me in an emotional way, and this film has that as well. Both of these scenes are dialogue-free and are scored using Arvo Part's ""Fur Alina,"" a hauntingly minimal piano piece which I recently discovered. To me, these scenes (which I won't spoil) perfectly capture the film's melancholy tone. And in general, the score is rather tasteful. Often, the sound design will completely take a back seat and certain scenes will play out free of dialogue with a sort of humming that brings a subtle intensity and a growing sense of dread. Overall, FOXCATCHER is an excellent, dark character study that features some great performances and an ending that will shock you even if you see it coming. Highly recommended, as long you have a good attention span.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Exceptionally Haunting Character Study,"Over three weeks have passed since I viewed this film at the cinema, and to this day it has been continuously on my mind.'Foxcatcher' was one of my most anticipated films of 2014; primarily being hooked by the plot synopsis as well as the cast and director involved. The trailers further heightened both my excitement and expectations, surprisingly I wasn't feeling sceptical about actors mostly involved in comedy portraying characters in a serious film like this. In fact, I was pleased to see Carell taking on such a challenging role, and hopefully expanding his versatility as an actor in terms of portraying another antagonist of sorts since 'The Way Way Back'.Thankfully, this film utterly exceeded my expectations, despite being dissimilar to what the trailer indicated. I was expecting a decent drama with swift pacing and strong performances, instead, I was swept up in a realistic character study which felt strangely atmospheric due to its overriding gritty tone. One of the reasons why the film stuck in my mind as much as it did, was due to the way it 'felt' and left me feeling afterwards; it was as if I simply 'observed' three people's lives. This was achieved by the slow pacing, long takes showcasing REAL emotion and the minimal use of a soundtrack allowing me to effectively experience and take in the chemistry between the characters.The performances did not disappoint either, they were phenomenal and according to me achieved exactly what was required in order for the plot to feel enticing. Firstly, I believe Steve Carell knocked it out of the park; his performance genuinely felt creepy and haunting, merely his presence and figure expression in a given scene evoked a sense of ceaseless dread. Both Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum equally delivered, their performances felt truly genuine; displaying intensity both mentally and physically in a flawless manner. I personally believe all three performances were equally worthy of an Oscar, both Ruffalo and Carell certainly deserved their nominations.To conclude, the wait for this film was definitely worthwhile. Although some people may find the slow pacing and gritty tone distasteful, I found that it helped the film and character development maintain engaging throughout. In addition to this, the film looked excellent, the cinematography was alluring and effectively further helped to set the tone. I'm giving this film a strong 9,7 as it provides an exceptionally haunting and enticing character study, and thus essentially achieves everything it strives for as a compelling biopic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A slight disappointment that drags on for too long but redeems itself with great acting performances,"Foxcatcher was a movie that i was eager to watch since the very first trailer hit. With a cast of Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, and an almost unrecognizable Steve Carell portraying characters in a true story; it was very hard to turn away from seeing this. After watching it i can say that i was a little disappointed by this film for a number of reasons, but the performances of the actors was not one. All three actors mentioned above gave pretty amazing and very convincing performances that were the driving force making me continue to watch this film with eyes open for the entire runtime, a runtime that went for far too long in thought. When a movie makes me constantly look at the time from just after the half way point that is a sign of the film being too long.The 2 hour and 10 minute runtime would have been more sufficient had there a few more key moments for the film to build up to. But the writing let the film down and didn't get me as invested in the overall plot as i should have been. The finale of the film was one that definitely caught me slightly off guard, and redeemed a little of what i was looking for throughout the film. So in the end Foxcatcher was still a good film with great performances but suffered from a long runtime with unfortunately not too many key events to keep me very interested - 7",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Steve Carell like you've never seen him.,"Seeing Steve Carell on the poster of this is what grabbed me at first. Plus Steve Carell in a drama role, you don't see that too often, so I was interested. I was completely amazed by his performance along with Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum. These 3 really go at it in this compelling drama.The story follows the true events of Gold Medal winning wrestler Mike Schultz (Channing Tatum), and his transition into the team Foxcatcher while dealing with pressure from his new glory destined coach, (Steve Carell) and back and forth relations with his brother, (Mark Ruffalo).Steven Carell is very impressive as a troubled, yet strong willed human. The makeup job on him completely immerses him in his character. Channing Tatum, who's last films were 21 and 22 Jump Street, is destined and determined. Mark Ruffalo was probably my favorite performance, he was the perfect support for Tatum in the right moments, and you always felt happy for him because he's always in a cheery mood.The film's story is told pretty straight forward. It doesn't take any risks or add drama every second that their is. It gives us the determination of each character, and they're the shining knights that push on the story's progression. The film just kind of ebbs and flows, and naturally the conflicts fall into place.I will say I wasn't heavily sympathetic toward the characters when you were supposed to, just because they didn't focus well enough on their emotions at times.

Very impressive.I didn't recognize Steve Carell at all! Even after checking IMDb about 2/3 into the movie, to see who the actor is, I was shocked to see it's him and still couldn't really recognize him. Great combination of performance and makeup by Bill Corso.I really like the interaction between Channing Tatum's and Mark Ruffalo's characters, which often communicate without any word and is just as powerful. Great stuff.Great performance, good direction. Story/script are lacking.As a fan of composer Mychael Danna, I couldn't NOT recognize the reoccurring theme, taken directly from his score to ""Capote"" (also directed by Bennett Miller).I also couldn't help getting a ""Boogie Nights"" vibe from this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
SilverRating: Foxcatcher,"""Foxcatcher"" (2014) by Bennett Miller staring Channing Tatum, Steve Carell, and Mark Ruffalo in the true story of the relationship between two Olympic Wrestling Champions of the 1984 Olympics and million dollar mogul, John DuPont is at the top of my list of Best Films of 2014. I saw this at the 2014 AFI Fest Premiere in Los Angeles. Although I will admit that the venue and event I saw this at added to the film's spectacle and my anticipation, the film was truly beautiful. The aesthetics and overall mood of the film grabbed me. If Bennett Miller thought to himself to ""I want to make this film a dark, creepy, and suspenseful."" then he truly succeeded. Foxcatcher embodies darkness yet the cinematography and lighting of the DuPont estate being a mansion surrounded by nature and later the light of the snow completely contradict your emotions of darkness and suspense. Although the rave is around Steve Carell for his depiction of John DuPont, Channing Tatum, I feel, doesn't steal the show but he is the show. His performance is what we follow the whole film and It is hard to see anyone else in this part. The acting done by the cast being Carell, Tatum, and Ruffalo are superb and it is hard to see anyone else in their parts. The story is dark with humor which you aren't sure is more creepy than funny. 8/10 Silver Rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Steve Carrell Casts Crippling Fear,"With Foxcatcher and Moneyball under his belt, it is a wonder why Bennett Miller does not direct more films. Initial thoughts aside, Foxcatcher was a brilliant drama headlined by three great performances. This is easily the best I've seen both Channing Tatum and Steve Carrell who are both known for comedies. The slow pace of the film accompanied by Steve's eerie demeanor and Channing's inarticulated pain invites this ""crippling fear"" of what is to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Chilling drama which soars like an eagle!,"Foxcatcher has the absorbing coldness of a film by Michael Haneke. I had zero interest when I read that it was about Olympic wrestling, however my interest was lighted when I saw the sinister trailer for the film and found out that it was in fact a psychological drama and not some sort of rites-of-passage sports movie. Unfortunately, I did read about the ending and started kicking myself when many critics recommended reading nothing on the true story. So although the ending was no surprise to me, it was still pretty shocking.However, there's much more to admire about the film than its tragic finale. A lot of people have called the film too slow and boring, and whilst it is very slow paced, I never found it boring for a moment. People who find this film boring would probably end up committing suicide if they put themselves through something like Uzak! I did think that it was longer than it needed to be, but it wasn't much of a detraction. Apparently, the original rough cut was almost 4 hours long so the editors have done well to whittle it down to a trim 130 minutes.The beginning of the film perfectly illustrates the lonely existence of wrestler, Mark Schultz. The shots are long, uninterrupted and the lighting is dim. Mark existence is based purely around wrestling as he lacks any sort of social life. His brother is his only friend and even he isn't that friendly towards him. Things change when similarly socially inept, John Du Pont invites him over to his mansion and asks to join his wrestling team and train for the Olympics.There's a thick foreboding atmosphere which penetrates throughout the film. A lot of the sinister edge comes from Steve Carell's outstanding portrayal of wrestling and bird enthusiast, John Du Pont. He's almost unrecognisable with his gigantic prosthetic nose which could outdo Katie Hopkins! He doesn't look, sound or act all that human. There's an otherworldly quality to him and you can't help but become completely absorbed whenever he's on screen. He's an unpredictable character who always remains compelling. The maniacal end scene urged me to find out more about the true life case.I was also impressed with Channing Tatum, who is normally cast as the pretty boy in rom-coms. His performance is pretty intense and a large amount of method acting was involved too. Apparently when he smashed his head on the mirror it was completely improvised! Mark Ruffalo didn't impress me quite as much but he still held his own. Really it's Steve's show and you'll go away from the film with his haunting performance in your mind.Foxcatcher is a supremely creepy and atmospheric film. It's a character and relationship study. Watching John and Mark become friends is quietly gripping. Their fallout is all the more interesting. It's beautifully directed and its quiet surrealism adds to the film's sinister atmosphere. Perhaps it's a little too slow for mass audiences, but fans of Michael Haneke and Paul Thomas Anderson will undoubtedly find a lot to like. I know that I did!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"As they say, sometimes real life can be stranger than fiction ... and Foxcatcher proves it is absolutely true.","I walked into the theatre only knowing a few things -- Channing Tatum, Steve Carrell, wrestling and Oscar-contender. If that's all you know as well ... stop reading ... go to the movies and watch it ... then come back to us and tell us what you think! Going in cold did make the 134 minutes bearable. A little too long, of course! We all know my disdain for movies longer than 120 minutes and constant cry to Hollywood ""Edit! Edit! Edit!""But I digress ... this is an amazing story put on screen in a manner that is worthy of the Oscar-talk.Steve Carrell did a wonderful job as John Du Ponte. And the make-up folks did a wonderful job letting him play this role without us thinking Michael Scott was on the screen. I can only imagine how difficult it is for actors such as Carrell to move beyond such a lovable character -- one that often defines our workspace and conversations. It's hard to be mad at Michael Scott / Steve Carrell therefore without incredible acting and make-up the Foxcatcher story could have been lost when they selected Carrell for the lead role. But it wasn't. If Oscar equals world-class, this team is worthy of the honor.(I will admit, though, that I think Carrell borrowed some characteristics from Gru in Despicable Me ... just a bit.)I loved Channing Tatum in this movie. I don't think it's because I'm a woman who loves Channing Tatum -- he earned a lot of street cred playing Mark Schultz. Yes, he is playing a guy that works out a lot. But Mark's character was complex while quiet -- which is very difficult to get across on screen. It's clear Tatum took this role very seriously and stepped up to the challenge.Mark Ruffalo was outstanding. I don't know if he'll ever get recognized with an award, but I believe he is the premier supporting actor who really pulls out the best acting in the folks that share a screen with him. While Tatum seemed like a natural fit in his role, I was shocked to see Mark Ruffalo on screen as an Olympic wrestler. He was awesome. He was believable. If I were casting a movie, I'd want a role for Ruffalo and Edward Norton. In my humble opinion, these two actors are true chameleons. Except maybe as Hulks (interesting that they both have done those roles ... hmmmm ...)Reading about the true story and behind the scenes is quite intriguing. In a recent interview, Carrell admits that the actors didn't interact much on set. ""It wasn't anything planned, we just naturally didn't interact, aside from the scenes we were doing. We didn't hang out, or bond,"" he said. Reading other articles it's clear this wasn't a fun set to be on. Many of the real-life characters, including David Shultz's wife Nancy, were on set to bring reality to the movie. It's a very serious movie ... with a very serious message.And to add to the real-life drama, Mark Shultz is not happy about how his life story ended up on the screen. He lashed out at Director Bennett Miller over the last few weeks regarding a specific scene in the movie ... and the true life saga from Foxcatcher continues.I believe you will enjoy this movie on-screen and researching the story after wards off- screen. Definitely put it on your list if it is Your Turn To Pick!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Outfoxed,"Invited to train for the Seoul Olympics at a facility run by an eccentric millionaire, a young wrestler struggles to maintain his sanity in this downbeat but engrossing drama based on a true story. The project is carefully directed by Bennett Miller who deliberately paces the material with many elongated silent shots of the protagonist just sitting around and contemplating. This might not sound particularly interesting, but with Channing Tatum in solid form as the wrestler in question, all these non-action based moments give us a great glimpse into his mind. Steve Carell is also excellent in a supporting turn (the BAFTAs got the category correct) as the mysterious millionaire with an unspoken hidden agenda. On one hand, it is a little underwhelming how the dynamics of Carell and Tatum's friendship are only ever implied with only some suggestion of Carell liking Tatum as more than just a friend; on the other hand, there is a lot to admire in how Miller leaves it up to our imagination regarding the highs, lows and rifts between the pair. Mark Ruffalo is also terrific as Tatum's brother, though he is far less subdued. Providing far more questions than answers regarding what occurred between the real life Mark Schultz and John Du Pont, 'Foxcatcher' does not necessarily offer the most satisfying narrative out there, but there is much to like in how moody and unsettling an experience it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unclear,"The greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher led by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances.Despite some great acting from Mark Ruffalo and especially Steve Carell, this film seems to fall flat. Is it about wrestling? The events leading up to a tragedy? The relationship of two brothers? We seem to get such a general view of each part that nothing is ever looked at in any depth and this leaves the film somewhat hollow.The number of Academy Award nomination is a bit surprising. It will likely end up being the most nominated in 2014 with the fewest wins. Carell, though great, is overshadowed by Eddie Redmayne, for example. A makeup award is possible, but only if the voters snub ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" for what was obviously a good deal of time-consuming design.

This real wrestling,"""The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing. "" - Marcus AureliusOverall rating: 3.75 stars Cinematic rating: 4 stars Family value: 2.5 starsWalking into the cinema... I did not wrestle. But growing up in the Midwest of the US (Iowa) there was always an appreciation and understanding for wrestling. It is an integral part of the culture. There is a mentality and physicality that are unique in the art of wrestling. The personal story of Foxcatcher was not familiar to me, but the director of Moneyball and the three lead performances make this wrestling film irresistible.No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. - Matthew 6:24Plot SummaryMany do not know how Olympic athletes get funding for their training, but all people desire to see their countrymen on the champions podium. Foxcatcher is based on actual events that occurred in the mid '80s wrestling community. It is a masterful, mat- based tragedy of an eccentric multi-millionaire, two champion wrestlers and the desire to achieve their goals. Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is given the chance to lead the training of future Olympic wrestlers at a state-of-the art facility by John du Pont (Steve Carell). Striving to get out from under the legendary effect of his revered brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo), he eventually pulls his brother into the twisted world of du Pont.ReviewBennett Miller (Moneyball, Capote) has an uncanny ability to take real life stories that contain elements that are unfamiliar to the general populace and make them accessible and engaging. Foxcatcher has Olympic wrestling as its backdrop, but becomes a tragic tale of money, power and identity. The Shultz brothers were some of the most celebrated wrestlers in US history, but it was the twisted end to their story that gained the most attention. The three leads were almost unrecognisable, but managed to personify their characters brilliantly. Tatum and Ruffalo did a masterful work in showing the mentality and physicality of world class wrestling. The muscle-bound walk, the beautiful brutality, and the close camaraderie of this athletic community helped the understanding of how such a series of events could occur. Miller manages to develop a basic understanding of this world and sets the trajectory for the tragic conclusion. Also, his direction allows Steve Carrell to turn from a comedian into an effective method actor as John du Pont. With the managed intensity of wrestling, the story and performances will hold your attention and leave you exhausted in the end. This is not the feel good movie of the season, but like the hypnotic state of John du Pont, this brilliantly crafted story has a mesmerising effect and is worth the time.There are many different life lessons that can be taken from the Foxcatcher story, but none stands out more then the impossibility of serving two masters. Looking at the duality between the Shultz brothers, the relationship between Mark Shultz and John duPont, and ultimately between wrestling and money. Miller manages to communicate the impossibility of serving two masters. The film begs the question,""What are you willing to do to achieve your dreams?"" In achieving these goals and dreams, do the very things that allow you to achieve them begin to dictate how you live? Foxcatcher is a film about wrestling, but leaves you considering even deeper things in life.Leaving the cinema...The story has all that is needed to captivate the audience, but the performances by the three leads take it to a new level of enjoyment. Miller proves that simple, but well told stories continue to have a place in cinema. This film is worth a look.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What can we know about brothers from the Bible? (Proverbs 17:17, Matthew 12:48- 50) 2. Can we love God and money? (Matthew 6:24, 1 Timothy 6:10) 3. What does the Bible say about wealth?

Interesting Story Well Told,"Interesting film based on the true true story of Olympic gold medalist wrestlers Dave and Mark Shultz and their connection to John Du Pont of the wealthy Du Pont family. Steve Carrell does a surprisingly superb job of capturing Du Pont while Tatum is weak as usual and Ruffalo shines. I find it incredible that I completely missed this story in the news and was wildly surprised as the movie unfolded. Nicely done, though I may be leaning toward the surprising true story and not the actual film. Regarding the film, however, a much better job could be done in representing the passage of time. On the positive side, the film captured the environment and circumstances in which these events took place and let us ""feel"" the motivations of the players.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
7/10,"A very difficult film to wrap your head around, yet not the type that is so haunting or deep you will be thinking about it for long. ""Foxcatcher"" isn't the masterpiece we were promised by the amazing hype surrounding it, nor is it worthy of all of its awards attention, especially considering other films which were left out in favor of it..ahem..Damein Chazelle..ahem..Jake Gyllenhal, yet in no way is this a bad movie.I have to address this up front, because it is the thing that is bugging me the most: the direction. It is excruciating ambiguous to the point that you could call it brilliant and weak at the same time. There are elements where the direction shines very bright: the movie looks amazing, the way by which it moves through the drama is clearly the way in which it is intended to be and most of all the actors give amazing performances which are clearly and brilliantly orchestrated by Miller. Yet at the same time, there are astonishing storytelling gaps, really hard to get my head around, lots of aimless scenes that despite never being boring they bring the movie to a length that is really exaggerated. But, most of all I did not get the point. So many elements are left in the shadows, it is such a hard film to read and to understand, there really could have been lots more.What keeps ""Foxcatcher"" alive are undoubtedly the performances by Carrel, Tatum and Ruffalo, Ruffalo being the best in my opinion. There is definitely more than just makeup to the transformations the actors go through, which ultimately results in three layered, complex and engrossing performances. Tatum and Ruffalo are utterly brilliant and Carrel is equally good if not more, but his performance is immensely toned down by the fact that you just don't have the basic character information or background to get what's the deal about him. The movie goes to great and successful depths to study John DuPont, but at no f**king point did I have some basic tools to interpret him and it was very frustrating. But anyways, because of these stunning performances, the film has a undeniable charm, for the lack of a better word, to it that manages to keep things going on. Yet I can't say the movie ever got me emotionally and tension-wise, and even less when it came to giving me something or making a point.To sum it up, I really do respect this movie and was engrossed by a good part of it, but it was a little disappointing and I wanted to love it, which I ended up not.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wrestle Mania,"Foxcatcher shines the light on two expert, real life wrestlers who are also brothers in this morbidly paced and themed movie.

It's an Oscar film, but never pretentious and also never boring.A good film despite its heavy handed themes and atmosphere.

Wrestling with the American Dream,"If Stanley Kubrick had ever gotten around to making a sports movie, it would look and feel a lot like Foxcatcher. Director Bennett Miller's former feature films make him an apt artist to deliver the haunting story of the Schulz brothers and their financial supporter, John E. du Pont. Miller has crafted an unforgettably ominous picture that combines the real life crime genre he chronicled in Capote with the theme of American sports he mastered in Moneyball. The steady stream of subtle foreboding that courses throughout the entirety of Foxcatcher places the film on a trophy shelf of the past decade's other masterworks.In terms of its plot, many of the trailers for Foxcatcher have given away very little as to what the film is actually about. The incident that Miller and screenwriters E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman bring to the screen is the strange but true story of how millionaire du Pont (Steve Carell) ensnared two Gold Medal-winning wrestlers (Channing Tatum & Mark Ruffalo) in his perverted pastiche of patriotism and paranoia. On account of its historical reality, the plot, though intriguing, could be looked up on the internet and revealed to anyone with little fanfare. Miller's chillingly compelling direction ensures that Foxcatcher is first and foremost a psychological film.A fellow critic from Screenrant has criticized Foxcatcher for ""struggling to convey insightful conclusions about its subjects."" While the film is less than lucid, there is no doubt that any room left for interpretation was a purposeful move from Miller. The film studies its three male leads with a level of focus similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's literary character study The Master. Miller's movie says little explicitly, and leaves ample room for audiences to sift through some disturbing subtext. Throughout the course of Foxcatcher, the viewer sees Mark (Tatum), David (Ruffalo), and even du Pont wrestle on the mat, but the true indications of the character's strengths and weaknesses come through cinematographer Greig Fraser's tormented close-ups. The only thing that these mesmerizing Olympians have trouble grappling with is their inner anguish.There has been a lot of buzz over Steve Carell taking on a dramatic role in Foxcatcher, but skeptics will question whether or not the buzz is justified. Here is the justification: Carell turns in his finest film performance to date as du Pont; the unsettlingly entitled, perplexingly stolid member of America's wealthiest family who has more than his fair share of, shall we say, eccentricities. While the buzz is certainly well-deserved, it turns out that du Pont has much more in common with Carell's signature Dunder-Mifflin manager Michael Scott than one might think. Like Michael, all Du Pont seems to want is love and admiration; validation from human beings who genuinely care for him. However, as infuriating as Michael Scott could be, it is more than safe to say that du Pont proves to be a bigger nightmare of a boss. Carell's understated work in the film elicits gripping fascination from the audience; it is the kind of comedian-turned-dramatist performance that would make the late Robin Williams beam with pride.Beyond Carell's performance, there is much more to commend in Miller's third feature. Tatum and Ruffalo also turn in career high- point performances. Tatum acts against type as an aloof and stand- offish champion, while Ruffalo portrays the picture's most headstrong character: a family man becoming progressively aware of the strings du Pont has attached to everyone he ropes into his estate. Audiences going to Foxcatcher expecting the next Chariots of Fire or Miracle will be sorely disappointed – viewers should not even approach the movie expecting to learn anything about wrestling itself. One critic from Tolucan Times complains that ""it doesn't explain a thing about Olympic wrestling."" This criticism is invalid. Although there is nothing wrong with being a sports movie, wrestling is virtually irrelevant to the Foxcatcher's real concerns. The filmmakers have turned torpid tabloid fodder into rumination about the all too thin veil of delusion separating the wealthy from the poor, the strong from the weak, and the American from the American Dream.Grade: ABy Ben Pieper (November 30th, 2014)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Haunting true life story told with great acting and chilling atmospherics,"I've been waiting to see this for quite a while now. It's been the prize winning thoroughbred of many a film festival this year. It was glorified and pontificated, hyped and praised as a masterpiece by everyone who saw it at Cannes, it's been a whispered about guarded jewel for a large portion of the year. Then everyone else, you know saw it.It's a fantastically acted, well-crafted movie, I enjoyed it very much, interesting premise, fascinating real life event, chilling cinematography and music. The problem is that I never felt that the movie dragged but I did feel that they struggled to flesh out the accounts of what happened into something deeply compelling. At times it does feel really stilted though never boring or uninteresting. Many aspects felt heavily emphasized and contrived to flesh out performances or political themes to attract awards voters. Other aspects seem cut, or missing to spare the objections of the families. Bennett Miller mentions in interviews that he agonized and laboured to find a presentable cut of this film and it really shows.If I'm going to take anything away from this it's an affirmation of what I've known for many years, that Steve Carell and Channing Tatum can act, they've certainly proved that here.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Authentic but still quite cold and dry,"Most of what I heard about Foxcatcher before watching it was solely about the makeup work done to transform Steve Carell into John du Pont, and Mark Ruffalo into David Schultz (admittedly, it was pretty remarkable.) Thankfully, that meant the rest of the true story was a mystery to me. There was a definite sense of tension building throughout the film, but not because of anything the filmmakers did. The mounting tension was more because I knew something was going to happen (why else would this be a story worth telling,) and it seemed virtually anything was possible considering the strange personality of John du Pont. I only wish it was told in a more compelling fashion. Foxcatcher is an extremely stark and silent film. Seldom do we see emotions expressed, but they are merely implied through the behavior of the characters, and some subtleties in the performances from the actors.In a way, Foxcatcher felt like a documentary. It's quite flat and free of any excitement. The finale of the movie could easily feel like it came out of nowhere because there is no build to the plot. Of course, if you were paying attention up to that point you can pick up on the clues that it was going to happen. I know there are many people who will appreciate the dispassionate and matter-of-fact way this story is presented, but I'm a sucker for a more dramatized version of events to make a movie based on a true story more cinematic. The acting performances were definitely the highlight of Foxcatcher, particularly what Steve Carell brought to the story. Even though I was worried I might get a little bored with the film, and the conclusion was underwhelming, the acting always kept me engaged. It's not a movie I'll revisit, but if you're looking for authentic story-telling in a true story, Foxcatcher might be for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

When Dave does join the crew in their quest for World Championship gold, he's stunned by du Pont's inexperience and arrogance.But Dave's disrespect stirs something dark in du Pont.Without a doubt Carell's performance is Foxcatcher's preeminent feature, followed by the other leads and hair and make-up.However, the actual murder gets lost in the meandering artistry.Furthermore, the only way to kill a wrestler is with a bullet made from a folding chair.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.cavidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good pace and acting , great story ruined by fictionalized stereotypes","The film is a good movie, but it could have been a great one . It centers on Olympic gold medal winning wrestler Mark Schultz and his brother Dave. Mark is struggling with a boring, lonely life, when he gets a call out of the blue from a billionaire who is heir to the Dupont fortune. The wealthy man wants to sponsor Mark, his brother and their amateur wrestling team as they live for free on his estate.The film is good because it is an interesting biography, and because it has a slow, realistic pace. Some found it's pace dull but I liked it's dark realism.The film could have been great, benefiting from both the interesting pace, and the fact that it is based on a fascinating , dramatic biography. However, it is brought down by caving to the PC masses as it portrays all the major characters in a typical stereotypical Hollywood way. It's as if the writers had a focus group whispering in their ears.Most adult men are creepy and evil, unless they are chaperoned by a woman and children in which case they appear miraculously transformed. They become perfect, smiley faced drones, floating blissfully through life in a quest to serve their children. The ""family men"" are filled with confidence, wisdom, and self righteous dignity. It goes without saying that women and children are shown as flawless, rays of sunshine piercing an atmosphere foul darkness.The two main male characters appear to be single, so of course they are shown to be at best creepy and at worst criminally insane. The filmmakers seem to be trying to be subtle in they're portrayal of Dupont as suspect, but I felt as though I was hit over the head with a hammer of overtones and innuendo. This follows the disturbing pattern in recent decades where any single adult male is shown negatively, something to be fearful of.Dave and his family act as though they are filled with a self satisfying knowledge that they are at the top of the social food chain. No matter Dupont is paying all the bills and puts a roof over everybody's head, they talk to him so condescendingly that in every scene he manages to appear pathetic. Carell also does a good job acting, but almost goes overboard with the ""creepy"" as it is rare to encounter any guy this weird in real life. . The message the film seems to be tapping at with a jackhammer is - ""no matter how much money you have and give away , if you are an adult male you had BETTER KNOW YOUR PLACE"". ""family and kids good, men bad"".I have read that Mark Schultz was dissatisfied with the way he was portrayed, and I don't blame him. Many who were there at Foxcatcher have been quoted saying the film was largely fictionalized, which is not a surprise. Movies today show sexual overtones to practically everything, so you never know if they were there in real life or they were added to sell tickets.I wonder if the real personalities were more interesting than those fabricated for the film. We will never know because the film makers choose the easy way out. They pander to those who worship at the alter of the family and children as they show any single guy as an untrustworthy creep. Makes one wish for the old Gene Hackman or Clint Eastwood movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Caught me by surprise!,"Foxcatcher is directed by Bennett Miller (Moneyball), and stars Channing Tatum, Steve Carrel and Mark Ruffalo. Past Tatum movies ( 21 Jump Street, white House Down, and Magic Mike) and Carrel's movies ( 41 year Old Virgin, Anchorman, and the popular TV show the office) are nothing like this one. Foxcatcher is a dark drama about two gold metal wrestlers striving to win another medal. Truthfully I haven't seen great acting from either Tatum, or Carrel, and thats why this movie caught me by surprise! Both delivered powerful and riveting performances, and I'm not the only one that thought so, The academy nominated both of them for awards, and the movie was up for best picture. This movie follows two brothers ( Mark and David Shultz). Both of their lives revolve around the sport of wrestling. They both wrestle in the olympic, David (Mark Rufalo) seems to be the more well off one of the pair. He seems to have more skill than his brother, and also have a wife and kids. Where has Tatum only has his brother, and now that his brother has to spend time with his family, he doesn't have as much time for his brother. Steve Carrel ( John du Pont) invites Mark ( Tatum) to work at the facility on his estate. And thats the basic story without revealing any spoilers. This movie is powerful and inspiring.

The interpretations of both Steve Carell who played as John du Pont and Channing Tatum who played as Mark Schultz were simply amazing. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Mark Ruffalo's who played as David Schultz and he was equally good. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is very interesting and it presents very well the true events of the team Foxcatcher.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Strarts strong but becomes a mess...,"This film is an impressionist painting half covered with a Jackson Pollock!I was really looking forward to see this one for two reasons: Tatum and Carell. Given the director was Bennett Miller, who already proved to be good and skillful at sport-drama with Moneyball, I thought there could be no problem.I was wrong.The first half of the film is impeccable, both directing and acting are good to watch. Tatum is a stunner, he amazed me. Ruffalo is perfect as usual, and this mentor/wise-older brother image fits him wonderfully. The scenes are powerful and are created with such a telling style, it is a directorial triumph. This is due to the ability to tastefully depict the a story of three man, with very few words but strong images.This was the impressionist part now let's see the Pollock side of the picture.Both the writer and the director loses it, for no reason, they were on a great track, but I guess they (chiefly the writer) had no idea how to get elegantly to the endpoint of the story.At the middle of the film, it becomes a mess! It gives you nothing, but DEMANDS you to keep on looking at it in awe, even though it is simply not entertaining or any good anymore. Motives become secondary, characters only do things because they have to, so everything goes as the writer and the non-fictional story parts demand it, nothing is at stake because we know that David Schultz gets shot in the end... The complexity and cogency ceases to exist.Carell is a bit of a disappointment for me, he pulls it off but does not succeed. But I don't blame him. He has no room to act, the director doesn't have any idea how to bring the DuPont out of the actor. He is poorly instructed. Almost no resemblance to the real man, except the broken speaking pattern. Why add 30kgs on Carell, when the guy was sickly skinny? Why make him having the same emotionless face all along, when DuPont rather acted as a schizophrenic, than a robot!? It was supposed to be Carell's big moment, but Tatum triumphed... Thank you Bennett...I gave it 7 only for the first 60 minutes and Ruffalo & Tatum! Deserves worse! Hope, Carell gets another chance for a big drama role sometime soon!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Foxcatcher was a pretty compelling true story tale,"Just watched this with my mom on Netflix disc. This was a pretty compelling story of Mark Schultz-an Olympic wrestler who won the gold in '84 along with his brother Dave-and his relationship with one John du Pont-a loner millionaire who wants to mentor him for the next Olympics. It gets to a pretty dark place though the tone seems quite slow and cold most of the time the film goes on. Channing Tatum and Steve Carell portray Mark and John quite compellingly as does Mark Ruffalo as Dave. As the events unfold, one feels quite stunned at what happens but one can't completely look away when they do. There's no music score, just background recordings that bring some disorienting feeling to bear. So on that note, I recommend Foxcatcher.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well made drama.,"A film crafted in an extremely artful and detail-oriented approach. Great Carrell and Ruffalo performances, but Tatum's performance is a bit bland. Tatum's character arc seems very rushed; the writing seems to leave out key details that lead to the change in character motives. However, despite these flaws the film delivers on the shock value of these true events. Definitely worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing characterizations,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this movie blew me out of the water. No, this is not a wresting movie. It is a brilliant exposition of character. I suppose what amazes me the most is that the two main stars are known (and very successfully) as comedic actors. Steve Carell was just amazing playing John du Pont. The real Mark Schultz says in an interview, he thought John had been raised from the dead. I am always so impressed when actors go beyond to show what they can do, which is so far beyond what they have done before. This is certainly true of Steve Carell and also Channing Tatum, who is known mostly for light comedies and showing off his abs. So much attention and deserved award nominations were given to Steve Carell and Mark Ruffalo (who is ALWAYS amazing), but to me it was Channing Tatum who broke real barriers and fully proved that he is an actor with great talent.The cinematography, combined with brilliant music and artful direction, created an atmosphere that was breathtaking. This is a movie of characters, created by phenomenal actors through their actions, their speech, their motions and their eyes. This is a phenomenal film if what you want to see is the creation of complex human beings in all their glory and in all their flaws.Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Three Incredible Acting Performances All in One Film,"First of all, it is important to realise that this is not a wrestling film. It is rather a chilling and psychological masterpiece from future Oscar-winning director Bennett Miller who once again shows his class through the visual style and mysterious tone of this rather excellent film. The story and the composed directing of this film are brilliant and although the pace of the film may be slow for some, the character studies 'Foxcatcher' unveils are truly exceptional - of three men with different motivations and ambitions. Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is the dedicated and highly motivated wannabe gold medallist whose rather frightening performances catches the eye. Then there is his settled and composed older brother Dave Schultz (Mark Rufallo) whose character is rather empathetic and rather tragically likable. And then there is the multimillionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) who gives a career-defining performance as the coach and the mentor of Mark. Steve Carell's performance in particular is very chilling and his uneasy relationship with his disapproving mother is perfectly portrayed. A small negative about this film is the fact it tails off slightly after a brilliant start, but maybe that is just me being harsh. Overall a very solid film with acting performances being as good as they get. Highly recommended. 8.0/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wrestling the brothers psyche,"What at first seems like an underdog sports movie (here about wrestling) turns into a psychological overview of relationships between brothers. Without trying to reveal the plot the film is about two wrestler brothers Mark and Dave Schultz played excellently by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo.Flashback to the 1984 LA Olympic games and they won gold. However Mark has an inferiority complex about his life compared to the uber confident Dave, married with 2 children. Enter US philanthropist John 'Eagle' Du Pont (Steve Carrell). He is a billionaire who begins to fund a wrestling academy and recruits the Schultz brothers. His state of the art facilities are used to prepare the US team for the 1988 Seoul Olympic games. Du Pont is a 'strange' character who has his own demons. Perhaps he sees the Schultz brothers own struggles as some kind of escape? The film's finale ends in tragedy unlike a Rocky film.Screened at Cannes this film has received plaudits for its psychological analysis.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Burn baby burn.  (Slowly),"OK I admit I am late to the party on this one but I missed Foxcatcher's fairly limited release in the UK and have only finally viewed it on DVD. But it was worth the wait.It's a uniquely paced thriller in that it's almost plot less. The dynamics and emotional drivers of all the main protagonists, two wresting brothers (Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum) and their errr 'mentor' (Steve Carell), are never revealed. It's sinister from start to finish but it's never entirely clear why it's sinister particularly if, like me, you don't know the story that it's based on.But suffice it so say the direction by Bennett Miler (two Oscar nominations under his belt now for this and Capote) is outstanding and grips you from start to finish, despite the fact that very little of any consequence actually happens.There's an elephant in the movie theatre with this film. And that is homosexuality. Lots of men getting sweaty and grappling with one another on the floor is not the point. It's the unstated relationship between the two main characters that is.Is the relationship between billionaire wrestling freak Du Pont and Schwartz homosexually charged? Maybe yes, maybe no. Du Pont may wish to be seen as a father figure but it goes much deeper than that in my view.Is the drug taking and drinking that Du Pont introduces to his Olympic Gold medallist charge some form of seduction? Maybe yes, maybe no.Is the relationship that Du Pont 'enjoys' with his mother also related to his sexuality (Oedipal almost)? Maybe yes, maybe no.Certainly it has enraged the real life Schwartz who clearly is not in any way inclined to the male sex but that's not the point. Miller has created a movie that is undeniably homo- erotically charged and that is not in any way a criticism.The movie is a beautiful enigma wrapped up in a conundrum and all the better for it.But ultimately what you are left with is the extraordinary performances of Tatum and, especially, Carell in a career defining outing that will surely be hard for him to beat.And one last point; the outstanding soundtrack by Rob Simonsen is a pretty fundamental contribution to the whole mood of the piece.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The flip side of the Olympic dream,"The film is based on the true story of brothers Mark and Dave Schultz (played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo), American wrestlers who won gold medals in the 1984 Olympics. The film begins after their wins as they are pursued to live and train in a sports community owned by eccentric mega-millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell).It is easy to distinguish this as an independent film as opposed to a typical Hollywood film. A Hollywood film would likely have ended with the Olympic glory with the final victory in slow motion (including the audience jumping to its feet) with a blaring orchestra. Instead, ""Foxcathcher"" shows a very deglamourized life (especially Mark's) post-Olympics, bravely showing the flip-side of the Olympic dream.Director Bennett Miller uses a story-telling style that is deliberately bleak and emotionally distant. This mood is best shown in Carell's performance which is subtle and repressed as he portrays someone who, most of his life, was given too much money and not enough love. The only warmth in the film comes from Ruffalo whose character has found happiness with his young family.The bleak style is fine but up to a point as the movie feels too long a 2.25 hours. Also, despite the length, there still seems to too little background of some characters. It's still praiseworthy, though, for its unique approach to sports biographies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Worth watching, but certainly not best picture material (Rating 6.5)","I would give Foxcatcher a 6.5 as it is worth watching, but by no means a title that should be nominated for best picture. Although I could see the merits of a best actor or best supporting actor nomination for Channing Tatum or Steve Carell.I do not mind a slower paced movie when watching a biopic- But the trade off I expect, is a story line that provides me with insight into the mindset of the main characters and a moderately accurate portrayal of the events (accepting that some parts of the story or time-line must often be condensed, etc).THE GOOD: We do get a pretty good insight into the characters of Mark Schultz and Dave Schultz... And John Dupont generally.THE OK: The film provides a decent insight into the relationship of Mark Schultz & Dupont... albeit with a few holes.THE DISAPPOINTING: We do not get much of an insight at all into the ""Motivations"" of John Dupont. Nor does the movie do a good job of exploring the relationship between John Dupont & Dave Schultz (Ruffalo).In reality Dave Schultz lived on the Foxcatcher Estate with his family for 6 years (1989-1996), whereas Mark Schultz (Tatum) lived there a much shorter period (which ended in 1988). Additionally, according to the real life story, Dave is the brother that Dupont looked to as a best friend and had the closest relationship with- which the movie almost completely avoids.OVERALL: Probably worth watching, however afterwards (when you undoubtedly go online to look for the Real Story to fill in some obvious gaps), you will likely be disappointed by the fact that the film almost completely avoids the most essential parts of real life events. (which In my case, left me feeling the movie in many ways was a big fail... as it relates to the biopic trade off between slower story/ in exchange for insight into actual events and characters).",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An interesting story, that sometimes lacks tempo and direction","Foxcatcher tells the story of John Du Pont and the Olympic winning Schultz brothers. Directed by Bennett Miller, Firstly i would like to say i went in to this film blind, and didn't really even know it was a true story, I think I enjoyed it more because of this and i suggest anyone else who wants to watch it do the same.The story is basically i very rich man trying to help out Mark Schultz played by channing tatum in his bid to defend his olympic gold medal in wrestling, the rich man is called John du Pont played brilliantly by steve carell. Its a very character driven movie which often leads to long scenes with very little dialogue, this is where i feel the movie stagnates a little, and overall the movie is possibly 20 minutes too long.However the relationships between the three main characters is where this film is most interesting, where there are always undertones of what each of them is thinking but it is never spelt out for the viewer. Steve carell in my opinion steals the film with a very good performance playing of a very peculiar man who you can never really work out.Overall a very solid drama and i believe if you like drama you will enjoy this movie immensely , however if your looking for a rocky style underdog sports movie you might want to give this one a pass.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carell is fantastic as Du Ponte,"It's best if you know nothing about John E. du Pont or the Schultz brothers when going to see Foxcatcher. This whole story was new to me and that definitely added to the enjoyment of watching this , if enjoyment is the right word. Steve Carell is fantastic as Du Pont and there are good performances from Channing Tatum ad Mark Ruffalo. Although the story revolves around wrestling , that is not what this film is really about. it's all about the mind of Du Pont and the further this film goes on you get the feeling that something isn't at all right with this man. you are never quite sure what his motives were for what he was doing , whether it was sexual , or ego based or that he was just lonely. Good film and i wouldn't be surprised if Steve Carrel wins best male actor at the Oscars but i would give it to Eddie Redmayne for The Theory of Everything it was me.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Didn't see that coming,"If you have a movie that at first sight is about an athlete and his (olympic) dreams, you kind of can guess where the movie goes. And even though there are a few things that you can predict, there's a lot left unsaid and a lot more that might surprise you (especially if you aren't aware of the real life incidents that occurred, something that can be said about me).So while this is overcoming the odds, it is also about struggling and living in a world that is not that appreciated, not having much of a family to back you up (or a mother that might push you to do certain things, although everyone is responsible for their own actions of course). The dynamic between the actors is really good and you might have problems recognizing Carrell. Also some nice interviews on the disc about the making of the movie",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carell and Tatum are Just Fantastic in FOXCATCHER,"FOXCATCHER is one of those powerful character-driven dramas that I couldn't turn away from. Each of the three main cast membersSteve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffaloare at the top of their game. I have zero interest in the sport of wrestling and I would normally steer clear of a movie with a subject that bores me as much, but there was so much positive buzz circulating about it that I opted to give in and watch. I'm really happy I did because Tatum and Carell give mesmerizing performances. FOXCATCHER is based (loosely, as I have found) on the true story of Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz (Tatum) and millionaire John de Pont (Carell). Schultz won the gold medal for wrestling in the 1984 Olympic games and, as the movie begins, he lives a quiet life training with his brother, fellow Olympic gold medalist Dave (Ruffalo), for the next competition. He receives a call from representatives of John du Pont requesting a visit and Schultz, with little else going on, obliges. Du Pont is a wealthy man and member of the famous family behind DuPont Chemicals, and he's interested in sponsoring and coaching Schultz in preparation for the world championships and, eventually, the 1988 Olympics. Schultz agrees to his offer and moves to the estate at Foxcatcher Farm where he trains with the old man. What starts as a well-oiled symbiotic relationship between two wrestling/USA enthusiasts turns sour when Du Pont insists Dave join them at Foxcatcher and the bond between Mark and Du Pont crumbles.To call John du Pont an interesting man would not be doing it justice. At least in the film, he is a bizarre individual and Carell does it to perfection. Apparently, Carell spent hours studying video footage of the man and even the real Mark Schultz says his performance is almost indistinguishable from the real person. From the start, you can tell Du Pont is abnormal. Perhaps from his isolated, wealthy upbringing or perhaps from a lingering form of mental illness, Du Pont does not interact well with others. You can tell from his speech he views those in lower stations in life as below him. He's narcissistic. He views himself as a patriot, interested in building America's image on the international scale with his attempts at sponsoring an Olympian. But he shares one thing in common with Mark and that is a passion for wrestling. Shunned by his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) for his interested in a ""low"" sport, Du Pont strains for her approval. There's an incredibly awkward moment in the film where Du Pont is lingering around the gym while Dave Schultz is training the Olympic team when Mrs. Du Pont is wheeled in. In an effort to showboat, Du Pont takes center stage and insists on a coaching moment where he feebly shows off a few of the most basic moves. When Mrs. Du Pont loses interest and wheels out, Du Pont drops the act and everyone goes about their business. It makes you cringe at how embarrassing it is for the man and his team, who play along.I'll try not to let my entire review focus on Carell/Du Pont but it's difficult because he's just such a bizarre character. He finds kinship with Mark and, for a while, both seem the better for it. Before moving to Foxcatcher, Mark lived a lonely existence in his barebones little apartment where he mulled away the hours between visits to the gym. The opportunity presented to him via Du Pont gives him a chance at getting back in the ring while also providing a warped sort of mentor. Tatum deserves as much credit as Carell because this is the best I've seen him. He's a load of fun in the Jump Street movies but this is probably my first time seeing him in a serious drama. Schultz doesn't do much in the way of dialogue but he's got an imposing physical presence. We're introduced to him in the beginning as he's speaking before a school class on his accomplishments and you can tell how out of place he feels. Muscle-bound, he walks with the gait of a large ape and his communication is generally limited to short sentences. This is a man who's focused his entire life on sculpting his body for one purpose. But Tatum injects a lot of character into what at first feels like a simple man. He seems to operate primarily on instinct and the most important part of his life is his brother Dave. He takes a shine to Du Pont early on but eventually sees through the man, altering their relationship in a way that eventually leads to tragedy.I won't go into detail about the ending here but those who know the story from the news know where it leads. I, for one, knew nothing of it. If there is one major flaw with FOXCATCHER, it's that the finale doesn't have much of a lead in. I had to do additional research on the side to get motivation for the act because the film left me with no clue. It seemed sudden and unmotivated, almost tagged on at the end because the movie was expected to close with it. Still, FOXCATCHER is an intriguing movie and I'm willing to accept its issues. Carell and Tatum are enough of a reason for those who are curious to find time for FOXCATCHER and I think they'll enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A chilly, forbidding film","""Foxcatcher"" is a grim, depressing and dislikeable film in which the American Dream turns very sour indeed. It's based on actual characters and events and is totally without humour. There is nothing to eradicate the clammy feeling that something isn't right here. An unrecognizable Steve Carell, (with prosthetic nose), is John du Pont, a member of America's richest family, a man with too much money, too much time on his hands and almost pathological fear and probable hatred of his mother, (a steely, forbidding Vanessa Redgrave), who decides to sponsor and coach brothers Mark and David Schultz and the American Olympic Wrestling Team.From the outset you know this creepy little man has an agenda other than the straightforward one of seeing his fellow countrymen pick up gold though it's hard to guess exactly what it is. The film never makes explicit du Pont's psychosis. Is he simply a closeted homosexual? Perhaps. Watching it I was reminded of the old gag, ""My mother made me a homosexual"". ""If I gave her the wool would she make me one, too"". (Any joke, even one as lame as this one, would have been welcome during the course of this movie). Or is he looking for the sons he never had or are likely to have? The brothers are played by Channing Tatum, (Mark), and David Ruffalo, (David), and they are both excellent. Tatum is a revelation; there is a touch of Lon Chaney's Lennie in ""Of Mice and Men"" in this performance. He is a lumbering giant, not very bright and almost totally dependent on his brother. Ruffalo has the smaller part and he gives the film its only warmth. Otherwise this is a chilly, downbeat movie and I don't plan on seeing it again any time soon.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Missed the mark,"I was really looking forward to this movie so it was very disappointing that it really didn't accomplish what I felt it should have (inflated expectations? Maybe so!).The story is fascinating and dramatic. The acting was strong; the cast was excellent. Great cinematography.My problem was this movie just fell short of portraying much depth in the relationships. Had it done this, the emotion towards one another, the disappointment and the tension would have all been much easier to understand. The viewer was expected to assume a lot of the love, anger, and ultimately resentment the characters felt towards one another without really exploring and showing the viewer WHY the characters really felt this towards one another.Solid acting, but both Carrell and Tatum show that they are not acting powerhouses. Ruffalo was solid as always. He has a real screen presence. Shone above the other 2 actors IMO.An excellent movie about a mentor/protégé that captured all the emotions and tension very well this year was Whiplash. Whiplash had a very similar love, hate, and ultimately fall from grace between the mentor and protégé. This movie fell far short of accomplishing what that one did. Plus this was a true story! Very disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Serenity Sandwich with a side of Tension Chowder.,"WARNING: Do not bring crunchy snacks to this movie.This movie is damn quiet. Like a Sunday afternoon in 1985. It allowed us to listen to what wasn't being said between the characters, creating genuine moments, and allowing the viewer to share the discomfort of the characters.Despite the cast, and because of the cast, it really worked. It could have become a blatant race for an Oscar, but instead the actors brought honest performances.Channing Tatum's recent string of fluffy roles didn't prepare us for the nuanced and powerful performance he was able to deliver. He had few lines of dialogue, but he was still able to communicate his emotions with mature subtlety.For the role of John DuPont, Steve Carell was able to suppress his usual outlandish persona, and because you know that he is withholding that level of energy under a rigid composure, it adds to the quiet accumulation of frustration of John's character.Who wouldn't go see this movie, based on the cast.

Chillingly taut,"Foxcather is a slow-burning character driven biopic which may not be to everyone's taste. Audience craving for fast based overly dramatized popcorn flicks will find it extremely boring and will fail to grasp the chilling experience. I feel the slow pacing of Foxcather was necessary to build the cold atmosphere needed for the psychological study the movie does of its characters. The trump card here is of course the acting. With surprisingly masterclass performances from Steve Carell, Chaning Tatum and Mark Ruffalo, it makes you feel every emotion and action of its characters.Based on true events, Foxcather is directly written to screen by Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye. Mark Schultz (Chaning Tatum) is a American wrestler who had won an Olympic Gold at LA 1984 yet he doesn't earn much. We see that is house is small and simple. Mark is mentored and trained by his older brother David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) who has been taking care of him since his childhood after their parents split up. David also was a gold medalist at 1984 Olympics; he is married and loves his family a lot. Mark on the other hand has a feeling he is living in shadow of his brother. Things take a turn when Mark gets an offer from a billionaire and wrestling enthusiast John E. du Pont (Steve Carell). John seems to have family issues, with his mother who is obsessed more with her horses rather than appreciate his son's achievement and treating wrestling as low sport. Mark starts training at du Pont's high facility 'Foxcather Farm' moving away from his brother who is unwilling to move his family. The movie then touches how this affects the characters and relations. That's basically the plot with a strong character development which is sorely missing in movies nowadays.Foxcather is not an eventful film with dramatic twists every now and then. It is a study of characters and their psychology. The main reason it is effective is the acting. Steve Carell's transformation into a sociopath from his routine comedy-flicks is shocking. I had to remind myself that he is the same comedy star. Same applies to Chaning Tatum whose performance has sadly not got much recognition at the awards. Also not to forget Mark Ruffalo who now really looked like Hulk-wrestler with his body. Director Bennet Miller with help of cinematographer Greig Fraser provide a absorbingly sad and chilling atmosphere. Adding to it is Rob Simonsen's haunting background score. Sometimes the silences and the background score convey more of the story than the actual dialogues in some of the long taut shot. But still, I feel at times Foxcather drags a bit too much in parts, the characters simply pause a lot even during regular dialogues. If the film was about 10-15 minutes short I think it would have been a lot more effective.Overall Foxcather is a deep character study and a psychological drama. The fact that it is based on true events makes it even more chilling. The slow pacing may put off many, but I thoroughly enjoyed the engrossing screenplay and memorable performances.RATING: [3.5/5]",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Compelling, depressing, frustrating, and beautiful","This is one of those movies that you don't enjoy watching but when it's done, you loved it and want to see it again.Nearly every moment hurts because of how wonderfully the roles are played. Steve Carrell deserves all the praise he's received for his role. You never know what to think about his character, and I believe that's supposed to be the point. He creeps you out, but you can't stop watching.Channing Tatum may be getting some flak, but I loved his performance. Everyone's saying that Steve made some major changes to his appearance, movements, speech, etc...but Tatum did just as much, in my opinion. The charismatic, confident leading hunk transformed into an awkward, quiet, slumped-over man for the role, and I loved it. He plays it so well and with a lot of depth. I don't know much about the actual person he's portraying, all I can speak on is the character in the movie, and I think he did a wonderful job. Honestly, I'm sad that he was not the one nominated for the lead role Oscar, but I understand why.Everyone else was just as wonderful, of course. I'm not going to pick apart every role, but I can say that the acting was never an issue for me. I can't really say what I'd change, although I suppose it had a weird pace at times. But it's dark, it's disturbing, and yet it's completely interesting and you can't look away because you just HAVE to see what's going to happen to everyone...even though it's a true story and unfortunately we already know.I don't regret seeing it in the slightest, and I plan to see it many more times.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

This Sporting Life,"This film is recommended.John Eleuthère du Pont, heir to the du Pont fortune and avid sports fan. Mark Schultz, Olympic wrestling champion. Dave Schultz, brother of Mark, friend of John, and another Olympic winner. This trio comes together, setting their sights on a common goal in Bennett Miller's compelling fact-based drama, Foxcatcher.Steve Carell plays the obsessive du Pont, a wealthy entrepreneur who loves to collect things: stamps, stuffed animals, firearms, money, and athletes. He starts a wrestling school called Foxcatcher Farm with his loftiest goal to reach that Olympic gold. But there is no glory in this tragic story, as he begins to nurture the young ambitious Mark, under the tutelage and help of his devoted older brother and develops a strange hold on both siblings.Written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futtleman, Foxcatcher tells its story of corruption, power, wealth, and control with a minimum of dramatic flourish. Their screenplay documents this stranger-than-fiction true story, but the slow pacing of the film tends to distill the impact of the circumstances. The three main characters are well-written but other supporting roles seem sketchy and not as strongly developed. The time line of events seems blurred also, especially the physical transformation of Mark Schultz who gains and loses poundage in mega-minutes.However, Foxcatcher does have, in its corner, superb performances. Channing Tatum delivers the best work as the beleaguered wrestler, unsure of his talent and overly-eager to please. Mark Ruffalo grounds his character and shows a loving brother and competitive coach simultaneously with such subtlety and conviction. Vanessa Redgrave, Sienna Miller, and Anthony Michael Hall give solid support in their underwritten roles.But earning the gold for this film is Carell as the schizophrenic philanthropist. The actor sheds his comic talent and delves into the psychotic world of du Pont with a fury of emotions that will startle and deeply sadden any moviegoer. He plays this complicated character as an outsider, a short stocky oddity, out-of-touch with reality and consumed with escalating rage. This is certainly a banner year for actors and their physical transformation and Carell's portrayal is one of this year's finest.Foxcatcher is well directed by Miller who seems to have a special fascination with eccentric characters, as shown in his two previous films (Capote, Moneyball). He shrewdly establishes the characters and their relationships almost immediately but rarely lets the actual suspense build. One wonders (and never fully comprehends) the bizarre behavior on the screen and the illogical actions of these characters without any immediate consequences early on, questioning why the warning signals were so readily overlooked to prevent this outcome. Never the screenplay, characters, or direction clearly answer that issue.One may know the outcome of the film well before viewing. But Foxcatcher deals with its violence unflinchingly and tackles the issue of mental health in a no-holds-barred way. Foxcatcher carries with it a ring of truth about the madness of sports, competition, and raw ambition, and while it may not fully deliver on its initial promise to captivate and impress its audience, it does have three stunning bits of acting that are top contenders this year.

Buying approval,"Foxcatcher is a brooding slow burn film from director Bennett Miller about two men looking for approval. One from his more gregarious older brother, the other from his disapproving horse fixated mother.Channing Tatum plays Mark Schultz, an Olympic gold medal winner in the 1984 Olympics somewhat living in the shadow of his older brother David (Mark Ruffalo) also an Olympic gold medal winner.In the opening scene we see Mark talking uncomfortably to a class of children at school. This is good for Mark as it allows him to get out of his brother's shadow. Yet when we see Mark wrestle he is always more effective when David gives him a pep talk.After a disagreement between Mark and du Pont, David is persuaded to join the training team. You can see his more effective training methods at play but at the same time it has a negative effect on Mark who already descended to a spiral of booze and cocaine under du Pont's influence and he becomes embittered performing poorly in the Seoul Olympics.The film is based on true life and tragic events with du Pont's influence suffocating those around him. He wants approval, he wants to be a mentor when all the time you think when you see him wrestle with the young men that he just wants to cop a feel of them.This is an actor's film. Carell looks unrecognizable under heavy make up with Tatum also putting more of a performance where less is more. The film is absorbing and despite the slow pace, yet at times it can also be lifeless.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mark and Dave Shultz's gripping wrestling story,"So i just finished watching Foxcatcher and i was blown away. This movie is based on a true story of two successful brother wrestlers Mark and Dave Schultz.So basically Mark is Olympic gold medalist and John E. Dupont, the heir of the Dupont family, is interested in wrestling and offers Mark a contract to enter his team - Foxcatcher and win Worlds for his team. Mark gets on well with Dupont, he feels like John is his ''father'' and they just have a good relationship overall. Two thirds into the movie this relationship starts to fall upon itself and things start to get really messy. Dave disagrees on some things with Dupont, Mark's not training properly, plus Dave kind of steals Mark away from Dupont and ... yeah.If you are fan of dark Nightcrawler-like movies with heavy atmosphere, I think this is a movie for you. At the end I just want to point out that I loved Steve Carrel's portrayal of John E. Dupont, and the soundtrack.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Vague retelling with brilliant preformances,"This was a little (lot) vague at times, whereas at the end I had to Google the events that happened to get the whys of it. Based on a true story about millionaire John Du Pont and his relationship with two brothers, Dave & Mark Schultz, Olympic wrestlers he engages to train at his estate so that he can be an ""Olympic coach."" Mark initially idolizes Du Pont but slowly realizes the depths of his benefactors madness.Things are hinted at...sexual misconduct and the actual murder is done in such a vague way it doesn't appear to have any motivation. Its slow at times and sorta feels like a documentary in its style which keeps the viewer at a distance. The make up and acting from all involved is phenomenal though. Steve Carell, wow creepy brilliant job. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo as the brothers also do a great job.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't watch this film if you like cinema...,"...or if you have eyes! What a boring film. It may be 'character driven' but unfortunately the characters involved are very dull people. This film could have told it's story in about 30 minutes without loosing anything. There is hardly any dialogue and it feels just padded out with long panning shots and scenes where nothing happens. I think Steve Carell is after being taken seriously because you can practically hear the strain of him acting as hard as he can, and what is the point of going to great pains to look and act like a person when nobody knows what the person looks or acts like?This film isn't fit to lace the boots of the Lego Movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Uncomfortably good,"Quickie Review:Mark Shultz (Channing Tatum) and his brother Dave Shultz (Mark Ruffalo) are both Olympic gold medalist wrestlers. In a chance to prove himself away from his brother's shadow, Mark joins Team Foxcatcher created by millionaire John E. du Pont (Steve Carell). As their working relationship starts to develop Mark comes to realize John's inner demons. Foxcatcher, is a suspenseful drama exploring very human insecurities and the actions it can drive us to take. Both Channing Tatum and Steve Carell give likely their career defining performance so far. Though a slow burn, the slow rising temperature is worth the wait.Full Review:Steve Carell is a comedy icon, and deservedly so. Meanwhile, a once laughable actor Channing Tatum had found his niche with the Jump Street franchise. Now we gladly laugh at Tatum because we genuinely find him to be great in comedy. However, with Foxcatcher both of these actors are daring to try something out of their comfort zone. That's the reason why I was so excited to see this film.Channing Tatum has really come a long way since his Step Up days (when in mood for puns you could even say he ""stepped up""). Looking at the massive success of 21 & 22 Jump Street I wouldn't have been shocked if Tatum continued to do comedies. Instead he chose to do a dramatic role with the director of Moneyball, Bennett Miller. A ballsy move, but one that pays off. He completely changes himself into a different person in this film. Yes, at first glance you would pass him off as a big bulky gym junkie, but there is more to him than that. He wants to be the best, to be seen as a hero. In his quest for greatness, Tatum effectively shows the jealousy and competitiveness of his character. A quest that inevitably alienates him from his loved ones. As for Steve Carell, he has the obvious physical changes but the dramatic transformation he goes through is much more impressive. His character John presents himself as a visionary and a leader. However, that is all a façade he hides his insecurities behind. His need for approval makes him manipulate people and his own public image. The more this need grows, the more questionable decisions he makes that constantly builds the tension between him and the rest of the cast. Their relation together is what makes the audience remain on the edge.One thing I should mention that some people may have a problem with, the length of the movie. I personally enjoyed the slow pace because it made sense with the psychology of the lead characters. That slow burn and tension led to a narrative climax that I physically reacted to. The only reason I bring this up is because I did notice several people leaving the cinema well before the film ended. The number of people was significant enough that it made me wonder if I was the only one who didn't mind the pacing. Nevertheless, I'm just cautioning you in case that does happen to be of any concern.In the end, I really liked Foxcatcher. It is always great to see actors take risks, even more so when they succeed. Tatum and Carell certainly did succeed, and I hope this isn't the last we see of them in a dramatic role.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Beautiful Film about deconstructing the American Dream,"Ever since I saw the preview for Foxcatcher on television, I thought it would be a dark and intriguing film. Since the true story its based on, happened to end in tragedy itself. The films main character is Channing Tatum who plays Olympic Wrester Mark Schultz. From the very beginning, we get a clear sense of what kind of person Mark is, one who always seems to carry an extra load of pressure, and longing for a father figure. This is one of the reasons why its so easy for him to latch onto Jon Du Pont when they finally meet. Up until that point, we also meet Dave Schultz (played by Mark Ruffalo) and his family, Dave is a Wrestling trainer and coach at a local high school. Unlike Mark, Dave has a great personality, family and seems to be more passionate when it comes to the art of the sport. He also possesses the confidence that Mark needs when it comes winning a gold medal the second time. It becomes obvious as the movie progresses that the glitz and glamour of being a Olympic Gold Medalist isn't all that its cracked up to be. We are shown that Mark lives in poverty, making twenty dollar paychecks talking to elementary school students, and people barely can differentiate him from his brother Dave. This identity crisis propels Mark to head too Foxcatcher Farms when he receives a call from the estate of Jon DuPont( played by the great Steve Carell). It isn't until Mark meets Jon Dupont for the first time where they instantly form a bond between each other(Both consider themselves Patriots and want to make America the best country again). Jon asks Mark if he and Dave will come stay out at Foxcatcher Farms and train for the 88' Olympics, in which Mark agrees but says his brother can't be persuaded(Dave eventually comes there midway through film, because the pay offer is so good). Another major theme of the film is how wealth can make someone worse off than they originally were. In real life, Jon Dupont's family was wealthy eccentrics who had a huge stake in chemicals, oil and thoroughbred breeding among other things. It's also been documented that the early Dupont's all partook in incestry to keep the family blood line the same generation after generation. These factors and many other contribute to the eeriness of the Dupont character even more, and throughout the film we also get to meet Duponts mother (played by Vanessa Redgrave). She psychologically destroys Dupont's ambitions and wants, and we can see in many scenes how hard Jon tries to rekindle his relationship with her but fails miserably.. to the point of coaching a wrestling team when Dupont possessed little to none wrestling experience, often relying on his own wrestlers like Mark and Dave for advice.. Out of all the characters, Jon Dupont (Steve Carell) was definitely the most interesting anddisturbing to watch. By the end of the film though, you garner a lot of sympathy and sadness for Dave Schultz(Mark Ruffalo), because he was just trying to raise a family and live a normal life. You also feel for Mark Schultz as he loses his brother, throws the 88' olympics because his hatred for Jon Dupont had grown to extremes, and even in the end he is still a product of America, switching from wrestling to MMA. Everything about this film is different and great, the setting/locations are all fascinating, the history is interesting, the electric dialogue and tense scenes make up for the lack of violence or action because this is a deconstructive crime drama where the crime doesn't happen till the end.. The only two disappointments I had with the film was that there was no clarification when it came to Dupont hiding out in his home in a police standoff for 3 days after he killed Dave Schultz, we only see him getting taken out by the swat team after they get him outside. And the other thing is that Mark Schultz has spoken out about a few scenes being fictional, but its Hollywood, everything is used for dramatic effect. Great film none the less. One reason I think this film is classic and rewatchable is because you can close your eyes the whole movie and the score will take you on a story itself... 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A constant downfall,"The acting was emotional to say the least. I felt disturbed by the personalities that were being portrayed, and became more uncomfortable with the thought that they were real. It was a constant downhill ride as we followed the lives of the Schultz brothers. Being on the top and gliding to the foothill of success, was what this movie seemed to be entirely about. It was simply a man with no financial limit, who intended to live vicariously through individuals who excelled in a passion he could not. The life lessons imposed on this movie were the powers of temptation and pressure, and how mental stability can be in the form of winning and losing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Foxcatcher,"I couldn't for the life of me see how anyone was going to turn a book about wrestling into a brooding thriller, and the trailer for it frankly looked about as gay as a c*ck in a frock and his socks on a rock in Bangkok.But 'Foxcatcher' turns out to be a relentlessly dark, hypnotically tense, creepy film that's almost anti-Hollywood in all its silence and subtlety, with so many of the most powerful moments being communicated through pauses, glances, flickers of recognition and realization, with no dumbing down or over-explaining to the cattle-stalls. Amazing they got such big names in to make it, even if you can't recognize the most famous one in it at all.Really, it's only a film 'about' wrestling in so far as Million Dollar Baby is a film 'about' boxing. And nowhere near as depressing, either, so that helps.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A serious film. Seriously awful,"This is serious film in which the viewer is exposed to the plight and inner struggle of ... blah blah blah.Leaving my highschool film class analysis behind and coming back to reality - this movie is a complete drag. The entire film is a series of depressing events interspersed with boredom. I did not feel any connection to the characters, there was no real progression and the only strong emotion I felt was to leave the theater. The one part of the movie that moved fast was the ending which was abrupt and left me questioning ""wtf did I just watch"".0/10 - Complete waste of time",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very well done,"I didn't see this movie coming. usually u hear a buzz see trailers. something. nope i pulled this one off the Oscar nominee list. i had no idea it was based on a true story until post viewing research.For me in any film the most important thing is the cast. more important that directing, cinematography, effects, sound editing and so on. and when u see who is cast for these roles u say what the frock. Both Steve Carrel and Channing Tatum go miles outside there comfort zone and do a very good job. Carrel more so than Tatum. Tatum was just sorta quiet and didn't really act a lot but he played it cool and didn't do anything to make you not believe. Carrel on the other hand. wow i grew up watching this guy on the daily show, as brick Tatum from anchorman, or even almighty. always hilarious and light. i will never look at him the same again. In Fox Catcher he is nothing short of one creepy Mother trucker. an Oscar worthy performance no doubt.Again mad props for casting. Mark Ruffalo is a great and bankable choice for any director to cast he was the shining star of this film for sure. He does a flawless job of portraying Tatum's brother role model and mentor in this movie. u really feel like he is his brother and you wish he was your big brother. he just came across as so honest and loving.Not best picture this year i'm afraid, but 3 amazing performances i will never forget.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very solid movie with excellent performances,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Foxcatcher"" (2014) is superbly acted biography sport drama based on very true events. The three leading actors were superb, two of them earning Oscar nominations. Mark Ruffalo stole every scene he is in, it's a terrific performance.Overall, ""Foxcatcher"" isn't inspirational sport drama. It is based on very true events, so read as less synopsis about this movie as you can before watching it. At running time 2 h 7 min is superbly paced, doesn't drag and is very well directed. Not a typical sports movie, but a very descent film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oscar worthy film.,"This film to say the least, was phenomenal. Personally, i feel that the little dialogue used was key to the feel of them film. The fact it was so quiet, without use of atmospheric soundtrack in most of the film, gave the film such a tense atmosphere so I feel that Bennett Miller successfully made use of little dialogue. If you as a viewer never took Steve Carell seriously, prepare to change your opinion on this fantastically versatile actor. If you watch real footage of Mr Du Pont, Steve Carell portrays the eccentric billionaire fabulously. Mark Ruffalo has always been an actor that I feel is very 'samey' in the majority of his films, but this also was a career defining performance. Same goes for Channing. He really portrays the pain and psychological pain that Mark went through to be the best. Perfect piece of filmmaking that everyone needs to see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Interesting True Story with a Thrilling Atmosphere Throughout,","Foxcatcher is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.Its based on a true story,one that I never knew about,and didn't bother learning anything about it so I would be surprised with what was to come,and it certainly kept me at the edge of my seat.Though the movie isn't a thriller for the majority,there is a constant creepy and unpleasant atmosphere throughout,you can tell that something big is coming.This atmosphere is mostly conveyed by Steve Carell,who delivers an absolutely terrific performance that is nothing like what he's done previously,he is a complete creep and it is certainly uncomfortable watching this character,but in a very enjoyable way,it was amazing to see a man who played Michael Scott and Brick Tamland now take on such a very different character,and do so with such grace.Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo also do an amazing job,you can tell in many scenes that they got in to these characters as much as they possibly could,their mannerisms and speech are very different and both deliver one of their finest performances to date.I do feel like the movie struggled a bit to find their leading man,which was a bit of an issue,for a while it was mainly Tatum,but it stopped following him and jumped to Carell a bit and then to Ruffalo briefly,this isn't a huge issue but I felt like it should have focused on one character as the leading role and not jump around characters.A dramatic and well acted movie that I will certainly watch again,I would recommend Foxcatcher to anyone looking for a good biography or drama.Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is finally getting the recognition as a wrestler he dreamed of after getting in to business with Team Foxcatcher,led by the very successful John du Pont (Steve Carell),but all may not be as good as it seems.Best Performance: Steve Carell Worst Performance: Anthony Michael Hall",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Real life drama of tragedy brought to the screen just fine, as it shows how ego, passion and greed destroys friendship.","Finally watched ""Foxcatcher"" and I for one was not aware that the film was based on a real life drama that ended tragic, I was to young to remember anyway when it was. You have the real life story in which director Bennett Miller brings to the screen just fine of the Olympic wrestling brother team of one Mark(Channing Tatum)and David Schultz(Mark Ruffalo)who are getting ready to train for the 1988 games in Seoul. And Mark is the younger up and coming stubborn guy who wants to escape out of the shadow of his older straight laced and wise older brother a family man husband and dad David. Oddly enough a strange millionaire makes his appearance that's one strange and lonely odd guy in John E. DuPont(in a wicked and odd transformation role for funny guy Steve Carell)and he lets both Schultz brothers train at his farm like estate and he even lets the guys along with other wrestlers share the estate. And John becomes a father like figure to Mark only slowly but for sure the ego of John takes over as the unlikely relationship was not meant to be as this millionaire lives in one strange world. Overall this film is a great showcase of real life greed, ego, compassion, and the need for friendship in a lonely world as it shows how a mixture of these issues lead to real life tragedy as ""Foxcatcher"" is one film that tears a little bit of your viewing heart.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
By Far the Worst Movie This Year,"There is absolutely no content to this movie and absolutely no story plot. You have no idea where the movie is going with the plot because nothing ever happens. Literally, nothing happens. A complete waste of two hours of your life.And boy, is it slow. As well as being one of the most boring movies, it's also one of the slowest movies. Countless times I was thinking, ""When is something going to happen?"" Well, nothing happened.I'm utterly disappointed that I wasted my time watching this film, and my friends all have the exact same opinion. Which is a shame, because the trailer made it look phenomenal.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Best Films of the Year,"The movie starts off by establishing the wrestler Mark Schultz's (Channing Tatum) sad state of affairs. The first day on screen consists of him giving a speech to elementary students, crunching ramen noodles into a bowl, and staring at a wall. Obviously, things went down hill after his gold metal at the 1984 Olympics (he and his brother both won golds as Mark mentions many times throughout the film). Then, as they say, everything changes when he gets a call from John du Pont (Steve Carell), a member of the Du Pont family. John offers Mark a place on his wrestling team on the titular farm. He speaks of being a patriot and what the nation should do for its wrestlers. Mark is obviously wooed by these statements. Since he and his brother, Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), are close, he discusses the offer with him. Mark ultimately decides to join John du Pont on the farm.I've known about this film since November of 2013 when they decided to postpone the release. A first, I wasn't exactly excited because the names behind it didn't thrill me. I'd never seen Channing Tatum in anything, Mark Ruffalo wasn't anybody but ""that guy who played the Hulk in The Avengers,"" and Bennett Miller wasn't a proved director in my eyes. On the other hand, I was a big fan of Steve Carell's because of The Office, but I wouldn't really call that a dramatic performance (at all). A month later, I saw Stranger Than Fiction and The Truman Show, and realized that a comedian can make a good transition to drama. Some could argue that he already did with Little Miss Sunshine. I then saw Tatum in 21 Jump Street and Ruffalo in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. My level of anticipation was raised.Then I saw Foxcatcher.Carrell took my expectations, threw them to the ground, and shot them three times. In other words, his acting blew me out of the water. When he was on screen, it wasn't Steve Carrell. It was John du Pont. He was John du Pont in looks and manner. I'd like to note that I haven't compared the real John du Pont and Foxcatcher's version nor have I seen much footage of John du Pont. Exact accuracy with John's mannerisms was not necessarily needed. What Carrell did was embody the character behind John du Pont: a disturbed, spoiled, mentally unstable man.Even though I just praised Carrell's du Pont to the utmost degree, I believe Mark Ruffalo one- upped him. Ruffalo's Dave Schultz is a much more nuanced performance. His feelings toward a subject could still be identified even though their subtler than his counterparts'. That is not to say that Carrell's feelings were blatantly obvious. Furthermore, John du Pont's depiction benefited from this somewhat emotionally open outlook anyways because that is what type of character du Pont is. By saying that Ruffalo ""one-upped"" Carrell, I'm saying that Ruffalo's performance was more difficult to achieve because he had to hide his emotion to the characters around him but not to the audience.Part of what makes this movie great is the relationship between the Schultz brothers. Dave basically raised Mark when they were younger, so they were very close. Conversations between the two of them felt very organic and dynamic. In the very first scene, the movie planted the seeds of Mark's resentment towards his brother because he felt that his brother was the one who lead him to everything he had achieved in life. He didn't feel independent in his achievements; everything he did owed to his brother. The movie built off of this inferiority complex. On top of that, Mark struggled with having only one talent (wrestling) which was overshadowed by others including his brother (""Dave's my brother. We both have golds."") If he wasn't the best at the only thing he was good at, he wasn't anything. He felt he found in John du Pont someone that appreciated his abilities. Channing Tatum successfully portrayed Mark's inward struggle and deterioration as a wrestler and a human being. John du Pont wanted both brothers to come to Foxcatcher Farm, but only Mark came, making du Pont aggravated and impatient because he was used to getting what he wanted and Dave denied him of his request. This made something he and Mark could relate over. The power struggle between Dave and du Pont, the brotherly relationship between Dave and Mark, and the strange semi-friendship, semi-mentorship between du Pont and Mark, increased tension among the trio. Two hours and ten minutes of Foxcatcher built on this tension until the haunting, chilling, and depressing finale in the last four minutes. It's worth staring at a blank wall for those two hours if you get to see those last four minutes.All I have discussed in my review is the performances of three actors and one theme within this epic (yes, I used the word ""epic,"" and I don't use it often), haunting masterpiece. I didn't go into detail about Channing Tatum's performance, and I didn't even mention Vanessa Redgrave (du Pont's mother), Sienna Miller (Dave's wife), or the surprisingly-creative cinematography.From the outside, Foxcatcher doesn't seen to have much going on. It might just seem like a slow-burning borefest filled with homoerotic wrestling scenes. Look inside and you'll find a carefully crafted and well-executed character study that truly understands its subjects and humanity as a whole.Highly Recommended | Award: CAUGHT THE FOX",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fuelled by Terrific Performances Foxcatcher is a Captivating Biopic,"Olympic wrestling would not usually be my top choice for a biopic. So it surprises me to say that Foxcatcher is one of the best and most compelling films that I have seen in a long time.The true story upon which this film is based is the Olympic Wrestling Team – Foxcatcher. Mark Schultz is trained and brought to John Du Pont's grounds to compete in the 1988 Wrestling Olympics in Seoul, where he trains with a group and his brother Dave.Earlier this year I saw the film 'The Theory of Everything'. I stated that Eddie Redmayne who played Stephen Hawking deserves to win an Oscar. After seeing 'Foxcatcher' it is my duty to retract that statement, as each of the three male actors work above and beyond to the best of their ability. Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo give career defining performances that are guaranteed to be remembered on their filmography.Although Ruffalo is great, I feel that it is his performance that I gained the least out of as he is given much less screen time than the others and therefore less to do. That being said his performance here is on par with his best work – 'Zodiac'. Carell and Tatum are at the core of this film's success and contribute to perhaps why I love this film as much as I do. Their relationship is intriguing and as the film nears its last third the collective strain on it is tangible.Carell was what I most feared; I felt before I saw this film that he is more suited to comedic roles and would not be able to accurately portray the innate creepiness of John Du Pont. Rest assured that he is absolutely astonishing, most of the time I forgot I was watching a film, at some points I felt like I was watching a documentary.Now, Tatum he deserves an Oscar, in this film he keeps himself extremely restrained. You can tell from his face his thoughts and feelings; you can literally read his mind. He usually portrays characters that are well versed in the world of sports and yes he is in this film as well. But my, he is so subtle, to deny this man an Oscar would be to deny the sheer driving power of the film itself.Many people it seems have taken issue with the films pacing. In all honesty, if Stanley Kubrick was still alive he could have directed it. Read into that what you will. However, this film relies on a bleak tone and I feel that the pacing compliments the film perfectly. If it was too fast then we would never get into the mind-set of the characters – thankfully we do!If you pay any attention to cinematography you will find so much for your eyes to feast upon. Almost every image is imprinted on my mind – the truth is this movie won't leave me alone and I mean that in a positive way!It is your duty to watch 'Foxcatcher' – it has three of the best performances I have seen from a film released in 2014. An enticing script, mind bogglingly great cinematography, an unbelievable third act and heart thumping music. Put into simple terms – deny yourself this film and you are denying yourself one of the best Biopics ever put to celluloid.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Don't be fooled, it stinks!","I saw Foxcatcher... The people responsible for making this movie are audited by the IRS and summarily thrown into a dank and cold prison cell in rural Kentucky. Before I get into what made me so upset about this movie, let me give you a quick synopsis about what this hunk of garbage is about. Foxcatcher centers on Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz, played here by Channing Tatum, and his time spent training with eccentric billionaire John E du Ponte, played by Steve Carell, at his palatial training facility for the 1988 Olympic games. Things between Schultz and du Ponte start off OK enough but as time goes on and the audience learns that neither man is the sharpest knife in the drawer nor the sanest, things go off the rails quickly and culminate in an truly horrific way.This movie has got to be the worst film I've seen in the last 5 years. What this movie is, despite what the trailer would have you believe, is Steve Carell and Channing Tatum staring awkwardly at each other not saying too much and making everyone in the audience feel uncomfortable and bored in a scoreless stagnant bog of white noise and silence as you faintly hear the murmurs of other people in neighboring theaters laughing and having fun for (no lie) TWO HOURS! This goes on until Mark Ruffalo, who plays Mark Schultz's brother David, shows up and all but says, ""what have you guys been doing up here with this audience for the last 2 hours?!"" and Channing Tatum and Steve Carell responded by saying, ""um...philanthropist, ornithologist, philatelist-"" and then Ruffalo has to then try to carve a plot out of the COMPLETE waste of time this movie has been up until then but by the time he does, it's far too little far far far too late. I swear every 10 minutes of this snoozefest of a movie I felt myself on the cusp of shouting ""DO SOMETHING!"" at the screen! The fact that Steve Carell or Mark Ruffalo are nominated for an Academy Awards for their performance in this movie is bordering on a criminal act especially considering people like David Oyelowo and Jake Gyllenhaal will be sitting at the house this year in spite of stellar performances in Selma and Nightcrawler. The only thing that is any good about this film is the makeup that they did on Steve Carell and even that isn't too spectacular seeing as it's just a nose piece from what I could tell. After all I've said, I'll summarize with this, it's one thing to be a bad movie, but to be a BORING bad movie is just unforgivable. Foxcatcher STINKS and I don't like it. It gets a 1... out of 5.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
A truly well-crafted film with acting that deserves a standing ovation.,"In terms of a story ""Foxcatcher"" (Miller 2014) doesn't really have a lot to work with at first glance. It's a story about a – in some or another way – down and out sports person who has to rise to the challenge, or not. These are stories that have been around the block with pretty much any sport you can think of, but ""Foxcatcher"" is not another one of those films. This 'straight forward' narrative is laced with character content making what could easily have been dull or boring scenes informative and engaging. The plot generally develops the way you expect it to, until the moment where what you should have seen coming catches you - and the lady somewhere behind you - off guard with a yelp. There are two elements of 'setup' for important things to come in this film and they are both done wonderfully. In retrospect you realize that the script and director were giving you a hint but in the moment of the scene there is no reason for you to suspect it; and that is how a setup is done correctly. As mentioned, the acting is praiseworthy and I fully support the freshly released 87th Academy Award nominations for Steve Carell (Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role) and Mark Ruffalo (Best Performance of an Actor in a Supporting Role). Both these actors performed well above what we've come to expect from them and that does not exclude Channing Tatum, who embodies the physicality of the screen character of Mark Schultz remarkable well. Besides the obvious credit going to the actors, Director Bennett Miller also deserves his nomination for the 'Best Achievement in Directing' Oscar as he created an environment and world that made everything believable. Not for one second did I question the location, the time, the characters, their responses – and there were some out of the ordinary responses - or the action(s) around their lives. Miller and his crew put so much attention in the detail without losing sight of the big picture which is remarkable (here's to hoping the 'Best Directing' award from the Cannes Film Festival is a predictor for the Oscars). The cinematography was clean, precise and functional. The framing of certain moments and scenes were powerful but the camera never drew attention to itself and its art form, which in the case of a dramatic film like ""Foxcatcher"" is a very good thing. The sound however, drew my attention, but in a good way. The quality of the audio work in this film is beyond impressive. They used silence like very few films do, they used music and scoring sparsely which made the moments where there was scoring more effective. As a technical whole I think there is little that could have been done to improve this film. Cinematographer, Greig Frasera and his team, along with the substantial sound department did great work. ""Foxcatcher"" is well rounded in every facet, dramatic, beautiful, engaging, and with a powerful, unexpected climatic moment; a worthwhile film experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fascinating,"This is a fascinating movie. I don't want to give spoilers so I won't talk about the plot. The actors did incredible work, particularly Steve Carell as a billionaire Du Pont and Channing Tatum as his wrestling star. Mark Ruffallo was also great as Dave Schultz. Carrell's performance is outstanding, he should really win an Oscar. He literally became this eccentric rich man, not just physically but also psychologically. Kudos to Carrell. I knew he had this in him, in spite of his many comedic performances. Tatum is also a nice surprise, he too became Mark Schultz and I might add he was very convincing.

How did they manage to make this story SOOOO DULLL ?,"Sorry this story had major possibilities and Hollywood made a complete mess of it as usual ... Hey Hollywood ... Don't you realise yet that until you start employing talented writers and directors that are capable of having a broader vision than their last washing powder commercial you are going to get less and less people interested in seeing your films Channing Tatum had obviously been directed to act like a retard ... OK he might not be the most talented actor, but this was farcical ... Steve Caroll ( whoever he is ) was just one dimensional skin crawly ... I would of thought the fact that the character was an totally untalented, over privileged arms dealer would probably have been enough to make the point without the creepy performance The major problem of course is its just not in the slightest bit exciting or interesting And god knows where this winging about homo eroticism comes from cos this yawn fest is way less sexual than even the most average wrestling match",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Money Can't Buy Me Love.,"I have no interest whatever in wrestling and very little in the life styles of the enormously wealthy except in comedies but this film is original and curiously gripping throughout.The story is based on historical fact and goes something like this. Channing Tatum is an taciturn amateur wrestler hoping to compete in the Olympics of 1988. His brother Mark Ruffalo is his older brother, coach, and best friend -- or ONLY friend as far as we're able to discern. Ruffalo is a laid back kind of guy, supporting his wife and two daughters. Both brothers live in one of those Northeast working-class shack towns of the sort I grew up in.Then, one day, fate steps into their lives. Du Fate takes the corporeal form of Steve Carell as John du Pont, the fortyish scion of the self-proclaimed ""wealthiest family in America"" -- they own Delaware -- calls Tatum and invites him to Foxcatcher, the family estate somewhere in the neighborhood of Washington.To keep it short, Carell acts as wrestling mentor to Tatum and in fact practically adopts him. Carell also gathers a squad of half a dozen promising wrestlers and is going to fund them through the next Olympics, with himself as the head of ""Team Foxcatcher."" He also hires the quietly cheerful Ruffalo but over time comes to resent Ruffalo's bond with Tatum. Carell wants to do all the bonding around here. It leads to tragedy.The film is about as far away from the typical ""docudrama"" as you can get. It's imaginative in almost every respect and plaudits are due especially to Bennett Miller, the director, and editors Jay Cassidy, Stuart Levy, and Conor O'Neil who have figured out the precise length to let a scene linger on the screen.The performances of the three principals is unimpeachable. Channing Tatum is first seen as an inarticulate brute, shuffling around in a gym, his eyes cast down as always. He speaks in grunts. True, he's a college graduate (I won't name the university, which must be known for its wrestling team) but we can't help asking whose breath blew out the light within this brain. When he tries to read the word ""philanthropist"" it comes out ""philogulist."" Steve Carrell is unforgettable as the rich guy. He's got a schnozz on him like a bald eagle and when he speaks -- or even when he doesn't speak -- he tilts his head back and stares down his nose like William F. Buckley. And that voice, so accommodating, so bland, so pragmatic. When he learns that Ruffalo doesn't want to move to Foxcatcher because his family is now established elsewhere, Carrell asks tonelessly, ""How much does he want?"" Nothing is made of it but it tells us a great deal about being rich.I don't know how closely it hews to historical reality. I'd never heard of the case. And it's not easy to figure out the dynamics in the narrative because it isn't spelled out for us, as it would be in a child's ABC book. The writer and director have enough trust in the maturity of the audience to let us figure it out for ourselves.My guess? The mother-dominated rich boy is starved for love. He had one friend in his childhood -- until he discovered that his mother was PAYING the other kid to be a friend. Well, now he's got a whole wrestling team that adores him as their angel. The presence of Ruffalo as the coach who knows what he's about interferes with that paternalistic relationship, not to mention the implicit homoeroticism. Carrell is jealous of Ruffalo.But you're entitled to your own guess. Or make no guess at all and just watch the understated imagery float with such aplomb across the screen. I'm glad I caught it, though it didn't unleash a love of wrestling. Where I grew up it was all schoolyard fist fights and bloody noses. Like Vanessa Redgrave as the starchy old mother, we'd have considered wrestling a ""low sport.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Channing Tatum steals the show....,"Well before I never thought I'd see Steve Carell and Channing Tatum in a drama together, but it happened and it was a great film. This film has perfect direction from Bennett Miller, who directed Capote and one of my all-time favorites Moneyball. When I first heard about this film I told myself this is going to be the best film of 2014. Well I was almost right. The performances really made the film for me, Steve Carell was crazy mesmerizing, but not worth all the award hype he's getting because Mr. Tatum was the heart and soul for this film truly. Mark Ruffalo was great he is the only one in the film who honestly for sure is getting an Oscar nomination. Jon Du Point was a strange, insane and tormented man who thought he could help America soar again, but in a violent way. Mark Schultz himself says the film is mostly false and well it's a movie, not exactly always fully true. Masterful acting excels the movie into a great story and this is a film that's just so out there, crazy and depressing you only need to watch this powerful story unfold just once.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too opaque,"The film is beautifully shot and the director knows how to shoot landscape to illuminate a story like no one else but the movie remains hobbled by the director and writer's inability to make the DuPont character anything less than opaque. He remains an enigma from beginning to end. If this was their idea it is a fatal error because with no way into DuPont's character we are at a loss on who to process the information that unfolds. Steve Carell gives a good performance with very little material to work with on this role. We never understand ""how"" he came to the terrible last moments of the film. Mark Ruffalo gives the most complete portrait in the movie in the supporting role of Mark--he truly transcends the material. Channing Tatum (not a favorite of mine) is adequate in looking like a clueless ape in the movie, but he like Steve Carell fall victim to the inadequacies of the script. Vanessa Redgrave is underused and clearly her part could have illuminated many of the aspects of her son's character. The narrative seemed inadequate to the story being told.

This is a bizarre but real story of men with cauliflower ears ;-),"Anybody who is not aware of the star cast may make a failed guess about the actor who played John du Pont. It is one of a performance by Steve Carell. Steve have nailed it in so many ways. The makeup was superb. The bizzare dialogue delivery was well acted. Not only Steve's, but Channing and Mark's characters were given thoughtful makeup, for example the Cauliflower Ears common in wrestlers. The expecting though unexpected climax stole the other interesting parts of the story. I am impressed by the director, Bennett Miller. It is one of his best work till date - even better than Moneyball.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best American movies I've seen in a long time,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. A gripping, bizarre yet intriguing story. A film about obsession, competition, conflict and loyalty, with a strong message regarding the often isolating effect that money can have and what is, at times, the ugly reality of the American Dream. Five-star cast, superb direction and beautifully shot.It is so refreshing to see a relatively ""mainstream"" American movie that is so well made. Unlike most Hollywood trash (about as subtle as a sledgehammer), this movie was wonderfully understated. It moved at a welcome, slow pace which paid respect to the passage of time. Dialogue was often sparingly used (to great effect). All of the scenes, whether stunning landscape shots or choreographed wrestling sequences, were beautifully and tastefully filmed.The characters were so strong; well-crafted and thoughtfully presented. The acting was uniformly superb. Most impressively of all, much of the character development was conveyed via body language, rather than through dialogue. Right from the word go, one had such a strong sense of what each character was about; the surly, intense and hunched over Mark (Tatum), the caring, supportive Dave (Ruffalo) and the weird, unbalanced du Pont (Carell).All three chief actors were excellent, but special praise must go to Carrell for his brilliant depiction of the eccentric, unhinged du Pont. Money talks, and there is no finer illustration of this than du Pont - a man who has every material object he could possibly desire yet pathetically (and unsuccessfully) craves the approval of those around him. Instead, he only succeeds in making everyone he comes into contact with immediately ill-at-ease, all the while understanding that they need to stay on the good side of the man who will help them realise their ambitions, albeit in a grandiose and self-gratifying manner. The dynamic between du Pont and the film's other characters was fascinatingly, and exceptionally, conveyed.Sure, the directors presumably took some liberties with the re-telling of events as they actually happened, but what movie ""based on a true story"" doesn't? I generally take all movies of this kind with a pinch of salt.I warmly recommend this movie. A thoughtful and beautifully constructed take on a unique, strange and ultimately tragic tale.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

An unsettling analogy of modern America,"When it comes to depicting a real figure caught up in real events, the one aspect that movie's struggle with is really getting to the heart of it's character. Commonly, these characters are larger than life, and it takes a truly talented actor to bring them to life and an intelligent script to dig beneath their skin. Director Bennett Miller seem to have the magic touch. His three features have all been based on true-life stories. Philip Seymour Hoffman brought Truman Capote to life in Capote (2005), to the point where you believed the strange voice coming out of him wasn't a mere impersonation, but an embodiment. His second feature, Moneyball (2011) was a solid depiction of underdog coach Billy Bean (Brad Pitt), who changed baseball forever with his use of statistical analysis.He's done it again with Foxcatcher, the shocking true tale of one man's madness amidst the quest for Olympic gold. Like with Moneyball, we are taken behind the scenes (or beyond the mat) of the sporting world, and the screen is flooded with the same damp, autumn colours as it was in Capote. It is melancholic but unsettling, as if slowly pumping up a balloon and waiting for it to burst. We first meet Olympic gold medallist Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), scraping twenty bucks together by appearing in his brother's absence at a school to teach kids the values required to achieve a gold medal. He goes home and eats microwave noodles, and then it's back to the practice mat in preparation for the next tournament.His luck seems on the rise when he is contacted by the mysterious John du Pont (Steve Carell), the head of a vastly wealthy dynasty who lives at his huge, beautiful Foxcatcher Farm. Curious, Mark goes to meet him and learns of du Pont's plans to make his farm the breeding ground of American wrestling. He instantly signs up, and Mark is given his own cabin and top-notch training facility. He is also given lots of cocaine, and soon submits to du Pont, at one point seen crouching in front of du Pont on his porch, like a well- trained guard dog. But du Pont is not satisfied with Mark alone - he wants his brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also an gold medallist - at Foxcatcher too. Only Dave has settled with his wife (Sienna Miller) and children in the suburbs and, as Mark points out, can't be bought. Du Pont cannot process this.If you don't know the bizarre news story that came out of this arrangement, then it's best not to know. The film's foreboding is creeping. The introduction of John du Pont doesn't portray him as the strange, uncharismatic, and increasingly deranged man that he was; instead we see him at a distance, muttering pleasantries and looking down that huge nose of his. He doesn't convince as a wrestling coach, but Mark laps up the attention and luxury like any young man in his position would. When Dave eventually arrives, he sees du Pont for what he is - a man-child who inherited wealth, buying tanks to add to his military paraphernalia and living in fear of his reclusive mother (played by Vanessa Redgrave), wishing himself a leader of men without possessing any of the necessary skills required to be so. Only at this point, Mark has seen it too, but he also resents the success of his brother.Miller and screenwriters E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman take all of this and makes it an analogy of modern America, where wealth inherited rather than earned still looms large over a country sworn to pursuing the dream and democracy. The performances are terrific. Carell and Ruffalo earned the Oscar nominations, but Tatum more than holds his own. In a scene just after a lost bout, Mark paces his room like a cage animal, suddenly bursting with rage and destroying a mirror with his head. Considering this was improvised on the spot by a dedicated Tatum, it really takes the breath away. Like the recent work of David Fincher, I believe that in the years to come, Foxcatcher will be studied as a window into our times and will be viewed as one of the finest American films of it's era.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A 2 hour film based on a 2 second climax.,"To say this film was bad would be lying. However, I wouldn't argue against calling it boring. The whole narrative lacks a key element of good cinema, which is audience involvement. To truly have an effect on spectators, they need to NOT be spectators. They need to be companions to the film, to the characters, to the storyline; their response to the film needs to have significance and purpose.The reason why cinema has such a big impact on people is because they are plucked from their seats dragged into the story. Foxcatcher just doesn't have this aspect. The characters are not well-established at all. At no point in the film did I empathise with Mark, John, or Dave, and likewise, at no point in the film was I rooting for any of them. It felt like I was just sitting there, watching. I didn't really care what happened to any of them.Along with this, the narrative consisted of essentially nothing. If you asked me, I believe that without all the irrelevant scenes, the film would last not even an hour. It felt like they were using bland fight scenes and dull training montages in order to give the sense we were watching something that wasn't completely void of a storyline. The only point in the film that truly had an effect on me was the climax at the end, which I can assure you was not worth the 1 and a half hours I had wasted watching the fodder to this scene.Pseudo-tension was also created with a repetitive and somewhat annoying use of silence which accompanied almost every scene. In theory, it may seem like a good, thoughtful idea, but when you're sitting in a theatre of 100+ people, silence translates to 'who is crunching that popcorn in row 5 and why do they have to be so goddamn loud about it'.Now, to perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole film, Steve Carrells performance. After it being so hyped up, and knowing his history in comedy, I was definitely looking forward to this 'Oscar-Worthy' performance. Let's just say he didn't deliver. Every scene that involved him was boring, as he just didn't have the acting ability or technique to make DuPont beyond a bland talking voice and instead a complex, conflicted character. I do really love Steve Carrell as an actor, and I especially love him in The Office, but I just wish they'd have chosen someone who would have added to the film, instead of taken away.In the right hands, this story could have been gripping, horrifying, and humbling all at the same time. Unfortunately, this adaption flopped. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Quest for Glory,"Under the helm of the visionary director- Bennett Miller, Foxcatcher serves as a classic storytelling masterpiece as it scrutinizes the human psyche's craving for success and the unbearable burden of anxiety that comes with it. This electrically captivating drama nets the audience's minds from the first scene and puts our hearts on a chokehold until the very last. The story reaches its climax when we least expect it to, leaving us emotionally shaken from the cathartic release of the pounding thematic conflict. Pertaining to the story, E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman have crafted a near perfect screenplay, tracing the downfall of all the central characters of the film- a rare creative choice in cinema.The year is 1987, three years after 1984 Olympics which won Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) the gold in wrestling. But after being overshadowed nearly forever by the success of his elder brother- Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), Mark craves for recognition from the society- having been previously 'unrecognized'. He somehow makes ends meet and lives all alone.Du Pont (Steve Carrel), an aristocratic multi millionaire whose sole dream is to draw glory to his training company- 'Foxcatcher', persuades Mark to join in as an official trainer for an elite squad of the US national wrestling team.Widely celebrated as a comedy icon, Steve Carrel's nerve racking performance as this dark role establishes his creative identity as a finesse versatile actor in Hollywood. So does Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum. They both delve into their varied character moments in the script and flesh out philosophical conflict through authentic and powerful emotions that resonate with the audience.Mark's hunger for fame and respect, not the love for the sport, motivates him to leave his brother behind and join Foxcatcher.But Du Pont often desperately seeks temporary refuge behind his own wealthy aristocratic façade as a means of escapism from his failures at establishing himself as a respectable figure in the eyes of others around, especially his mother (Vanessa Redgrave). This mannerism plunges him into a downward spiral of desire to succeed. His mother stomps down on his swirling ego by declaring that she does not want her son to get ""low"" and labels wrestling as a ""low sport"". Consequently, being a fan of it, Du Pont feels passionately stirred at being insulted at. But being blinded by his own unhealthy obsession for power, he fails to recognize the truth in her wisdom- the fact that he has actually gotten way too low in the pursuit of glory.Du Pont's character casts a lasting impression on our minds, owing to the precarious grin donned by Carrel during the awkward moments of the film. His grin comes off as a careful composite patchwork of anxiety, annoyance and arrogance.The premise of this film is built upon the physically aggressive sport of wrestling, which is a precise metaphor to the psychological tussle in the minds of both Mark and Du Pont- as the two men grapple for fame and glory.Mark and Du Pont's common goal of fame in life ties them together in a friendship that yields advantageous to both their desires. However, as the days fly by, their individual struggles to establish societal dominance tear their duo apart very soon, throwing Mark into a dark lonely corner of his own mind. This leads to the arrival of Dave on the farm as the new trainer.Being a former Olympic gold medalist, Dave's coaching skills are unrivalled by Du Pont's, who in fact is just a sport fan. Feeling outgunned by Dave's expertise, Du Pont actively pursues his goal of proclaiming himself as the head coach for the entire Foxcatcher team. He senses a pressing and urgent need to be hailed as a father figure to them. Dave's presence on the wrestling squad also serves as the perfect emotional backbone for a struggling and unstable Mark to lean on. But his new popularity amongst the other trainees silently infuriates Du Pont- compelling him do the unthinkable in the film's jaw dropping climax.The vivid imagery and visual storytelling implemented in this film clearly establishes it as one of Miller's best works till date.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The idiosyncrasies of the human mind !!!,"Bennett Miller has always had the ability to get the best out of his actors. He did it with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Capote, he did it with Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in Moneyball, and now he has done it with Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum. Mark Ruffalo has done fantastic work before, but I have never seen Carell and Tatum do anything as good as their work in Foxcatcher before. All three actors transform themselves physically and emotionally to give absolutely astonishing performances.This film is based on a true story. Like the real life story itself, the film is also very dark, haunting and extremely unpredictable. This is a very dark and interesting take on sports films. The film never ever resorts to clichés and remains entirely grounded in reality. The style of storytelling is hypnotic, moody and the pace is intentionally slow. Miller uses minimal editing and allows the actors to express themselves without feeling the need to make jump- cuts. The director gives subtle hints regarding the reasons why some of the things happened, but he never explicitly establishes any solid evidence. This actually gives scope for subjective interpretations.This film might be difficult for some people to sit through due to the slow pacing. But if you want to watch a film where every actor is at the top of his/her power and if you want to watch a film where the director allows the story to progress effortlessly without feeling the need to resort to clichés, then Foxcatcher is a must watch.Even though Bennet Miller gives enough hints throughout the film to allow the viewer to make up his/her mind about why the things happened as they did, but above all the film also establishes the idea, that at the end of the day, some things that humans do can defy all logic and explanations.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I end up loving this film and think about it for days. This means for me that it is a good film, with an excellent cast and a great leading performance.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An immensely creepy and wonderfully acted slow-burn,"One of the most impressively eerie films of recent times, Foxcatcher is another quality film to be directed by Bennett Miller that may well just be the film that officially leads him to be called the master of the mood piece after the quality Philip Seymour Hoffman starring Capote and the most interesting movie ever filmed about stats Moneyball came before this new slice of true story filmmaking.The less known about Foxcatcher the better and its clear Bennett wanted his 2 hour plus feature to be an exercise in the slow build and under the skin creepiness that so many films strive for yet fail to reach. Bennett nails the films 80's set production design and glum mood and upcoming horror filmmakers could strangely take tips from the way Bennett constructs many of his scenes, never has a late night wrestle or an awkward documentarian conversation been so utterly off putting. Foxcatcher's tone is flawless and tone perfectly suited yet it's well designed coldness is also its biggest weakness as we sadly never feel overly affiliated with the movies main troupe of actors, despite the work of Steve Carell, Channing Tatum (making up for Magic Mike) and Mark Ruffalo who together produce a stunning 3 pronged acting attack.Delivering career best turns, Carell and Tatum deserve all the plaudits they received for there on song turns. Carell is quietly menacing and near unrecognisable as real life figure John du Pont, a billionaire, wrestling loving mummy's boy that has more deep seeded issues than you'd care to imagine and his chemistry with Tatum's slow yet dedicated Olympian wrestler Mark Shultz produces many of the films strongest scenes. John and Mark's friendship and comradery take this tale to many dark yet fascinating places and when accompanied by Ruffalo's assured turn as Mark's older brother David, Foxcatcher truly soars to some great dramatic heights and the oft unappealing sport of wrestling becomes a thoroughly thrilling back drop to all manner of human conditions, laid out bare on the mats these men compete on.Foxcatcher will not be for everyone and it's by no means a flawless film, yet it's a refreshingly unique and uncompromising poetically licensed telling of a seriously troubling true life tale. With 3 standout acting turns, particularly from the here starkly unfunny Steve Carell and the oft misused Channing Tatum, Foxcatcher is another quality film by Miller that would attest to him being one of the finest dramatic directors working today.4 late night wrestles out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Amazing performance By Mark Ruffalo and Steve Carell,"Brilliant performance by the supporting Cast, a intriguing true story, but has a very slow tempo that makes this film feel like its more then 4 hours long.Let me first say, i was not a fan of Tatum in the film. There, he often broke character, and you can see that he wanted to break out a smile half the time he was on screen. Also the fact that he just kept on pushing his lower jaw out and slightly squinting his eye brows, didn't change the fact that he spoke and had all of his own mannerisms. His only good performance was in the hotel scene, where he was breaking down, but even then we didn't see his face.Mark Ruffalo was by far the best actor! He stole the film with his excellent performance. Just look at the way he walked, carried his body in this film compared to Avengers. Look at his mannerisms, his little personal character traits, this is was great acting is. his Nominations for Oscars was well deserved.Steve Carell was also great in the film, although he did have a lot of prosthetic over his face, he still came across as the Golden Eagle rather then Carell playing the Coach. I can not say, and will not say that he was better then Mark, because he wasn't. But he did demonstrate that he has a variety of acting abilities in this film.Now as for the film, and what i believe was the reason why this film is a 5/10. The story was interesting, and is based on the real events surrounding John du Pont and the Schultz brothers, but as a film, it felt at most to be dragging on. Not Much was happening, the tension was building very, very slow. and makes you look on your watch to see how much of time has passed. The not so subtle direction of suggestions of some kind of relationship between John and Mark, just felt awkward and pushed down the viewers throat.I can honestly say that i did want to walk away from the film, but only stayed to watch more of Mark's brilliant acting and Carell's great performance. Now i know some might say, this is not an entertainment popcorn flick, and that's fine, but if i can sit and watch 12 angry men all day on repeat and not get bored. Then i should do the same for this. Not feel like ""When is this going to end""",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Geeky Randy's summary,"Based loosely on the story of multimillionaire heir John Eleuthère du Pont (Carell) financing 1984 U.S. Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz (Tatum) for participation in wrestling competitions. Excellent performances all around—Carell definitely transforms, while Ruffalo is also memorable for the very charismatic Dave Schultz (Mark's older brother). The plot slowly heats up to a boiling ending, with its characters spiraling downhill—more of a quiet and intense film of crime and tragedy rather than wrestling. Not fully accurate, but Miller certainly tries to build multiple layers in order to compensate for cut corners. The script took several years to get off the ground, and the film spent almost an entire year in post production the effort shows.***½ (out of four)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Foxcatcher review,"In this Bennette Miller Drama 'Foxcatcher' you get to see the darker side of sport, the sport in this case being wrestling. Unlike Mickey Rourke's 'The Wrestler' which indeed was very heartbreaking and rough, this film concentrates more on the background events, which include Tatum and his brother (Ruffalo) and the tensity between them and Tatums wrestling trainer (Steve Carrel) I have to say, after seeing this movie it left me feeling a bit down and depressed, but that was the intention of the movie. It done perfectly on making you feel very sorry for Carrel's character, and gives you a big shock towards the end. It is one of the movies you can't easily forget, and is one of the greatest films i've seen in a long time. I thought the performances, from all Tatum, Carrell, and particularly Ruffalo were fantastic,. The impact it gave me through all the characters worked perfectly. I truly felt sorry for all these characters in the movie, especially Carrel. To think that this was a true story is terrifying, when you've seen the movie you'll understand,. But if you haven't seen it, i highly recommend you try and see this somehow, because it is definitely worth a watch. A lot better than i was expecting. I thought the film concentrated more on the sport of wrestling when i first saw the trailer, but the film turned out to be completely different.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Loved the plot and incredible acting,"I'd struggled with the idea of this film and gone to watch it a few times, only to be distracted by something else. However, I'm so glad I did eventually make time for it. The description of it doesn't do it justice. As a woman a film about 'wrestling' wasn't that appealing initially, but this film is about so much more. The story is fascinating and unfolds at a gentle pace. The acting is incredible both by Channing Tatum and Steve Carell. After watching the movie I researched the facts behind the film and was stunned that this really was in parts a true story - perhaps it's a UK thing, but it isn't something we heard about over here at the time. I'm going to be recommending this quiet gem to a lot of people.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Still waiting.,"I was very excited for this movie. I figured it was going to be a very dark psychological movie with strong characters and a fascinating character study. It was indeed dark and psychological, but it was very emotionally hollow.I found no reason to care about any of the characters. The story is wrong as the Schultz brothers weren't at Foxcatcher at the same time. Also, Dave Schultz and John Du Pont had a different relationship than portrayed.I was waiting the entire movie for something to happen. There was an ending, but it was so hollow and anti-climactic that I just didn't care.I don't recommend this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Steve Carrell,"Very nice movie. I would recommend.This is a long movie, though it doesn't feel that way. My first time watching Steve Carell in a serious, non-comedy type role and... he is amazing! Didn't think it would work at first, but a good actor is a good actor. The same could be said about Channing Tatum, who really embodied a wrestling champion. Don't really know why he was depressed half the movie, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I found the movie to be more sad than motivating.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie about power,"Some reviewers have claimed that Foxcatcher is at essence a movie about repressed homosexual tension. To me, this is an instance of the projection of an individual's own concerns and ideological framework onto a movie.In response, you may ask why any interpretation that I develop is in anyway different: surely I have my own dogmas and conceptual constructs that get in the way of an ""objective viewing"". Such an objection would have some truth to it, but I would not be willing to concede the post-modern notion that there is no objective truth to any piece of art.If interpretation was merely projection, then I cannot see how any kind of discussion could take place about a piece of art: regardless of the question of whether it is good or bad, there must be some objectivity to what it is.Foxcatcher is a movie about power. The movie nearly explodes with tension: a tension between individuals dominating each other in a multitude of ways. It is also about narcissism: the attempt of someone to create a reality about themselves that is wildly disconnected from who they are.The movie presents events that occurred in the real lives of Mark (Channing Tatum) and Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo). Both brothers won Olympic gold medals in wrestling at the 1984 games held in Los Angeles. The movie opens with them practicing together. When Dave gets the better of his younger brother, Mark reacts with a cheap blow to the face, making Dave bleed. This action symbolises the relationship that follows: an emotionally vulnerable younger brother, who lashes out at his older brother in the knowledge that his older brother will not hurt him back; an older brother who knows the vulnerabilities of his younger brother, but does not react due to a understanding of his own role as the holder of power in the relationship and his self-definition as benevolent leader.The power dynamics intensify with the introduction of John du Pont, played by Steve Carell. Carell plays du Pont as a slightly disfigured man on the threshold of insanity. Carell could be criticized for overacting the role; however, the performance works when contrasted against the considered Ruffalo and the quietly brooding Tatum.Du Pont is the heir to one of the wealthiest families in the United States and lives in an enormous compound with his mother. His mother disapproves of him, and du Pont is desperate for her approval. We are made to feel that du Pont is a man without any achievements of his own and has bought his way to artificial success. His mother has a large stable of expensive horses, for which she has won various awards. Du Pont attempts to out-do his mother with his own stable of successful wrestlers, and in doing so gain her respect.With the promise of money, stability and a paternal role model, Mark takes up an offer to live in du Pont's commune as part of Team Foxcatcher. At one stage, Dave asks Mark what du Pont gets out of the relationship, to which Mark states that du Pont simply wants to help people and advance America. As the movie progresses we realise that du Pont wants to be the team's guru: their respected life coach who they look to for wisdom and support. Essentially he wants to help himself, by manufacturing a reality to confirm his narcissistic veneer.The movie escalates when Dave joins Mark as the coach of Team Foxcatcher. Dave realises upon arrival that Mark has entered an unhealthy relationship with du Pont: his once idealistic brother has been victim of du Pont's narcissistic rages, and is once more playing the role of the tormented child. However, this time Mark's master's intentions do not contain an concern and true affection.Dave is the true threat to du Pont: he enjoys the true respect of the wrestlers, and has a sense of genuine authority. His authority has been won by achievement and wisdom rather than money. Dave also sees through du Pont's mask more clearly than the others, which is something du Pont both senses and resents.The final stages of the movie see du Pont's mask gradually slipping, and Mark moving back under the comforting shade of his older brother. Upon being revealed as psychologically disfigured to the people that he was desperate to lead, du Pont explodes under the tension, and by killing Dave murders the shame he felt towards his own weakness and ineptitude.Foxcatcher is a magnificent account of power: power between siblings; true versus bought power; and ultimately the power that misplaced shame can have on the life on an individual and those around him.This review is taken from: amateurreviewspace.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Touching Story of a Young Man not Doing Anything,"I walked into the theater wanting and expecting to like Foxcatcher. At first, the slow and stripped-down approach to each moment was interesting, but then I found out that the entire movie would be that. Lingering on the nothingness between events. About a quarter of the way through, I found myself more engaged by the fact that I had weird smelling burps from dinner. I don't know about you, but in my opinion, the journey of a depressed wrestler, a sociopath billionaire, drugs, depression, and obsession should be more interesting that a minor case of mouth farts.Channing Tatum can act. He's been in enough B-movies and needed an acting role he deserved. So, he got cast in this movie. Channing didn't let me down in this department. He, Mark Ruffalo, and Steve Carell gave outstanding acting performances. I was impressed all the way through with how believable Channing Tatum was as an confused, emotional wreck. Mark Ruffalo made me feel for him just for being a nice guy. Steve Carell seriously delivered in his non-comedic role by being a skeevy bastard all the way through, even in harmless conversation. I was stunned by their performances, but that wasn't enough fuel to keep the movie engine going.I'm not one of those guys who go into movies expecting everything to be going at light speed all the way through, though I prefer it. I understand that a movie might take time to show us things, but there's always a reason. The long sequence of the Dave re-entering the ship in Space Odyssey was to create tension. But Foxcatcher meanders and panders to people who think waiting through a slow movie is some kind of accomplishment. You didn't win a prize. You sat on your proud, waxed ass through a movie that didn't edify anyone.The moments where I really was pulled in by what was happening were like needles in a stack of sentient hay that tries to smother the poor needles with its dragging artiness. These few great moments were just brief interruptions of the shots of du Pont's team running, training, sitting, and generally doing what they're meant to do: work. I once listened to a consultant at a paint store explain why she thought the colors in people's houses are important. It was interesting because it was her passion and she explained it with passion. Foxcatcher goes into excruciating detail about wrestling technique, but for all that it does, I still didn't care. This 134 minute jaunt across the pacific beaches of Planet Dull was uneventful and lead up to five minutes of climax. And what a climax it was. A great one. One that happened without warning or logic. It may be a true story, but that's no excuse. It's actually LESS of an excuse. John du Pont was a real guy. Surely someone looked into his motivations at some point. Out of those 134 minutes, I'm going to liberally guess that I enjoyed 20. That's 26.8% good. That's 73.2% drab void-space. That's too damn much boring. That's a failure of storytelling.The movie's tortuously slow progression to a dissatisfying ending expects the audience to enthusiastically bury their faces into its cleavage.

A surprisingly good movie!!!,"I can't believe I left it so late to see this one. I'm also amazed that the story - based on actual events - isn't more widely known. Steve Carell puts in a fine acting performance - it's hard at first to take him seriously in a dramatic role, but he does manage to pull it off very convincingly! Both Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum also put in great performances as brothers with deep rooted sibling rivalry that rolls into adulthood. All the major players in this movie were mesmerizing and the story line will resonate with many people who have grown up with sibling rivalry. You really feel the pain of Channing's character (Mark Schultz). The movie is somewhat disturbing on some levels, but it is really worth watching. You don't have to be an athlete or a fan of wrestling to enjoy the depth of this movie. If you enjoyed Whiplash, then you will enjoy this - it stirs up similar emotions. I thoroughly recommend this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Misses to tell a story,"It feels like a tv production from the seventies. Its very slow, which is a nice way to say boring. Some scenes are more or less irrelevant to the plot. It misses to explain some interesting decisions of the characters so its hard to understand their intent. Characters remain hollow and simple: the champion wants to win, the father wants to protect his family, the crazy millionair is, well, crazy. There are very interesting events and relations between characters, but you don't get enough information about it to really get into it. After all the movie misses to tell the story of these interesting people.Its also inaccurate regarding the real people and events. Just read wikipedia to get a quick impression.

"Foxcatcher works so well because of its strong writing and direction, but also because of how Steve Carell transforms himself into John Du Pont","Foxcatcher is loosely based on the events surrounding multimillionaire E. I. du Pont family heir and wrestling enthusiast John du Pont's 1986 recruitment of two 1984 U. S. Olympic gold medalist wrestlers, Mark Schultz and his older brother David. Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo plays the three leads. Steve Carell completely transforms himself for the role of John Du Pont and his performance are truly breathtaking and award worthy, the make-up and prosthetics used was brilliant, Tatum and Ruffalo also brings terrific performances worthy of nominations but I want to praise Channing Tatum as it was interesting to see him in such a serious role which I am not that used to but I loved it. It's also quite remarkable how Tatum and Ruffalo had to learn wrestle and have that serious training, plus that most of the fights aren't fake, everything is real.The film is produced and directed by Bennett Miller with a script by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman. Greig Fraser was the cinematographer and I have nothing but good things about his work in this movie, the way he shot and just captured everything, brilliant. I loved the sets and locations they picked for the movie. The film's visual style and tone are top notch.But Foxcatcher wouldn't be this great if it wasn't for Bennett Miller's direction and the screenplay, I think the strict work place of not joking around between scenes helped make the atmosphere more serious and the actors going all in into the dramatic part of their performances, as it's based on a true story and the characters should be treated with respects, which I think they were perfectly but I'm also new to the story and people.Though Foxcatcher is only loosely based, it's still a very great film, perfect even. But dont watch it expecting everything is true to what really happened. With phenomenal acting performances, strong writing and direction. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An unsettling look at the underbelly of egotistical quests for validation,"An unsettling look at the underbelly of egotistical quests for validation, Foxcatcher is a model journey of building tension and quiet rage. From the onset, the core trio of actors of Carell, Tatum, and Ruffalo bring life to their characters in ways that only they can. Both Tatum and Carell are absolutely electric in these iconic performances. While this movie is excellent in almost every way, the acting is clearly the crown jewel of this production.That being said, Foxcatcher is masterful from a technical perspective as it strips itself down to the bare bones, allowing its subtleties and nuances to echo loud. The scoring is minimal yet striking when utilized. The sound production is intimate and haunting. The cinematography is deliberate yet subdued. All of this contributes to the focused purpose of creating an atmosphere of uneasiness. Overall, this film is cohesively geared towards its climax, which perfectly releases its ever-mounting anxiety.

"Bereft of energy, I wanted to like this film like most others but couldn't.","When ""Foxcatcher"" debuted, there was a lot of talk about it being an Oscar-contender--for both best picture as well as acting awards. However, after finally getting to see it, I was shocked. Was this the same great film? It certainly didn't seem great. It seemed, amazingly, rather boring--and it's hard to imagine this considering what actually occurred.First I will talk about what I liked in the film. The wrestling looked really good. I wrestled for several years and would know if they wrestling sequences were crap--they weren't and I appreciate the shape the actors got in to do the film.Now, what I didn't like. I have rarely seen a film more bereft of energy than this one. Heck, compared to this an Ingmar Bergman film looks like a Disney picture!! Stark music, stark cinematography and actors who are practically mute make this a very hard film to energize the audience. Plus, often events in the film seemed incomplete--as if you were supposed to know exactly what happened to Mark Schultz in the 1988 Olympics or what motivated Du Pont to commit murder. Instead, it's all a very bland cipher. Additionally, the historical accuracy of the film and timeline are often wrong and could have been better.Overall, a huge disappointment--much of which is because of all the hoopla about the film but also because it was so lifeless and dull and didn't need to be.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Americana notion of Regicide,"True story. True experience. It is very hard to achieve this level of authenticity that still feels larger than life. Bennett Miller, director known for his perfectionism and slow deliverance, doesn't try to mask his motives. He is very clear about the story goals.The patricide. Killing a ""father"". Breaking off. It is the film of Fathers and Sons, for them and about them.""People who don't have fathers tend to have two strong qualities. One, they tend to feel that anything is possible and the other is an unrelenting anxiety and insecurity"", Miller pointed out in one of the post-release movie interviews. The film raises big questions that speak to all of us. We are all somebody's children and we all have to make our own lives despite of them. How hard it is to reconcile integrity with the need to earn a living? How hard (or necessary) is to break off from your family in order to find your true identity? Can you really escape the clutches of your heritage? What hides behind the incredulous world of the rich benefactors, the fathers of ""the greatest nation in the world"" and their protégés?Deep-dive, subtext, allegorical aspects are there. The facts are there; wealth, class, entitlement. It is all there. But this film is more intelligent and subtle than its elements. It is not trying to point at what is obvious or solve the crime. It doesn't tell you what to think. Instead, it is looking at the roots of these people and it allows you to determine who these people really are without laying it to your lap. And it does so in a very quiet, painful way  From the very first scene in the film, introducing Dave and Mark, Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team, the wordless expression of their relationship, naturally intimate physicality of wrestling communicates the love between the brothers. Straight to the bone, austere, tough love. Dave Shultz, the older brother and a father figure, is played by Mark Ruffalo. His character brings warmth and humanity in the mostly inhumane lives of professional wrestlers. It is a hard task and Ruffalo's performance is restrained yet deep, depicting to the last atom the complexity of a unique brotherly love. He is, also, the black mirror for Dupont, the ""patron"" and a self-imposed father figure. By being himself, dedicated and caring coach and brother whom everyone looks up to, Dave is unwillingly sending the hurtful message to Dupont: this is what you will never be. Not with all your money and all your power. You cannot buy love, respect nor talent. Rough fact- easy to say, much harder to learn.Channing Tatum plays Mark Shultz, introverted emotionally troubled wrestling prodigy.Portrayed as a big gorilla that speaks physical language fluently, yet verbally and emotionally is on a level of a 5-year old. Great performance,though exaggerated to the verge of a parody Wrestling is not supposed to feel ""real"" or ""natural"", I mean these men are treated as highly- trained cage animals and their struggles are incomprehensible to the most of the humans. They are not really expected to have weaknesses or breakdowns as the rest of us. Still, Tatum painted this character with many shades and sensibility of a broken child in need of a strong paternal presence. We never doubt his weak spot or his fragility. This is where Dupont finds him...or they find each other. In spite of his wealth and power status, Dupont suffers from the same deprivation, or depravity in his case. They are both driven by the same raw ambition to reach greatness at any cost. Vanesa Redgrave is brilliant in a role of Dupont's controlling aloof mother, an old-money heiress who drives the last nail in her son's fragile ego.For some, the most surprising element in the film was the comedy star Steve Carell. Wtf, Steve Carrell starring in heavy drama?! Yes, all comedians have dark side, and yes, they can be really, really scary. After watching it, I can't imagine anyone but Carell in this role. His comedic sensibility, a serious committed talent and incredibly specific work found a place for Dupont's bizarre persona, and the right attitude. Even that big artificial nose and over-the-top prosthetic serve the performance legibly- an excuse to look down upon others, to distance himself even more from the ""regular"" people.If you couldn't care less about the wrestling that makes majority scenes in the film (like I don't), or if you can't sympathize with the characters that hard and impenetrable, you will feel what they are feeling, and you will empathize with their struggle. Wrestling functions as a perfect metaphor. It is the most primal of sports, the one in which you bend another person to your will. Literally. The story of power and manipulation never gets old. Dave's complex relationship with his ""surrogate father"" Dupont communicates much more than misplaced egos of its protagonists. It portrays generations and generations of Duponts and Schultz'. I would dare to say even -one whole nation. No wonder it took years to edit and sleep on it in order for Miller to find the film's true voiceIt is a very quiet subtle voice that gets under your skin slowly and gradually it becomes impossible to ignore. A lot of surplus was cut off so the voice of the film becomes this meticulous and precise- a time well used.The final result?Haunting, insightful and intelligent film that will probably stay with you long after you finish watching it It is felt more that watched. Heavy stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Material perhaps better suited to a documentary,"There are some real-life stories that just cannot be made into interesting movies. This is one of them.Labelled as a ""character study"", it focuses on Mark and Dave Schultz, two wrestlers, Olympic gold-medal winners and their ""mentor"", billionaire John Du Pont.The problem is that the first half of the movie is dominated by Mark and John, two very dry, silent men, with assorted personality disorders. Watching these two moving in chilling, beautiful settings, hardly speaking to each other is not my idea of entertainment.The other two main characters of the movie are John's disapproving mother and Dave, the only outgoing, warm personality.In very sketchy psychological analysis, we should understand that John Du Pont had serious issues with mommy and became a weird, lonely recluse because of that. We should also understand that Mark had issues with big brother Dave (and probably with the whole world at large) and that is why his character is a sullen moron.The soundtrack also takes itself very seriously, so you get the impression of watching a very long wake - and have the same fun.I give one point each to the male leads, who definitely did a great job, but that's as far as it gets.

Exceptional,"Exceptional fact-based drama by workmanlike Bennett Miller, who directed Capote and Moneyball previously. Concerning the murder of a wrestling coach by millionaire heir John du Pont, the film examines what led to the tragedy. The major theme here is wealth and class in America, and it's one of the best films about that that has ever been made. The three major characters, du Pont and two brothers who both won Olympic gold medals, Mark and David Schultz, are beautifully written and plaid by Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo respectively. Carell is a product of pure, American royalty, but having grown up relatively isolated from actual society, he's a giant weirdo. Tatum, the younger brother, lives only for wrestling and doesn't have much besides his older brother outside of that. When du Pont invites him to wrestle under his tutelage, he jumps at the opportunity. Ruffalo is content in his life with his loving family and at first refuses to join the team, though du Pont is very insistent. Of course, he can buy anything, and eventually does, spending an undisclosed amount of money to bring Ruffalo in. The action upsets Tatum, and the whole situation starts to go to Hell. The film is very cold, and quite slow moving, but I was deeply interested throughout. One of the films of the year, no doubt.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"an eerie drama about weird obsession and the ""American dream""","For a lot of people, but especially athletes, we're told that going for a respective native country is a very admirable, noble, Go-For-It aim. And for Americans, it's the ultimate sort of hope, at least in conventional terms - being the ""Best"" and representing the country in places like, say, the Olympics. This is what John Du Pont (a mostly unrecognizable Steve Carrell) tells to the young, impressionable Olympic gold medal winner Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum, recognizable as can be), that his ambitions should be directed to get the gold - again - for America, as it is. Schultz is impressed by Du Pont, if nothing else by the attention of someone who is, as Mark sees, a super wealthy man (one of the biggest wealth-areas in the country), and wants to join him in his quest for Olympic glory in 1988 along with his brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) who is not quite as enthusiastic, mostly due to his family/current work commitments. No matter, Mark will do it for John, this will work... for a little while...Foxcatcher is a helluva piece of work, mostly in how director Bennett Miller stages his scenes and lets them unfold with his cast. This isn't a film with urgent line-a-minute drama. On the contrary this moves more like a slow-burn dramatic film from the 70's (think, I don't know, Fat City or something in terms of tone), and he spends a lot of time just watching his actors move around settings, looking at objects and pictures in the Du Pont home, the horses in the barns and fields, the wrestlers moving their bodies this way and that (like apes at times, even the brothers, which makes Du Pont's comment at one cruel moment - ""You ungrateful ape"" - to a character all the more brutal and spot-on). There's a lot of watching and waiting, and all the time, surrounded by stuffed birds, desperate, lonely men, and eerie, weird vibes, it makes for a film that us uncompromising.All three lead actors pull in solid work here. Tatum has been getting amazing notices from critics across the board, and this is his best work as a dramatic actor (personally I still prefer his comedic work or Magic Mike, but that's neither here nor there), in large part because he is there to react and listen. He doesn't have to emote in LOUD ways, if that makes sense. His most intense scene is in a hotel room and is mostly in shadows, so it's really about the internal space this character inhabits. And it's a compelling, interesting one: here is a man who is an Olympic champion, yet without this opportunity from Du Pont he would be still eating Ramen noodles and few prospects. Tatum goes for this uncertainty, then certainty, then going-off-the-rails, and then doom and gloom, with a quiet quality that comes through extremely well.Ruffalo has an easier role to play - the more ""normal"" character here, who has his most pressing conflicts when dealing with his younger brother, or having to basically lie to a camera crew doing a propaganda documentary on Du Pont as a wrestling coach - but still is fascinating to watch for how much emotion he puts into a 'straight' man in awkward or tense moments like those wrestling matches or the prep. He may be underrated come awards time when Tatum and Carrell get the bulk of the limelight, but he is no slouch here in the slightest.And Carrell. Jesus. In a way there can be a big criticism of his performance, or maybe it's just down to how the writers present him (one of them from Miller's Capote, the other from Something Wild), that he's one-dimensional, or not that 'deep' exactly in his enclosed, rich weirdo. He really doesn't 'change' so much during the film. Things happen around him and he is not the most predictable Character (with a capital C) as he may be benevolent one moment, and slap your face the next or get mad you didn't put the 50-caliber machine gun on the tank (yep, that happens, that's how wealthy the Du Ponts were), but he is pretty much the same sort of ""off"" kind of crazy from start to finish. It's just that by the end, his crazy finally comes un-spooled, whereas before it's more about the package of this man. (What's the line in the movie Speed? 'Poor people are crazy, I'm eccentric.')But all the same, Carrell inhabits this guy, and makes his loneliness and (maybe) latent homosexuality or whatever it is about him that gets him engaged about wrestling to a fullness. I felt repulsed, intrigued, confused, scared by this guy, who lurks around his mansion and comes to these wrestling practices - and at one point wrestles himself, albeit in a fixed match which he may or may not know about - like a vampire. Indeed how Schultz comes to this man's premises, becomes ingratiated, it's only a wonder the man doesn't get more people under his wing. Actually he does, under the guise of still having a lot of wealth and being able to do whatever he wants. If we ask an actor in such a quietly towering role to just be truthful to being a freak, Carrell is Freak of the Year.Foxcatcher at times may be a little long, or a little ambling in its pacing, but it all builds up. By the time it comes to that climax, it's shocking not so much for what it is but how inevitable and, maybe, preventable it could have been. The stakes in this movie are about mental wellness, attraction, and being enveloped in guises and dreams for something 'more'. It's presented like an All-American nightmare; one wonders if this is on a double-bill with the recent Nightcrawler if some would want to just give up on the promises for a better society.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

winning,This is a story I was not familiar one. It is about John E. Dupont and his quest to come from under the scrutiny of his family and find love and approval from his mother. He does this by seeking to build and coach the ultimate wrestling team. The Schultz brothers were already known in wrestling circles but DuPont gave them the platform to get better. What happens in the course of the movie is interesting. It shows how money and all the material things can give a person the inner grit to win. Steve Carrell portrays Dupont in the perfect manner and is break form his comedic type he usually portrays.

Dark story centered around wrestling told by excellent performances,"There is not much talking but this disturbing story based on real events is told in a very compelling way.The central characters are two brothers who won Olympic gold medals in wrestling and a multi-millionaire heir to the Du Pont empire, portrayed brilliantly by Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo and Steve Carell. The younger brother is fully focused on his training for the next Olympics, 1988 Seoul, and is excited to accept an offer of the eccentric philanthropist to train at his state-of-the-art facility. It is an opportunity for him to get out of the shadow of his older brother who was always in charge. The motives of John Du Pont are slowly coming into focus through his increasingly disturbing behaviour conveyed by Steve Carell in a haunting fashion.This is not an action-packed movie but the storytelling is real, with just a glimpse into the world of wrestlers. Superb acting by Channing Tatum in a very different role than his usual. He does not have much dialog but he makes up for it in a lot of blank stares. And it took me a while to even recognize Steve Carell as he flawlessly portrayed the slimy and cold narcissist. A very comical scene when Du Pont coaches his protégé to pronounce an introduction of his benefactor as ""Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist"".The tension builds up and soon you come to expect that it would blow up. In the end there is a climax (I will not reveal it in case you don't know the story).I give it 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A really dark, disturbing and extremely ambiguous film!","'FOXCATCHER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed biographical thriller about two Olympic champion brothers, who are asked by an eccentric multimillionaire to be a part of his future wrestling team. It stars Steve Carell as the multimillionaire, named John E. du Pont, and Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo as the wrestling brothers, Mark and David Schultz. It was directed by Bennett Miller; who also directed another critically acclaimed 'true crime' thriller (in 2005) called 'CAPOTE', as well as another critically acclaimed sports film (in 2011) called 'MONEYBALL'. It was written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman (Futterman also wrote 'CAPOTE') and it's based on the tragic true events; which surrounded the lives of the Schultz brothers and John E. du Pont. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics and it was nominated for five Academy Awards; including Best Director, Best Actor (Carell), Best Supporting Actor (Ruffalo) and Best Original Screenplay. It's a really dark, disturbing and extremely ambiguous film; I enjoyed it quite a bit.Mark and David Schultz (Tatum and Ruffalo) both won gold medals for wrestling, in the 1984 Olympics. Four years later Dave lived happily with his wife (Sienna Miller) and kids, but Mark was relatively depressed and poor (despite his gold medal and past fame). So when Mark is suddenly contacted by a multimillionaire, named John E. du Pont (Carell), and asked to come stay at his estate in order to help train a wrestling team for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mark happily takes him up on his offer (as he's paid very well in return). Du Pont asks Mark to invite his brother along as well, but Dave doesn't want to leave his family. A strange bond forms between Mark and du Pont as Mark is eager to win another gold medal and du Pont sees an opportunity to become a respected wrestling coach, as well as finally win the approval of his overbearing mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Things don't go as planned and tragedy strikes.The real Mark Schultz served as a consultant for much of the film's production but when he first saw the completed movie, he ranted on Twitter about how much he hated it. Critics had pointed out that the relationship shown in the film, between his character and du Pont's, has 'homosexual undertones'. This is what upset Schultz the most; but he later apologized for his harsh words and now says he loves the movie. I think there is some homosexuality, implied in the film, but like everything else, in the movie, it's very ambiguous. That's what I kind of like most about it; it's very dark and creepy but nothing is spelled out for the viewer. I think almost everything, in the film, is left up to an individual's interpretation. Miller has said he was trying to show a ""narrative of a cult""; with the characters and situations being studied in the movie. I think it's all very fascinating and well made. It's maybe a little too slow paced and seemingly uneventful, at times, but it does have a powerful payoff. Carell really did an amazing job transforming himself into the role; and he does deserve all of the acclaim he's been getting. Tatum is pretty good as well but he seems more naturally fitting to his role; so it doesn't seem like it was as big of a stretch for him to do. Ruffalo is good, like always, but no better than he normally is, in my opinion. It's an all around well made film. Probably not one of the very best of the year, but a pretty good one all the same.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/O9KTvaLDibs",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A powerful experience that winds us in a knot,"Based on a true story that made headlines in the late 1990s, Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher is a superb psychological drama that features Oscar-worthy performances from Channing Tatum as an emotionally repressed Olympic gold medal-winning wrestler, Mark Ruffalo as his supportive brother, and a barely recognizable Steve Carell, playing a scion of one of America's wealthiest families. With a screenplay by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, the film brings to life the tragic consequences of an emotionally dependent relationship built on psychological control and delivers it with relentless tension.Three years after winning a gold-medal in wrestling at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) has lost none of his physical attributes but much of his self esteem. Poor and unrecognized, he lives alone in an apartment, eats fast foods, and ekes out a living giving lectures to elementary grade school students. His brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also an Olympic champion wrestler, has provided much of the emotional support Mark requires but now lives in Colorado with his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller) and their two children, Danielle (Samara Lee) and Alexander (Jackson Fraser). Mark's life is rebooted, however, when he receives a call from John du Pont (Steve Carell), a wrestling enthusiast and a member of the one of the wealthiest families in America.Du Pont asks Mark to come to his 800-acre estate in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania to train a wrestling team capable of winning gold at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. The eccentric du Pont, who lost his parents at a young age, lives with his elderly mother (Vanessa Redgrave), a horse breeder who looks down at wrestling as a ""low"" activity. Convinced by the huge sum of money he is offered and eager to emerge from his brother's shadow, Mark readily agrees and is flown first class to Pennsylvania to help in his mentor's stated goal of training a winning Olympics wrestling team and maintaining America's prestige. Du Pont has something to prove to himself and tells Mark, ""Coach is father. Coach is mentor. Coach has great power on an athlete's life."" Though Mark is happy living in the estate's opulent guest house, he wants his brother to come to Pennsylvania and bring his family, but Dave is unwilling to uproot his family and break his commitment to his job. Asked to give John personal wrestling lessons and perhaps perform other duties that are hinted at but not mentioned, the relationship between the teacher and his student begins a downward spiral when Mark is offered and begins to use Cocaine. With a military tank on his estate for sport and a gun in his pocket that he fires into the ceiling during a practice session, to say that du Pont is strange is like saying vampires prefer their meat slightly undercooked.As Mark's physical abilities on the mat begin to deteriorate, DuPont calls him an ""ungrateful ape"" slapping him across the face. Out of concern for his brother, Dave is enticed to come to the estate, but an undercurrent of suppressed emotion and resentment re-escalates the tension, leading to an unforeseen tragedy. Though understated and deliberately paced, Foxcatcher is a powerful experience that winds us in a knot then challenges us to make sense of what is left unsaid.Though the film does not have an overt political agenda, it illuminates the consequences of distorted values arising from a feeling of entitlement. du Pont could easily stand for the mindset of the privileged few who think that power and love are commodities they can buy on the open market and expect the rest of us to defer to them obsequiously. Unfortunately, many do.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic Performance in a brilliant movie,At the time of writing this review I have seen the brilliant Foxcatcher twice and it does not lack what Bennett Millers previous two films had.The directors trademarks can be seen all over throughout the film. There is a dreaded sense of buildup through each scene that concludes in the most unlikeliest of endings. The three main actors here give sensational performances particularly Steve Carell as the terrifying John Du Pont. up to now Carell has done solid work in the Comedy side of things but it seems with this mesmerizing performance we may see more good things to come from Carell.As for Channing Tatum hes pulled quite possibly the biggest surprise of the year with his performance. Say what you will about Ruffalo and Carells excellent performances but this is without a doubt Tatums movie. Its a shame he hasn't been recognized by the awards season for his fantastic work in Foxcatcher like Ruffalo and Carell have.Foxcatcher is undoubtedly one of the finest movies made this year. It isn't quite a cinematic triumph i was hoping it would be but its a movie that needs to be scene whether or not you are familiar with the DuPont story.9/10,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A deeply chilling and disturbing tone poem of a film.,"I can't remember when a non-horror film has made me feel so uncomfortable and tense for it's whole length. It's a quiet film. Slow. Subtle. Almost dreamlike. Much of what happens occurs without dialogue. But there is always a heavy feeling of doom floating over it's sad characters.And what a fascinating bunch of characters. Based on real people, I found myself wondering if a novelist could come up with a trio so laden with emotional and social meaning.John DuPont (Steve Carrell) is the mega millionaire who is vaguely 'off', and clearly fighting mental demons. He dreams of being a wrestling coach and somehow coaching America to glory, so he essentially buys a now down on his luck ex-champion Mark Shultz (Channing Tatum) to come and wrestle for him. The two men have a complicated and tricky relationship. There is admiration, father and son bonding, resentment and even seemingly unspoken sexual attraction. But neither man is able to communicate about almost any of it, or deal with any of the feelings themselves.The third member of the triumvirate is Shultz's older brother Dave (Mark Rufflao). Less of a painful introvert than his brother, Dave has been Mark's coach and only friend. They have a complex filial relationship, captured beautifully by director Bennett Miller and writers Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye in the lengthy, almost wordless opening scene where Dave leads Mark through a training session. Just as messy, if healthier, than Mark's relationship with DuPont, we see in the scene the love, admiration, jealousy and rivalry that exists between these two quiet men.Now Dave joins Mark at DuPont's vast compound to be 'assistant coach' to DuPont's 'coach', which is deeply bizarre as it quickly becomes clear that Dave knows 10 times as much about both wresting and leadership as DuPont ever will. As we watch a frustrated DuPont quietly head into an ever darker place the tension grows as thick as in a Polanski film, and even the film's conclusion provides little in the way of release. I headed back out into the night with a knot still in my stomach. It's the rare film that can pull me into that kind of claustrophobic space of madness and loss.A word has to be given to the tremendous work done by all three actors, along with Vanessa Redgrave as DuPont's mother -- unforgettable in a role that only gives her a few minutes of screen time. While Carrell has gotten the lion's share of the kudos (and he is terrific, reinventing himself as a purely dramatic actor) both Tatum and Ruffalo also do world class work here, creating inarticulate men who express with their eyes and bodies what they don't quite know how to express with words.This is not a 'fun' movie, but it is one that you can feel deeply, and end up pondering the nature of madness, success, the American dream, family in a way too few American films do.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
the decadent rich,"An isolated, pathetic heir convinces an Olympic wrestling star to utilise his wealth and resources in return for some reflected glory. When the flaws of the mentor seep into the mentored, the star's brother gets involved, with tragic consequences. Carrell has rightly been lauded for his beguiling performance of a deeply damaged individual whose access to power allows him to corrupt others. Looking small wandering around his vast property, having arid, brittle exchanges with his emotionless mother, he is both pitiful and sinister. Tatum also nails the immature, needy and therefore vulnerable younger brother. But it is Ruffalo who impresses most as the most conflicted character in the narrative. He wants to look after his brother, gain access to the benefits the mentor offers, and maintain a relationship with the mentor while keeping him at a safe distance. The complexities of all that are brilliantly captured by Ruffalo, who is fast taking character acting to new levels. E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman fashion an engrossing, tight narrative that crackles till it breaks. Based on a true story that it is best to know little or nothing about before watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Camel hump can't get the family man wrestler so he settles for the half-wit brother. Camel hump takes half-wit back to Delaware to the big du Pont estate 'Foxcatcher'. Here camel hump's mother lurks around when not playing with her horses. Spooky mom doesn't care much for camel hump nose and little half-wit wrestling and playing around. So camel hump gets family man wrestler to move to Foxcatcher. Spooky mom dies, camel hump nose snuffs out family man, half-wit develops a weird eating disorder and goes cage fighting. The end! Two hours of movie and all you see Steve Carell walk around cross-eyed due to the camel hump placed on his nose, some men running around a room, Vanessa Redgrave looking like the sheeted dead, and Mark Ruffalo smiling a lot. This is a boring movie!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Dark And Powerful Film,"I must be completely honest and admit that I didn't know the Schultz brothers story at all before watching Foxcatcher, so it was a completely clean slate for me.The obvious things to note are the performances from Carell, Tatum and Ruffalo. All are brilliant in their own way. Carell as the eccentric billionaire who becomes more and more haunting as the film develops. Tatum as the talented wrestler who struggles to step outside of his brother's (Ruffalo) shadow. And Ruffalo as the older brother who tries to hold down a family life while coaching in Team Foxcatcher. Carell and Vanessa Redgrave also have a couple of scenes together which excellently highlight their fractious relationship and point towards why DuPont is like he is.I found the film quite a slow burner, but far from boring. You could sense a dark undertone the whole way through the film, and tensions building. I did feel the ending was a bit abrupt and maybe the ramifications of Carell's actions weren't explored to the extent that they might have been.The score is sensational, and almost tells a story in itself as you sense the movie taking a more macabre tone towards the end.All in all, a very solid psychological drama, hitting all the harder knowing that it is based on a true story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Foxcatcher"" is good and is led brilliantly by Steve Carrell's performance, but it doesn't seem to deserve the nominations it's getting.","""Foxcatcher""'s true story and ensemble both seem to have a cold and frosty shade of white over them and the film generally has that too, both literally and metaphorically. Bennett Miller's direction reflects this, and the several chilling shots he captures, for me made my experience within that screen.The film's true story follows Mark Schulz as he trains to win the Gold medal for Wrestling at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, with the help of the multimillionaire John Du Pont. As usual difficult questions are posed and ""Foxcatcher"" again asks us a question, as so many films do, about America, and as Erin Whitney and Matthew Jacobs point out in their review for the Huffington Post, it is one that acts as ""a distant horror story for the 1% percent"". The film comments heavily on this with the multimillionaire Du Pont as the man at the fore front of these comments understandably. For example Du Pont almost seems to have the Olympic Wrestling Schulz brothers simply because they form part of his trophy cabinet, as objects to play with at his disposal, which acts as an explanation for the films ending.But the compelling true story and character study, particularly in regards to John Du Pont (played by Steve Carrell), is the films strength and a fascinating one at that. It will probably be unknown to my generation. But as usual the story told here is different to the one that actually happened and on reading what did happen it seems that the film's director, Bennett Miller, missed out on several details that could have made the story that much better. For example, although the film does pick up on Du Pont's descent into madness to an extent, it doesn't take the opportunity to make it obvious and although I appreciate subtlety I think it would have been even better otherwise. In the true story, Du Pont for example thought that his horses were sending him messages from Mars and he also frequently asked his wrestlers to check his attic for ghosts. This really would have been a test for Carrell and could have contributed to an already stellar performance by him.The film though is propelled forward by its performances that branch out past what these actors are typically known for, Channing Tatum (playing Mark Schulz) and Mark Ruffalo (playing Dave Schulz) for example. But it is Steve Carrell's performance that manages to break through the story and again what roles he is generally known for, and the hole that he leaves allows for Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo to follow through it, and therefore still deserved of the praise they have received from others. These performances ultimately stop ""Foxcatcher"" from being defined as good for its story alone. Bennett Miller's direction is good. As I mentioned several of the shots he captured really made my cinematic experience, the best of those featuring Du Pont releasing his horses out into the wild. We see Du Pont's dark silhouette with his hands raised, urging his horses to flee and it looked great on screen.Although its story is good and its ensemble, headed up by Carrell, is brilliant ""Foxcatcher"" doesn't bring anything new to the table, and although I didn't expect it to, I did expect it to do more than it did. It's a vague expression to say that and I'm lost for words really in how to describe why I'm not rating the film better, but it's almost as if, thinking about it, the film was saved by its ensemble performances which will explain why so many will have it in their best films of 2015 lists come the end of the year. Ultimately, ""Foxcatcher"" is a good film and worth seeing, but not one that lives up to the hype surrounding it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

And it depicts how males can fall into or reject unhealthy relationships with other men. These relationships can be described as: Brother, Son, Coach, Mentor (Teacher).It also shows how inherited wealth can rob a person of authentic achievement. And these particular people may then set about to become authentic, goal oriented individuals without going through the school of ""hard knocks"".

The Wolf of Olympic Wrestling,"8.4 of 10.

In short, you get a look into their true, closeted lives. Of course, you get a look at the athletes lives too, but that alone would make it an ordinary film at best.Definitely a sports film that will be enjoyed by more than sports fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Baring that in mind this movie was something that I recommend skipping no matter the alternative. I wish I could tell you about acting but there was none, the few parts that had speech took all of three seconds and the rest of it was a blur of pointless events. If they wanted to make a documentary about a wrestler why didn't they just say so? Making people waste time like this should be against the law. Now on to plot points, there were none. Wrestler is coached by brother, he leaves brother to try on his own, fails, trains with brother again, and then leaves. That's it, that's the whole movie. This is one of those things where someone will try to tell you that a blank canvas is art, don't be fooled it's just blank canvas. 1/10 simply because there was no lower marks.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Two excellent performances highlight a great film,"Foxcatcher is your typical Oscar contender. It's based on an extraordinary true story. It has a bunch of very accomplished actors, many of whom are performing at the top of their game. It has that central performance which anchors the movie. And, crucially, it's quite fun to watch. Put it next to the other contenders that have just been announced, and this Bennett Miller film fits in very nicely.The story is definitely extraordinary, and hard to believe that it happened less than thirty years ago. Mark and David Schultz, who both won gold medals in wrestling at the 1984 Olympics, were recruited by reclusive millionaire John DuPont to train the next generation of Olympic wrestlers at his purpose-built training centre. Known as Team Foxcatcher, it was an unlikely alliance with even unlikelier circumstances.You don't need me to tell you how all of this ended – a quick Google search will do a much better job of that – but I can tell you that a very solid job was done of bringing it to the screen. Bennett Miller is a director with proved success in biopics – Capote and Moneyball are both brilliant – and he continues in that vein with this. He's very good at making sure he doesn't take too many creative liberties, letting the truth of the story take precedence.But when you look back on Miller's past successes, what he does best is get excellent performances from the unlikeliest of actors and, with Foxcatcher, he gives that privilege to Steve Carell. Arguably one of the best comedy actors of the modern era, Carell was a massive gamble for this role, but he is fantastic. The prosthetic nose and hairpiece already help to strip away any preconceptions, but it is a performance so far removed from his previous work that you can't help but be impressed. DuPont was the richest man in America at the time, but he was also a loner. Living in the shadow of his mother (a small but significant and vicious cameo from Vanessa Redgrave), he saw Team Foxcatcher as his way of getting acceptance. The way he goes about trying to achieve that is funny (in a twisted way), but Carell plays it straight. There's no deliberate attempt to amuse, and neither does it happen accidentally. Every time he appears on screen, Carell makes you uncomfortable, especially as his power increases.The other two points of this triangle casting are a mixed bag. On the one hand, we have Mark Ruffalo, who is the MVP. While Carell is the one getting all the media attention, it's Ruffalo who quietly steals the show with a very understated and emotional performance. He is the moral compass of the movie and, like so many great performers before him, he manages to express deep, complex emotions just by shrugging his shoulders or laughing nervously. He is definitely up there as one of the best character actors of this generation, and a joy to watch. Channing Tatum, I'm not as sure of. He is a good actor, don't get me wrong, and he isn't bad in this. In fact, he surprised me with the maturity of the performance. But, the truth is, he's a good actor but not a great one; and as Mark Schultz, who the film is following most, it needed somebody who could match Carell and Ruffalo. And he couldn't. I sat there and kept wondering how different the film would have been if it was Tom Hardy up there. Similar builds, similar intensity, but Hardy is far above Tatum when it comes to acting chops. But we got Tatum, and he holds his own, so fair enough.What people do need to know is that Foxcatcher isn't a film about wrestling; there is, of course, some wrestling in it, but it's there as a narrative device. In fact, one of the best scenes of the film is a wrestling 'match' between the Schultz brothers. It's a five-minute scene where the older brother (Ruffalo) is training the younger one (Tatum), but there is clearly some tension. There are barely more than four or five words spoken, but we pretty much learn everything we need to know about the sibling relationship in that five minutes. Tremendous. At its core, Foxcatcher is about two things. The want and need for power; and the consequences of living in someone else's shadow. Foxcatcher has rightfully got some great press, primarily because of Steve Carell's performance, but I don't think it's quite there as an Oscar-winning movie. Of the three leads, Ruffalo is the one most deserving of an award (and he's nominated for Best Supporting Actor), but there are other actors more deserving. Still, this is a really engaging, dramatic thriller which does justice to an extraordinary true story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Performances Performances Performances,"Foxcatcher is a slow burn. In fact it's a really slow paced film, but at no point was I bored. That is because I think this film may be the single best acted film of the year. It's a shame that all 3 of the leads will likely be left out come Oscar night. Not only does Steve Carell give an uncharacteristically chilling performance, but Channing Tatum is an absolute revelation.Without reading too much about this film and the stunning events that unravel, you can tell from the trailers that it's a pretty tragic tale. It's about two brothers who are world class wrestlers but are unable to make the next step to Olympic greatness without the resources needed. Here's where the ever-so-creepy John Du Pont comes in and gives them a home, wealth, and the training necessary to win gold. The question then becomes why does this man care so much about these kids to spend tremendous amounts of time and money. Well the answer is that this man is just crazy. Or just strange for that matter. Carell's voice makes the character that much more disturbing. Du Pont completely changes the way Mark Shultz (Tatum) looks at life. In a way he brainwashes all these kids to do things his way and only his way.The most understated part of this film was Mark Ruffalo. Both the writing and his delivery of the subtle lines are just impeccable. His arc is both depressing and eye opening. A man this devoted and this engraved in his craft should never have to go through some of that stuff. With that being said I don't think anyone goes through more than Tatum's character. There is a particular scene where he is freaking out in his hotel room and pretty much hitting rock bottom. That's when I saw the once joke of an actor turn into an Academy Award level performer. You can see his dedication to this role in the pain he puts himself through in just that scene alone.Sure, the film can be a really slow freight train at times but it's material gets more interesting as the film progresses. And the performances are just perfect all around.+Tatum is a revelation+Carell's transformation+Ruffalo's understated performance+Direction & writing-Can be really slow at times8.1/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worst movie in history,"This is the worst, most boring, obsolete, stupid and pointless movie ever in the history of cinematography. I have no doubt that the real story of the horrific events involving the Schultz brothers and du Ponte is a tragic but very deep and powerful story. This movie however does absolutely nothing to tell the story, never ever in all of it has one decent conversation in it, there is no plot, not story line, no reason for what occurs in the movie is ever given, nothing ever happens, the relationships are never explored, explained, or even dwelled into in the slightest manner. The whole movie is a series of useless, empty shots of photo frames, picturesque cottages, man touching each other and that is it.

It is as a movie, absolutely pointless, unnecessary, dead boring and just a plain waste of money, time and film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Grade: A-,"Foxcatcher is an interesting examination of human psychology and male dominance. With a cast of actors who are known for lending comedic talents far more often than anything else, it was easy to get buzz early on about the film, but would it pay off?The movie begins with a very clear message; Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), an Olympic wrestling champion, has nothing. He has gotten to the top, and doesn't know what to do with himself anymore. On top of that, he is living in his brother's shadow (played by Mark Ruffalo). His brother actually has a life after the Olympics- he has a family to take care of, he is more social, and he owns a wrestling gym. Mark, on the other hand, only has wrestling. So when he gets a call from John du Pont, it's a chance for Mark to step into the spotlight again.Steve Carell is the one to see in this movie; his role is transformative, both physically and psychologically. It is rare to see a character with so many different complexes- blind patriotism, mother issues, fame- and Steve Carell does it so well, almost all behaviorally. His facial expressions, despite being rather minimalist, speak volumes. He has his nose high in the air much of the film, and does impulsive, violent things. What's scary is that he seems in control at all times, though we go on to see that mentally, he is not in control, just fighting for it.Even though he gives the best performance in the film, and his career-best, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo also give great performances. Channing Tatum, much like Steve Carell, relies more on physical acting than anything else. His character puts himself through a lot of pain to get to the top, and it clearly has an effect on him, but he doesn't want to vocalize it. He doesn't want to depend on anybody, but he falls for du Pont as soon as he gets the call, and the story begins to weave a dark web of dependency.Enter Mark Ruffalo, Mark's brother, the established family man and wrestling champion, who begins to see what is happening to his brother Mark. He wants to look out for him, he wants to make sure his brother is taken care of, but he knows something is off with du Pont, and it might cost his family to save his brother. He tries to hang it all in the balance. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role, and has transformed so much physically for the role. David Schultz is a man we can respect, and we fear for him, because he may be in a little bit over his head.The movie relies so much on the strength of its performances that, sadly, it doesn't offer much else. The movie is so restrained, so much invested in the psychology of its players, that you'll be left remembering the characters, but walk away having learned nothing. Films don't need to teach a lesson or message, but there doesn't seem to be much communicated in the screenplay. It is simply a story of three men who want different things, and will do almost anything to get it.The movie features a crisp look, but is pretty straightforward in its shooting. It fit the style, and the wrestling scenes in particular are intimately shot, paralleling the sport itself. The colors of the film are very overcast and grim, creating a darkly suffocating feeling. The editing of the film does its job, but considering the length of the movie, there are lots of little moments, and probably even some scenes, that could have been cut. At two hours and nine minutes, it feels overlong when there's little story pushing the movie in any particular direction.Foxcatcher is well done in most aspects, and the acting is some of the strongest this year, but overall, the movie is slightly underwhelming itself. See it for the actors. See it for the characters. When you leave, that's all you remember about the movie. It's a good effort that needed just a little bit more focus.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Combining elements from Capote and Moneyball, Miller delivers a chilling psychological character study","""You have a problem with me?""If you thought Bennett Miller's Capote was a cold and distant crime thriller wait till you watch Foxcatcher because it is a very silent and slow paced psychological character study that explores some pretty interesting relationship dynamics along the way. I was captivated by this film and the atmosphere that Miller sets during its 134 minute runtime. I went into Foxcatcher completely unaware of the story it was based on, and I think that is why I may have enjoyed it a lot more than others who were already familiar with the story. This isn't your typical inspirational sport film, it is more concerned on studying the characters and you get an eerie sense that it is building into something much more than simply winning or losing a wrestling match. Miller's Capote was a crime thriller and he followed it with Moneyball which was a sports film centering on relationships, and in a way Foxcatcher is a combination of both those films. Miller is interested in telling real stories and exploring the characters behind them. Unlike Jolie's Unbroken where we get a sense that she is simply narrating a story where one event unfolds after another; Miller seems to be focused on the characters and their motivations. A lot of people might get bored with the slow pacing and somber tone of the film, but I was engaged with these characters fifteen minutes into the movie. There was a moment during the opening in which I felt the performances were a bit too actory or stagey, but once I got past that I was really invested in the psychological drama behind each one of the relationships. Miller has now directed three impressive films although this is his least approachable one.There are some outstanding and creepy performances in this film, but the way in which the characters related to one another is what worked best for me. First of all you have these two brothers who've each won Olympic gold medals. Mark (Channing Tatum) is the youngest brother who seems to be sort of a social outcast living in the shadow of his older brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo) who is the more likable one. Dave also understands wrestling better and knows how to coach, while Mark is more muscles than anything else. They have a solid and caring relationship with one another, but there is some resentment in Mark. Their relationship changes when a multi-millionaire named John Du Pont (Steve Carell) enters in the picture. He is a wrestling aficionado and offers Mark the opportunity to come stay with him in his ranch and train in the facility he has built there. There is something offbeat with du Pont who is desperately searching for acceptance and recognition. Vanessa Redgrave plays his mother and despite not having much screen time her presence seems to have an effect on John who is seeking for her approval. There is something true about what Miller said when he referred to comedic actors as having something dark about them because Steve Carell pulls off a chilling performance as this eccentric millionaire who tries to become a role model for Mark. The problem is that du Pont isn't a coach, he is more of a sponsor, and without Dave Mark isn't that good of a wrestler. Tatum, Ruffalo, and Carell each give strong performances, which doesn't come as a surprise considering Miller directed each one of his lead actors to receive Oscar nominations in his previous films. The film relies heavily on their performances and they deliver. Carell receives most of the attention because he plays a creepy character who makes everyone around him feel uneasy at times (there is a homoerotic undertone to the film). The moments in which du Pont is trying to impress his mother by acting like he is guiding the wrestlers was the highlight of the film for me because no matter how much money this guy has you know he is desperate to be something he is not. Ruffalo is also outstanding and is given perhaps the most likable role in the movie, but Tatum is equally as good. Foxcatcher succeeds in most part due to those three strong lead performances and the way each one of these characters relates to one another.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I must be missing the point!,"OK, could someone please explain what is it about this movie that makes people say it's a masterpiece or an Oscar nominee or master acting.... Totally dull, boring, dark and not thrilling at all and stupid movie in my humble opinion. LEt's say the acting is reasonably good, but no way it's exceptional - Carell acts like everything will fall of his face in a matter of seconds, and all 3 lead actors look just like they pooped their pants! (see how they walk in the movie!-OK, the wrestlers might be walking like that and great that they all acted it right but it's a bit silly); Except from that, movie goes on forever, totally slow, uninteresting and complete waste of time. WHile being quite a fan of sport stories, especially when true, this is by far the worst sport related movie I have ever watched. Even though it's about the characters, it still is about the sport as well? I am sorry but the way it's directed is totally not deep, not understandable and you feel like tons of things are missing (I believe I read that in the beginning there was over 40 hrs of material- I Wonder why!!?!). I respect that there are people that see more in this film than I but from an ordinary viewers perspective, I just don't see what's so great about it?? Definitely nothing Worth my attention. And for Oscars - no way! I respect Steve Carell, but the way this was played by him - at least 20 more actors could have done it at least the same... all in all - a disaster movie from my point of view. 2 stars instead of 1 - only cause I have some respect towards those who think it's a masterpiece. Watch it and decide for yourself.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
A highlight in true to life sports drama,"(78%) A film that on the surface is a simple sports drama about a domineering coach and a wrestler, but underneath it's a jet-black, regretful, true life tale that begs for attention. I'm almost certain this is the first Steve Carell movie I've paid money to see, which begs the question, what the hell has he been doing all this time? Because he is brilliant here as the massively odd billionaire who just wants his mother to be proud of him, and he will do anything to gain her approval, even if he can't really actually achieve greatness due to his limited talent. The attention to detail given to each character is a shining example of how to add layers without the need of telling everyone's life story. And despite this undoubtedly being a touch too baggy of pace at a couple of instances, it's still richly constructed, expertly told, and at times hugely griping picture with steller performances from everyone involved.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly tragic,"FOXCATCHER slowly, inexorably, tightens its grip. I found myself becoming more and more tense watching it, which is a sign of how involved I was in Bennett Miller's telling of this melancholy tale of loneliness, delusion and betrayed trust.The film is totally dependent on its three remarkable leading actors. In terms of public recognition, Channing Tatum's contribution seems to have been taken for granted, with no individual award nominations for him, as far as I'm aware. This is unfair. He matches the high standards of Steve Carell and Mark Ruffalo: no mean achievement.The exposition is a little ham-fisted, maybe. But apart from that, it's a well-written movie. Some, I know, have found the pace too slow, but I can't see any other way for its boa-constrictor effect to work, carefully coiling around you and gradually squeezing out all the air...In retrospect, Bennett Miller's bloated biopic CAPOTE can be excused as a dry-run for FOXCATCHER. Both are about emotionally wrecked rich kids attracted by the virility and vitality of an equally damaged man from the other side of the tracks. CAPOTE attempts to raise its story to the level of tragedy but fails, because its central figure cannot reach beyond pathos. FOXCATCHER is a truly tragic tale. You emerge from it shaking your head at its inevitability.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Only for the Love of Steve Carell ... Chaning Tatum,"Well i did not like the movie it was gripping yes, but then for most of the movie i felt the story is not moving forward..In the time when story twists and turns faster then you can digest your popcorn this movie as it is based on a true story is very slow.Maybe that is done intentionally as it is set in 80's .. or maybe i was expecting something on the line of ""Remember the titans'my bad.So yeah Steve Carroll is amazing never had expected such a performance from him, Channing Tatum has proved his mental again and yes some nice Olympic professional wrestling is up for view.I wish if the movie had a little bit more pace and thrill it would have appealed better",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A chilling look into a murky relationship.,"Bennett Miller's directorial career only consists of three feature films, yet his mark on Hollywood is already becoming indelible. His debut Capote saw Philip Seymour Hoffman garner a long-awaited Academy Award for his portrayal of the flamboyant artiste, then his follow-up Moneyball turned the sports flick on its head to deliver one of 2011's finest motion pictures. Now he's back with a dark and moody peek into the world of 1980's competitive wrestling, through the eyes of Olympic gold medal winner Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), his wrestling legend brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) and wealthy team sponsor John du Pont (Steve Carell). Much like Moneyball was a baseball movie that wasn't actually about baseball, however, Foxcatcher forgoes completely homing in on wrestling in favour of scrutinising the murky relationship between the bizarre du Pont and the tight-knit sporting brothers. It's a riveting and chilling, yet rather depressing story – made even more unsettling with the knowledge it's based on true events – that ends with an absolute gut-punch, but Miller's peculiar filmmaking style can be off-putting on occasion. Where the distinctive director masterfully excels once again though, is with the performances he generates from his cast. Looking, talking and moving differently to what we know, Tatum, Ruffalo and Carell expertly embody their individual roles to transcend the initial shock of their altered physical appearances, the latter two earning Oscar nominations in the process. If you're seeking fun at the cinemas then you might want to give this a miss, but if it's a (relatively) modern day Greek tragedy you are after, then Foxcatcher should be top of your list.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Over-hyped,"Based on true events, Foxcatcher tells the dark and fascinating story of the unlikely and ultimately tragic relationship between an eccentric multi-millionaire and two champion wrestlers.When Olympic Gold Medal winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is invited by wealthy heir John du Pont (Steve Carell) to move on to the du Pont estate and help form a team to train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics at his new state-of-the-art training facility, Schultz jumps at the opportunity, hoping to focus on his training and finally step out of the shadow of his revered brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo).Driven by hidden needs, du Pont sees backing Schultz's bid for Gold and the chance to ""coach"" a world-class wrestling team as an opportunity to gain the elusive respect of his peers and, more importantly, his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave).This movie is a bore fest. And if you already know how it ends because you are familiar with the story, it's pointless to watch.The wrestlers seem to be retarded. I'm not joking. It was hard to watch them. Plus the relentless wrestling scenes will put you to sleep.It's really an over-hyped movie. I will say this -- Carell is nearly unrecognizable. But then he's wearing a fake nose and some Chiclet front teeth.Unfortunately the painfully slow pace of this movie and poor payoff does it in.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carell and Ruffalo deserved the Oscar,"Is it the best movie of the year? No, I doubt it. I cannot give any credits to the director for his work neither. The duration of the movie is really long considering the story told.However, when it comes to acting, wow ! Carell really nailed it ! After leaving ""The Office"", I always thought that he is uncomfortable with his reputation as an actor. He has been labeled as an one-dimensional comedian who plays exaggerated characters and he desperately felt an urge to get rid of this label. Finally, he has come up with a role like John E. Du Pont (a troubled mind doomed with antisocial character and a fortune) and nobody would ever name him a comedian. From now on, he is a real actor of multi-dimensional characters.I do not want to end my review without commenting on Ruffalo's performance as well. If somebody would tell me that Mark was a professional wrestler before his acting career, I would definitely believe it. He had prepared himself perfectly for his character and become literally a real wrestler. After the movie, I have read an interview of Nancy Shultz (widow). She acclaimed that Ruffalo talks, walks and wrestles just like David Schultz. Well done, Mark !",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant performances in an otherwise slow film.,"Foxcatcher is a biopic about wrestling brothers, Mark Schultz(Channing Tatum) & David Schultz(Mark Ruffalo). The movie is set during the days leading up to the 1988 Olympic games held in Seoul. Multimillionaire sponsor, John du Pont(Steve Carell) recruits the Schultz brothers for his wrestling team, Foxcatcher. This team up leads to unexpected situations.Foxcatcher is a great film. However, it is a bit dragging. Apart from the wrestling, there's not much happening in the movie apart from the conversations among the various characters. However, the unexpected & shocking climax of the movie makes up for these minor inadequacies. The performances are the highlight of the film with the three leads of the film giving their career's best performances. Steve Carell is outstanding as John du Pont. Carell's portrayal of his dark & complex character is flawless. Channing Tatum is scintillating as Mark Schultz. Tatum's intense performance is unlike anything you've ever seen him in before. Mark Ruffalo is spectacular as David Schultz. The supporting characters are impressive as well. Foxcatcher is worth a watch. Watch it for its unforgettable performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very late review I know,"I'm making this review 6 years after the release of the film because, I have seen it 2 times in the past but don't think I firmly grasp the meaning of the movie. Now I'm 18 and know that the film is about arrogance, selfishness, and mostly conceited ness. This whole film is about family and who do you trust, your angels or your demons. Each character has there own important story. Mark is a Olympic gold medalist and wants to become that worlds greatest wrestler, Dave is also a Olympic gold medalist and has a wife and children and isn't focused just in wrestling, and John du Pont is a selfish greedy man who grew up living with a weight on his back and the weight on his back are ""the horses."" His mom loved horses and hated the idea of wrestling. It's a very slow burning movie, definitely on the back burner, but it gives a message to the audience that ""you never really know people"" and also ""money doesn't solve things"" it's not the money, it's the people. Brilliantly acted by Steve Carrell and Mark Ruffalo. The story was really awesome and I'm glad I got to review it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

unbelievably awful,"I have a book called ""Flesh and Fantasy"" which explains how to win or be nominated for an Oscar. One way is a false nose.Steve Carrell (with a false nose) stars as John Dupont in ""Foxcatcher"" from 2014, also starring Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo.""Foxcatcher"" is the story of two brothers, 1984 Olympic Gold medalist in Wrestling, Mark Schultz (Tatum) and his brother Dave. Mark is invited by the fabulously wealthy John Dupont to train at Foxcatcher Farms and form a team, with the goal of winning the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. Schultz agrees and is excited for a chance to do something on his own, away from his well-known brother Dave (Ruffalo).Dupont feels that he does not have the respect of his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and wants the wrestling team to help him gain not only her respect but to boost his ego. Mark becomes increasingly more dependent on his approval.However, all that glitters -- Mark finds himself involved in things that could wreck his training, both physical and psychological. Dupont then has Dave come in as a trainer. The end of the story is tragedy.Well, the whole thing was a tragedy. It was so dull, it was practically done as a documentary - and not a particularly interesting one, I might add. The pacing was sleep-inducing.I blame the director for absolutely everything that went wrong. Steve Carrell probably studied DuPont and gave an accurate portrayal. Given Dupont's psychological problems and lack of self-esteem, Carrell's flat affect, both in his lack of expression and flatlined voice, were correct.The only problem with that is, it's hard to recognize how deeply disturbed he was when everyone around him is acting the same way. Channing Tatum spent the whole film looking like a dumb jock and muttering.The homoerotic part of their relationship is shown, but since Tatum acted no differently than he did in the beginning, it's hard to say if it bothered him or not. He does, however, frost his hair.Mark Ruffalo does the best he can.Obviously from the reviews, people read into it a lot more than was there, and that's good. If everyone had the same opinion, it would be a pretty dull world - almost as dull as this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something missing that stops this film from reaching the next level,"There's a lot to love about Foxcatcher, the most notable being the performances. Steve Carrell gave a transformative performance as John Du Pont, which was the real highlight of the film. His energy was so sinister and engaging, and whenever he was on screen was when Foxcatcher was at its best. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo also gave great performances, particularly Channing who thrived in exploring the more tortured elements of his character.My criticism would be that the film maybe lacked a bit of structure. I was never quite sure who our protagonist was, and I didn't find myself overly excited by or drawn into either Schultz brothers. The intriguing bit of this story was the relationship between Du Pont and the Schutz's, and I don't think this was explored enough. I would have liked the wrestling to take more of a back seat and for the characters and their relationships to be explored more.Don't get me wrong, there was good character development and exploration, but in the wrong places at times. I just didn't find a connection with either of the brothers, and this was the films major failing for me which stops it getting a 9 or 10.I would definitely encourage anybody to watch Foxcatcher though, particularly lovers of drama and sports. It has a lot of brilliant elements and the story is bizarre. If the third act doesn't have your jaw hitting the floor then I don't know what will!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good Silent and Gritty Drama,"I have been a fan of Bennett Miller since first seeing Moneyball. The trailers and cast list for Foxcatcher gave me an interest in seeing it and learning that it was a passion project for Bennett Miller gave me high hopes for the film. This film is truly a great showcase of brilliant cinematography, production design, and acting. Every performance in the film is fantastic and although the media and academy awards have shined the spotlight on Steve Carrell and Mark Ruffalo I found this film to be the breakthrough for Channing Tatum's dramatic career. Tatum gives this career defining performance as a darkly troubled and tormented Olympic Athlete who aspires for greatness. The narrative arc of the film seems a bit messy due to the large gaps of time in between major scenes of character or plot development. There are several scenes in the film that seem irrelevant, the pressure that has built up throughout several major scenes has somewhat dissipated the emotional engagement of the audience by the time the climax has arrived. Many average movie-goers will not be able to sit through the entire duration of the film due to the extremely slow burn to the climax and scenes that drag in the middle of the film. Overall it is still a good film with a great creation of visual atmosphere with interesting sound design to create an eerie environment that is unique in modern cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Highly overrated film,"What is all they hype with this movie? I had such high expectations. This movie had potential to go in many meaningful directions but as soon as it seamed like it was going somewhere it would stop dead in its tracks and change course. In the end I couldn't draw a single point or lesson or meaning from any character or event in the movie. It was just a very tragic tale that seemed to all be for nothing at all. It gave no conclusion to any of the characters. It even showed a very emotional ending very awkwardly, not focusing at all on any of the 3 major characters.The only positive is that the acting by Channing Tatum, Steve Carrel, and Mark Ruffalo were all very good. However, the screenplay did not really write a lot of emotions into their characters. The main emotion I kept feeling was just awkwardness throughout the movie. Channing Tatum's character was always angry and resentful and it did not really dig into great detail as to what shaped his character to be like that. They didn't explore the relationship between the Schultz brothers, except in the very beginning and it just skimmed the surface. Overall it was a confusing mess for the audience and you are left not knowing what you are meant to feel or think by the writers and the director.

"True, murky story. Carrell's transformation is perfect.","Foxcatcher delves into the true story of the murky John du Pont, the endlessly wealthy yet under-achieving son of America's infamous du Pont dynasty, and whose obsession with the sport of wrestling sees him buy his own team with hopes of training them to Olympic glory.
Channing Tatum plays Mark Schultz, an upcoming star keen to step out of his brother-come-coach David's (Mark Ruffalo) shadow and moves onto the du Pont estate as his prized trophy sportsman.
But when Tatum fails to live up to du Pont's expectations, the unnerving millionaire brings his brother on board to whip the team into shape, but as David begins to take over the team and question the change in his younger brother, du Pont marks him as a disposable barrier to his reputation.
Steve Carrell's transformation into du Pont extends beyond his sizeable prosthetic nose, with his dead eyes patrolling his staff and darkly irking those he desperately tries to impress and influence while Ruffalo, with his patient manner and humility, was the perfect choice to honour the memory of David Schultz.
The real Mark Schultz's recent furore in the press was unneeded, with the film offering no real suggestion that his relationship with his wealthy benefactor was sexual in any way.
In actuality, Foxcatcher comes down hard on Du Pont's distant mother, suggesting her life-long disproval of her son is to blame for his emotionless ambition and, ultimately devastating, disregard for human feeling.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie is tragic and beautifully done,"Foxcatcher is a bleak, muted, and cringe inducing movie. It's bizarre on many levels. Steve Carrell's performance is outstanding as the sociopathic John Du Pont who in many ways ironically is who I imagine a rich and evil Michael Scott would be. Du Pont's overwhelming need to feel valued in a space that does not belong to him in the slightest is so uneasy to watch and creates a sense of claustrophobic tension over the entire movie ultimately ending with a shocking and tragic turn of events.

When a generous, very wealthy philanthropist proposes they move to his land to train for the World Wrestling Series and next Olympic games, he finally gets the chance to show his mettle away from big brother's shadow. Mark Shultz goes from a rock and a hard place to a pot of boiling water, and nothing his brother David does can help. John Du Pont lives an extravagant and excessive lifestyle, always under his mother's disdainful eyes. But it is when the three; Mark, David and John; finally unite that the water boils over.After watching the film I jumped straight onto the World Wide Web to seperate the wheat from the chaff, and like the saying goes: truth is truely stranger than fiction. The film touches on all the important points, but never focuses in on what really occured before the craziness set in.The decision to turn it into a comedy may have been inspirational, and the casting fully supports the skewed view, but by doing it this way it distracted greatly the truth in the story being told. Although we may never know what really happened on the Foxcatcher farm, the way the events were depicted in this film feels like it trivialised the reality of it. Du Pont puts ""eccentric"" in a whole new light, as dark as that may be! And Channing's performance as the bloated, quiet and cauliflower-eared wrestler should be awarded!What an incredible turn of events that started as an attempt to make America great in sports by a man denied his passion by a family strict of class! A film that touches many facets without delving too deep!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good as a sports movie,"As a fan of both film and sport, I have always been disappointed that films have not caught the essence and drama of athletic competition. Even some films that have been highly regarded such as Field of Dreams miss the mark as far as I'm concerned. Foxcatcher is an exception.There are themes in the movie which transcend sport for sure. The deference that a deranged John E. DuPont was able to garner purely because of his wealth reflects modern American values.But wealthy or not, he was clearly a fish out of water in the world of high class athletes. The movie captures this perfectly by its accurate portrayal of the two brothers. Their personalities were different but they shared a devotion to sport and achievement. Sport defined their lives and the movie reflects that. To be sure, in a non-revenue sport such as wrestling, they needed financial support but they were nonetheless insulated culturally by their athleticism. Thus their relationship with the wannabe DuPont had to be strained.The icing on the cake was the straight presentation of the wrestling scenes. There was none of the music, quick cuts, and choreography that Hollywood usually uses to virtually destroy the beauty of real competition.Foxcatcher might not be the movie of the year but it is certainly the sports movie of the decade!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining,Not your typical sports-themed movie. Unfolds slowly but entertains. Great acting from all three leads. Didn't recognise Steve Carell under his makeup. And the wonderful Vanessa Redgrave makes an appearance. Being based on true events adds another dimension.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movies Self Promotional Buzz Tricked The Sheeple Into Believing That This Embarrassingly Bad Movie Is Good,"This movie actually succeeds in being weirder than John DuPont. This movie commits to nothing, including substance. Why was this movie even made?... I understand why a movie was made depicting the circumstances associated with the Schultz brothers and Dupont, but why was this movie made? Sure, sometimes movies/writers/directors have a story/direction in mind, but in the end it doesn't come into fruition for whatever reason. In this instance, it's like, what the f__k were they thinking? They were alright with this? I would imagine that the actual events associated with Foxcatcher should make for an interesting story and I'd really like to see that movie, but it sure isn't this B-rate movie, and yes it acts and feels very much like a B-rate movie.The fact that some people rated this movie well is an interesting psychological phenomenon. I don't believe anyone liked this movie... people were tricked into liking this horrendous movie because they heard some caned hype in the movie promos. Many people don't understand that the buzz is not actual buzz from the movie, rather it's the buzz from the people selling the movie... then in sheep like fashion they echo the buzz of a successful movie promo campaign and that's exactly what happened in reference to any positive reviews this movie received. I can't help but think of the Steve Carell's performance was excellent buzz, when in fact it was hilariously bad (btw Carell's normally a great actor). He looked and sounded nothing like the guy for one, but would not have been a problem if he created his own character that was acted and performed well. I don't blame Carroll because when every single character in the movie comes across like a Saturday Night live skit, the mistake is not with the actors, but the director/story, etc.This movie doesn't give us much substance... to avoid spoilers I won't break down specifics, but it does a poor job of telling the story and ultimately leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. If the viewer does end up caring, it's not because this movie makes them care, it's just because they're curious about what the actual story may have been. I'd be very surprised if Mark Schultz was happy with this movie. At the very least he must have been pissed about what it implied, especially if it didn't happen. Maybe he can rest assure knowing that he isn't alone... every person who has watched this movie has also taken it in the shorts.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Its a lame dud for me, but maybe I'm missing something?","You know when you eat something that you think ""This food has to be tasty"" but then realize, ""Actually this is kinda blah""? In film, that's Foxcatcher.Foxcatcher has solid performances from all three of its leading actors and the film's content has 'oscar bait' written all over it. The cinematography is decisive and adds to the film's mood and for a bit you might think Foxcatcher is a prestigious film worthy of the nominations it's garnering – you might be mistaken.Channing Tatum is Mark Schultz, an Olympic gold medalist in the sport of men's wrestling. His life greyly drones along as he trains with his brother and fellow athlete Dave, played by Mark Ruffalo. Dave's life is changed substantially when multimillionaire and philanthropist John du Pont (Steve Carrell) invites Dave to train at his estate in Pennsylvania Foxcatcher Farms.Foxcatcher is a dramatic examination of the people behind the events that unfold during this time period for the Schultz brothers. It is depressingly taciturn and does not embellish the moments in this real men's lives. Though it should be noted the film takes several liberties in manipulating the time frame in which these events take place to their whim for narrative effect and is detrimental to the film's biographical integrity. Bennett Miller's direction of E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman's screenplay is starkly ambiguous and provides no illumination or psychological evaluation into the characters motives. In fact, the film's makers manage to strip some layers away from the characters' personalities to make them more of an awkward every-man.While I understand the final effect the film Foxcatcher is going for, it simply misses the mark for me. There is not nearly enough content in the story itself in the way the film is told and its pacing is abysmally unbalanced. Foxcatcher just drily brings to the life the story that occurred in 1996 and could have done so in thirty minutes rather than two hours. It's climax is weak, uninspired and cliché.It is like Foxcatcher is trying to be significant and to use the Schultz brothers as a mirror to speak of a greater message, but unsuccessfully.

I can't believe this was so dull and dry.,"I watched this movie from start to finish even though by the 30 minute mark I was absolutely bored to tears. I kept waiting for the momentum to pick up. I understand this is based off a true event, but seriously there was barely any dialogue much less action! They did an excellent job with the makeup though for the actor playing John du Pont as I seriously could not believe that he looked nothing like his character! Don't get me wrong, I watch tons of shows and movies in all different genres, but this was by far the worst, the most dull and dry movie I have seen in years. I think they could have done a much better job with this and I cannot believe it has been ranked so high! Even at times of celebration in this story there was very little emotion from the characters. I guess I had better not apply for a position as a movie critic as I must have it all wrong! In the past few days I have watched several movies based on real life events and none has bored me except this one! I was very interested in seeing this movie as I thought it would be cool to watch a movie based on these true events. I was completely wrong! (And this is coming from a girl who watches documentaries for the fun of learning something new!!)

Bizarre. Strange. Weird. And Slow. Very slow.,"A bizarre story based on very bizarre events.An Olympic champion called Mark Schultz dedicates every hour of his days to wrestling, and trains with his brother with his sights on becoming World Champion. However, he receives an unusual phone call from a millionaire called Du Pont who flies him to his house and offers to sponsor his training for the future. While it would not take a scientist to see that this rich guy is completely out of his mind, Mark Schultz who probably wants to do things his own way and stand out of his brother's shadow accepts the offer and moves in with Du Pont. The partnership of these two men leads to unlikely events.While I am pretty interested in fighting in general, I have to say that to me, the movie felt extremely slow paced, and it made me wonder throughout if the story was actually good enough to turn it into a film. While the performances of the actors are all fantastic, I don't think this deserves some of the praising reviews I have read. Nothing really happens in this movie, apart from seeing many strong grown men training and accommodating the stupid and eccentric needs of a lonely and retarded millionaire.By IMDb standards, a movie with a 7.4 rating is sort of OK to watch, and that's exactly what this is: just another movie",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Foxcatcher is way over-hyped.,"Well hello there fellow Internet people. I hope you are all having a fantastic day. And if you want to keep it that way I would highly recommend that you do not watch Foxcatcher. I know that you might think that I am crazy based on all the positive feedback this film has received. But trust me...yes I am advising you to trust some random guy on the Internet. I made the mistake of falling for the hype of this boring movie. I wanted to see the entire cast. I really like all of them in other roles. BUT...they praise Steve Carell for his role in this monstrosity when really all he does is give long blank stares and mumble broken sentences. People have said the ending is shocking and unexpected. For me it was relief. It was over and I could focus my attention to my gorgeous girlfriend who had a look of ""What the hell was that?!"" on her beautiful face. We then went on to discuss how crappy it was and went to bed. Nothing really happens in Foxcatcher. There is a bit of a story about wrestling and the billionaire who was trying to live vicariously through all the wrestlers. But the bulk of this movie is Steve Carell saying stupid stuff and taking his sweet time to do it. If you wanna watch it to see if I am right about all of this then fell free to do so. But do not say that you were not warned.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Two Communists Wrestling,"Before filming a particularly dark scene, Bennett Miller made Steve Carell write on a piece of paper the thing that he hates the most about himself and then put it in his pocket. Miller told Carell, ""Just have it right there, and know that it's in a place where, if I was a dick, I could just grab it."" According to Miller, the result is the favorite thing that he has put on film. What Carell wrote on that piece of paper was that he was ""pro crime, and is an advocate for communism for America.""Miller asked the same thing of Mark Ruffalo, and surprisingly, Ruffalo wrote the same thing down on his slip of paper.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pacing is Slow Bordering on being Creepy,"This is based upon a true storyBillionaire John Dupont (Steve Carell) sets up a wrestling training complex on his Foxcatcher farm and invites former 1984 Olympic Gold Medalist Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) to lead a team to win the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Korea. Later Dupont gets Mark's brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo) to join the team.We see Steve Carell in a dramatic role as John DuPont. Carell is given a prosthetic nose for the role and most of the time he keeps his head high as if balancing the nose so it doesn't fall off. Why someone thought the prosthetic nose was needed is beyond my pay grade. Did the real John DuPont have this large a nose? Did the real John DuPont hold his head high? Apparently so. The nose is an issue in the sense that we couldn't help but notice it all the way through. My eyes never left the nose. Carell does a credible job and he should stick with drama as he was never funny as a comedian by my standards (you are tough).This movie is very slow, the pacing borders on being creepy because we never know what is really going on between DuPont and Mark. Mark is introduced to drugs and booze, loses his edge in training and this is where DuPont gets brother Dave to join the team. Dave is also a former US Olympic Gold Medalist and seems to be a better leader of the team giving sound instruction all around. Mark feels slighted.This is too slow bordering on being creepy mostly because the long silences between character dialogues by almost everyone. We thought there might be some homo-erotic play going on, but the movie never goes there and we are left with these uncomfortable silences. If the pacing was quicker this could have been a better story hence movie. This movie will be forever remembered by the slow pacing (hey,don't forget the nose) and not for the actors and what eventually happens. Not good.We do get to see the DuPont estate and surrounding landscapes, at times, and these scenes are pure gold. It is here we didn't mind the slow pacing.Steve Carell was nominated for Best Actor and Mark Ruffalo for Best Supporting Actor. The director was nominated for Best Director. . There was also a nomination for Best Writing – original screenplay. The dialogues were pretty good, but the silences over-powered them. (3/10Violence: Yes.

Foxcatcher,"The greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher led by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances.Foxcatcher is directed by Oscar nominated Bennett Miller, stars Steve Carell also nominated for best actor in a leading role, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo. In fact Steve Carell performance is very good, he's properly unrecognisable. At this point, his performance is clearly career defining. Plus in my opinion Channing Tatum is largely underestimated. He gives a performance that is so restrained and in which you can read so much on his face, some moments you can literally feel his pain and torment. Mark Ruffalo plays a father who is very protective of his family but also of his brother and he also deserves his Oscar nomination for best actor in a supporting role. In fact, all those three performances are Oscar worthy to me or at least nomination worthy as the movie cannot function without them. However it is a quite slow paced movie, there are few 5 to 10 minutes long sequences and you are left wondering what was the real purpose of those scenes. This movie is based on a true story and tries to make a statement on why Dupont did what he did. The emotional core of the movie is very hollow and distant. As I said before I think Channing Tatum is the lead actor in this film; some of you can disagree and think that it is Steve Carell, but Tatum's character is the only one I really felt connected with. Finally, if you combined the slow pace, the blank emotional core and the fact that you can't really understand some of the character motivation behind this film it's a little bit disappointing.Overall Foxcatcher is a beautifully shot movie with some out of this world performances but the heart and soul of the film itself is a little bit distasteful.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Let me rate stuff zero stars you cowards,"This is a film made by yanks for yanks and it shows, and it is grating. The yankness alone of it is so off-putting that I could barely make it through the first fifteen minutes. In these first few minutes it established the following things about itself: a complete and utter lack of self-awareness, a glaring conceitedness about the interest and value of white yankee mens' internal angst - which is neither valuable nor interesting but does indeed stem from the aforementioned absence of any self-awareness as all: men, white, and especially yanks. Above all it is boring. It is so boring while telling you oh-so-urgently, so fretfully how grand and meaningful and whatnot it perceives itself to be. If you are a yank, specifically a male, white one, and also interested in sports (which as I understand is a cultural expectation the majority happily fulfills) I suppose this will be an enjoyable film for you. If this demographic is of interest to you as an object of study, I guess you may be able to glean some insight from it at least. Will the couple of hours of tedious drudgery of actually watching the whole damned thing be worth it? For me, the answer is a clear no. Obvious Oscar bait pretending to possess a depth it never even attempts to reach. Bleakness does not equal substance. A mindless orgy of self-flattery barely disguising itself as drama. A waste of every resource that went into making it. Rarely have I hated something this much. I'd actually like to give it negative stars; zero seems too generous a verdict.

Too slow and too surly,"This was a huge disappointment. Steve Carrell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo are good actors, and Ruffalo especially is good in this. But alas, the dialogue and editing is so slooooooooow and it makes this a boring struggle.Neither Steve Carrell's massively distracting fake nose nor Tatum's overcooked hulking sadboy performance mean the audience needs minutes of silence to soak up their characterizations. The dialogue isn't weighty enough to warrant minutes of reflection interspersed with admittedly nice shots of trees against a moody musical backdrop.Why didn't it work for me besides the pacing? As a Brit, maybe I am more familiar with very rich people being very sad, lonely, and broken? Maybe Americans find this aspect of the story groundbreaking?

The result is a very well acted but very slow story of jealousy, loneliness and desire for acceptance... dressed up in a wrestling theme. The problem is there's just not enough here for a movie. DuPont is very very weird from the start. The kind of guy who offered you 20k to sleep on his estate and wrestle you you'd run a mile from. Once you get over his missives not being gay ones then there is not a lot left. He's just a miserable lonely rich guy with no friends who fixates on wrestling. So not really worth watching.

Why did that just happen?,"I guess I had really high expectations about this film. I also thought I'd get some answers to the real life mystery. Perhaps with no preconceptions I would have enjoyed it more. Wonderful acting, some great dialogue. Understated performances is an understatement here (with notable exceptions). I was not really captivated by the wrestling scenes, but this could be my lack of interest in them rather than the film itself. It's all atmosphere, character development, and performance, with some fine direction. But where is the story? I also found fault with what I assume is the editing. There are parts of the film that seem be skipped, where I was sure a scene was missed - or parts that were so briefly shown it was nearly impossible to observe what was important, but this could be a fault of direction or camera- work.I am still wondering why most of the events in the film happened. Time after time, events occur in the film that beg the question ""what!? - where did that come from?"". Did I miss something? I even went back to re-watch some scenes and there were no answers.Perhaps the filmmakers did not want to make this an 'inspired-by-real- events' film, but a more accurate portrayal.

A true wrestling story that deserved to be told... Better than this.,"I was genuinely hoping for a special movie since all the awards shows and ratings raved about this movie. Plus the fact real wrestlers deserve something better than ""Vision Quest"" to portray what real wrestling looks like. What a missed opportunity.This is Olympic-quality wrestling, not the WWF and that fake garbage. True wrestling. The sport ancient Olympians in Greece spent their entire lives trying to perfect with their bodies. Wrestling is one of the most graceful, powerful, challenging sports in the world. Anyone who ever participated in this sport will attest to the mental and physical toughness required. It also isn't for everyone as it can be slow, uneven and boring to someone who has never suffered through drastic weight loss, brutal practice sessions in 100+ degree gymnasiums, psychological games by coaches and competitors alike, as well as the (sometimes) inhumane practice facilities with which the sport associates.The real-life story is horrible. du Pont was a nutcase with too much money and the Schultz' were probably a little too desperate/trusting for their own good. But this movie is simply not good. The cinematography is gorgeous and the actors definitely go against their normal stereotypes. However, I believe the subjects deserved a more honest treatment and are not nearly as lummox-like as portrayed. Both wrestlers were beasts (in a good way) and two of the most powerful, beautiful, graceful wrestlers who ever wore a United States wrestling singlet. They were GREAT. I wish I could say the same thing about this movie. It is average at best.I met Mark Schultz decades ago after his 1984 gold medal and before the events of this movie transpired. Mark was kind, supportive and intelligent in real-life. I can say without equivocation that the Channing Tatum ""lummox/Neanderthal"" portrayed in the movie is not close to the talented, good man in real life. Mark Schultz deserved better. I never met John du Pont or Dave Schultz but can assume they were caricatures as well.It pains me to say this as an ex-wrestler, but this movie BORED me. You have two of the most fascinating American wrestlers in history but you barely see them in their glory. It felt like watching two overweight super-heavyweights in the middle of a stalling match where the referee waits and waits and waits for someone to make a move... that never shows up until the VERY end, after the audience is already done watching and doesn't care anymore.From a wrestler's standpoint, I'd say the original true story was worthy of a trip to the Olympics in the Greco-Roman style but not worthy of making the medal round. The story probably deserved to be told but as a documentary, not mainstream. This movie is more like a high school single-A state champion who stalls too much and, when up against better competition from worthy champions (better movies), this movie isn't good enough to make a college team, let alone make it to the Olympics. 5 out of 10 is the best I could give it and that's only because I like the Schultz boys and what they brought to a great sport. The movie really isn't worth your time. Pleeeeeez make a better wrestling movie, Hollywood. Still waiting for something to beat ""Vision Quest"" as a decent wrestling movie. Probably just wishful thinking...",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great Performances in a film that ached for some keen editing.,"This is not a bad film; problem is it should have been bloody great one. It is based on the real life shenanigans of John E. du Pont – one of America's richest men. He is so rich he can have and do whatever he wants and he wants to have his own wrestling team, and go to the Olympics in Seoul and win gold and him pretend to be the coach and get all the laurels like some latter day Roman Emperor a la mode of Nero oh and have a real friend.He sets up a state of the art gym and lures two wrestling brothers, the Schultz brothers – played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo to come and join his team called 'Foxcatcher'. Du Pont is played Steve Carell and all of them put in credit worthy performances and this must have been a very physical role. There is a lot of wrestling – the Roman – Greco sort not the sort that is basically bad choreography (but much more fun) and the need to be very emotional too.The 'however 'here is that some scenes go on too long, even the so called scene setting at the beginning just goes on forever, this is 134 minutes long and there was so much that could have been cut that would have given this more immediacy – which is what is needed in a film that posits itself as a thriller – I would have called it a drama to be honest but that is a small point. This is still well worth watching but I think director Bennett Miller could have left a bit more on the editing suite floor as this story did not lend itself to 'lyrical delivery' as it is often euphemistically called and there was a lot more to the story that would have risen it higher in the entertainment ranks too especially about Du Pont, but that is always the choice of the makers.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Ill-focused, self-indulgent direction topples fascinating story","The situation surrounding American wrestling impresario John du Pont and his recruitment and hiring of Olympic wrestling champion brothers Mark and Dave Schultz started as curious and ended as tragic, something the people behind this gloomy film is more than happy to wallow in. The story starts in 1987, three years after the Schultz brothers won their Olympic gold medal, with younger brother Mark feeling somewhat disillusioned with the World Championships coming up. He's taken in by millionaire du Pont, played with a tremendous focus on exteriors and extravaganza by Steve Carell, and made the figurehead for his wrestling team Foxcatcher.Without disclosing much more of the story, it's worth mentioning that it is constantly engrossing and never dull, something Bennett Miller somehow manages to make it through his ill-focused, self-indulgent direction. The film is more interested in characterizations than characters, and - much like du Pont himself - sacrifices the sporting and human side of things for an perpetual hunt for controversy. John du Pont may have been eccentric and moody, and Mark Schultz may have been simple-minded and reserved, but surely they didn't wear those labels in their faces at all times.Mark Ruffalo's Dave Schultz is the only real human being in this film, but he's made into a secondary character, which is rather surprising for those who know how this story ends. Unfortunately, this is just one of several examples of how the filmmakers try to bend this film into a shape that doesn't quite fit, something which culminates when the pivotal scene is played out with only a pretence of accuracy, by suggesting that du Pont's defining act came as a direct consequence of the failure at the 1988 Olympics. This lacking causality is only one of Foxcatcher's problems, however. The hollow, emblematic performances by Carell and Tatum, or the film's one-note mood are others.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
The film seems to focus on the most uninteresting parts of the story,"Foxcatcher is based on a tragic and fascinating true story, but the film seems to focus on the most uninteresting parts of the story. I found the actual news articles to be more engaging than this movie. Nevertheless, Foxcatcher is almost worth watching for the subtle, yet dramatic physical changes to Steve Carell's and Channing Tatum's appearance, as well as their performances. Those two do a really good job.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Super boring,"I tried to stay awake watching this, but it was tough. Very slow and boring. Steve Carell trying a serious role? It's not for him, at least not in this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Discussion of Johan's conspiracy theory,"Maybe the eastern bloc wanted to better their chances at the Olympic wrestling gold again. Targeting Du Pont with psychosis inducing drugs would have done the job. I wonder if any conspiracy theorists or even john himself have wondered if it was sabotage from their competition. The movie looks at a lot of different angles for how things went down at the du Pont farm and with this wrestling team. I think it is a pretty good explanation of things. And I don't mean to be disrespectful David Schultz' a life. I think the movie could have made more of a point to explain the reason this happened is because of an inability for many Americans to comprehend and treat rich people as equals. They think the rich are inherently good and better than the rest of others and give them too much leeway to trample on others rights. Rich people are humans just like everyone else and hanging around them for their money is not going to get you where you need to go. That said, it would have been interesting to see if the sabotage angle was ever discussed.",,Anonymous,Biography
Steve Carell,"it is his film. in a special manner, like proof of talent and science of a director to use it. a dark, cold drama, almost cruel about dreams and ambition, appearances and illusion. a not comfortable film about the price of sacrifices. and, again, a beautiful chance for Carell to create a character who remains long time as image of strange form of evil. the great virtue of Bennett Miller is to have right actors for each role and a good script for create, in precise way, the story as a large puzzle in which not the acts, the dialogs or the subject are most important but the force of atmosphere. film of fight, it is like a black circle. credible, cold, more than image of real facts. in fact, it could be the Steve Carell impressive debut.",,Anonymous,Biography
Three Strong Performances Make Foxcatcher A Less Tedious Affair,"From the director of Capote & Moneyball comes another biopic, this time concerning the multi- millionaire John du Pont which mainly covers his relationship with 1984 Olympic gold medalists, Mark & Dave Schultz. And even though Foxcatcher looks like an interesting character study on paper, the film itself is quite a tedious experience for the most part.The story of Foxcatcher concerns John du Pont; heir of the multimillionaire Du Pont family & a wrestling enthusiast who recruits the 1984 Olympic gold medal-winning US wrestlers & brothers, Mark & Dave Schultz, in order to help coach aspiring US wrestlers for upcoming tournaments. The plot also tries to capture the relationship dynamics between these three characters.Directed by Bennett Miller, the film starts working on developing a motive behind what actually led real-life John du Pont take such an extreme action considering that there's possibly none in reality but it's so static, uninspiring & unappealing at times that it becomes a chore rather than an immersive drama. The technical aspects are fine mostly but it's the performances where the film excels.The cast comprises of Steve Carell, Channing Tatum & Mark Ruffalo, and the trio have done a terrific job in their given roles. It's a shame that the narrative is unable to keep the interest alive for the actors gave everything they had & are simply fabulous. Carell obviously is the biggest surprise here as the unhinged character but chemistry between Tatum & Ruffalo is also pretty much spot-on.On an overall scale, Foxcatcher feels like one of those boring lectures featuring a teacher who's is reading out loud in front of the class but simply lacks the imagination to make the lectures interesting or engaging for the students. It had the resources & it had a fitting cast to pull it off but in the end, there's no reward for sitting through this slow burner. Watch it only for the trio of excellent performances.",,Anonymous,Biography
Foxcatcher,"A quietly powerful movie about a very sad bit of American sports history. Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum offers mesmerizing performances that makes Foxcatcher a pleasurable watch. At the end of the day, the film revolves around the character John Du Post, however interesting and troubling of a character he is, the overall film rides too much on his erratic personality and behaviour that it fails to reveal either more of this past or the inner workings of the Schultz Brothers. The way the film explores the idea of mental fragility feels honest and believable. Carell projects himself onto Mark, a malleable young men in need of direction, but once he sees failure, John immediately discards him for immediate gratification in Dave.",,Anonymous,Biography
Creepy,"Creepy! This is a pretty dark and somber film. It depicts the true story of Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), an Olympic gold wrestler, and the period in his life where he was at the Foxcatcher farm with John Dupont, played by John Dupont. It deals with Mark's relationship with his new coach John Dupont, and his brother Dave, whom he has always lived in the shadow of. I was intrigued with Steve Carrell playing a dramatic role. Other than that, I didn't really know anything about the film going in. Interestingly, while I was a little disappointed by Steve Carell's performance - it was a little too actory for my tastes - Channing Tatum really hit it home. I'd be surprised to learn that he doesn't wrestle.",,Anonymous,Biography
Good but way too slow,"No, I get it. It's a tragical story. There's nothing funny about this drama. If you're looking to be entertained don't even think about watching this. I actually didn't know anything about the story or what had happened. Which I'm not sure was a good thing or a bad thing. The whole time I kept thinking to myself ""Where is this movie going??"" So many times it felt like it just wasn't going anywhere. And then... BOOM. And then that was it. Just like that. Which I guess is what happened in real life too. So great job portraying the truth and making this as realistic as possible because that's important BUT there is NO excuse for the slow editing! Just because the story is sad and tragic does not mean that the movie has to also be sad and tragic. Not sure why filmmakers haven't realized that by now. There's a way to portray those emotions and feelings without completely boring the audience to death. Otherwise, A for effort. Really felt like it transported me back in time and space.",,Anonymous,Biography
Distancecatcher,"Can a film be made with all the available technical prowess yet still fail in its ability to relate what it wants to the audience? It has happened before, though usually in science fiction or action- laced stories where special effects and mechanical devices override any characterization or human interest. Yet, in the case of Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher, the result is too much stylistic layout for the sake of not enough dramatic juice to let the story flow smoothly. Watching this film is like witnessing a car engine break down due to losing oil, transmission and coolant simultaneously; this movie needs its essential fluids replenished.So much has been said already about Steve Carell's performance, but is it anything more than a well-known comic actor under a lot of makeup and prosthetics attempting to disguise himself as a 'serious' actor? Of course, other actors have followed similar paths like this before, but Carell's acting seems too subdued to allow us to be interested in what he is doing. Bennett Miller has always been a director who likes to keep the audience at arm's, or even a parking lot's, distance, so it is hardly surprising that Carell is directed to perform so. Indeed, John du Pont is the most potentially interesting character because he is a seemingly walking paradox. He possesses a doctorate in ornithology, is the heir to the fabulously wealthy and prestigious du Pont chemical corporation. Yet, he is presented, with whatever historical accuracy that can be managed, as a quietly malevolent control freak with serious mommy issues and some ambiguous form of mental illness. All this is deduction, of course. The film has no interest in exploring who du Pont truly was or what motivates him to act as he does. Here, he is merely the lone villain, the obvious bad guy we are supposed to both fear and be fascinated with. In this regard, Carell is creepily effective, but it bodes no goodwill upon the film or our rooting interest in him. He cannot, or will not, be penetrated by the audience.Opposing this, Channing Tatum may end up being the most revelatory element about the film. Known previously as a handsome but absent- minded meat-head-type actor receiving roles based upon his looks rather than acting ability, Tatum here finds the perfect role for himself, utilizing the typifications of his career in order to portray wrestler Mark Schultz as just what he has been stereotyped as: a mindless, muscular athlete with little to no ability to separate himself from either his brother or the past they share. He wants to individualize and prove himself to be more than a mere fighter of men for sport, but he simultaneously desires leadership and direction within the context of a team and common goal to be attained. This he had with his brother, Dave, and he soon finds it to a weird degree with John du Pont.While the movie covers this unusual but symbiotic relationship, interest is maintained and Tatum proves himself to be a reliable and intense actor, walking in a slouch and keeping his lower jaw agape like a heavy-breathing animal. Then, the plot begins to gear forward, albeit with somewhat large jumps in plausibility or logic. Firstly, Dave comes to run du Pont's wrestling team with no explanation despite having rejected the same offer earlier. This is never cleared up. Then, the shift focuses from emasculated Mark to the unsettling strangeness of John du Pont as Carell continues to walk around, sometimes with a gun, but always lurking and watching hie beloved team of men and patriots training for American greatness in the upcoming Seoul Olympics. Finally, the inevitable element of this true story establishes its presence, forcing us to watch something that could have easily been left out in order to focus on the characters. Instead, it is presented as the denouement of a true crime TV special, shot abruptly and shockingly, but to no effect upon our sympathies or understanding.In his review, David Edelstein referred to Foxcatcher as ""a true crime story bloated into looking significant."" He mentions Miller's most lauded film, Capote, as having a similar detached quality, although that film seems to understand better its obsession. It may also help that Capote is a far more interesting character than du Pont, as well as the fact that Phillip Seymour Hoffman is better- suited for these kinds of roles than Steve Carell. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that Miller has shown himself capable of visually expanding somewhat thin stories into depressing, but admirable dramas where the look of things trumps nearly anything happening within the frame. Perhaps the one conclusion to be taken from this is that you can get away with this type of storytelling provided you have a fascinating character portrayed by a competent actor. In this case, Carell's brave performance is only that; a gimmicky attempt to distance himself from comedy while simultaneously distancing himself from the audience of Foxcatcher.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Not as strong as the book, but still very good",Foxcatcher is all about the performances. The main cast are all incredible. Steve Carell pulls off what is certainly a performance of a lifetime for a man who has been known for comedy roles. Carell may not win an Oscar for this film but it did earn him his first nomination and its hard not to cheer for him as the Oscars approach. Mark Ruffalo also received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Dave Schultz but its Channing Tatum who surprises me out of the whole cast. Tatum shows that he is certainly capable of playing a serious role and he doesn't always have to be a big box office draw. I read Mark Schultz's (who makes a cameo in the film if you know his story see if you can point him out) biography prior to watching the Foxcatcher movie and sure it does not necessarily follow the most true story but the film is still effective. The film was a lot darker and more thriller like than I had expected as I figured it would be more of an intense sport film. The ending of course is a pivotal part of the film and I will not give it away but if you are unaware of the Foxcatcher story it will likely shock you and I think that is why this film has gotten such critical acclaim because its a true story that many people are completely unaware of. If you're a fan of sports movie I would maybe sit this film out because it certainly not full of action but if you want to see some amazing acting Foxcatcher is a film for you.,,Anonymous,Biography
