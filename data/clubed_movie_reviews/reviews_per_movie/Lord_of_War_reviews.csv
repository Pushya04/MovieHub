This movie has aged very well,"I recently rewatched this modern classic. Nicholas Cage remains a most accessible and plausible character especially in roles like this, where a clever fellow discerns a golden path to riches and sells his soul during the flawed journey.In the IMDB trivia, it is interesting this movie was never funded by US sources, probably because the truth hits a little too close to home, and makes people uncomfortable. As the movie ironically points out, the biggest arms suppliers on the planet are also permanent members of the UN security council.Back to the movie itself. Since it is based on real lords of war and warlords, it's coldly terrifying to see how easy the means for mass murder have been made available across the world. As many have noted, it is far easier to kill from a distance than from up close, giving the killers a false sense of morality and deniability.This movie has aged very well - the insidious arms trade it highlights is as active and lethal today as it was for the last 100 years. As a beloved game series Fallout points out, ""War. War never changes.""",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just An Incredibly Well Made Film,"Apart from the very serious topic, this is just an incredibly well made film. There are many scenes in this movie which stay with you long after the credits have rolled, the darkly funny ones as well as the truly horrific ones, and to me this is something only the best movies ever achieve. Intelligent and stylish: this is one of very few so called ""films with a message"" that I can watch again and again, because it's so cleverly constructed and so beautifully shot and acted.

Just Evil Prevails,"Atop a hillside in Liberia overlooking an impending village massacre once the arms deal settles, Nicolas Cage's Yuri pleads to his conscience rattled brother Vitaly (Jared Leto), ""It is none of our business!"" Writer and Director Andrew Niccol's ""Lord of War"" is all about the big business of war, and the cost of selling one's soul. That lost soul is Yuri Orlov played masterfully by Nicolas Cage. Cage as Yuri also narrates the story. Niccol sets the warped and dark tone in the opening sequence of the manufacture of a bullet to its final destinationso to speak. Yuri comments that there is one firearm for every 12 people in the world. So the question is ""How do we arm the other eleven?"" Niccol's ""Lord of War"" is not so much a clever indictment of humanity, rather an acknowledgment of perhaps humanity's darker nature. In a poignant and chilling realization for Yuri (Cage) he says, ""They say that 'evil prevails when good men fail to act.' It should be 'evil prevails'."" I don't think this is cynicism on Niccol's part, rather only stating what is so given all of history and now. He certainly makes us think from the inside out.Yuri Orlov (Cage) is from a Ukrainian family in Little Odessa, NY. As a young man he has an epiphany witnessing a Russian mafia hit. Being an arms dealer is the path to success. He finds that he also has an innate gift for his chosen profession. He enlists his brother Vitaly (Leto) into the business. ""Lord of War"" traces the Orlov brothers over the course of 20 yearsthrough the end of the Cold War to the advent of terrorist threats and dictatorships in third world countries. Yuri truly becomes the Lord of War supplying arms to anyone and any country for a profit. He also acts as an independent agent for undisclosed countries supplying arms to ""freedom fighters"". One gets the drift. Yuri eventually hits his stride and becomes very successful and very wealthy. He marries his trophy bride, supermodel Ava Fontaine (stunning Bridget Moynahan), has a son, and living in a luxury apartment in Manhattan. All the while he eludes the grasp of Interpol Agent Jack Valentine (very good Ethan Hawke), by keeping three steps ahead. Predictably Yuri's world comes crashing in upon him. In a powerful scene with Ava who purposely ignores what her husband really does for a living, Yuri has a conscience meltdown.The actors in ""Lord of War"" are great. Nicolas Cage is such a powerful and versatile actor. I don't think any other actor than himself, could enroll sympathy as arms dealer Yuri. Cage gives Yuri a subtle detached edge and an expert in context. Cage knows he is in morally bankrupt position, and he uses his smarts and sense of humor to rationalize that he only supplies the weapons to men who do evil. Yuri is the ultimate poster child for ""Guns don't kill people. People kill people."" Jared Leto is surprising as the coke head brother, who eventually cops to the monster he has becomethe counterpoint to Yuri. Bridget Moynahan is deceivingly powerful as Ava, the former model aware that her asset of being pretty is fading, and closes her eyes to what her husband does until it is too late. Moynahan is stunningly beautiful and has distinctive grace and vulnerability. Ethan Hawke as Jack Valentine is the intrepid idealist saving the world from the likes of Yuri. Hawke is very strong and compelling.Andrew Niccol's ""Lord of War"" ends and the world continues on. The echoes of Yuri voice, just ""evil prevails"" is a chilling and poignant reminder. Nicolas Cage is brilliant as the lost soul in ""The Lord of War"". ""The Lord of War"" is one the year's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Surprising Morality Tale,"I was really surprised that Hollywood was able to tackle a huge moral morass like the black market arms trade and leave the moral issues in the audience's lap. Yuri (played by Nicholas Cage) goes to work in a particularly ugly world. When he says that he's had a bad day at the office, you can be pretty sure that someone has been shot or blown up. At any event, what I liked about this picture was that although Yuri obviously has some moral issues to wrestle with, he does so on his own terms, and we are left to figure out the rights and the wrongs. Since most movie-goers don't like to leave a movie with food for thought, this picture may not play very broadly in theaters, but I hope it gets a good audience on video. I also though that Jared Leto was wonderful as Yuri's tragically addicted and unhappy brother.",,Anonymous,Crime
story-telling perfection,"A movie about a gunrunner who arms the dictators, tyrants, and genocide-perpetrators of the world should not be this deliciously funny. Lord of War is story-telling perfection. The opening scene depicts the life of a bullet, from its creation in the factory to the moment it blasts through the head of a poor African child. Nicolas Cage is Yuri Orlov, the son of Ukrainian immigrants, who becomes the world's most successful arms dealer. Writer/director Andrew Niccol took every major world conflict of the part 25 years and seamlessly incorporated them into a smart, funny, complex story about violence, corruption, and the essence of warfare. Lord of War has no clear-cut, black-or-white, good-or-evil ""moral of the story,"" but no intelligent observation ever does. It's just a fabulous film. ""I never sold to Osama Bin Laden,"" Yuri tells the audience. ""Not on moral grounds, but because his checks were always bouncing back then.""",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
No-one seems to age,"A very enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours although over the space of twenty screen years nobody seems to age. The cinematography is fantastic,especially in Africa(some great open landscapes). The most jarring thing for me was a couple of (you can see them coming from a mile away)VERY obvious deaths. The first five minutes are superb, a mini-movie that could be called 'The life of a Bullet'. The soundtrack is also superior to your usual Hollywood movie. Strangely Nicholas Cage should be the 'Bad Guy' but isn't portrayed as such.By the same token Ethan Hawke is a fairly unsympathetic 'good guy'. And are they really his teeth?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Truth About Guns & Wars,"Many people might walk away from this one not feeling ""entertained"" because it's not your typical Hollywood thriller. It's not a ""Feel Good"" movie you should take a date on in the hopes of coming away high on life and hand in hand. It's a movie that'll make you think and might disturb the uninformed viewer who knows little about the politics of war.This is a movie based on actual events (that means it's a movie that has some truth to it). From what I heard the director made quite a bit of research of the gun running world when creating this movie.This movie takes a look at the gun running business through the story of one particular trafficker played by Cage. It goes through two decades of wars & conflicts and how the business and politics of gun running works. Cage is the middle man in that world, who navigates through it very professionally and coolly. Cage's character is made to be likable, but not a hero by any means.Many people may think that this movie depicts certain cultures and races in a bad light, but if you know anything about history and keep up to date with world events you'll understand the truth behind these portrayals.The movie is interesting because it is as close as to a realistic look to arms trafficking as Hollywood could produce without making a documentary. It's refreshing because of this.I hope people see this movie because it very much shows the truth behind how wars are supplied and how the richest nations in the world have done this for the ultimate prize that thing that makes the world go round  Money.The movie as a whole is produced very well and the acting and cinematography is up to par with the type of film it is (as mentioned before, don't expect a big production Hollywood action flick).Don't expect your typical Hollywood ending here either.(I'd compare this movie with Buffalo Soldiers (2001) with Joaquin Phoenix)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another powerful well-made political drama with an excellent story and a powerful performance by Nicolas Cage,"""Lord of War"" is about a man named Yuri (Nicolas Cage) who in the early 80's decides that he doesn't want to just work in a restaurant for the rest of his life and decides that instead he wants to be an arms dealer. Once he makes his first sale, Yuri is hooked on the feeling of making big money for selling firearms, and continues to sell the firearms but he wants more and more of a profit and more and more of a challenge. It's not until an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) is hot on Yuri's case that he begins to question the nature of his business and whether what he is doing for a living is moral and if he should be responsible for the hands these weapons get into and what they are used for. A powerful performance by Nicolas Cage, as well as a great thought-provoking movie ensues I love movies like this one for a few reasons. The main reason is that for the most part you can't predict what is going to happen next or where the film is going. Another reason I like movies like this is because it's powerful and its makes you think. And lastly I like a movie like this because it doesn't end in a typical way and actually leaves you feeling blown-away and surprised.The filmed starred Nicolas Cage who lately has done of some the best work of his career. His performance here is top-notch and powerful. There are so many other people in the film including Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Ethan Hawke and Bridget Moynahan to name a few who are also very good at the roles they played. This film is written and directed by Andre Niccol the same man who wrote ""The Terminal"" and ""The Truman Show"" so I guess I shouldn't be so surprised by why I actually liked this film so much, it had a good lead actor and a good screenwriter.I guess this movie all comes down to how open minded the movie-goers who see this are. I guess it also amounts to where you stand on the political fence. The film is not for those who don't have an open mind about things that are going on in the world today. The movie is based on true events so be warned that some of things shown in the film are happening in real life or did happen at one point in time. To be honest, I do believe what the film states in the end, it doesn't seem at all far fetched. It's like Yuri says in the film ""it's not our war and no matter what we do we can't stop it"" and that's true it's like smoking kills people every day but there are people who run cigarette companies everyday knowing that they are killing people every single day and getting people addicted to something that in the end will kill them. Is that moral? What can we do to stop it? These are questions this film asks and leaves it to the viewer to decide on.So in the end, this movie isn't for everyone. In a sense this film is kind of like the movie ""Blow"" because it's about a man who feels his life isn't complete without selling something that is bad. He has everything he could ever want but still needs to sell the firearms. It's an amazing and powerful story which I feel really puts things in perspective as far as us Americans look at things. Nicolas Cage's performance is incredible as he seems to not care at all for the people's lives he puts at stake every day and when it comes to his own life he still seems unemotional and doesn't seem to worry. Personally I think this is one of the best film's of year and is in fact just as good as the other political drama currently released called ""The Constant Gardner"" so if you have an open mind about things and enjoy movies that will make you think, well check out ""Lord of War"" because it's well worth the price of admission at the theater.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Lord of War"" is a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Interesting but unsatisfying.,"This is a quick moving film, jumping from anecdote to anecdote as we see Yuri expand his empire, taking bigger risks as he does so.The acting is OK, Cage is understated in the lead and the rest of the cast have little to do.The story is very dark and cynical, you could see it as the absolute pinnacle of capitalism laid bare, no morals just money.There are some nice flashes of humour in Yuri's escapes from the police.I found the film a bit hard to get into, the situations are bizarre but not really funny, the characters aren't interesting and the narration is unemotional.The ending is better than I expected, very cynical.It is almost a good film but there is something missing that makes it feel too clinical.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Nicolas Cage,"Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is an Ukrainian immigrant living Little Odessa in New York. Vitaly (Jared Leto) is his brother. His dream girl is the neighborhood beauty queen Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan). After witnessing a gangland hit, he decides to start selling weapons along with his brother. Meanwhile, he's being hounded by incorruptible Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) and fellow gunrunner Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm).I love the matter-of-factness to Cage's narration. The story is fascinating and spans the world. But it's Cage that sells it. He still has the charm. Before you realize it, you're rooting for an amoral death dealer, a Lord of War. Jared Leto is terrific as the drugged out brother who's struggling with more than his addiction. This is one of the better black comedies with an anti-gun message.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent expose on the evil arms trade.,"A kind of dark comedy concerning a crazy, rogue arms trader (Nicholas Cage) and delivers one of his best ever performances (in a film quite like no other). It contains a very serious message throughout and some highly quotable lines to, such as ""The 'AK-47' being the biggest weapon of mass destruction, as it's killed more than anything else"". The tile is a clever word play and a featured mad dictator who gets everything backwards, such as ""Bath of Blood"", instead of 'Bloodbath' and ""Lord of War"" replacing 'Warlord' and so on. Has a ring of a terrible truth, with death, destruction and murder, being such a lucrative trade.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good Outline,"Uri Orlov (Cage) is an arms dealer who has no conscience and he does this work, why? Because he is good at it. And, if he didn't do it, someone else would. Pays pretty good too.This is a good outline of someone who is an arms dealer. I say outline because it assumes we know a lot of things: how does he pay for the arms; where are the arms stored; how do they get from one location to another? I am sure there are more questions but you get the idea. Do we really need to know all the details? Probably not, but I say they should be addressed and not have the movie jump all around to show that he deals in the mid-East as well as Russia and Africa. If one instance was completely shown in the movie I think we can make a leap as to what the other deals involved. And, the movie does jump all around. Probably by design to keep us from getting the popcorn we craved when we first sat down.However, I like Nicolas Cage and this is still a good movie despite too much jumping around from one location to another. He is an excellent actor and we do get the idea what this movie is all about. Where the movie could have saved itself more would have been to add more suspense and tension. There wasn't enough. It's entertaining and there are some very good lines in here or if you prefer, witticisms or truths may be an even better word.The ending is somewhat of a shocker, but when you think about it, maybe not.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lord of war: Great film seeming to receive bad reviews by dense critics,"I felt this movie & the actors/actresses did their parts at portraying the turmoils of a man unable to escape his addiction in a dog eat dog world. Nicholas Cage's role of a ""gunrunner"" sheds light to subjects otherwise not focused on by todays society. Too often do films dull down the truth of life. The term ""speechless"" comes to me when i think of what one word to describe this film. Cage does a wonderful job of keeping his guard up and showing how strong and selfless one must be to do what no one else will. Despite the graphic nature of the subject and reality behind how corrupt this world is; This movie is not the catalyst for out-lash. It's simply a great film.

Lord of War  is the Lord of Movies this year.,"Yuri Orlov(Nicolas Cage) tells his humorous, disturbing, and tragic story of coming from nothing to becoming the greatest gun-runner in the world.Lord of War could not have been made better. The narration by cage was not only hysterical but when needed to be, emotional. The acting was the best this year. Cage showed me that he could find a character that actually fit him and the supporting cast with Jared Leto and Bridget Moynahan was incredible. I have never seen a movie that was so funny and so dramatic since my viewing of American Beauty.The writing was beautiful. There is nothing more to say about it. It was just B-e-a-t-i-f-u-l. The movie is also very entertaining which can't be said about most dramatic movies but then again this movie is more than just dramatic, it's in it's own category! The story is gripping and makes you want Cage to succeed in his illegal actions after you have seen the other side of his criminal lifestyle. It characterizes every day warlords to the point where you understand them and sympathize for them and maybe even blame the American government due to fact that it is based on actual events. Overall, the movie was incredible and honestly one of the best this year.I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hello to arms.,"'Lord of War (2005)' is kind of like an audio book read by Nic Cage. Rather than a film featuring narration, it's narration featuring a film. I'd wager that around three quarters off it is told via Cage's sardonic voice-over, which naturally takes quite a bit of steam out of the narrative. The endless exposition is only occasionally witty or well-considered, typically residing somewhere in the spectrum of lazy writing. The story is also bizarrely paced, moving at a clip but never really saying anything of value (all the more ironic due to the never-ending narration). Its amoral anti-hero's rise to the top of the arms trade is kept largely off screen, an odd choice which further reduces the tangibility of his arc. The picture's insistence that it's based on actual events had me wondering whether it was an adaptation (or, rather, translation) of a book, which wouldn't excuse its wordiness but would go some way in explaining it. However, the actual events it's based on aren't much more specific than ""arms deals happen"". The movie isn't adapted from any existing material, so its execution is all the more baffling. Though the incredibly bleak underlying message of the flick is solid, it isn't hammered home as much as it should've been. The plot sort of goes around in circles and hits the same beats several times. Its satire isn't all that sharp, either; in fact, most of the affair is played entirely straight, despite its moments of deadpan absurdity. At the eleventh hour, the flick elects to include some commentary about the fact that it's actually the USA, UK, France, Russia and China that do most of the world's arms dealing, which is an interesting concept that never gets the time it needs to properly develop. Everything prior to that focuses on Cage's grotty little salesman, who provokes little more than a modicum of empathy due to his total lack of morals. The feature isn't afraid to go dark, which occasionally leads to some bracing sequences. Also, it comes into its own as it gets deeper into its second act, with scenes that include actual dialogue and even some tension. The opening title sequence is emblematic of - and arguably more effective than - the entire affair, a concise and entirely visual representation of a single bullet's lifespan. The feature is reportedly rather realistic, too, and the horrors of its subject matter are undeniably affecting. The fact that it was cheaper for the production to procure stockpiles of real AK-47s rather than prop ones tells you all you need to know about the arms trade. Having said that, the film itself doesn't feel especially anti-gun. That's a shame, because surely that's the only real takeaway from something like this. Of course, it wouldn't change the minds of gun-lovers even if it was, but it may at least have made them think about the weapons they cherish. Ultimately, this is an intermittently successful but mostly flat attempt at depicting an irredeemable arms trader's rise to power. It's never boring or anything like that, but it's only truly entertaining on occasion and it's narration gets on your nerves.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A pleasant surprise,"I saw the thumbnail for the film, believing it to be a shitty Direct-to- video action film. What a surprise I was in for! Instead of a few good laughs at the expense of Good ol' Nick Cage, I got an intelligent and exciting drama detailing the moral implications of the arms trade and the way it affects the lives of those involved. In fact, it was one of the best movies I had ever seen, in my opinion. One of the most underseen, underrated, and under-understood (I couldn't think of one for this) films ever made. The cinematography was beautiful, the soundtrack was haunting, the writing was sharp, clever, and witty, and the film was full of great performances from Leto, Hawke, and even Cage himself. Truly, in my opinion, as close a film to cinematic perfection as I have yet to see. 10/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Well-meaning, but a lot too much.","I'm amused by the reviewer who referred to Andrew Niccol as a 'new starter'. Not only is he of course a well-seasoned filmmaker, he has a reputation for exactly this kind of film. However, this is where Lord of War fails.While there's much in this film to be applauded, both stylistically and in terms of its overall message, unfortunately with regard to the latter it's far too much of a blunt instrument. Where this doesn't compare favourably with Niccol's other notable moral tale, Gattacca, is the complete lack of emotional engagement with the characters.A worthy and certainly purposeful moral is fine, but it's no good unless it comes to the screen through the experience of characters we care about. What engages the film viewer is the personal narrative, not the explanation, and this film is just full of explanation, with very little story. I'm always a little worried when a film begins with first-person narration, and in this instance my worry was justified. Cage's voice-over arises throughout, and despite a periodical nicely poetic turn, it never strays from the boringly pedagogic. We get it already, guns are bad, and the people who sell them sell their souls to ignore the effect they have. Would that this had been put much, much more succinctly and with greater dramatic effect.Testament to this problem is the simple proportion of the story dedicated to the protagonist's family. His wife's eventual betrayal of him to the authorities packs no emotional punch whatsoever - it's just an inevitable outcome with no resonance for the character. His son is nothing more than a plot point, a foil for a throwaway comment about an African child of the same age who is butchered by soldiers while Uri seals an arms deal with them. Again, it packs no emotional punch, because we simply don't know his son.If further evidence were needed of the story's shortcomings, the Ethan Hawke character, a morally upright lawman on Uri's case, personifies this. Again, there is no sense of any emotional purpose to the character. Why is he so obsessed with Uri? Why does he need to pursue this world of shady arms deals? What is his reason for despising this world of amoral jiggery-pokery so? His explanation when he has Uri sat in cuffs by his grounded freight plane is nothing more than trite, hollow statistics. It sounds like so many cold, numbers-driven political objections. They may be perfectly just, but they are not real, not, at least, when it comes to the motivation of someone so apparently obsessed with changing an evil practice like this. The reasons we do things are not the reasons why they are wrong, but the reasons why they matter TO US. None of it mattered to me, the viewer, a chronic shortcoming with something that so obviously matters.While it would take an unusual individual to disagree with the general message of this film, it would also take someone especially unaware not to have grasped that message within about the first three minutes, indeed, by the end of the opening sequence. What we get, then, is another hundred minutes of making the same point. The power of drama, and perhaps of film especially, is in translating meaning, purpose, truth, through the filmmaker's skill, into an emotionally or comically engaging story, one that we care about by virtue of what it is, not the message it presents. The message is obvious enough - the benefit of film is its ability to make people care about the people involved. Lord of War critically fails to do this. So concerned is it with conveying a message that is untarnished and unmistakable, that it forgets that it is supposed to be about real people, strong characters, in real emotional, psychological and moral jeopardy. It's a shame that it didn't manage this.Gattacca is one of the great films of our time, exactly because we do care about Vincent, and because his rebellion against an amoral world is intensely personal. The Truman Show stands out as a wonderful piece of modern questioning about our world, our perception, our view of who and what we are. But both of these films of Niccol's managed sufficiently to blend an earnest moral with succinct, colourful, emotionally dramatic and sometimes comical personal stories. They left room for the viewer to find the message, and to care about it all the more because it came through the medium of characters who mattered. This is left behind almost completely in Lord of War, and it fails far too obviously. It's a shame.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Interesting film by a new starter, Andrew Niccol","Lord of War is about an arms dealer named Yuri Orlov who confronts the morality of his work while being chased by an Interpol agent. This is a very interesting film brought by director and writer of the film, Andrew Niccol (Gattaca). This is another great film of his that will boost up his career even more. Nicolas Cage puts up another great performance of the year and although his acting is very ostentatious, his narrating just like in The Weather Man, which came out a couple months later, is perfect. The dialogue is very good and the script couldn't be any better. Most of all, I clearly gave respect to Andrew Niccol, because honestly, he deserves the most credit out of any one who worked on the film. My hat goes off for him.

"Great Movie -- Similar to ""The Godfather""","This was a great movie. Cage delivered on the ""anti-hero"" - a 21st century ""Corleone"".The locations were cool and ""spectacular"". From a visual standpoint this movie really does take you around the world. New York, Russia, Libya, Libera, etc. This movie is shot very, very well.The pacing of the movie is brisk, the scenes aren't morose. Like Platoon, this movie doesn't glamorize or demonize situations. A guy who sells weapons for a living meets some violent people in some violent places. The visual style is breathtaking . . .What I like best is, no characters in the movie are ""romanticized"". There are no ""good guys"". One could make the case that there are no ""bad guys"" as well I suppose. There are people who do bad things for reasons you don't understand. There are people who do nothing when they should do something for reasons you don't understand. Its a pretty accurate depiction of real life :)I think I might have rated the movie 8.5, if there were any other movies at all about this topic that were anywhere in its league. If you make a great ""Legally Blond"", that's nice. If you make a great movie about arms trading with a sold antihero and supporting characters, I figure you get ""extra credit"".I think you're a fool if you miss this movie. Its not about Iraq. Its not particularly political. This movie could have been made under any president in the last 100 years and been just as accurate. Its not particularly anti-gun. Its just about this guy who sells guns.On the other hand, don't take people to this movie if they can't handle violence or movies that aren't designed to make them ""feel good"" when they walk out.

Only the tip of the iceberg...,"I had to revisit this flick after a chain of certain recent events. While this movie is based on a true story, it's not THE true story... THE true story is far worse than this. This is a diluted version of reality, because people would not have the stomach for the full, real truth.Aside from that, the movie is fantastic, and very entertaining. They managed to tell a story of a true monster, with a palpable lightheartedness.In reality, the movie is inspired by Viktor Anatolyevich Bout aka the Merchant of Death, but not an actual story of his life. What this movie doesn't mention is the number of innocent people this man killed. He is responsible for conspiring to start wars with other arms dealers and ex-Soviet military officers.In addition, and worst of all, is that his weapons not only killed millions of Africans, they have directly killed thousands of American, French, British, Canadian, German, Italian, Israeli, Jordanian, Kuwaiti, Indian, Australian, Georgian, Estonian, Egyptian, South African, New Zealander, Pakistani, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Swedish, Iranian, Saudi, Philippine, Cuban, Brazilian, and many others, on various humanitarian, peacekeeping, anti-terrorist, law enforcement, etc, persons, who were innocent, or fighting organized crime, genocide, terrorism, slavery, human trafficking, drug trafficking, piracy, and all kinds of other dark and evil people.And after all he did, this SCUMBAG CRETIN - this walking demon, the devil in the flesh, is now back home in his motherland Russia, sipping vodka with his pals in the Kremlin, laughing at the west, thanks to *** ***** aka ''10% To The Big Guy'', who set him free in exchange for a pothead basketball playing lezzbo that tramples the American flag, of whom is less valuable to humanity than a rusted can of beans, who tried to smuggle illegal drugs into Russia.

"A 'Stylish"" Look At Arms Dealing","This was a very pleasant surprise, far better than I had ever hoped, filled with fabulous cinematography and riveting story about the life of arms dealer during the 1980s and '90s.It was an interesting film, to say the least, and Nicholas Cage was terrific as the lead character, ""Yuri Orlov."" I loved his narration, too. How much of what he said is true, I have no idea, but it's fascinating stuff. Don't believe a lot of it, even when they tell you it is ""based"" on true events. Most of still can (and usually) is made up for dramatic purposes.I felt those visuals, combined with the outstanding acting and always-interesting story made this a good film. It also proved you don't need action every two minutes to keep a film involving for the audience. This has just the right amount of drama, suspense, action, romance and, yes, even humor.With all the political comments made here in the narration I was wondering if I was going to hear the typical Democrat whine and sure enough, late in the film a comment is made regarding the 2000 elections. The liberals still can't get over losing, fair and square. They just can't accept that. This is about the fifth time I've heard this in 2007 films although at least time, the guy making the absurd statement was the Liberian dictator.....but it really was the film maker, of course. Despite that, and the very pessimistic storyline that evil always wins in the world. According to Bible of ""Yuri,"" in the end, the meek won't inherit the earth; the arms dealers will and that evil rules, so why fight it and yourself over it. Wow, what uplifting words to live by.Outside of Yuri's wife ""Ava"" (Bridget Moynahan) and the man who pursues him, ""Jack Valentine"" (Ethan Hawke) no one in here has much in the way of high-ground morals. At least they made the lawman an honest; that's rare in films today.Jared Leto plays Cage's brother ""Vitaly"" and plays his standard slime-ball character. Wow, this guy is becoming the male Jennifer Jason Leigh, regarding sleazy roles. Everyone was solid in here, from the Americans to the Russians the Africans....and all intriguing people. Ian Holm as rival arms dealer ""Simeon Weisz"" deserves mention.Amir Mokri is the cinematographer and Andrew Niccol, the director, who combined to make this movie look so stylish and beautiful to see. Looking at Mokri's resume, I see he's done a number of stylish films. Niccol hasn't directed much but what he has also offers interesting visuals.Looking at the front and back cover of the DVD might make you think this is just another of these brainless action flicks, but it is not. This is solid film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

just remember - he never sold to Osama Bin Laden,"Nicholas Cage stars with Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke, Ian Holm, and Bridget Moynahan in ""The Lord of War,"" a 2005 film directed and written by Andrew Niccol.Cage plays Yuri Orlov, who comes from the Ukraine with his family and settles in Brooklyn. He goes on to become the biggest arms dealer in the world, with the law (Ethan Hawke) on his trail, constantly trying to get something on him. Yuri has everything - money, the woman of his dreams (Moynahan), a son, and a thriving business. But as he says himself, ""There are two types of tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want, the other is getting it."" The main character is based on a real-life arms dealer, Viktor Bout, who was finally arrested in 2008 during a sting operation and convicted in Manhattan in 2011 of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens.Despite its chilling subject matter, ""Lord of War"" manages to be funny at times, with brilliant dialogue -- and no easy answers. Narrated by the main character, we see the violence, the terror, the politics, and the corruption all around war and arms deals. Yuri tells us, ""I never sold to Osama Bin Laden. Not on moral grounds, it's just that his checks kept bouncing back then."" How it's possible to make any part of this film funny, I don't know, but Niccol gives us some great lines to remember. The humor is mostly in the beginning; later on, the film becomes deadly serious, almost like Yuri himself. It starts with selling a gun in his room for extra money; later, he's sitting with heads of countries.As the cynical Yuri, Nicholas Cage is fabulous and makes you like him despite his profession and the fact that he starts down a slippery slope and keeps sliding. Jared Leto does a fantastic job as his coked-up brother and partner Vitaly, who, when faced with the reality of what they're doing, has feelings about it not entertained by Yuri. Yuri remains detached; it takes the drug addict to see arming so-called ""freedom fighters"" for what it is.A very different kind of movie, beautifully acted and produced, that gives one a lot of food -- and ammunition -- for thought.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Starts with a promise but doesnot hold up,"It starts as a promising movie. Nicolas Cage as Yuri leaves a good impression at the beginning and it looks like on of those black comic films which do highlight a serious problem but doesn't take themselves too seriously. Something like Wolf of Wall Street. At the beginning it had that feel, but overdoes of morality and a sense of leaving a message at the end killed the movie. Somewhere along the way writer developed a sense of morality and abruptly tries to change the track which does effect the story line and kill it. There seems to be a rush to end the film that too at a very different note where it started i.e. making an un-apologetic gum smuggler feel guilty. If don well and more gradually it might have worked, but the way all of a sudden, a wife that never questioned her husband's source of money developing a sense of morality, killing his brother to bring a scenario of doom seemed like an afterthought. The worst were last 10 mins in which the power of his connections is exhibited. Overall well acted movie with good dialogs and good first half but weak ending to the story which kills the movie",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
LORD OF WAR...A WINDOW INTO HUMANITY's DARK SIDE!,"If You LOVE Cinematic ""ONIONS"".... LORD is Your Movie!But Before diving in... FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title's Content and Context...Here is a film that presents a portrait of some of our least favorable attributes. Things that, in some dark recess of our consciousness, we know very well exist, but somehow make us feel uneasy to contemplate the light of day. Also, I think Lord of War appeals to fans of films that require the use of gray matter and applied consciousness.Lord of War is based on a true story.... Clearly, a striking example that reality is often far stranger than fiction. Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a Ukrainian-American who walks aimlessly through life. When he witnesses a failed kidnapping attempt at a Ukrainian restaurant in Little Odessa resulting in the death of the two murderers, Orlov has a kind of demonic epiphany: People simply cannot live without weapons to kill their neighbors!!Andrew Niccol (The Terminal, The Truman Show, Gattaca) that in addition to his role of director, has written and produced ""LORD"" ... quite a versatile man, most definitely! Like his compatriot, Peter Jackson, Niccol is an example of the growing influence of New-Zealanders in Hollywood. And here, he shows us a film that is in no way easy to catalog! Protagonist Orlov is a man whose entire life is a lie, and like many who lead a double life, Yuri Orlov ends up believing totally the myth in which he has enveloped himself!!!So as to reveal no more than necessary, suffice to say that in its last half hour, there are some interesting surprises. Nicolas Cage deserves special recognition, not only for his excellent work here, but for the maturity he has shown lately in his choice of subject matter and tone! After several years of appearing predominately in action-flavored movies, it seems Cage has opted to change course a little. With LORD of WAR, he has made a very wise choice.ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!!Any comments, questions or observations, in ENGLISH ....o en ESPAÑOL, are most welcome!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Despite the weaknesses inherent in the delivery and approach, this is an engaging and slick film on an important and depressing issue","As a boy in Brighton Beach, Yuri Orlov realises that, while some people open restaurants because all men will need to eat, other men sell guys becomes man will always want to kill. Starting out in a grubby hotel room selling a single gun, Yuri uses his local connections to increase his trade. The end of the Cold War opened up huge stocks of weapons to be illegally skimmed off and sold abroad and soon all of Yuri's dreams are coming true  even his childhood infatuation with Ava Fontaine. However as his reputation and sales grow he comes under pressure form two forces closing in on him; one is a determined government agent Jack Valentine, the other is the morality of the business he has made his own.Whether or not it is based on a true story or not, the truth inherent in the material to make it an impacting and engaging story. The opening credits tell the whole story and it is shame that it never gets as good as the moments where we follow a bullet from the factory to the skull of a child somewhere in Africa. However the reason it doesn't is because the gun trade isn't as simple as evil men doing evil things  it is a business and it is a business that my own elected officials in the UK are a major part of. So although it makes for a weaker film in some ways, it deserves credit for not offering any easy answers (or indeed any answers) and offers up this world in a way that is sickeningly convincing and yet realistic. The plot relies heavily on the slick delivery that is told from Yuri's point of view and totally in flashback. It does fragment the film and prevent the development of characters and depth but it does keep things moving well and allows Niccol to make his points well. As a result some of the narrative threads are dull (Yuri's relationship with his wife is weak) but it does achieve what it sets out to achieve, which is a fast ride through the world illegal arms trading.Those who have caught Mark Thomas' shows will know that there are sharper vehicles that this subject has been handled in and indeed the film could have been more impact, funnier and darker but for a Hollywood film I can forgive it because it does tackle an unusual subject. This buys it some leeway but not all the weaknesses can be overlooked and some viewers may tire of the pace and delivery of the film before it is over. The cast are mostly caught up in the film rather than playing it because they are not allowed the time to develop or emote. As the story is his, Cage does dominate. It isn't a great performance but it works and he pitches his character well neither moral or immoral, just doing business and earning money just like everyone else. Moynahan does well with what little she is given but Leto is asked a lot of and cannot deliver it convincingly. Holm and Hawke deserve credit for adding their names to this ""issue"" film but other than that they don't add a great deal. Walker is a solid presence as Baptiste even if he is a bit one dimensional a character.This is not a perfect film then, mainly because the flow and stylish delivery means that points are made in a sweeping rather than targeted fashion, while depth and character development are left to one side. However it is engaging because the subject is an emotive one and it is hard to be disinterested. Mark Thomas has done it better (and will do it better) but it is praiseworthy for a Hollywood film with such clout to raise awareness of the issue and it is a good film even if it does have these problems throughout.",,Anonymous,Crime

Nic Cage should have seen some award recognition. I say the same for Ethan Hawke. He truly played the gritty cop part well.This is just one powerful, underrated movie.

Stuck in the hands of corruption.,"Lord of War is a simple of example of how corrupt the world is from the view of an arms dealer, and how money doesn't solve everything, rather, how money can drain the person's morality but then drains him himself completely.Nicolas Cage's flawless acting which suited the arms dealer persona very well is a principal in this movie, and without it, I wouldn't even have liked the protagonist, or rather, the antagonist, you can't distinguish who's good and who's bad anymore.

"Stunning performance, solid underlying message, great movie","It's not every day that Amnesty International endorses a movie.Lord of War is a cynical and nihilistic look at the arms dealing industry. The film does meticulous work covering every aspect of the industry. No apologies made for any controversy portrayed.The movie is well researched and the conflicts are all real. Some real-life names are different. but the details to smuggling methods and weapons smuggled were enlightening. Special commentary on the brutality of the trade was also eye-opening.But, overambition did drag this Lord of Wardown a bit. This film seeks to cram too much information. Some plot points seem forced and the story changes flow often. But I'd rather have a film telling me too much than too little.Also, another issue I had with Lord of War was that there were a few inaccuracies. The opening factory scene, for example, is not how real bullets are made. The beginning CGI was also a bit aged in some aspects. Some guns described were inaccurate. But these mistakes are forgivable since it didn't take too much away from the movie.I'd rate this film a 4/5. Highly recommended and worth a revisiting. A modern remake would do this film justice. Out of the many movies Nicolas Cage is in, this is one of my more favorite movies starring him.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Uber-restrained Cage,"Nicolas Cage has had an up and down career over the ages - well, mainly 'down' these day, but, back when he could still headline a movie that wasn't released straight-to-DVD, he did 'Lord of War.' It's mainly a drama, but there are certainly elements of satire and almost black comedy sprinkled liberally here and there. Cage plays your average lovable international arms dealer who's happily selling weapons of mass destruction around the world while enjoying the fruits of his efforts (much to the disapproval of a long-suffering Interpol agent, played by Ethan Hawke, who's constantly hot on his trail).There's a reason Nicolas Cage won an Oscar and could prop up even the weakest of scripts with his acting ability and here it shines through. It's definitely one of his last (best) films where the whole show lies upon his shoulders. Granted, he's got a bit of a reputation of - how best to put this - going a little 'over the top' with his acting performances, however, here he's actually pretty restrained compared to some of he previous output.Even though it's Nic's show through and through, there is a pretty decent cast around him. Besides the already-mentioned Ethan Hawke (who's not in it as much as he probably should be), there's also Jared Leto and Ian Holm, both who put in good performances considered the amount of screen-time they're afforded. Cage's on-screen wife is played by Bridget Moynahan who has little to do but look hard done by due to her husband's dodgy lifestyle choices.It's full of social satire and statements about the way we (as Western nations, I guess) live and run our countries, plus the impact the arms trade (whether it be legal, or Nicolas Cage's way of doing it) has on the countries such weapons end up in the hands of. It's also pretty dark in places and doesn't pull any punches. Just because the majority of the violence caused by such weapons is cleverly edited out, we can get the full horror of the regimes who desire to buy illegal weapons such as machine guns and grenades.It's hardly an uplifting film, but Cage does what he does best and makes it worth a re-watch or two with his charming portrayal of someone who deliberately blinds himself to the horrors of what he's doing, simply to further his own lavish lifestyle - hardly a heroic protagonist, but then I guess that's what the film's trying to say.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
What am I Missing?,"Cage stars as a rags to riches gunrunner whose lack of scruples leads him into interactions with civil war and unrest all around the world. Cage is there to profit off of all of them. But as his world starts to crumble around him, will Cage learn from his past? To be honest, I was a little shocked by the positive reviews from critics and audiences alike when I went onto the IMDb page after watching the movie. Was I watching the same film? There's not much going on here. The plot is glued together loosely by a series of wars throughout the world and the ever present Nick Cage. The editing in this movie left me scratching my head. Am I suppose to feel bad for Cage's wife and child I've seen for all of two minutes? I guess the message of this movie is we as a society need to focus more on stopping gun sales that help start civil wars and genocides but the film does a poor job of getting its point across.The cinematography is fine but nothing spectacular. The constant voice over from Cage is unnecessary, made worst by the face that Cage was sleepy when read his lines. I was already rolling my eyes by the time the intro of the bullet was over. This movie thought it was a lot smarter than it turned out to be which is unfortunate for the audience.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Important, brilliant, disgusting","You know how when you watch a regular American action movie and you think that the morals of the hero are stupid? Sometimes you even wish that the ""bad guy"" would win. Well, this movie meets half way. The main character, Yuri Orlov, is not a nice guy. He is an arms dealer who deals weapons illegally to war lords. As a matter of fact he IS the ""bad guy"" in the movie. Not the BADDEST guy. The real bad guys are, of course, the warlords(the warlord in Liberia is particularly nasty). You don't see much of the good guy in this movie. Anyway, the good guys name is Jack Valentine. His mission in life is to stop guys like Yuri. The best and most realistic aspect of this movie is that no one wins. I'm not going to offer any spoilers. Let's just leave it at that. In a way, you can say that the bad guy wins. But he is a REALLy bad guy; you don't want people like that winning anything.

Lord of War combines political commentary with entertainment and does it well,"Based on that premise that this movie was anti-gun, I really wrestled with my conscience: But I couldn't urge a boycott without knowing more about the movie, so I reluctantly bought my ticket.Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is the man destined to become the titular Lord of War. But in his early years, he's searching for a mission. Yuri and his family immigrated from Ukraine and settled in Brighton. Yuri isn't satisfied. Neither his is younger brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto).In his early 20's, Yuri remains uncommitted until the day he witnesses a hit by the Russian mafia and is stricken with the notion that people open restaurants because other people will always need to eat, and that people buy guns because people will always want or need to kill.As his business grows, Yuri brings Vitaly into the venture. Vitaly soon finds himself addicted to drugs, while Yuri, has another obsession: Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), a beautiful model he's worshipped for years.Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) isn't fooled by Yuri's pretenses. Unfortunately, he can't back up what he knows with the evidence to prove it. Yuri's business grows until the Soviet Union falls and offers him the biggest windfall he's ever had. Yuri is able to entice the bloodthirsty president of Liberia, Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker), with a buffet of weaponry.Yuri's wealth grows by leaps and bounds as does his reputation; but he stands to lose much as his lifestyle grows more dangerous both to himself and to those around him.Although the main characters and storyline are fiction, director and screenwriter, Andrew Niccol points out that almost all of the events depicted in the film have actual real life precedents, and Yuri is a composite of five arms dealers. The civil wars and violence in Liberia that extend from 1980 to the present are real. So, obviously, is the fall of the Soviet Union and subsequent looting of weapons (some $32 billion on arms from Ukraine alone are estimated to have been stolen from 1982 to 1992). Although there are moments when Niccol's script does get preachy, it's based in truth and conveys that truth in a realistic and impactful way.Nicolas Cage is never less than very, very good; Jared Leto, too, is good. Bridget Moynahan is,well cast as the beautiful and naive Ava, and Eamonn Walker is positively menacing as the capricious Baptiste. Ethan Hawke has little screen time, but is just fine, and Ian Holm once again brings his considerable experience to bear as a genteel and yet ruthless international arms dealer.Lord of War is violent, to be sure, and virtually all of that violence involves guns. But in fairness, virtually all of the violence in countries such as Afghanistan and Liberia does involve firearms. The commentary offered by the film as a whole is far less anti-gun than it is against the immorality  or worse, the amorality  of those who would sell to all comers even knowing the end result will involve massacres rather than defense, and genocide instead of any noble cause. And the movie is honest enough to place blame on those legitimate political regimes that export weapons of war even as it highlights the culpability of individual arms dealers whose very business is death.The production values are superb (filmed on location in New York City, South Africa, and the Czech Republic, the backgrounds add considerably to the reality of the film); the direction and editing are good (pay particular attention to the opening sequence of the movie involving the life of a bullet from manufacture to gunshot, all depicted from the point of the bullet). The script is dramatic, but with surprising moments of genuine humor (it has a few moments where the writer is obviously trying much too hard, but thankfully they truly are few). Better still, while entertaining, Lord of War offers some educational value I've not seen available anywhere else. As such, I'm pleasantly surprised to find I'm recommending you see the movie rather than suggesting any boycotts.POLITICAL NOTES: Given its storyline, the political implications of Lord of War are many.In the least sense, there are two moments in the film that seem to address some anti-gun sentiment directly. But these two moments  one of them regrettable in its naivité  aren't enough to warrant a boycott.On a much larger scale, the political machinations behind many of these supposedly independent gun runners is shocking. Remember that the penultimate scene in the movie is based on a true. It's also ironic to note the fact that the world's five biggest arms dealers are nations, not individuals and that (here's the ironic part) those five are the five members of the UN Security Council (as an aside, does that begin to illustrate to you just what a farce the UN really is?).Those who most violate the humanity of others with their guns would do so if they had to use sticks and stones (or the machetes we see in one particularly horrifying scene). The bottom line is that getting rid of the guns would do nothing to stop the fighting. To pretend that eliminating guns will eliminate the problem is both naive and entirely ignorant of the facts; worse, getting rid of the guns would make any defense against the bad guys impossible.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Lord of War is rated R for ""strong violence, drug use, language and sexuality."" Some of the violence is graphic, as is the drug use. I wouldn't recommend Lord of War for those under 16. But the mature, Lord of War offers much to talk about. Frankly, talking a little more about political realities like these couldn't hurt anybody, and might actually improve in some small way some of the awful circumstances found around the world.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lord of Bore,"""Lord of War"" is a very well made film. There really isn't much wrong with it, except I never really cared about the subject matter or any of the characters.The ad for this film is a bit deceiving, in that it makes it look like it is a comedy. There are a few funny one liners, but most of those are used in the ad. The film is steeped in sarcasm, which is sometimes funny, but in the end the film is kind of depressing and tries to make a serious point about the world's munitions distribution.Nicolas Cage plays a munitions supplier with a personality of a door to door salesman. He has no morals and justifies his profession by saying that ""somebody has to do it."" The only likable character in the film is the Interpol agent played by Ethan Hawke, but he is only in the film for about 10 minutes.I would have liked this film a lot more if the lead character was more sympathetic. Because of that, it was hard to really care what happened to him. Still, this is not a bad film and it does have wit and sarcasm on a serious issue.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Incredibly well made...though certainly NOT a film for everyone.,"Wild opening sequence from standpoint of bullet on assembly line.Narrated throughout by Yuri.""Lord of War"" manages to do something very rare with movies...it tells the story of an evil, despicable person and you can't stop watching. Normally, when the protagonist in a movie is evil the film is tough to watch and is tough to enjoy. But the style and writing make this one to watch.Nicholas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian-American arms dealer with little in the way of conscience or a soul. He sells to ANYONE and doesn't care about the consequences. All he cares about is money and power. And, sadly, this is a true story!The reason to watch the film is the writing and style. The entire movie is narrated by Yuri...and the dialog is brilliant as well. Often, a bit comical...but also often deadly serious and awful. Cage is also wonderful in this role...and it's one of the better ones of his career. Well worth seeing, though it is a tough film in some ways...with a few very violent scenes. Think twice before watching or allowing your kids to watch! But if you do, prepare to be mesmerized.By the way, what DID happen to Yuri after he was jailed? Well, Yuri was actually based on several arms merchants...so much of the story is fiction. However, one of the worst of these killers, Viktor Bout, was released by the US recently in exchange for that lady basketball star caught in Russia with pot. It sure didn't seem like an even exchange and the consequences of this exchange are pretty horrific.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Acting and Direction Make Up for a Weak Plot,"I remember seeing ""Lord of War"" once, but the temptation to go back and look at the scenes and the action was just too hard to resist not seeing it again. The acting by the cast and the direction by Andrew Niccol was pretty good I would've given ""Lord of War"" a higher grade, but there were some minor hiccups that lowered my expectations that this is a masterpiece of classic drama.The casting overall was excellent all around. But the real weak link in the movie has to go to the leading actor. Nicolas Cage. Cage lacks in panache and drive for us to get a better comprehension to the character of Ukrainian weapons dealer Yuri Orolov. His accent was not very accurate and no Ukrainian was even spoken. Russian was utilized in the movie, but the on-and -off accent by Cage will miff you when Cage's weak attempt at a Ukrainian accent makes you unconvinced that he is of Ukrainian extraction.Another flaw that shrugged me was that director Andrew Niccol who has impressively reverted back to the trials and tribulations of Russian Cold War dramas, but there is no real Russian language used in the movie as they speak very sporadically in terms of words only to more frequently speak English with a very strong undecipherable Russian accent. Therefore, the culture of the story is not very convincing in spite of the user friendly intentions.The casting was wonderful overall. The one I was impressed with the most was Eamonn Walker's portrayal of Andre Baptiste which is a homage to Liberian Charels Taylor his semi psychotic presence was so chilling it will leave a lasting impression for a long time to come. One of the best props I have ever seen was his son's car which is made of pure gold and has a Kalichnikov. The film's locations and globe hopping in the style of Bond, Bourne and Hunt are so amazing, it gives you the feeling you're being dragged in for the ride.To summarize, ""Lord of War"" was an excellent movie that will entertain you very immensely. Sure it wasn't perfect and at times some editing needed some work, but that could easily be forgiven. Even if you're not a action guru, you'll be impressed with memorable acting from the ensemble that deserve our applaud.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One Of Cage's best movies!,"**** out of ****Let me tell you that this movie is one of the best I've seen this year. Nicolas Cage is a great actor and he's the type of performer who for me is one of the best: just the ones who can act expressing themselves in a very convincing way, not only by facial expressions or body language, but also by very strong lines throughout the entire movie. His narration is amazing. He plays Yuri Orlov, an arms dealer, who although risks his life very often (he travels to many distant and dangerous places including many locations from the east lands and even finds himself locked up in a room with two hookers, with no rubber and in a country where 25% of the people is infected with AIDS), is lucky at being good at it, since he gains money, has a beautiful wife and a son.Like said before, most of the film is narrated by Cage. Even by paying attention to the self limit, it's not possible to absorb all of the great lines in this movie, and I must say I need to watch it again, however I won't pay to go to the theaters again, I'll wait it on DVD... The movie is about the life of an arms dealer, the difficulties of it, the advantages of a life like his own, consequences, and most important thing of all: not only a visionary movie about weapons, wars, injustice and etc., but, at the same time, a masterpiece of a protest, like a slap on the faces of the government people, or even, as the beginning of the movie suggests, a bullet in the head.The cast includes actors like Jared Leto, who plays Orlov's brother, who, although is not an arms dealer like his older brother, do other acts in the movie that helps us see another point of view, which is very interesting, since we don't get bored just with the main plot of the movie. Bridget Moynahan plays Cage's wife in a much better role than hers in I, Robot (not that it means it was bad, not at all) and Ian Holm, who I admire since the good old times of Alien.For people who didn't like the movie (like I checked on the IMDb's forum, this movie is for people who pay attention, have good tastes in movies' genres, not for people who aren't grown enough to see this movie's qualities yet).",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Can't decide what it wants to say...,"I went into this film with high expectations after some positive reviews on IMDb and from fellow film buffs. I was a little disappointed. This film is not clear about what it wants to be. Is it an intelligent dissection of the arms industry and the moral issues or is it entertaining crime/gangster movie like Pacino's scarface. Sadly its neither and wavers between both ends of the spectrum.Nicholas Cage is a great actor but hasn't given a real performance in years. This film is no different. And Jared Leto is just irritating as his junkie brother - especially towards the end when he starts getting a morality attack at the wrong time. The camera-work is superb though and flits between Ukraine, Manhattan and Africa quite well. I don't know if it was on location shooting or sets but they look really realistic. I won't call this a bad movie and it has several interesting ideas and some educating moments but its definitely not a classic or a film that can be lauded as highly intelligent. That would be giving it more credit than is its due.....",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A bold if rudimentary satire, ""Lord of War"" is a satisfying crime drama","This film is, much like its granddaddy ""Scarface,"" a guilty pleasure. Andrew Niccol's ""Lord of War"" is in many ways a standard crime lord rise-to-power saga, but manages to shine through the myriad of imitators with a number of daring and refreshing moves. While the plot is perfectly predictable (with a few exceptions), the cinematography is excellent and the subject matter of gun running leaves the possibility of some gutsy satire. Don't expect cinematic genius or a film that will become a cult treasure; just expect to be satisfied for two hours.Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian-American who has taken to gunrunning to make his living. I must admit that at first, the name made me cringe and chuckle at the same time, but after a while I was used to it. In his pursuit is the enjoyable but entirely flat Interpol Agent Valentine (Ethan Hawke). The story follows Yuri's rise to power, his marriage to hometown beauty Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), his struggle to defeat veteran gunrunner Simeon Weisz (Iam Holm), and his evasion of Agent Valentine's painfully by-the-book pursuits. The plot can be predicted almost entirely by supplanting the standard near-misses with the law, desires to go legit, compromises of morality, and inevitable downfall. What is most impressive about this film is not the story but its sheer irreverence for moralization.Most poignant is the introduction and opening credits. Cage's disembodied voice relates some statistics about guns that you might hear from ""Bowling for Columbine."" There is one gun for every twelve people in the world. We then see Yuri and he says, ""The only question is: How do we arm the other eleven?"" After a pause for a guilty snicker, we follow a plate of metal from factor to firearm in an impressively well created (though cartoonish) point-of-view crash course in gun trafficking. The final image in the sequence is the bullet being fired from an AK-47 into the head of an all-too-young African ""soldier."" This seems cruel and overly graphic, but it is done in such a way that it is detached and satiric, setting the tone for the rest of the film.The relentless clip at which the film moves helps it avoid plunging into soap box mode. We see Yuri's clearly immoral and illegal acts rapidly enough that we haven't the time to consider them wrong. Niccol's script gives Cage's narration wit and craft that makes us cheer for Yuri's slights of hand. Yuri is clever enough that we entirely forget that he is selling guns to genocidal dictators. On top of the dialog are subtle stabs at American foreign policy and philosophical hypocrisy with quips like ""I sell to leftists, and I sell to rightists. I even sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers."" Blood splatters onto blue and white windows to make less-than-subtle patriotic images. When the dictator of Liberia rigs an election and Yuri chastises him, the dictator flashes a newspaper showing the Supreme Court intervention in the U.S. Election of 2000. While not subtle, these tactics help steer the film from being preachy for the first half of the film.When Yuri hits his requisite moment of moral decline, the film comes to a complete halt. Nicolas Cage enters melodramatic mode and looks like he might fall asleep as he tries to portray Yuri's descent into hell (which according to the movie is Africa). The palace of the brutal, but likable, dictator is replaced by the shacks of AIDS-infected hookers. Instead of laughing at the wake of destruction left by Yuri's trade, we are left to wallow in shock-value atrocities just in case we couldn't tell the film was a satire. It is unfortunate that the film reverted to such hackneyed tactics, as it is otherwise a well crafted criticism.Thankfully the film picks up itself up with a witty ending and more scathing remarks. It also departs from the standard crime saga with one final stab at US foreign policy and at our expectations in an ending that makes up for most the film's faults. What this film lacks in originality it makes up for in the guts to deal with such touchy subjects with comedy. ""Lord of War"" is appealing and satisfying enough to be worth the time.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Fact Much Of It Is Made Up Explains A Lot,"One thing I didn't find clear with Andrew Nicol's 2005 film LORD OF WAR of how does a nobody called Yuri Orlov find himself becoming an international arms dealer ? One minute he's selling a firearm in New York then in the next scene he's in Lebanon selling weapons to different factions of a particularly bloody conflict . Let me get this straight , a conflict that has been waging for several years that has seen thousands die and has many thousands of combatants armed by regional and international powers needs a man who's just come off an aeroplane for its arm supplies ? He must have been carrying very large suitcase . Like wise airport security must be very lax in that part of the world . As the story continues and we get constant voice over Yuri Orlov globetrots all over the planet getting richer as he sells more and more weapons but never gets round to explaining the mechanics of how all this works . There's a very good reason for thisLORD OF WAR opened to great acclaim from organizations that aren't known to comment on films such as Amnesty International and the fact that anyone praises a film starring Nicholas Cage makes you sit up and take notice . The fact is despite being based on real life events and characters Yuri Orlov is a composite character . This explains a lot as to how a son of a New York store owner suddenly and implausibility becomes a major player on arms market and supply around the world but at the same time it means a film portraying an important topic ironically loses its own integrityLike so many other films that have an important topic as its subject matter LORD OF WAR has received more acclaim than it probably deserves . As a piece of film making it is deeply unsatisfactory , The scenes jump around from location to location or rather one different warzone to another different warzone every few minutes without much explanation . The film is also too reliant on voice over and yet as with the locations there's little filling in the audience as to how Orlov set up the deal or even who he is dealing with . I know the film feels the need to scream "" Oh Orlov is a bad man because he's selling guns to make money "" but more explanation is needed as to the why , how what and where of the scenes - especially the how . Compare this to the narration used in so many Scorsese movies and you'll see how unsatisfactory Nicol's screenplay isAnd LORD OF WAR is in humble opinion a very unsatisfactory movie along with being a very simplistic one . Orlov is a bad man because he sells weapons to people and the film gives the impression that if he is caught by Interpol the whole world will suddenly ascend to perpetual peace . In other words the arms trade in general and the illegal arms trade led by men such as the composite character Yuri Orlov is to blame for the world's conflict . This totally misses out the point that most countries experiencing conflicts are caused by failed states , the international drugs trade and refusal of government to legalise drugs , religious intolerance and a lack of democracy and the arms trade is only a symptom of the disease . Don't believe me ? Then name me a war between two secular democracies ?",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Warlord With Half a Heart,"Nicholas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a displaced Ukranian who grew up in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, NY. In his early 40s, Yuri is a major player in black-market international arms dealing. We learn this via his narration, which is reminiscent of Ray Liotta's voice-over in ""Good Fellas."" The two men survive similar experiences: rapid success, daunting adventure, cocaine abuse, and, inherent in their chosen fields of endeavor, much trouble. Unlike Liotta's character's quest to become a ""made"" player in the Mafia, Yuri doesn't seem to have any goal in mind other than doing what he does best: deal. In fact, via his narration he ponders quitting and then tells us why he decided to stay in the arms-dealing game, ""I was good at it."" He's like an accomplished master chef who decides not to toss off his apron for to take a seat with patrons in the dining room. Instead, with the knowledge that it's hotter than hell in the kitchen, he stays put, knowing deep down that it is in the heat that he feels most alive.Throughout his dealings Yuri is pursued by a straight-laced Interpol agent played by a scruffy-faced Ethan Hawke. Though the agent is on the right track in believing Yuri to be the arms-dealer he is, the agent is too tied to making the perfect collar--with all evidence 100% in order--to bring Yuri down. Hawke's main job in the movie seems to be to voice the liberal, anti-gun, human rights point-of-view. He does so, though one gets the feeling that he resorts to such rhetoric to abstain from his real goal: bringing Yuri down.At one point in Yuri's career he decides to quit. Perhaps because of the agent's constant presence or perhaps due to the evolution of his heart. (Mind you, he gets out of the arms-running business into a lucrative business exploiting developing countries in other ways.) Naturally, this option to stay out is undermined when one of his former clients, the gun-crazed dictator of Liberia, strong-arms him into making one last killer deal.If you dig Nicholas Cage, like I do, you'll like this movie. And, beware, you kind of have to like him because this is a very insular movie with not much to do with anyone else but Yuri. It does not have the emotional resonance of ""Constant Gardener"" but then again that movie suffered from knocking one over the head with its messages.This movie avoids the knee-jerking, opting to let us judge for ourselves what's right and whose wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent Movie,"Andrew Niccol must be applauded for this masterpiece, not only for its entertainment value, but also its message, especially considering the lack of media interest on the topic of arms dealing.After having for some reason watched recently his appalling work in Snake Eyes, where he was conceivably running after a hopefully large career-damaging paycheck, this movie should also strengthen/build Nicolas Cage's reputation as a serious lead man. He is throughout this feature on cue, and convincingly delivers Niccol's polished, urgent text. Moynahan and Hawke also deliver strong performances. Special mentions must be made for Leto and Walker, who both carry their ambiguous supportive roles, with distinction, and who were both less well known to me.This is neither a date, nor a family movie, but for friends. It is definitely worth being seen at the theater, and should become one of those essential components of any respectable DVD collection, in my humble opinion.Nicolas Cage (Yuri Orlov) 8/10 - Very good performance, but hard to believe his supposedly Ukrainian origin.Bridget Moynahan (Ava Fontaine) 8/10 - Gorgeous, just gorgeous.Jared Leto (Vitaly Orlov) 9/10 - Scene stealer.Ethan Hawke (Jack Valentine) 7/10 - Good performance, but rather one-dimensional character to play in the first place.Eamonn Walker (Andre Baptiste Sr.) 9/10 - Scene stealer.Andrew Niccol 10/10",,Anonymous,Crime
"not as advertised, but decent","I think this film warrants much higher than a 2. It was not what the viewer might expect from the previews however. This film seems like a documentary about guns with some story rather than the other way around. Others have complained about violence in the film but then again, this is an R-rated movie, so it was nothing I did not expect. More shocking than the violence may have been the (gratuitous) nudity and drug use. All in all the movie was interesting, but more of a documentary or docu-drama than an action or suspense movie. Furthermore, I think the minimum of 10 lines for a review is unneeded as good writing should be concise.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A deals a deal,"Lord of War sees Nicolas Cage play Yuri Orlov, a Russian émigré to the United States, whose family pretends to be Jewish and living in a dead end world of Little Odessa. He sees an opportunity that violence can make him money and becomes a successful arms dealer as he starts out small in the early 1980s and his enterprise takes off once the USSR collapses.Yuri is immoral, he realises if its not him, then someone else will sell arms. Even then someone will find a way to kill others. The film is driven by its narration and goes on a zippy and st time a sarcastic and cynical pace, maybe too fast as before long Orlov and his brother go from working in a family restaurant to an arms trade fair and his brother being hooked on drugs.Things take a turn as Interpol close in on him after pursuing him for years and his wife probes deeper into his activities, his brother realises the consequences of their actions in giving weapons to local warlords.Cage does not convince entirely as a Russian born American, the film is also a little bit to glib and smug, although the cynicism is a plus but it does come close to some preachiness here and there. Of course Orlov must face the consequences of his action but Ethan Hawke who plays the Interpol agent seems to be too much of a smug boy scout himself. The film loses steam towards the end with what looks like silly plot resolution to give Orlov a crisis of conscience but it still makes for an interesting and at times a funny film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good-looking and important.,"The subject of gun-running is very political, very heavy and very unpleasant. Still, Niccol manages to turn this grave theme into a slick, sometimes funny, often emotional and very involving biopic.The story of Yuri Orlov, the Ukrainian immigrant who builds his gun-running empire from nothing, is intertwined with gun-running 101, the wars and conflicts of the 20th century, and corruption in the worlds largest governments. At points it reached the level of political-ism that can be called preachy, but steers off at the right time.Some scenes are very gripping. Some scenes make you shake your head since they are so absurd but still true. Example:(MILD SPOILER)""The AK47... It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do."" Some scenes are very darkly humorous. There's even a romantic relationship, and it's more realistic than many in movies.The camera-work is super. It doesn't succumb to any modern fads, like shaky camera JJ Abrams-style, or other silly techniques that ruin movies these days. Instead, we get crisp, sharp and colourful scenes. Russia is cold, dark, gray-green, Liberia is dusty, colour-rich and warm. Watching Lord of War is a treat.Nicolas Cage redeems himself after National Treasure. This is not his best performance, but a good one. Bridget Moynahan is boring as usual. That's just a personal annoyance though. Jared Leto works well as Yuri's crazed brother, and Hawke is good as the Interpol agent.One of the best performances comes from Eamonn Walker, as the sadistic Charles Tailor/André Baptiste. He and his son are both cruel to the point of silliness, which is exactly what you can say about African dictators.Lord of War is one of the better movies of 2005. It's important, it's well-crafted(the intro sequence is awesome), it's well-acted and well worth the money.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Gun Jams. Repeatedly.,"Okay I read the review that's been 'rated most useful' on here and actually rented the film based on it. Well blast you reviewer, damn you. You misled me.The reviewer professed that this was 'no typical Hollywood film', and that not everyone would 'get it'. He was totally right - I didn't get it. But I don't think I'm missing anything, I think the movie is. It is essentially contrived. The characters are unimaginative, as are the moral conundrums they face. Cage's wife is a stock character, there only to highlight Cage's spiral down into decadence.Besides feeling decidedly forced, the movie is frequently at odds with itself in tone and style. At first it seems to be a light action-centric biopic with the occasional sombre note. The humour is always teetering on the edge of being funny, but never quite comes to fruition. You couldn't pick the action scenes out from a crowd - they're all as generic and boring as hell. And the ending to the film - well boy I won't 'ruin' it, but Cage breaks down the fourth wall and attempts some sort of lame profundity with a statistic we all knew anyway. The makers of this film obviously thought they'd induce some sort of revelation in the viewers - the pomposity and self-righteousness of this assumption really shows on screen.Don't get me wrong - I don't mind the message of the film, but its stunted, inarticulate, out of the blue delivery at the climax of the story really doesn't work. Most of all this film failed in entertaining me - the characters were boring and the narrative predictable. The film is too light to be affecting; too dark to be funny; and far, far too predictable to be engaging. Predictable story, predictable character arcs. The only unpredictable element of the whole experience is the tone, that blundering beast that bumbles all over the place for the whole film, before finally flopping over dead.Might I add - the cinematography is not all that great. At points it is really nice, but often shots feel artificial.6/10 - The gun doesn't just jam. It Backfires. There are better films on which to spend your time.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Very good - poignant yet not too depressing or heavy going,"I had been waiting to see Lord of War for some time with slightly mixed feelings on the matter. I think Nic Cage is an excellent actor and was interested in finding out more about the subject matter but had heard mixed reviews and was concerned it could be very heavy going with a topic like that.However, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is told with a serious tone (as it deserves) but there are elements of black humour in there and it never gets bogged down in the politics or morality.Lord of War tells the story of Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant who eventually becomes a major player in the international arms trade. As well as dealing with his business and the moral issues faced it also shows the impact his occupation has on the rest of his life, most tellingly his brother.The acting is excellent all round, there is not a performance that could be criticised. Cage plays his morally dubious character perfectly, managing to inspire sympathy without ever letting you forget that all his devils are his own creation.The opening scene showing the 'life' of a bullet is an excellent opener and, stylistically, the highlight of the film. It sets the tone very well for what lies ahead.This is a realistic film with a believable ending that has managed to avoid many of the clichés usually employed when dealing with immoral characters. I would recommend this to anyone who has the slightest interest in the topic or just wants to watch a well made, gripping film with an important central theme.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
fantastic movie about war and its motivation/consequences,"Upon first seeing previews for this movie, I wasn't expecting much at all, probably just Cage selling weapons. But as almost anyone who understands it would agree, Lord of War is far more than simply a movie about gun running, but film that speaks highly of morals, and what going to war really means. The story chronicles the life of a Ukranian immigrant who eventually decides to sell guns internationally. The story tracks every progression he makes until ultimately becoming the most well known gun runner in the world. The main message of the movie is that war is fact, that war will always be, and therefore so will people willing to support war. The question therefore becomes of morality, and whether or not you want to be one of these such people. It presents war as a choice, not as an ultimatum.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A necessary evil.,"Nicholas Cage's Yuri Orlav is the embodiment of the situationally ethical arms dealer who justifies his profession with such specious arguments as supplying arms to countries for their ""defense"" or because someone will take his place if he leaves--unsatisfactory justifications for families of slaughtered African refugees and bloody poor excuses for the US government.Director Andrew Nicol takes too long in Lord of War to establish the flawed Yuri through a series of expected scenarios leading him into the rarefied position as top gunrunner in the world, with powerful and dangerous leaders willing to give him money and protection in exchange for arms. Only after Ukrainian Yuri has become comfortable with his moral ambiguity and his family remains ignorant of his trade does the director/writer introduce the tensions between Yuri's better angel and greedy devil. This conflict is also couched in the most general and clichéd ways to the extent that his flawed reasoning remains intact (his brother, Vitali, played by Jared Leto, provides the alter ego of slacking but morally outraged pretty boy) but is counterweighted by his concern for his wife and child. His relationship with a brutal Liberian general pits Yuri's ethical life against his family life.Yuri's voice-over narration takes a few shortcuts to his character while exposing the essentially conflicted nature of a trade where he is so good at what he does that he is reluctant to leave. ""I am a necessary evil"" is the closest he comes to recognizing his corruption. Nicol layers enough wisecracking comments from Yuri to help mitigate the overwhelming sense of Yuri's moral decline.The contribution of this character to modern fictional reality is that politicians and business people are faced with the same dilemma of wishing an end to the conflict in Iraq for reasons of honor but hoping for continuation for pragmatic reasons such as profit (as usual Halliburton and Cheney come to mind). When the closing credits remind us that the US and Russia are among the top arms dealers in the world, Nicol's allegorical subtext rises like fat to the surface. Too late to make it a great action film; too didactic to make it great art.As for the endurance of evil, Hawthorne also had the insight in ""Young Goodman Brown"": ""Evil is the nature of Mankind.""",,Anonymous,Crime
A very good movie for its class.,"This is a movie about Nicholas Cage being a weapon merchant. He is doing business with the most atrocious dictators and tyrants in the world and he has no regrets, because he is actually good at it. As a technical guy, I can relate to that. Ethan Hawke makes a remarkably small role in this movie as the idealistic Interpol agent.What is nice about Lord of War is that it shows that a man can do wrong things without actually meaning harm as well as doing harm without doing the wrong things. What is not nice is that is shows a birds eye view of something that is anything but comfy and something to feel good about. It's similar to that scene in Syriana where the rookie Intelligence officer is destroying a car with a missile by using a joystick in the CIA headquarters. Is that the world view of Americans, I wonder?In rest, it is a well done movie, worth seeing, and maybe even able to start some discussions about the nature of morality.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Then there are movies that are trying to tell too much truth that they miss the mark. Lord of War is one of those movies.I felt like the filmmakers were so busy telling the truth that they forgot to tell a compelling story. Cage was narrating through the whole film, so it was impossible to get into any of the characters. He and Leto supposedly grew up in Brooklyn, but were devoid of even a hint of NY attitude, accents, or mannerisms. I don't even think they believed in the characters. All the scenes were events from Yuri Olav's life that seemed to glorify the lifestyle of being an arms dealer, but they did nothing for the flow or arc of the film.

"""Please, Sir, Will My Arm Grow Back?""","Combined with the recent release of ""The Constant Gardiner"", September 2005 is shaping up to be a good month for films concerning, even in part, Africa. While both films use the tried and true device of having white protagonists through which the (one assumes) white audience can relate (do you ever think that white people will ever be allowed to see black people as fully human?), ""The Lord of War"" seeks to comment on how Western arms dealers, and their client manufacturers and nations, cause misery and strife on a global scale.Director Andrew Niccol helps Nick Cage deliver a relatively understated performance in a film that teeters on farce, but never quite goes over the edge. Niccol directs his actors in a uniformly believable manner. The script, director and actors all appear to have taken this project on as their moral statement. Like ""Gardiner"" ""The Lord of War"" gives a damn.Some of the situations depicted are far too gruesome to make light of. Cage portrays an American arms merchant who travels the world to enrich himself, and to accumulate the accouterments of success. His character arc is that of an individual debating the morality of what he does, even as he is confronted with the immoral results. The purveyor of death, though, is hardly allowed to have the ""good life"". Can he emerge at the end of the film redeemed or punished? Or, is there another dramatic outcome? The film is as close to as perfectly constructed as one could hope: the domestic scenes counterpoint the globe-trotting and worldly events, as well as contradicts them: can one who contributes so much social disruption be allowed to have a 'normal' life? The cinematography provides some beautifully constructed shots. The locations are authentic (Czech Republic and South Africa). The music spans cultures and accentuates the drama, rather than trying to sell soundtrack albums. Producer Nick Cage appears to have put his ego aside to develop a film that is entertaining while at the same time preachy and didactic. Cage is definitely part of a greater whole, that whole being one of the best films of the year, and required viewing for people who give a damn.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

When you see a war taking place on the news you never really stop to think, I wonder who is profiting from this?

Cage, who plays the main character, finds himself struggling between whether what he is doing is right or not and continuing the ""one thing he is good at"". I really felt all the actors did a superb job of bringing there characters to life. I especially like the style of the movie, the monologue by cage's character fits in very well with the overall purpose of the film and the movie itself has a very raw feel to it. Overall, I hope that others will look past this film as being simply 2 hours of entertainment and really consider the ideas that are brought up this film, is it right that the five biggest arms-dealing countries are also the leaders of the United Nations?

Liberalism -- Again,"Hollywood is infested. I've been looking forward to seeing this movie since I first heard about it. I am a big Nicolas Cage fan.But I am tired of going to a movie and hearing anti-American liberal propaganda. Everybody in this movie is just misunderstood heroes -- or anti-heroes, y'might say. Even Baptiste? Please.But not America. America and all the big countries are just bad guys. Automatically. Unequivocal. The U.S. President is the worst of 'em. I'm tired of hearing this. I'm very pro-America and very conservative-leaning. I am proud that America exists, but Cage's character just looked at America as a dead end. The Enemy. Just as they characters did in THE CONSTANT GARDENER. Another liberal, heavy-handed movie.God, give us a conservative movie, something where Americans aren't Imperialists or Anti-Christ-like businessmen.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Although Lord of War propels with a somewhat uneven testament on international arms dealing, it is a compelling piece of work","""There are 550 million firearms manufactured in a world circulation, that is one firearm for every twelve people on the planet"" says Nicholas Cage's character in the opening scene. This political thriller boasting Andrew Niccol in the director's chair offers a significant, but somewhat convoluted testament on the tragic repurcussions of illegal arms dealing. The central figure in the story of a seemingly ordinary man who finds himself way over his head when he gets involved in a contraband arms dealing industry. As what many may know from reading the newspapers, arms dealing is a dirty business, and this film sheds some fair light on it. Although Niccol appears to show slightly more interest in pushing for a political agenda than telling a stimulating story, the story serves not as an angry condescension against arms dealing but a bold character study of a man wrestling with his inner demons as a result of his amoral business. Set in the 1980s during the final stretch of the Cold War, this film stars Nicolas Cage as Yuri Orlov, an Ukrainian native who makes a shot for the big bucks when he starts an contraband arms dealing business, selling a mass production of firearms to various international warzones around the globe. Bringing his cocaine addicted brother Vitaly (played by Jared Leto) along, Yuri quickly rises up the financial ladder with his selling, but soon must confront his morality when he finds himself in the crossfire of Interpol agent Jack Valentin (played by Ethan Hawke) who's pursuing after him.This movie tackles the area of the Cold War most films of the genre often neglect, and that is the politics that went outside the United States when many countries in the eastern hemisphere were at war and one of the major conflict dealt with exchange of international firearms. While the arms exchanging duty did lead to a helping hand for international defense, it also opened doors to tragedies that caused the lives of countless lives including children. This film focuses on the lead character's struggle against his morality when we witnesses the violent tragedies of countries at war, while experiencing a bold uproar in the law enforcement. Andrew Niccol does a fairly successful job at portraying the rise and fall of the lead character's dirty business, effectively exhibiting the violent consequences of arms dealing that puts him and his family in danger. But it is not the final half of the film when the story splashes into a somewhat uneven fiasco. There is a fair amount of substance and political commentary sprinkled throughout the two-hour picture, but perhaps it doesn't help that the narrative occasionally teeters towards the brink of uncertainty. The story ends on a rather ambiguous note that has a good capacity to leaving viewers with more questions about Yuri's morally dubious choices than answers.Nicolas Cage, Academy Award winner for his harrowing role in 'Leaving Las Vegas', does a pleasant job of showing his acting muscles in the lead role. His performance is solidly pleasant and shines a strong light on his talent. While his character may not fall in line with the category of a villain, there is no doubt that this role will provoke outrage for his ill morality that eventually leads to tragic consequences. Adding pinches of levity to the film's dark tone is Jared Leto who hops into the role of the lead character's younger brother Vitaly. Leto shines with a dose of humor nearly minute he is on screen, with his flamboyant behavior resulting from his compulsive cocaine addiction. While his comedic portrayal eventually overstays its welcome, Leto proves himself as a competent actor. Bridget Moynahan, suiting the role of Yuri's sexy lover and eventual wife, exhibits a decent performance for her time on screen. Then there is Ethan Hawke who takes on the role of an Interpol agent who rides on Yuri's tale upon discovering his unlawful business. His performance is quite strong and effectively shows his acting chops, nothing more nothing less.Lord of War is far from standing a cinematic masterpiece, but it is smart, if slightly flawed testament on illegal arms dealing. It is an ambitious picture that is bound spark plenty of interests and discussions long after its conclusion, at least for some who get the invested in its bleak subject matter. It is a dark picture, but it is an intriguing nonetheless. Best of all, it marks the spot of one of Nicolas Cage's best endeavors.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Time will be Kind to this film even if 2005 wasn't,"Sold as a black comedy--in which the laughs are the main point, it's really a satire or satirical drama/tragedy. This is more along the lines of films like UNDER FIRE and SALVADOR than DEAL OF THE CENTURY. And all the better for it. Easily the best film from this writer/director. It's free of the irritating trendy jump cutty style of the day but is very stylish and evocative. It's I suppose a comedy of the absurd and of the inescapable in this (the film's and our's to a great extent) war happy world.But the tone is perfect throughout and there is nice use of songs in the film and a fascinating scene where poor people take apart an airplane--it's like watching ants eat a dead animal, leaving only the skeleton.It feels like an honest movie about the greed and wheeling and dealing of selling guns. It's fun to watch someone succeed and that keeps your interest even as you and the character realizes the horror of what it's really all about. You may say, of so it has a preachy or mock heroic ending. No it doesn't go that way either. A perfectly made movie about the commerce of war and that's the element that this film argues drives the whole thing. Cage's character says once, ""I'd rather they fire my guns and miss as long as they fire my guns."" I won't go on and on and tell you it's an important movie, but it is very involving entertainment. Not amusement. Entertainment, it's about something without feeling like a sermon. Forget the bad ad campaign and give it a chance. In years to come this film may well be remembered long after the ""hits"" of this rather weak movie year have faded.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An interesting, if somewhat unfocused, movie...","I liked the movie, but over all it seems to become less than the sum of it's parts. Acting-wise its put together seamlessly. While Nicholas Cage has not always chosen wisely in his acting roles, he does an admirable in his portrayal of the lead in Lord of War. In fact most of the actors seem well suited to their roles. The script seems solid enough and well written. It is in the focus of the movie seems to be missing. Lord of War starts out as a sort of black comedy then becomes a morality tale and ends more as political statement, the movie cant seem to decide if it wants to be entertaining, thought provoking, or just prompt political and moral outrage in the audience. A good film, if a bit confusing on that note.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Yuri is impressive,"I really enjoyed this film. It's not going to make many top 10 lists, but it does have some very memorable lines, and some memorable scenes.....like the stack of A-K 47s. Nicholas Cage does yet another bang up job as Yuri and is very convincing as an international gun runner. The plot is thick and the directing is nicely done. It never hides from its agenda and never runs from its message. It stays on point and doesn't lose focus on our warlord Yuri. The ending sequences are powerful and there are more guns in this movie than Rambo ever dreamed. The only pet peeve I have about this one is the lack of explanation of how he conquered to much. How he could fly through international air in some scenes with ATF hot on his tail and a few other small things. Then again I suppose they weren't trying to make a 3 hour movie. Nevertheless it is very entertaining and I recommend it for anybody looking to have a good time. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
good film,"This was directed by Andrew Niccol, who directed one of my favorite films Gattaca, and also a really crappy one called Simone. This movie starts out with Nicolas Cage and his family moving from the Ukraine to New York City and they open a restaurant that isn't doing too well. There a lot of Russian gangsters in the area and Cage gets the idea to become an arms dealer after witnessing a murder. Cage and his brother, played by Jared Leto, become partners but things start out slow. It's the early 80's and they slowly work there way up to the top. Leto becomes addicted to cocaine and by the time the soviet union comes apart, Cage has become one of the top arms dealers. Ethan Hawke plays an agent who really wants to bring Cage down but he just has too many connections. It's a great film and i hope this movie is a big hit.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Flawed, but fascinating","It's not necessarily a bad film, but a flawed one that could have been improved easily.The entire premise of the film, following a gunrunner through his trade, and the constant narration by Nicolas Cage is absolutely riveting. You can't get enough of his character, Yuri Orlav. He's a very bad guy, but you watch the dissection of his character, from young guy growing up in Brooklyn slums, to a witty SOB selling guns to people who would shoot him in an instant, and it's all excellent. His performance on screen proves that there still is acting talent in Hollywood, and it's no wonder why Cage won an Oscar and is still pulling in crowds (albeit, not as huge as back in the day).But the problem with the film is not Cage. Or even his co-stars. Even though it's Cage-centric, Jared Leto, Bridget Moynahan, Ian Holm, Eamonn Walker, and even Ethan Hawke all pull in some very good performances, even though some of them are barely in it. Leto is really starting to seem more than a pretty face (maybe an Oscar nom for Chapter 27?).It's not the visuals either. From the fabulous opening sequence involving the creation, shipment and final resting place of a machine gun bullet, to the fast editing techniques throughout the film, it never lets up. The cinematography is particularly a standout, and the scenes in Africa come later in the film, be prepared for some really beautiful sequences. While The Constant Gardener may have nailed the life in Africa to beyond an art, this film still brings outstanding beauty to the landscape. The way that some of the shots are set up, even when not in Africa, are pure genius.No, the problem is the story. After the initial narration, and the setup of the film, it just falls apart. Yuri sells gun, Yuri gets in trouble with Valentine, Yuri continues selling guns. For 2 hours, it's the same thing. Even with significant plot points flying around, the cycle continues on and on. While the movie begs to be interesting, it just falls apart at the seams, and can't get back up on performances alone. Even though you can't stop watching, you know deep down that the movie has fallen into boredom territory. It's a real shame too.While the life of a gunrunner is an interesting concept, it could have been pulled off much smoother in its translation from script to screen. A polish of the script could have helped this film greatly, and made this underrated film even more appreciated, and seen during its initial run.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylized oversimplification of arms dealing...,"...mixed in with some leftist propaganda all rolled up into a B grade gangster flick. There's really nothing else to say but there is a 10 line minimum to these reviews:Cage starts out selling uzis to local gangsters and works his way up to selling helicopters to dictators. Along the way a few people get shot and some stuff blows up. Also: hookers and blow.All of the fun stuff ends up taking a back seat to the real purpose of the film: to educate you on how slimy capitalists exploit third world countries and perpetuate violence.I happen to agree with the message, but this is a horrible way of conveying it.

Boring,"This film is about arms dealers trying to get away from the authority, and the moral issues concerned.The topic itself is controversial, and I must applaud the filmmakers for making a film about such a topic in the first place. It is very nicely shot, it has nice scenery, nice cinematography and it also has great acting.However, the problem of the film is that it does not fall into a category. It seems not be too dramatic for a documentary; it is too plainly told to be a drama; there is too little action to be a testosterone fuelled movie; and there is not enough suspense to be a thriller. Furthermore, it really dragged on and on. I felt that I could have just watched the last 15 minutes of the film and not have missed anything.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Only Cage can make Yuri not hated in ""Lord of War""","I 100% agree with those who believe that only Nicholas Cage is the only actor who can make us not-hating Yuri and even feel sympathy for him. Though a gun-seller who earns, let's say his living and not his millions, out of death selling, Cage convinced us that he is trading in no more than a double-faced merchandise. As he says arms can be killing no more, if not less than, cigarettes or cars can. Both kill if used heavily, rashly, or badly. The privilege in his merchandise, arms, is that it has a safety tool that hinders the trigger while cigarettes, cars, and alcoholics do not have similar security tool !! I am convinced with his logic or even his justification.The feeling for admiration and sympathy did not faint from me, at lest, for Yuri till the end of the movie. Though he is selling death with a cold blooded heart I have never missed tenderness in his eyes and acts with his wife and kid and more strongly with his brother. I believe that Cage deserves to win the Oscar for his marvellous performance in the scene when his dear brother, who was felt as a son to him, was brutally shot by the very weapons he is barging. The way he tried to save him, the strained tears in his angry eyes, and the way he continued dealing with the killers of his brother are all fertile lessons for any acting learner or fan.Any other actor may act the character of Yuri; however, it will, definitely, end by hating Yuri and his death-business. Cage made us rethink more than once in the whole philosophy of gun-market and its inevitable necessity without losing our sympathy and admiration for Yuri/Cage.The narrative voice of Cage all over the proceedings of the film, sorry for using ""proceedings"" as I work in the Law field, made a homey human background that lessened some violent scenes. Though some Cinema watcher may not like it; I find it indispensable as many sciences and behaviors can never be felt and understood if it is removed. It was like an echo or mirror of Yuri's deep conscience which he wishes and pretends not to have though it is still lurking and paralleling his actual conduct. I felt the same with the narrative voice in ""National Treasure"" as the voice only, even without his appearance embodies and recalls visions and feelings not written in the script.I can not end without respecting the daring implications and condemnation conveyed to Machiavelli political attitudes in the US and in the third world.Good work Cage and all movie Crew who entertained us courteously, thank you all.

Excellent high energy movie with a message,"Nicholas Cage and this movie should have been nominated for an Academy Award. If you are a Cage fan, then this is him at his best. His character is that of an amoral (not immoral) international arms dealer. He portrays a man who is driven, not by avarice, but by his ""addiction"" to the high he gets from ""making a deal"". On a micro- level truly is a movie about an addiction which feeds upon its main character. On a macro- level it really is about the global societal impact of the international arms trade. There are no dull moments, no questions about what is going on, and really no give aways about how this movie will end. I think is is Cage's best (after Leaving Las Vegas). The sets and attention to detail are impressive. The movie really was a ""global"" adventure.Even the lead into the movie (where the title and initial credits are given) is a well choreographed visual and musical production by itself.

firearms getting treatment instead of drugs,"At the birth of a bullet we start our journey into the world of firearms. Travelling along the assembly line, through inspections, transportation, meeting its other half; the jacket of an gun, to its death where it 'rests in peace', lodged into the head of an African boy; but peace is a word of taboo by the world of guns, for which Yuri Orlov is apart. After witnessing a mob hit, Yuri's mind click to realise that gun trade is one of the most profitable trade on earth, feeding man's lust for guns. Yuri's brother Vitaly takes as the sideman, yet struggles with a heroin addiction. Trophy wife Ava loves the high life, never questioning where the money comes from. Starting from the bottom, Yuri works his way to the top; standing on first name basis with world leaders. Simeon Weisz, once leader of the gun trade, tries to push Yuri out, yet Yuri has more than one person out for him. Constantly on his tail, Jack Valentine wants Yuri out of commission, yet fails from incriminating evidence.From the opening sequence the message of Lord of War hits you hard, making its statement clear and right in the cross hairs. Mixing satire with the political agenda makes the message even harder, as the story is based on actual events. Lord of War is one of the first films that exposes the underworld of gun trafficking, which is heavily dominated by films of the seedy world of drugs, so Lord of War is a breath of fresh air, yet Lord of War doesn't reach the grandiose mark that a lot of films have done for the drug world. Yuri is not a hypocritical man, for the lack of morals he has, his life is a balance of paradoxes from the friendships he has from all the government leaders. Stating that he does his job because he's just good at it, emotional connections are severed to Yuri, though reflects a cold truth on the people who run the trade. Being unsympathetic for the people who fall under the rain of bullets, it becomes harder to sympathise with him when any tragedy hits him.Narration is always a hard element to handle, as the narration either works to the films advantage or back-flips and doesn't work. Yuri's narration hinders and distances further from the emotional connection of the characters. Shining moments are the symbolism mixed with the statistics, the sound of cash registers from the expulsion of the bullet shell, placed with what may be any almost to perfectly picked sound track; granted it hits every moment perfectly.Suited perfectly for Nicholas Cage, he embodies Yuri, evoking that unsympathetic, cool hardness, rattling off gun specs without skipping a beat. Jared Leto turns a disappointing performance as Vitaly, bouncing on an emotionally erratic yo-yo. Ethan Hawke brings nothing special to Valentine, with his brief appearances so wooden. Bridget Moynahan brings one of the better performances, wonderfully showing the unquestioning naivety of Ava.While its not startling revelatory, Lord of War still surprises on the illegal gun trade, yet doesn't compare to the depth brought to films on drugs. Yet this does open the door for more films like this to make their appearance.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Lots of potential, little capitalization","Lord of War is a genre-mixing political semi-satirical drama. It features many lines of quotable dialogue, a story packed with bloodshed and morality, and sex and drugs. But after the credits role, it's not the quality that will stick in mind, it's the flaws.First among those, there's not much of a story. The film follows an arms dealer from his first backdoor dealings to international war supplier. The first hour feels like exposition without plot, and so does much of the second. The movie is too undecided whether it wants to be a cat-and-mouse game, a serious drama, a political satire, or a love story / family epic, or even an action film. In the end, there's too little of every theme for any of them to grab the audience.The hero is a psychopath (in terms of being completely incapable of feeling compassion or emotion, and being a terribly dispassionate, wily character). Which means Nicolas Cage is terribly miscast, as he-of-the-sad-eyes is entirely unconvincing for the role, and spends too much time trying to be sympathetic to the audience, while spouting unsympathetic lines and doing unsympathetic actions. It's almost as if his face is on a different script from his mouth and hands.In the end, Lord of War is a movie that was too ambitious, and failed to work. The humour needed better delivery (no Nicolas Cage), the preachiness is too obvious, the narration is too corny, the drama is too uninvolving, the suspense is too watered down... It's like Syriana, only less well executed.",,Anonymous,Crime
an excellent movie,"In my opinion this movie is a masterpiece. The suspense, the black humor and tension are extremely well mixed in this one. I think this is one of the best movies with Nicholas Cage as a primary character. This is a realistic movie with characters resembling real ones. They act very unpredictable, as in real life, adding to the tension as you can't guess what the next step will be. There are no bad or good guys, there is no black or white there are just shades of Gray, as the main character himself notices. Althrough the CIA guy, which represents somehow the good side (if such side exists) in the world of violence seemed to be also corrupted by violence. Through the movie we take notice of the old saying ""He who draws the sword will die by the sword"". It strikes from the beginning that the main character is a very complex and well depicted one. Is not your regular mobster with a gun at people's head. Somehow he has a sense of justice buried deep inside him, who is hunting him down in his depressions. Highly adaptable, is learning quick from his friends or foes alike. In a word he's a survivor, outwitting the competition and everything that stands in his way. Somehow his reasons are uncertain even for him as he discovers that he has no real motive for doing it, money being out of the question. A masterpiece movie in my opinion, which i give a ten out of ten. A must see for every people who still thinks violence is the way to do things.

Again Nicolas cage turns out a very good (and convincing) role as a Ukrainian immigrant to the US who starts to develop a natural role for dealing in arms.The opening line of the film had me hooked on it straight away:""There are 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation, thats a firearm for one in every 12 people on the planet, the only problem is... how do we arm the other 11?""Even if you find yourself not enjoying the film, there are plenty of nifty little statistics and historical facts which will keep you entertained throughout.The film has a slight echo of goodfellas about it, as the character of Nicolas Cage, 'Yuri', grows up in a run down neighbourhood with his brother and slowly rises to the power of his profession with his brother.Of course the film does raise the issue of morality with arms dealing, and you can feel the strong moral at the end with Yuri's brother.I won't ruin the film, but the acting is strong and the story interesting and well written. The only criticism I have of the film is that the constant jumping from one year to the next can make the story feel a little loose at times, but apart from that a good film.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Nice, sarcastic slice of powdered life","This film creates a slightly sarcastic picture about a peoples who gets their profits from the conflict-zones. Black humor, beautiful picture, steady soundtrack, almost apocalyptic atmosphere, which is mostly by those perfect colors of this movie. Kind of a life-based-road-movie, i suppose. Violentic, in a good sense of it, if it can be expressed so....Imo, colors was like Apocalypse, Now, atmosphere and dialog like some mixture of an Pulp Fiction & Full Metal Jacket and the angle of view felt time to time like some PC- Game, maybe like the Delta Force: Black Hawk down.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Guys will enjoy it more than girls (unless you're a big Ethan Hawke fan),"I have to be completely honest, this is not a movie I would typically rent. The only reason I did rent it was because of the face of Ethan Hawke peaking out from behind Nicholas Cage on the display at the video store. Don't get me wrong, I really like Nicholas Cage, too, but he probably wouldn't have made me rent this movie without Ethan behind him. Truthfully, Ethan was probably only seen in the movie for a total of about 30 minutes, spread throughout the film. But that's OK. Now, down to business. I've never seen a movie on this subject matter and was surprised at the end of the movie to see a caption stating that it was based on actual events. For those two reasons, it is worth seeing, even if it's only for your own information. Nicholas cage is a 'gun runner' who deals with some of the most dangerous men in the world during times of war (mainly) selling them weapons of all kinds. There are some scenes that are somewhat disturbing, like the opening scene, for example, where you see a bullet go through a child's forehead. There is a pretty good amount of killing throughout the film, some shocking. All in all, it was a pretty good film. Interesting nonetheless. After watching it, I didn't feel as though it had been a waste of time, but I'm not sure I would feel the same if Ethan Hawke wasn't in it. I think generally speaking, it's more of a guys movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterpiece,"""Lord of War"" is a masterpiece which can be enjoyed by audience from all tastes. It perfectly tells the relation between guns, terrorists, governments and money, gives you lots of useful information about guns and history of war. It tells how someone can become incredibly rich by only selling guns, to governments, to terrorists, to armies. However, what made this movie a masterpiece in my opinion is combining this great plot with outstanding scenes and unique shooting styles. My two favorite moments of the film were Yuri looking at a guerrilla shooting with AK-47 and hearing the ka-ching sound of money every time he shoots out a bullet, and the time lapse of Yuri's plane getting stripped off overnight just like a small mammal eaten away by ants. On almost every scene you just can't help but wonder how much work and effort they put in a single movie. I congratulate all of its makers for this piece of art. Well done...",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lord Of WAR Review.,"Lord of WAR, what can be said about this amazingly dynamic drama that has been crafted, except for ""WONDERFUL"" Lord of WAR tells us the ugly truth of the life of an Arms Dealer (Yuri Oralv, played by Cage) as he struggles through becoming the best at what he does. Yuri goes from being a small time no one to an all around bad ass and 'walking genocide' Lord of WAR displays amazing acting and is a rivetingly dramatic film that will entertain the high brow audience who care more for story and depth rather than senseless violence and action. If you thought like me, that Lord of WAR would be an action movie you thought wrong. However I wasn't disappointed in the least at the movie for what it was. Lord of WAR will enthrall and entertain you from start to finish with its unique originality and directing.All in all Lord of WAR in my opinion is a great movie that Drama seekers and Cage fans should go see and enjoy. The Movie is really a masterpiece worthy of a few awards. Go see it and Enjoy it THE FINAL WORD: There's a lesson to be learned, and a tale to be told. I give Lord of WAR 2 thumbs up for its story and originality!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Preachy film about the gun trade,"This movie is earnest, well-meaning, virtuous, right-thinking, long-winded, and confused. It might well have started out as a newspaper op-ed page article. It does have a few funny bits, and the performances are adequate, but the preachy tone drains the movie of whatever vitality it might have had. There is one plot oddity; Nick Cage's arms dealer has a son who never seems to age. He is always a toddler, though the film stretches over many years. Maybe this has some hidden meaning, or maybe it just shows sloppiness. I might have a little more respect for this heavy-handed sermon if it had shown me something about the international arms trade. But no, the Cage character just announces he is in the business and proceeds to get rich and guilt-ridden. The movie tosses around jargon (""end-user certificate"" for example) but demonstrates no knowledge of how the business works. What a bore.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
This theme should deserve better,If it weren't for the scenes taking place in Liberia which show some kind of truth and realism and for the final scenes my vote for this movie would be much lower. In fact this movie is rather weak as a libel against arms traffic since the scenario is full of cheap ideas with some improbable or unexplained developments (for instance how and where could a modest Ukrainian immigrant suddenly find the necessary capital to create so quickly a large arms dealing business?).The dialogues and the off comments by the main character intend to be cynical but exhibit a large amount of commonplace philosophy about arms dealing after all. Even the sentimental story of the arms dealer and his wife is rather watery since the beginning and the sudden consciousness of the latter about the true business of her husband is quite unconvincing. The players do their work so so except of course Nicolas Cage who does a great job in a movie whose quality is unequal to his talent. The theme of arms trafficking deserved a better movie indeed.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"come on, tell an actual story will you?","OK look, this movie gets an A for its bold moral stand: it is AGAINST gun running that KILLS PEOPLE! Especially poor African people who have been royally screwed by warlords and their tireless posses of sadistic killers. I was waiting for the audience member who would cheer the AK loving crazed son of a dictator using starving refugees for target practice, but to my surprise, nobody did. Score one for finding a topic on which EVERYONE will agree with you - random death in pointless wars fueled by amoral arms dealers is bad.But would you like to know why a single one of these countless wars starts or continues? Or about the big business of arms trading, i.e. legal companies and not one guy working out of storage container under a bridge? You won't learn anything about these things in this film. What you will learn is the Hollywood lesson that moral feeling is the important thing. And the American political lesson: you are either for it or against it, so why have facts, geopolitics, economics, connect people to motives (besides money, drugs, and hookers), or any of that boring crap that explains how things actually work?? You will also learn the following: Africans are either victims, looters, or mindless killers; African leaders are mindless killers; Africans die because their leaders are mindless killers (oh yes, with First World guns); African dictators's sons like gold chains, gold-plated AKs, gold watches, local Ho's in Dallas cheerleaders outfits, and mindless killing; Africa has lots of local Ho's who like to watch people being mindlessly killed; the top international arms dealers ride in their own planes to deliver the goods to Sierra Leone or wherever; former communist generals will sell billions in lethal arms to whomever for a Rolls and a VCRand so on. I'm not being too nice about this film, which is on an important topic, has a good cast and many good moments. Plus parts of the film offer a descent into hell that has some real power. But the film accepts that the average audience consists of political children who don't know about the arms trade or that the US government is a world leader in it. Therefore the film illustrates this fact rather than telling a story that would analyze this fact. The filmmakers make the usual mistake of assuming no one will watch a movie that doesn't eliminate all complexity in favor of a story about one or more movie stars acting normal in abnormal situations and talking about it. Oddly enough, this comes off as more didactic rather than less, since the lessons don't flow from the missing complex structure but from the stars' reciprocal speeches. Too bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
An amazing story with an unbelievable ending,"You forget about Nicholas Cage, and only see Yuri Orlov in this movie. He did a very good job portraying the main character as a realistic gunrunner, and not some kind hero or antihero. In this movie, there are no good guys and bad guys, only the reality of war, politics, and business (capitalism in a nutshell). The ending is shocking but also realistic, this is a movie that really makes you think.This movie isn't for everybody, but if you have the patience for a thought provoking film, I strongly recommend this movie. I gave it a ten because of the overall acting, story telling, pictures, and flow of the movie. And of course, the ending really knocked me off my feet.Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wardogs is better,"Not a terrible movie but I did not find it very engaging.The story is very broad (almost covers the whole life of Yuri) and in doing so makes some of the side/intermediate plots feel rushed. A lot of the events that happened could have been made into their own movies.At the same time, they almost completely skip over how Yuri made the leap from small time dealer to billionaire, which would have been interesting if the goal was to really outline the rise, fall, and struggles of an arms dealer.Acting and writing are pretty mid. Too much narration from Nicholas Cage. I think Wardogs is a way better movie, but Lord of War probably does a better job at highlighting the dark side of arms dealing.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
More boring Hollywood moralizing,"The story of an amoral arms dealer from New York could be made into an interesting movie, but this isn't it. ""Lord of War"" is a paint-by-numbers, preachy, finger-pointing, ""oh, isn't the arms trade so unethical and it kills kittens and puppies too"" piece of Hollywood garbage. Whatever happened to characters, stories and dialog? The big studios wonder why box office numbers keep declining, well its because of crap like this.Nicholas Cage stars and narrates the entire movie, as Yuri, the arms dealer, who with help of his brother, becomes an arms dealing kingpin.

Is this a remake...?,"Well, I've appreciated this movie, but something is hitting back in the 'after-shock', and this is the reason for not so high a vote: first of all I would have preferred it filmed on a black and white film, or a mixture of B&W and Color, so as to appear more dry and 'reportage-like'; I believe that would have solved much of the past-impression I got of some kind of indulgence about 'weapons ads', video games and blood shedding... from the first title sequence onward... The second point, and this comes probably from my being Italian, I was already somehow accustomed to this subject, since I saw this kind of characters and situations in one of Alberto Sordi's movie, 'Finché c'è guerra c'è speranza (1974)'; I should also admit this is not just a carbon copy of that work, and not just because of its updates: possibly you may consider it as an homage to that movie as well, but I feel someone should have pointed it out here!",,Anonymous,Crime
Difficult political climate,"I think that this is a good story and well acted. I think the idea that it is a political movie is not appropriate. An individual viewer may hope that it follows his or her political ideas, but that is not the point of a movie. I find it is difficult in this climate to make a movie that is not ""politically correct."" The one failing of this movie is that it was probably watered down to make it more soothing to the American Pshyche. So,I don't find the movie that daring. What would you do in your personal work life if you finally came to the conclusion that your work was something really morally corrupt. I see millions of people who seem able to go to work every day without an active morality. So, this is one man's tale. It was not ""American World Police 2"" cinema. If it had been a bit more original or edgier I would have voted higher for it.

"Violent, sadistic, ironic and utterly hilarious","This is an excellent film for people who enjoy a good story, with a bit of irony and black humour.The film is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a gun runner, ruthlessly cashing in on social upheaval and political violence. In the name of realism it is unabashedly violent at points.Nicholas Cage as the gun runner himself, is often affected by the moral conundrums of his stock and trade. The real conflict in the story is how he resolves these anomalies.At the same time, the film does not glamorize the gun trade at all. At no point does it say that gun runners are actually really decent guys. Instead it simply challenges you to assess it for what it really is, and use it as a metaphor.Be aware that this is not the sort of film you would typically watch with your family.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very good story of an arms dealer hurt by occasional preaching,"Nick Cage is an arms dealer who tells us about his life and how the world, and his conscious has changed over time.This is a wonderfully made film. Its witty, well acted and contains some technically brilliant shots and sequences. This is a film thats a kick in the head and forces you to think about what people like Cage's character are doing to the world. Cage gives a wonderful performance as a man who begins doing something no one else is and manages to make enough money he can get everything he ever wanted,However he never expected it to weigh so heavily on his soul. The film does a great job of showing the truly bizarre world that Cage inhabits. Its all food for thought.Unfortunately the film often undermines itself by being overly preachy with too many passages that are about the statistics of what the weapons are doing to our world. There are too many times where in the name of expediency people talk about what all of the weapons are doing, as if the story itself isn't enough proof.I liked this movie a great deal, the problem is that I wanted to like it more. Its one of those films thats really good but which has something keeping it from being great.Definitely worth trying at some point.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Prefer it My Way,"Greetings again from the darkness. No mystery in why this one is fading into oblivion at the box office. It is a very non-mainstream subject matter that is all but impossible to market to the film-going public. This again proves that a top movie star does not make a hit movie.Writer/Director Andrew Niccol (""Gattaca"", ""S1mOne"", writer of ""The Terminal"") delivers a very visual film considering it is about gun runners. The sight of Nic Cage running around deserts and slums in a tailored suit and crisp white shirt is funny in a sick way. Cage's character seems to have convinced himself that being really good at something is enough, that something doesn't necessarily have to be a ""good"" thing. His wife, played by the gorgeous Bridget Moynihan (""The Recruit""; ""I, Robot"") understands that no lifestyle is worth failing as a human being.The story is much better than the film allows. There is a bit too much cuteness and wink-wink nudge-nudge going on. The relationship between Cage and his brother, played by Jared Leto (Fight Club"", ""Panic Room"") is very confusing to them and to the viewer. Ian Holm has a nice turn as Cage's rival arms dealer. Ethan Hawke is actually pretty good as the agent on a mission to shut Cage down.The film tries to make some political statements, but mostly it is a mish mash of seriousness and smart-ass comments. Usually when a film has this much voice over, it is either a cost cutting measure or the story is too difficult to follow. It appears Niccol just wanted to hang his hat on Cage's track record for delivering and didn't trust his own ability to make a stand-up film.Overall, a decent performance from Cage (not his best), a solid supporting cast and some amazing shots of parts of the world most of us will never visit, make this one worth seeing. The opening sequence during the credits is pretty cool as it follows the manufacturing of a single bullet up until the point where it fulfills its destiny. This could easily be the Cage character's lifeline as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Grip the Mind and Conscience,"The rise to power of an international arms dealer is the subject of Lord of War. The film follows Yuri Orlov from his youth on the streets of New York, where he first gets the idea of going into arms's sales, through a career of accumulating wealth, winning the woman of his dreams, and gaining the power to bend governments to his will. The story is said to be based upon actual events with the character of Yuri representing five major arms dealers.Nicolas Cage is the star of Lord of War, and I cannot think of many other living actors who could have taken this part and made it their own. He has an uncanny ability to portray a man without affectation yet exude powerful emotions of love, lust, guilt, and remorse. Cage narrates the film with his unique sardonic tone, and that narration is a perfect rendering of the message of the film: this is business -- big business -- and a few million innocent lives should never interfere with profit.That special tone in Cage's voice is so very effective in such lines as:""There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?""and""I sell to leftists, and I sell to rightists. I even sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers.""Lines of this character and some humorous situations may cause viewers to see this as black comedy; however, the suffering caused by war depicted here is so graphic that humor has little standing. Nevertheless, movies are made to entertain, and this film's dark wit creates superior entertainment.Jared Leto, as Yuri's brother, effectively represents the decay that infects a person of conscience who becomes involved in the business of human destruction. He provides an interesting contrast to Yuri who is seemingly without emotion or conscience.Yuri's wife, beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan, shows us the love that might have been available to a man whose emotions had not shut him off from mankind.For the depiction of pure evil and avarice, Eamonn Walker and Sammi Rotibi are notable for their portrayals of an African despot and his son. Rotibi especially chills with a manner of a man who has, from birth, absolute power over the life and death of anyone within his range.Andrew Niccol's writing and direction have provided us with words that grip the mind and conscience and images that evoke both gentleness and horror. Lord of War should engage the interest and concern of a wide audience.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Lord of Mediocrity,"This movie is LAME. There are only two good things about it: the subject is slightly unusual (but could have been much more interesting with better handling) and the opening and closing shots of Cage's character are cool. Other than that, I could barely make it through this thing. It took me several days and I had to watch it in chunks.The characters are two dimensional and I didn't care about any of them; I didn't believe the relationships--ever. The acting, writing, directing-- mediocre at best. Any more, Nick Cage frankly looks strange; it is like he is always trying to look like a movie star (thin, tan, and shiny smile) rather than the characters he portrays. Jared Leto was irritating--it looked like he was auditioning for a bigger part in which he could chew all the scenery all the time. Ethan Hawke was not convincing as a tough government agent ( I don't why he keeps playing cops; he comes off way too wimpy), and the woman who played the wife was the most mediocre of all.

"Hmmm, Adnrew Niccol really has a lot on his mind....","Nicolas Cage leads as Yuri Orlov, an arms dealer that believes his trade is fair, so to speak, and that he is doing his job, well. Director Andrew Niccol offers another social assessment, this time scraping a little bit more bone.Niccol tackled social discrimination in the form of genetics in Gattaca, the world's lust for tele-visual junk in The Truman Show and now he resides in the helmer's chair for the Lord of War, a tongue in cheek look at the world's arms trade and the politicians and warlords that pay for Cage's designer lifestyle and maintain his designer wife.Mr Niccol is a man that has a clear vision. His previous works all engaged the audience with an underdog, someone that society has said has no chance who eventually circumvents the odds and liberates themselves. This film however is a little trickier to decipher.The opening shot trails across a sea of bullets and lands on Cage, explaining the woeful truth via his jobs description: ""1 out of every twelve people on the planet has a gun, my job is to figure out how to arm the other eleven,"" and then we are taken on a clever life cycle of a bullet from it's birth to it finding it's home - a child's head. Indeed, tongue-in-cheek, indeed the opening sequence is laced with brutal cynicism but is Niccol wagging his finger or trying to provide us with a vehicle where we, the popcorn chewing audience, make our minds up? Both methinks, but the answer is hard to figure out. Possibly due to the subject matter or the reality that there are Yuri Orlovs everywhere, courtesy of none of the characters being romanticised- there are no good guys or bad guys as such.However, on closer inspection it is clear Niccol wanted to create a pure anti-hero, someone who cares for his family and his wife but has the moral unwavering of a government assassin, which is essentially what Cages' Yuri is. The film works very well as a blasé report of a trade that seems futile to try and stop despite peoples' efforts. One said person is Vitaly (Jared Leto) who's flawed Adonis is present again in this role and is compelling to watch as his morals outweigh his brother's and provides a good contrast. Ethan Hawke, continues to reinforce his Oscar nominated calibre as an Interpol agent constantly outwitted and outranked by Cage and his supporters (i.e. customers)..This is a good film, that explores subject matter that hasn't really been tackled in this vein. All performances from the lead, Bridget Moynahan as Yuri's wife to Ian Holm's rival arms dealer are concrete.Andrew Niccol has provided yet another interesting social critique that may hit harder than his others but nevertheless should be appreciated for its audacity if not for its unsettling truths that (maybe) should have been tackled a while ago.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Niccol Trucks On With Another Good Film,"In an industry that has been brimming with socialistic enthusiasm and leftist political ideology, it takes a relative unknown to release a smart film that proves to be an entertaining watch whilst delivering a provocative message to the viewer. Directed by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, S1m0ne), Lord of War tells the story of Ukrainian-born Yuri (Nicholas Cage) who eagerly tries to escape the slums of Little Odessa and, in doing so, joins the thriving arms business. The film jumps from America to the crumbling U.S.S.R. to the African state of Liberia. While the obvious direction for a film depicting rich merchants suppyling arms to the third world would be an emotionally-stricken drama filled with grief and fury, Niccol takes a surprisingly fresh turn by delivering a semi-satirical film that paints Cage's character as a different kind of monster: a brilliant entrepeneur.While the constant narration may grate some viewers, Cage's monotone voice matches his performance on screen. He's like a used car salesmen; cool and persuasive, manipulating the strings from his icy exterior. Proving to be valuable foils to Cage's largely emotionless performance, his unstable brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and the Liberian ""lord of war"", Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker) even out Yuri's virtues and vices. The other performances, however, are secondary to Cage's solid performance. As an actor who never impressed me in the past, his recent films, including Adaptation and even National Treasure have proved him to be a more quirky, if not more versatile, actor.The film itself is of the slow variety. As in Ted Demme's Blow, the film progresses in a linear fashion, demonstrating Yuri's growing business from year to year. The opening scenes of the film are among its most powerful; we see Nicholas Cage standing amidst a sea of bullet casings, and as a fly on a wall, we are placed on the back of one bullet, tracing its path from his warehouse, being traded and carried across the seas and ending up in a firefight in Africa, until it is shot into the skull of a young boy. Swallowing the relative slow pace of the rest of the film after this heavily stylistic intro is made an easier task due to the satirical nature of each scene, similar to Three Kings. One particular scene has Yuri evading a persistent Ethan Hawke and dumping his weapons cache into the arms of enthusiastic African peoples; the image parallels the UN food deliveries in the third world, and is one of the greatest examples of satire in the film. Despite a tone that mimics the sombre figure of Cage, Niccol manages to include a few moving images that highlight the reality of third world living (following the weapon drop, a brilliant fast-forward scene depicts an entire cargo plane scavenged for parts). There are also enough twists and betrayals to keep any viewer glued to their screens. Lord of War will not go down in history as one of the greatest films of 2005, but any film enthusiast would be amiss to give it a pass. (7/10 Good)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't expect a great action flick because I imagined much more from them as the air plane scene for example that I liked.

Nothing that great,"Not sure what all the hype was about. This movie, as most, states ""Based on Actual Events."" That's about like saying that Capricorn One is based on actual events. Arms dealing is serious problem, but the movie tried to glorify the gangsta vision of guns while appealing to the anti-gunners. Can't say that this is an excellent movie. Not epic. Not original. Some decent panoramic views, but nothing outstanding. Story was slow, over simplified and very fashion-oriented. I suppose if you are an NYC holier-than-though, posh and perfect actor, maybe you would appreciate this movie. Overall it was weak, and giving it a 5 was too generous.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A surprise,"Lord of War did something not many movies do. It surprised me. After watching the trailer I was expecting something fun, maybe a little gun-play and Mr. Cage talking his way out of trouble. What I got however was an entirely different animal. This was a smart, well written film that hit all the buttons it needed to. Family, love, honesty, commitment, guns, satire, more guns... Without giving anything away this film made me think of some of the issues from the last two decades, and really brings home the fact that many of the skeletons in America's closet have come back to haunt us all. The soundtrack was fun, the film was well shot and well paced, and the opening scene was perfect. All in all a movie that is well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Cage shines in a film that could have been brilliant - 70%,"One of many things my Better Half and I share is a deep-rooted respect for Nicolas Cage. Personally, I find it hard to think of a movie he's done that I haven't enjoyed in some way – whether he's in blockbuster action fluff like ""The Rock"" or in seriously heavy dramas like ""Leaving Las Vegas"". OK, I can forgive anyone ""Con Air"" and Hell, every rule has to be broken at some point. From the moment I first saw the trailer, I could tell that this wasn't Cage in wide-eyed Elvis mode. ""Lord Of War"" is something that screams to be taken seriously, despite the near-the-knuckle humour and deep implausibility of it all. This is a very modern war film and an original one, delving into a world seldom explored in movies.Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian gun-runner who takes us on a journey from his early days living in America to his rise to the top of the pile. In the beginning, he trades Uzis to local gangsters with the help of his younger brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) but soon eclipses the efforts of his British idol, the veteran arms dealer Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm). But for all of his money, he is morally bankrupt - his trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) is unaware of Yuri's other women, his son grows up without him, his brother descends into a drug-fuelled hell and the dubious nature of his business continues to eat at Yuri's soul. As if this wasn't enough, he is constantly forced to outwit federal agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who is getting ever closer to catching Yuri.While ""Lord Of War"" is an excellent character study of a thoroughly disgusting human being, it isn't what I would call an entertaining film. It has a streak of wickedly black humour running through it but because the truth seems so improbable (at least, I hope it is) and because Yuri is so vile a person, you don't sympathise with him at all. Cage is typically brilliant as the slimy arms dealer and Hawke is a perfect foil for him. But the story is one that you rarely identify with, set in a world that is both horrifying and reprehensible. The fact that many do this for real - a fact hammered home by the end credits - and often with the blessing of their respective governments can't help but anger those of us with a conscious.""Lord Of War"" strikes me as being one of those 'cult' movies that come along every now and again. It's not a laugh-a-minute and anyone who saw the trailer (like I did) may feel slightly disappointed (like I am). I do feel that the film was marketed as something that it wasn't - maybe the studios felt that a serious war movie with a moral ending wouldn't have made much at the box office. I noticed that no American studio would fund ""Lord Of War"" and I wasn't surprised, given the US's current love for all things trigger-based. I respect the fact that this is a well-made, intelligent film but for me, I prefer something with a more overt anti-war message such as ""Black Hawk Down"". By comparison, ""Lord Of War"" comes across as a darker version of ""Jerry Maguire"" and to be honest, that's not what I'm looking in a war film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Muddle or Fusion of Genre Movie,"29 January 2006. Depending on one's reaction, Lord of War is either a muddled attempt at addressing an important social issue using a barrage of different movie genres to create a politically safe movie or a fusion of delicately balanced movie approaches (genre) to create a sensitive look at arms dealing. It's difficult to classify this movie - a wry, dark comedy action thriller drama? What holds this movie together instead of falling apart among a multitude of movie genres that almost amount to an overload of movie approaches that almost don't deliver is Nicholas Cage and his voice over and his character that like Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector, is this dirtbag that you can for some mysterious reason still like.Throughout this movie there are glimpses of various movie genres that if had been specifically used by themselves could have made this movie a much more focused powerful comedy or drama or political drama or relational drama, an action, or political thriller, or crime drama, or an adventure movie any of which might have been even better than what was ultimately presented on screen.

Business as Usual: A Peek at the Weapons Trafficking World,"Director/writer Andrew Niccol makes films with layers of meaning, the kind that find us laughing at inappropriate moments because contemporary life is like that: what on the surface seems like an entertaining story has very dark roots. His previous strange films include 'The Terminal', 'The Truman Show', 'S1m0ne 'and 'Gattaca' and now LORD OF WAR takes its place in that arena of black comedy. Niccol really releases his last spear when at the end of the film there is a statement 'Based on Actual Facts' and at that point the film takes on an altogether new significance.Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) immigrate to the US to Little Odessa with their parents (Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian) who have posed as Jews to escape the Ukraine in 1980 - before Glasnost. Yuri is bright and sees gunrunning as a lucrative business and after his first tiny success in the gang infested Little Odessa, he convinces his dreamy-eyed brother to be his partner. The business grows exponentially as Yuri discovers his best customers are countries at war: in time he is wealthy, has married his dream sweetheart Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and settles in as one of the more successful gunrunners in the world. He buys weapons from stockpiled American ordnances after the US has 'finished' a war and sells them to Eastern European, African and South American revolutionaries. He is tracked/stalked by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who in his role as a government agent is determined to stop Yuri's dispersal of deadly weapons that result in needless deaths when disseminated to countries in the throes of political change.Though Yuri is first for business, he does care deeply about his wife and child, and about Vitaly whose entry into the world of wealth is soon squandered on a cocaine addiction requiring frequent detox. Yuri is not a mean spirited man: he sees his business as just that, salesmanship of items for which there is a huge demand and he does not see himself as the perpetrator of violence. His life has moments of compassion, many moments of financial success, moments of pride in being the gifted gun-runner he has become, and moments of introspection. He hobnobs with dictators, revolutionaries, fellow gunrunners and the law. The resolution of the story is not an end but merely a tapering off.The film is narrated by Yuri and for the first part sounds almost comedic - until the visual depiction of the killings are on screen. Niccol appears to be showing us a factual business that is legal in the eyes of the government ('Washington encourages gunrunners to take care of aspects of world control they can't be seen as condoning') and it is his gift to drive his message home about how human lives are wasted for the sake of business and weapons proliferation. The film is painful to absorb on this level.Nicholas Cage gives a powerful performance as the opportunistic Yuri and the criminally under-used Jared Leto once again proves his fine-honed acting skills as the drugged addled innocent Vitaly. Likewise Bridget Moynahan is excellent as the wife who elects not to question her source of wealth. Key cameos are keenly provided by Ian Holms and Eaamonn Walker. The film is rapid-fire paced, the cinematography is excellent, and the impact of the film is powerful. It is unusual for a director to take on topics this controversial and end up with a film this entertaining. Recommended. Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Cage at his best, arguably Leto too; powerful drama with thrills, tears, and even laughs","Easily, in my opinion, Nicolas Cage at his best, with a powerfully versatile performance that covers all bases. From angry and emotional to the complete opposite: he portrays someone who is detached and indifferent, while not entirely devoid of humanity, so very well. Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke are also playing some of my favorite roles they've ever had. You really want to feel for everyone on board, somehow even Cage's villainous sort of role. His narration of the whole movie, surprisingly, doesn't get tiring or irksome. It fits and feels right. Sure, it comes off as a little preachy here and there, but it's just playing the hand it's been dealt, and well. There's still sufficient suspense and moments of unexpected intensity that keep you far from being bored, even if you aren't intrigued by the subject matter. And sure, the movie panders to the human moral code in some scenes more than others, but not exaggeratedly if you know anything about the true evils in the world. This film doesn't hold back, and it is felt thoroughly. The soundtrack is great, too; the ""Hallelujah"" scene always breaks me down, and that isn't the only one. Even when I'm not chuckling from certain subtle humor, I'm either glued to the screen or, yes, tearing up. From the emotionally nauseating get ingenious opening credits to the nerve-wracking ending and a bit of closure you wish you didn't receive.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solidly enjoyable film,"Lord of War is an interesting film (as you'd expect from any film starring Nicolas Cage) but it feels like a few opportunities were missed.It follows the rising and falling fortunes of opportunistic international arms dealer Yuri, played superbly by Nicolas Cage. He is the real high point of the film. It is a vibrant and energetic performance that pulls you in and demands your attention. There are a host of strong supporting performances from the likes of Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke, but it's all about Cage.The story is pretty well told but nothing particularly remarkable. At times it flies by too quickly and I do wish there was a little more meat on the bones of some of the themes and the ideas. Still it makes for an enjoyable time.The filmmaking isn't overly flashy but is perfectly serviceable.Lord of War is a pretty safe bet of a film all things considered. It has a great lead performance and some interesting themes, but could have pushed a bit further in certain places. Overall a strong and enjoyable film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Didactic = bad,"I hope Wal-Mart takes this back. It sucks on so many levels it is hard to detail them all. Even the commentary was unwatchable. It reminded me of bad software documentation. Load accumulator with AX. Move AX to ACC. No kidding? I can see what you shot--- how about something a little more interesting? (See Walk the Line commentary for greatness.) Now I didn't decide to take it back just because it sucks. I decided to take it back because of the lame-a$$ anti-gun screed complete with fake ""gun manufacturers"" included in the special features. I agree with Peter Tosh. ""Ain't gonna be no peace till man get equal rights and justice."" If people are not killing themselves with guns then they will use rocks. Or famine, the most popular tool of oppression. But give 30 Jews in the Warsaw ghetto guns and they can hold off an entire Nazi division for a month. That's why Hitler agreed with the creators of this movie-- first you take everybody's guns away.But I digress. Anytime you have huge sections of voice-over narration it is a pretty good sign the scriptwriter can't tell a story. The story spins from one improbable scenario to another. If you know anything about guns, history or politics you will dwell on the errors and not pay attention to the (bad) story-telling. The African dictator was the only sympathetic character-- which says a lot about the other characters.This rivals the badness of Dungeons and Dragons, the movie one perceptive commenter said: ""This is what happens when the director's mother owns a production company."" Yes, that bad. It is so pathetic hearing the creator's talk about their limited budget. Fifty million dollars is limiting? Look what Tarantino did with 1.2 in Reservoir Dogs.

Underappreciated bittersweet tale about the arms trade with Cage at his best,"This is a movie which is impossible to watch in Australia at the moment. Which is a real shame because as many people should see it as possible. After having enjoyed War Dogs I knew I had to see this, the original war arms film with a bit of humour and first person narration. This is the superior film, however given it doesn't shy away from the death and destruction that follows it is not as enjoyable even with great bits of humour and tension. A lot of drug use and sex scenes also.The intro to the film is brilliant, as is Cage. Few can play the characters that he can and for this role hes perfect as the guy who got into drug running because hes good at it. And doesnt seem to care about the lives killed from his guns. Ethan Hawke is great as the relentless and ethical agent in pursuit, a true good guy balancing Yuris completely amoral sociopathy.

Funny and disturbing in equal measure,"Surprisingly effective black comedy about the arms trade that manages to be laugh out loud funny one moment and disturbing as hell the next. Yes, the film owes a lot to Goodfellas, from the decade spanning story to the constant voice overs. But it does a good job of sucking you in and entertaining you while at the same time showing you how the arms trade works, all without coming across as overly preachy.Nicholas Cage puts in a solid performance as the arms dealer at the center of the story. It's not a sympathetic character, but he's so open and audacious in his evil-doing, and Cage is so amiable in the role, that it's hard not to like him. All too often Cage's acting is either over-the-top or wooden as a plank, but here he gets the balance just right and carries the film pretty much single-handed, with constant monologues and more screen time than most of the rest of the cast combined.Jared Leto's also effective as the troubled younger brother who has the misfortune of developing a conscience (never a good thing for a gun runner), and Ian Holm has a nice little cameo as a rival arms dealer. But it's Eamonn Walker's turn as the psychotic African dictator Andre Baptiste which really steals the show.Despite being a 'message' film, Lord of War is also slick and highly entertaining. Whether or not you're interested in the politics behind it, it's well worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
brilliant but problematic,"One important point to get out of the way - the use of Interpol in this film is indeed completely fictional, but it has been a conventional fiction in films, especially action films, since the late 1960s, so I am willing to pardon its use here. However, I should also note that this is not an action film, it is not technically even a ""thriller,"" and part of the difficulty assessing the film is in trying to determine precisely what it is.This is in many ways a brilliant film, both visually and in its dialog, and both a thoughtful and thought-provoking expose of the contemporary arms industry. Yet it has two difficulties in its structure that make it difficult to recommend without qualification. Both have been noted in previous reviews: first, we don't get to see the development of gun-runner Orlov's business, from his first sale to his appearance at an arms-sales convention, where he is already well-known, albeit only as 'an amateur.' How does he get from Brooklyn to there with limited funds? There's actually only one probable answer - major loans - but this is only hinted at when he remarks about using credit cards to pay off credit cards. And even this doesn't explain how he adapted to the culture of illegal arms sales when he first entered it. That's important because obviously that introduction would have gone into the worlds of, first, street gangs, then mobs, then international crime cartels - we know this is true, since we do get the one glimpse of a major sale to a South American drug dealer. But surely this would only be the tip of the iceberg.The other problem in the structure is more difficult to address, because it is also part of the film's strength. The first two thirds of the movie are presented as high-irony satire on the international arms market. It is only as the final third unfolds that we begin to realize that Orlov, as voice-over narrator, is not speaking ironically, he actually means every word he says. The tone of the film then shifts dramatically into tragedy.The strength of this movement is that we at last discover Orlov to be a cold-blooded socio-path, even able to disregard the death of his brother, since it doesn't entirely impede the arms deal he is engaged in at the time. This is a man who has only one reason to live, to develop a successful illegal arms trading business. Nothing else matters to him, and because of that he is actually more wretched than the murderous thugs he deals with - they, at least, enjoy what they do, he is merely obsessed with his profession.That's a powerful statement, to be sure. The question is whether this dramatic shift in tone really works, or have we been, as more than one reviewer expressed it, deceived by the comedic beginning into buying a kind of numbed sociological drama? One reviewer compared this film to Scorcese's ""Goodfellows,"" but Scorcese affects the shift from ironic commentary on Mafia culture to actual gangster film drama in a gradual convolution punctuated by moments of intense violence that point out the moral degradation we should have been admitting all along. ""Lord of War"" reads as pure satire until the moment it isn't amusing at all, and that is very disturbing. It's hard to say yet whether that is a good thing, or whether it is asking too much from its audience.Otherwise, as noted, much of the film-making is actually brilliant - in the script and the visuals; and the editing holding these elements together is solid. The acting is quite good, although I found Cage lacking focus occasionally - but this may have to do with the shift in tone noted above. And the film's topic is certainly important enough to consider.But it's not clear whether a film can go down this path without surrendering some important clarity. I had the same sense with the sudden shift in tone towards the end of ""No Country for Old Men;"" and as with ""No Country,"" at the end of this film, one is left with an uneasy sense of helplessness. I'm not sure that's where the director wanted to leave us, and I'm not sure whether I like, or even accept, being there.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of Cages better ones.,"It is indeed quite easy to poke fun at some of the cages more laughably bad roles that he has taken as of late. However, all the memes and the like should never take away from the fact that he can actually be a good actor sometimes, hell, even a damn great one, like he is in this.This film follows the life of a Ukrainian man who sells guns to various dictators and militants and eventually becomes the main financier of bloodshed and combat in many warring countries. Knowing that it is easy to see his character as irredeemably evil. He sells these weapons with full knowledge innocent people will likely die because of it and does it anyway, he sees it as a business. That's what makes him that much more of an interesting character. He sees the prospect of arms dealing as a pure money making affair, with no attached desire to get involved with any of the conflict that makes his business necessary. He goes from country to country, getting all down in the nit and grit of the monstrosities and genocides committed, and still leaves with the cash and returns home to great riches and a loving family.This is a pure character study of a film. It takes us through the eyes of cages character, who also narrated the film. We see his many complexes on how he believes arms dealers may be the only thing keeping a sort balance. How they may be more genuine then some prompted legal businesses. It has a good deal of violence and depravity to it, but also intrigue. This all comes down to cages brilliant performance, all the levels of cleverness and precision that make him fun to watch, and the rest of the movie, right along with all the uncomfortable states it outs you in and the questions it makes you ask there.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ironic how countrys promote peace and sell weapons at the same time 7/10,"Lord of War is a brilliant film which criticizes the world of arms dealing and the fact that five countries who are part of the U. N are also weapons suppliers.The plot centers around fictional character (yet based on real life arms dealer) Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his tales of becoming a ruthless arms dealer who later questions his morality.One of the most interesting aspects I've picked up during watch was the resemblance in character to both Yuri Orlov and another figure - Walter White/Hisenberg from the series Breaking Bad.Both Yuri and White are similar figures, they both are excellent at their illegal jobs, question themselves throughout their journey, get their family involved in the business.What defines both characters the most is that they enjoy their job and position they gain. Any other character in film or TV would have loved their illegal doings and gain, cash flowing from everywhere.But that's exactly where Yuri and Walter White are exceptional, they do what they do because they love it. It gets the better out of them, yet consumes them. Just like Yuri says near the end of the film to Eva, he's good at it, at his profession, he loves it.Aside of the opening sequence of ""the life of a bullet"" and great acting by both Cage and Ethan Hawke. I don't have anything more to say about this film, I believe it perfectly rounds the arc of ""rise and fall of a criminal"", all while pointing out to certain aspects of peace and conflicts in the world, and how the major countries do little to nothing to stop them.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Very good supporting roles from the great Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke. Bridget Moynahan as Ava Fontaine gives us something extremely beautiful to see.

Works as an immigrants story and healthy dose of reality,"Of course, Hollywood's stock-in-trade is fantasy so it can be refreshing to see it depict the real world in real world terms. Like ""The Constant Gardener"", ""Lord of War"" lays out the picks-and- shovels guys behind geopolitical civil unrest. Lots of groups would like to start a war but few have connections needed to men like Nicholas Cage's Orlov to bring the idea to fruition. Cage's natural neutral affect, normally a liability, works perfectly here as we see Orlov as the kind of mostly emotionless pragmatist will to engage in the dirty business of acquiring and reselling arms without regard to the cause they will be used for. Ethan Hawke plays his good- looking, drug-addled brother and sidekick and if this were a ""Star Trek"" film he would wear a red shirt. The movie does an excellent job of demonstrating the ruthlessness Orlov needs to rise from cook in his parents' restaurant to the world's foremost arms dealer and husband to a model. It also does well at demonstrating the pressures and dangers he faces in this profession and why he has limited ability to extricate himself when he needs to later in the film.

One of the most engaging and realistic gun trade movies,"Enjoyed watching it several times. Based on facts, obviously 'colorized' and stylized for effects, but shows the strategies, tactics and dilemmas involved. Great acting by Cage! A thought-provoking and darkly humorous exploration of the international arms trade, and the morally weird world of weapons deals. It's a very visually strong narrative. The plot occasionally jumps into over-the-top stuff, it is still grounded in the harsh realities based on facts - one can easily tell that. The supporting cast, including Jared Leto as Cage's troubled brother and Ethan Hawke as a determined Interpol agent, adds real depth to the story. Lord of War is an Excellent portrayal of the ethical quandaries and complex geopolitical factors at play faced by those involved in the arms trade.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Selling Guns to Mobsters,"Having immigrated with his family from Ukraine and subsequently growing up in a humble working class section of Brooklyn ""Yuri Orlov"" (Nicholas Cage) yearns for something more. Not only does he want to become rich but he also dreams of marrying a fashion model by the name of ""Ava Fontaine"" (Bridget Moynahan) who he worships from afar. His big break comes one day when he latches on to a scheme to sell guns to mobsters and from that day he puts his heart and soul into his newfound business. Due to his imagination and persistence he quickly rises through the ranks to become the number one international arms dealer in the world. It's during this same time that he manages to win over Ava to finally have everything he wants. Unfortunately, his sudden rise to wealth and fame isn't without a cost as his competitors and those investigating him begin to close in on him from all sides. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent film which benefited greatly from the impressive performance by Nicholas Cage. Likewise, having an attractive actress like Bridget Moynahan certainly didn't hurt this film in any way either. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this movie and have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cage at his best,"This film was recommended to me by a friend when it his DVD. I watched it and was amazed by the things depicted in the film, some cool, some bizarre, some tragic, yet completely entertaining from start to finish.Nic Cage's performance in this film is terrific, in my opinion, much more tragic than his role from Leaving Las Vegas. You love him and hate him, cheer him, and root against him for the path he chooses. His choice to become an arms dealer comes as a kind of destiny he feels he was born to fulfill.I like how his character always manages to stay one step ahead of the law while juggling his family life. His choices are not always morally correct, yet he is aware and makes no apologies.Please see this movie if you have a chance. After you watch it, watch it with director's commentary. The director has a lot of good stuff to tell about the movie, from how he got the financing to the actors he hired for certain roles.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Lord of War-...And to think It All Began in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn***",Nicolas Cage gives an admirable performance in this film as a Ukrainian émigré seeking a better life for himself in Brooklyn. The family came here pretending to be Jewish so as to get out of the old Soviet Union faster. It is true that Russian Jews intermarried among Jews so as to leave the Soviet Union but carrying this to the point that they acted as Jews once they were here was a bit ridiculous.Cage and his brother get into the life of gun-runners. We follow their escapades through various countries. They supply the guns to the highest bidder. They couldn't care less why the guns are being used.The film deals at length with their trips to a corrupt Liberian government.Cage marries along the way and has an ideal life which eventually catches up with him. The film deals with a CIA agent (Ethan Hawke) who actively pursues him until he realizes that Cage is also a government plant who will be allowed to continue to do this as long as the interests of the American government is served. Corruption was never worse.Very nice cinematography marks an engaging film.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Wow, surprisingly good","So first we have Nicholas Cage, who hasn't shown much judiciousness in picking scripts and overacts regularly. Then we have Niccol, who's got an essay writer's penchant for making workable film premises a real chore. Somehow, both of them dialed back their tendencies, and nailed it.Let's start with Cage. I kept expecting him to break out into some over-the-top emoting, or overplay cool (so that it was uncool), but if you are looking for evidence that the man can act, this is exhibit A. As Orlov (guess that's a nod to Nosferatu), he makes an utterly believable sophist who can compartmentalise good and evil. Everything with him is a little caricaturish, but the character he conveys has enough cracks in the facade to make it relatable.Then there's Niccol. I was surprised to see his name on it. If you've ever watched Gattaca or the Truman show, his movies have h""igh ground"" content but ate often stilted and poorly delivered coming over as set pieces. This one though, has enough grit and grime, and enough dimension to lift it out of film school.Many will react to the social message of the film and I guess that was the point, but looking at it as a film, it is good.It compares with War Dogs (2016) and War Dogs is much better made but this film does a lot more.Go watch it. Remind yourself that Nic Cage can act.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
instructive and thorough examination of the arms smuggling,"I found this comedy/drama extremely interesting in his documentation of wealthy countries gun trade at the expense of poor people. Andrew Niccol delivered a didactic piece of work, log lesson but never tiresome. This work manages to combine dramatic events and a dark humour, succeeding in making laugh in spite of the seriousness of the subject. Nicholas Cage's acting performance is not as perfect as usually but decent anyway, the script is quite solid and the direction too, that's why the movie gets its message, dealing with ethical matters without ever being heavy. Bridget Moynahan gorgeous but surprisingly less believable than in other films.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Enjoyable,"I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was, considering it didn't get a major release and stars Nicholas Coppola. That's right, Coppola. He does't GET to rely on his familial connections to get into Vinewood, then pretend otherwise as if he got where he is based on acting skill.ACTION) This isn't an action movie, despite the guns. The effects are functional, and there's a cool intro sequence that follows a bullet from manufacture through travel to use.COMEDY) LoW is a dark movie, and it's peppered with bits of dark humor here and there that can be good for a chuckle if you're sick like me.PLOT) The movie is a fictional character study of an illegal arms merchant as he develops his business, gets paid, and runs from The Man. The script is good, and the flick wisely decides to set things up as a sequence of interesting narrated Vignettes rather than a straightforward story. This lets us skip from one story to the other quickly, and keeps the movie moving at a brisk clip. The only time the movie slows down is during the last quarter, where our antihero undergoes his crisis of conscience; that sequence could have been handled better.The narrating is passable, but sweet lord Mr. Coppola cannot act, and it shows, and while his valium-drip monotone was OK in a simple action movie like Face Off, this isn't Face Off. As the focal point, he's supposed to be carrying the movie, and he's the worst actor here. Only the script saves this movie.Regardless, the character he plays is a well-written totally amoral salesman, rationalizing his death business. It's those people with moral convictions, the government agent who won't bend the rules to catch his prey and the competing arms dealer who takes sides in conflicts based on politics, who are the losers. All the protagonist sacrifices are those family members who insist on following a code of morality that no longer seems applicable in a world where people are going to kill each other, anyway, no matter who's supplying the ammunition.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very intriguing and entertaining film about a gunrunner,"From just the intro I could tell this was going to be a interesting movie. And for the most part it did and most aspects of this film is very well executed. For the most part the dialogue and the narration by Nicholas Cage's character clever and sharp for the most part. The plot is about a very good business man and has talent for being a very good sales man, but what he sells is weapons to different nations and regions. So basically he is a arms dealer who would trade with anyone as long as he got the big bucks for it. He is also sleazy at times and knows how to use people and just throw them away. So basically he is someone almost everyone would hate especially when he says stuff like ""there's nothing more expensive for an arms dealer than peace"". But you can't help but have slight respect for this character because of the way he accomplishes his tasks, it's just very sharp and entertaining to watch, also witty at times. This is one of those movies with the protagonist narrating almost everything through his success and failures. But is very well crafted to the point it got my attention for the most part. The timing and luck of this arms dealer can sort of take out of it's believability, but it's thrilling from the beginning to end. And how the greed of this arms dealer consumes him as the film progresses had my attention and kept my interest. Also Nicholas Cages performance wasn't just intriguing but conspicuous. Ethan Hawke has been good with the cop roles he has been getting and in this his performance is very well done as well playing Jack Valentine. A Interpol agent who is a clean and straight by the book type and doesn't take bribes no matter what. Basically one of the main problem for the main arms dealer in this movie.8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Umm... well....,"There was once a film called Little Big Man. That film told a story which alternated between humorous sequences, some bordering on farce, and high tragedy. And it worked very well. So the juxtaposition of humour and tragedy can be very effective.I'm not sure it worked in this movie.The events of the film are not, in any way, funny, but Cage's droll voice-over narrative is constantly amusing. In fact, you spend most of the movie thinking ""Gee, what an engaging fellow - witty, funny, the very essence of good company."" And yet what he is doing must mean that he is either completely stupid (if he does not understand the effect his actions have) or completely devoid of any sense of morality (if he does not care). Even when his actions bring his life crashing down about him, he doesn't change.I'm not sure the making the audience empathise with a wholly repellent protagonist is the best way to get your point across.I quite enjoyed this film, but I was left feeling somewhat uneasy - there is something about it which just didn't feel right.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nic Cage's best,"I saw this in the cinema in 2005, loved it then, and watched it a ton since then. It's just so good, very rewatchable, super smooth, highly entertaining, and very well constructed overall. My favourite Nic Cage movie by far.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Blind Eye,"Whether it's the meat industry, child slavery or even racism, these are all modern day outrages widely present in society. Yet, people don't regularly stand up to these injustices since life is too comfortable, and that's the internal moral conflict Yuri Orlov fights. Always feeling inferior his entire life, he begins profiteering from trafficking weapons to build a sense of worth. Most people would find this ethically unacceptable since you are providing arms for ruthless dictators and causing the deaths of millions of innocent civilians. Especially because it is just for monetary benefits.I will honestly say Nicholas Cage is not my favourite actor. I must also add that he performed exceptionally in this film, and that he definitely pulled Lord of War together. It's surprisingly revealing to see how the world revolves around money, and how people will act superficially in the face of controversy. Money equates to power, and this unfortunate truth represents how isolated we are from others. This movie certainly offers a unique perspective with regards to warfare, and offers a viewpoint most contemporary war movies don't. Regularly, war veterans are glorified and combat is shone in a bright light. The reason I enjoyed this movie so much was because it demonstrates how warfare can affect relationships and completely transform your sense of the world.One of Yuri's primary arguments for his abhorrent work is that if he didn't do it, someone else would, and he would lose money out of it. Similar to other problems across the globe, the main reason why atrocities still occur is because people are passive and unwilling to risk their comfort for the sacred life of others. It is for exposing this side of war that I truly loved Lord of War.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Beware of Dog!,"I used to think Andrew Niccol was a promising new director...that is until this film. In a word it is bad, for more reasons than I am willing to name in this space. I had a bad feeling early in the film when Jared Letto's character gives his brief but gut wrenching explanation of the ""beware of dog"" sign in his kitchen. It felt like a 14 yr old trying to be poignant. Which in many ways is what the entire film feels like. The film is primarily a poorly written yet sincerely acted drama...a bad combination. The worst part is when the film tries to be a dark comedy. Not because the comedy doesn't work but because it does. For various fleeting moments through out the films two hours (or so) it shines as a witty satirical take on the state of gun running. But unfortunately before you know it these moments are gone and its back to cardboard flat characterizations of pointless clichés that pass as characters. ""Gattaca"" was brilliant, ""The Truman Show"" (as written by Mr. Niccol) was amazing, ""Simone"" was misunderstood but ultimately flawed (perhaps the studios fault?).

I gave it one more try and was stuck to the screen the whole time.I thought it was going to be this action film with machine guns firing and never running out and explosions and that but there is a film that has a very serious undertone to it with a slight twist of humour.I found Nicholas Cage brought a good performance to this role and everything that he done which effected the world also effected his family.Some slick sharp thinking made him the great salesman but not of cars...but of guns. It also left this disturbing thought in your mind that this is actually going on in the world and knowing how cold and evil this world really is.If the slickness of his car-salesman tactics had been thoroughly thought through then I probably would have notched the score up a little but still a great film and a real eye-opener.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Interesting film...,"This film is reminiscent of films like Traffic and The Goodfellas. It's narrated by Nicholas Cage's character throughout. I was impressed by the opening sequence in the film - this alone is worth seeing the film. The dialogue was strong but the sub-plot seemed cliché and overly predictable at times. Definitely one of Cage's better performances. It offers some interesting perspectives on all issues related to guns, however, I found myself wishing there was more to it than what was on the surface. This film definitely gets you thinking but it fails to really one perspective. I applaud the director for making the movie though as I don't think it's going to be very successful - it's not a downer but you're not going to walk out of the theater feeling any better than when you sat down.

Very well done.Performances by all the primaries were good, with Jared Leto being the standout as Nick Cage's younger brother. He should get an Oscar nod for the performance. Cage put in a standard turn as one of our better American actors.All in all, well worth seeing.

I thought, ""this is going to bee a helluva movie."" Then began Nicolas Cage's relentless voice-over. Other characters appear; Cage's brother, his parents, his dream girl. None of them have more than the most rudimentary character arcs. Relationships are presented rather than developed. The denouement is heartbreakingly predictable and largely senseless.

It's a great action, a great drama, a great political statement. But most of all it's a great romance. Lord of War tells of a man who rises from the low ranks of gun-running to become a world class arms dealer, not unlike Scarface or Goodfellas. Along the way, he tricks his childhood crush into becoming his wife and is hunted by rogue agent Ethan Hawke. When the you-know-what hits the fan, will Cage choose his family and wife over his love of money? And either way, will it be too late with Hawke closing in?

Lord of War may be my new All-Time Favorite,"I saw Lord of War yesterday and I was overwhelmed. It's clearly for adults only but with that in mind I can't think of one moment I would change. I would say this is easily one of the most completely satisfying films I've seen in many a year. I'm in awe of its beauty and I left the theater completely inspired. In my mind everyone connected to this film has just risen a couple of notches up in my book. This movie has a point of view, and it is strongly anti-violence, but it is also able to give a realistic sense of the gun-trade that must have taken years to acquire. I would think this is mostly inside information that no one would have wanted known generally.Still glowing from my viewing I went to today's Chicago Sun-Times Weekend insert to see what Ebert had written about it. I was completely surprised to find that there's not one word about it! What could possibly be the reason for this obvious spurn? Well, I always thought Ebert was Jewish and there is one scene, quite a short scene, which is not very complementary to the Israeli Defense Forces that may have offended him though to anyone who has followed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, by almost any non-mainstream media, it's not only justified, it's long overdue. Could that be why he's ignoring it? Or could it be that he takes offense to its portrayal of Africans? I've read Ebert's reviews in the Friday Chicago Sun-Times Weekend insert for years now. You have to amend his stars awarded by these rules: If it's predominantly got Blacks as actors he automatically will give the movie at least an extra star. On the other hand, if it's likely to be a blockbuster regardless of what he and the other critics have to say, he will frequently give the movie at least one less star than it really deserves. The man has a knack for descriptive phrases but his rebuff of this magnificent film will not be forgotten by this movie lover for a very long time.Politically savvy males in particular should run to catch this movie in theaters before it's gone. But those who like to see masterful direction should go to see it as well.

It's a well made movie but it fails at what it's trying to achieve.,"Really, this is a well made and good looking movie but it's also a movie that obviously tries to send out a message, in which it just simply fails. It's a movie that tries to make us sympathetic with the movie its main character. It's obvious that the movie tried to make us understand what drove him and why he did the things he did. It even perhaps tries to make it seem as if it's a noble cause what the main character did but you can just never fully agree with what the main character did in the movie, which also doesn't make you care and sympathize for them, which makes you root for the Ethan Hawke character instead.The movie tries to tell it's main story in a ""Goodfellas"" type of approach. We know that the main character is bad and that what he does isn't good but yet we sympathize with him. Yes, it's obviously Andrew Niccol picked the ""Goodfellas"" approach with this movie, which gets all the more confirmed by the movie its last scene, in which the Nicolas Cage character speaks directly into the camera, addressing us the viewers.The movie would had probably been better if it was more of an action-thriller about the Ethan Hawke character trying to hunt and catch Nicolas Cage, or at least in that case the story wouldn't had been such an issue then.But no, ""Lord of War"" is by no means an horrible movie. It's too well made and good looking for that. Andrew Niccol proofs himself to be a capable director, even for a movie that due to its controversially (though the eventual end result can be called hardly controversial) didn't get much studio and financial support. It's a movie with lots of pace and style, which makes this a good as well as a pleasant one to watch. It's not a movie that is a heavy one or serious one to watch and it luckily picks a more light approach, which is the reason why this movie is mostly so perfectly watchable.The movie has a good cast, which sort of all makes it more a shame that the movie only focused on the view point on things of the Nicolas Cage character. Besides Cage, the movie features Jared Leto, Ian Holm and Ethan Hawke in it.It's a good movie, even if it doesn't achieve at what it tries to achieve with its viewers.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cage as an actor is like Costner...too laid back,"in most films to involve me much in what he does. That being said, he does a pretty good job here as his all mind no emotion approach to his arms-running ""job"" is right for the central character of this horrifying film subject. It's not often that money over lives is shown so graphically to be of such greater importance to the depraved people doing it that whatever happens to the world as a result means absolutely nothing to them....they would merely say, ""it's a business, like any other."" As with most Nick Cage films it doesn't survive close scrutiny for details and realism, but it is a good non-stop action film about one of the lowest forms of human activity, about one step above or below child porno/sexual slavery. And, neither have any regard for human life.As most others have detailed the film's plot and, alas, its outcome, most of what is left are the emotions evoked by the film's subject, that of private-business arms-running to wherever in the world there is a bloody ""war"" and big money to be made off of it. The main question is.....It does make obscene money and is grossly immoral, but does anything it does or causes make an ant's toenail difference in the big world picture? Some would say no, others would say it makes every difference. These strong arguments can be made either way, as some might say, ""if I don't do it someone else will, so what?"", and on the other side, ""it just brings us that much closer to the Appocalypse"".We alive now probably will never know the eventual true cosmic cost of this seemingly heinous activity or whether it has a cost the world truly cares about, but it may suffice to say that violent human behavior through history has been forbidden and/or supported in every human endeavor, including religion past and present. But, who can say with authority that it means much to the world in the long run, or if there will be a long run as a result? Some would say it makes no difference to the world as we are all worm food in the end, and the recycling of our bodily energy is all the world cares about whether it is too early or too late or now or whenever, just so it gets done and allows the earth to go on doing what it does best to survive.But, it is really aesthetically and spiritually worth living in a world that coldly pragmatic, with no other importance for us than to feed the eternal earth recycle? Most on this earth would say no. Thus enters religion, and the other side of the meaning of life issue for most of us.

Pointing out that the film's anti-hero didn't sell arms to Osama bin Laden because his checks bounced, for example, comes across as a pre-calculated, half-hearted apology. Let's leave him out? The film is better when Mr. Cage's ""Yuri"" marries Bridget Moynahan (as Ava Fontaine), with relatively little narrative fanfare.Ultimately, however, writer/director Andrew Niccol does create a captivating film statement about gun-running, and its human cost - both literal (Vitaly's body) and figurative (Yuri's soul). There are some outstandingly imagined sequences, beginning with the opening ""credits"". Weaving Rufus Wainwright's singing of Leonard Cohen's broken ""Hallelujah"" into the film works very well.

Has the feel of an important movie,"The tone of the movie established in the beginning is entertaining, though it doesn't seem to motivate the character's choice of actions. Growing up in the violence of Hell's Kitchen, he decides to becomes an illegal gun salesman for the local thugs. Hoping to expand his business, he and his brother work to enter the world stage.Selling guns illegally is akin to selling any illegal product, from drugs to being a mobster like in ""The Sopranos."" But there's no sense of Cage's character being a mobster. His disconnect from what his product is used for and his responsibility of that use is interesting but probably a very foreign concept to 99.9% of the population.He is so calculating and cavalier through-out the movie, it's difficult to develop a sense of empathy towards him. However, his character is presented in such an entertaining fashion, it's difficult to despise him for what he does. There are efforts made to suggest that he had a sense of morals, but truthfully, it comes across more as him just being a spineless worm.The film takes a very dark turn in its final reel as his world begins to fall apart.

Thank you for fighting,"Andrew Niccol's film 'Lord of War' is in places amusing, and its heart is in the right place, but fundamentally it's a somewhat pointless satire about the arms trade. Not dissimilarly to 'Thank You For Smoking', it suggests that in a bad world, everybody's compromised but some worse than others; however, it's the worst guys who have more fun. The problem is that this message is both everything and nothing; holding people to account for general badness (but partially forgiving them because of the state of the world) lacks the impact of a specific charge. The use of the song 'Alleluia' on the soundtrack, surely the most over-used music in contemporary film, typifies the blandness of the film's vision. But the corrupt world of gun-running is portrayed here cartoonishly, so we don't really care when people get massacred, and the flimsy treatment can't really bear the belated attempt to add moral weight.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of Cage's best movies.,"The film follows the story of Yuri, a anonymous person turned into a successful arms dealer. He participated in some of the most iconic moments of the past few years (The cold war, third world countries oppression wars, etc.), selling guns to all parties, it didn't matter if they were his friends enemies or allies. The money was the only thing that matters.Yuri was a remorseless, but successful merchant. When it came down to business, he was certainly good. But his successful career took tolls on his family. We see that and many other events in Yuri's life through Nick's narration.The story was really good for me. The acting too. It was a smart move to hire Nick for this movie, and Jared, Hawke and Bridget were pretty good as well. On the other hand, the script felt a little tacky for me, but it was good. I felt entertained during the whole movie. There were plenty of good scenes, and overall the movie was very amusing.I respect Cage a lot, but he played some really bad roles in the past few years. Nowadays it seems like he tries to be part of bad movies. This is the exception (National Treasure was good also).This movie might not be the most accurate motion picture in terms of reality (There aren't Interpol agents that travel in third world countries to seek relative small arms dealers, etc.), but as entertainment, it was great.I recommend this film because of its good storytelling, good actors and pretty decent plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Squirm-inducing,downward spiraling morality tale","Early on in this film,you know exactly who and what Yuri Orlov(Nicolas Cage,brilliant as actor and narrator)is. It's the how and where that he's about to show you.Yuri is an arms dealer. An independent one at that. When he started in the business as a dealer in the early-to-middle eighties,he is very much a small-timer,a little fish in an ocean that is populated by mostly large nations and rogue militaries. He still manages to find stashes and sell,but usually to fringe groups and drug-dealers. Whne the fall of the Soviet Union occurs(over a period of time spanning 1989 to 1992),this opens up business for Yuri. Now,with huge stashes of guns,grenades,bombs,aircraft and tanks left behind from the Cold War,provided by family connections in his family's home country of Ukraine,he becomes a highly coveted deal broker in weapons,coveted by governments large and small.He is also a tragic figure:a little man who felt insignificant growing up in Little Odessa in New York. He worked at his family's restaurant along with his wild,irrepressible younger brother Vitaly(Jared Leto,melding his musician instincts into this character) before witnessing a mob hit which impressed upon him the belief that the world is always looking for someone to supply them weapons,hence his career path. He is also smitten with the most popular girl from the neighborhood(Bridget Moynahan,beautiful and just a hint oblivious)who goes off to become a model. Once his biz takes off,he is able to put his family up,get his brother in on the business and sweep the girl of his dreams off her feet,marry her and start a family.Naturally,when someone deals in unholy alliances,the Devil comes back for his pay,and Yuri is about to slowly but surely pay that price.Smartly written and never underestimating the intelligence of its audience,this movie,penned and directed by Andrew Niccol,gives you a picture that is rarely(if ever)pretty and quite damning by its path. Interwoven in this story are(among others) the incorruptible Interpol agent(Ehtan HAwke),the rare independent gun-runner(Ian Holm)whose business clashes with Yuri's and the Liberian dictator(Eamonn Walker,very strong here)who has somehow managed to get into Yuri's head and knows how to push his buttons. The film traces Yuri's path from confident,cool and self-deluding businessman to a soul-challenged interloper who leads a double-life on borrowed time. Cage's voice is perfect as narrator,and director Niccol intersperses the tale being told with a few choice narrative cut-aways,lending a sort of surreal sense of the story.It is a story of violence and moral weakness,and judging from the people who've backed and/or put their names on this film(among them Cage himself co-produces and the show is endorsed by,among others,Amnesty International)there is a sense of conviction behind it. The commitment here really shows,and that is why it works.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pretty cool movie and one of Nicholas Cage's better films!,"I just watched it again for my second time. I forgot I watched it the first time so I guess it wasn't that good of a movie. This movie scores a 6 on my vote. The bullet sequence special effects lathered intro is awesome and I love how it goes from country to country in the viewer. Cool true story and fictionalized to the Hollywood extent this film is good but not Mr. Cage's best work. Oh, and I love the Soviet accent he and Jarred Leto try to pull off. I think Jared Leto had a better performance but I am a bigger fan of his work then Nicholas Cage. I respect Nicholas Cage because he is related to Francis Ford Coppola but didn't want that to be the reason for his success so he changed his name when he went into acting. And one of his first films also owes success to Coppola as Cage was casted in Rumble Fish as ""Smokey"". Nicholas Cage is a poor actor which has luckily been casted in some good films. I never expect too much from his acting and I liked Lord of War as much as Snake Eyes. Mr. Cage, stick to action movies!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Enjoyable and not so ordinary movie,"While this is in some ways very typical ""Nicholas Cage movie"" in a sense, the facts related to real world makes it interesting.

The life of main character, however, makes the film very fun to watch and keeps it interesting to the end. Again, the end of movie kind of follows the modern trend in film industry as far as I can see.Anyhow, nothing devastating, but better than ""Doom the movie"".

The Best Film on Arms Sales Ever Made,"This is the best film Nicolas Cage has ever made. It is in my top 100 films of all time; and it is not easy to get on that list. The acting, direction, production values, and writing for this film are top of the line. There is not one flaw in the film. I can count on two hands the films I have give ratings of 10; it is not a rating I give often. Every scene is perfectly shot. Every sequence is more astounding than the next. Every character is eminently believable. America loves its guns. It makes, uses and distributes more guns in the world than the next TWENTY countries combined. Americans love their guns more than their children; and this is not an exaggeration. When faced with protecting their children or the second amendment to protect gun owners, Americans consistently take action for the latter. They can say they love their children more than their guns, but their actions prove otherwise. Of course, there are millions of Americans who do love their children more than guns (and I am one of them), but it would appear as if they are in the minority, OR the gun lobby and forces that we see at work in this film are far more powerful than the majority of Americans who live in the country. Even the character portrayed by Cage throws away a toy gun that his son has. At some level, he does not want his son to be like him. Our children are bombarded with toy guns from toddler age, TV gun violence, movie gun violence, and actual gun use in communities until guns become second nature to them. I was ecstatic when I qualified for Expert in Basic Training during the Vietnam War. I loved going to the rifle range because I was very good at it. I had been conditioned to feel that way from the time I was a small child and had my Hopalong Cassidy six-shooters in my side holsters. After the Vietnam War, I knew better. And forty years after the Vietnam War, I still know better. Guns are instruments of death. My favorite line in the film is when a little girl who is an amputee asks the white man from the US ""Will my arm grow back again?"" No, it won't. It would be nice if we protected children instead of guns.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lord of War indeed,"I really felt this movie transcended political and social issues and began to focus on the metaphysical. It, obviously, still delivered it's socio-political message, but it wasn't the focus of the movie. Yuri (Nicholas Cage) really did become the ""Lord"" of war, sin itself, trapped in his own personal hell. Able to depict the laws and needs of man he rises above law and becomes a sort of demigod, as is shown during his trampings across west Africa where the armed men are unable to kill him and the hyenas confront him (""I felt cursed with invincibility"").Cage, Bridget Moynahan, and Eamonn Walker all deliver amazing performances. Eamonn Walker really stole the show in a lot of ways, he played his role perfectly. Ethan Hawke is solid too, but I could have stood a few more scenes with him (like getting authorization to shoot at his plane over Africa). Despite the other reviews, Jared Leto's character was really the only down point of the movie. His overly dramatic final scene was hog wash, but Cage and the ""Freedom Fighter"" did finish the scene well at the bargaining table. (Honestly, that scene was the only reason Leto and the guy who played Andre Jr. were even in the movie, they were fluff characters who were there only to die) At any rate, I thought Lord of War was a great movie worth many viewings. Even if you don't make as much out of the movie as I did, it's worth it for the scene where Yuri has his plane land on the African highway...

a must see!,"Andrew Niccol is a genius. This film had me gripped to me seat from start to end. I saw this film whilst passing thru France.. in English of course, and I don't understand why it wasn't marketed more, it is stylish, well paced and the 4 leads work in perfect harmony together. Nick Gage seems to breeze thru the story so effortlessly, despite the challenges he constantly faces, he is believable and cunning, and when he pulled off that stunt to get Ava, it gave me a few ideas of how I might achieve similar goals!.. Kidding. The most shocking part of this film is that its very very real, Africa is a scary place where live has little or no value, people come and go like the wind and to be able to do that kind of business in that continent would take some serious nerves of steel. Its one of the best films I've seen all year. A",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
He's like the Gordon Gekko of guns,"""Lord of War"", a gripping morality play about the lucrative and immoral arms trade. In such a business, you don't get to the top without turning a blind eye to the inherent ugliness, and Nicolas Cage makes it look easy. He plays a Ukrainian immigrant who falls into the trade, and rises in status while staying a step ahead of warlords and interpol; a smarmy scumbag all the way.It's kinda funny, there's the organized crime, cocaine and sobering end a la ""Goodfellas"", but it doesn't feel like an imitation; and there's an ending here that you don't see coming, one that betrays a deep-rooted cynicism of geopolitics. Bottom line, it's a flashy well-paced movie. Cage owns the role, Hawke holds his own nicely, and it's just a solid drama all the way.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Satirical reality,"Through out the first viewing of the film, I felt sorry for how Nicholas Cage has to make such an effort to be portrayed as a slightly better thing than the ultimate manifestation of evil. In truth I don't believe its the arms dealers that cause murder, but the way we are and its just easier to point your finger and say that this is the bad guy.On the other hand I am glad this film came out at a time when Hollywood is seriously running out of interesting or not so cheesy scripts. Funny thing is we need people like arms dealers to feel good about ourselves. Nicholas Cage's performance was great and the issues touched by this film are all part of reality that people don't like to familiarize themselves with. The Hallelujah; song by Jeff Buckley is one of my favorites and the musics of the film are generally great.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A new story plot that fires off a lot of rounds to make an impact towards the audience but in the end they are all blanks,"**1/2 Nicolas Cage, Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan, Ian Holm, Kobus Marx, Jasper Lenz. Directed by Andrew Niccol. Opposite satire of a normal action packed gun fire flick from Cage where this time his charm does no good, on the other hand I did enjoy Jared Leto's work in ""War"". A new story plot that fires off a lot of rounds to make an impact towards the audience but in the end they are all blanks. Trigger happy gun salesman Yuri (Cage) begins examining his life when his wife (Moynahan) starts to dwell about her commitment towards Yuri. And an Agent (Hawke, a disappointing role for Ethan) is hot on his trail as Yuri goes through different encounters to the countries he sells firearms to. Niccol made a nice attempt at a mobster, gang like film but fails in the end. ""Lord of War"" is nothing more than a summer blocker buster (if that) that tries to stir up feelings towards the characters and meanwhile let them enjoy wholesome gun fire. Mediocre attempt overall, My final rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One thought,"One thought went through my mind as the overblown starting credits to this movie rolled over the screen: MTV. Without MTV we wouldn't have movies like this one. I remember seeing a sort of AIDS-themed weekend on MTV once, and this movie is like that weekend only here we are dealing with guns. So if MTV ever chose to do an ""MTV: Gun Weekend"" it would be something like this movie.Nicholas Cage (looking more or less constantly bored) is the hotshot arms dealer in this movie. A Ukrainian American starting out with small deals on UZI:s and ending up selling half the Ukrainian Soviet arsenal to third world countries at war. And all the while, not a single emotion shown in any of the characters. Except perhaps from the perpetually depressed dope-head brother of Cage, played by Jared Leto.I don't demand much from movies like this one. Sure a pop-culture styled drama about guns could work. But here we have a movie that also wants to portray a person that should at least be halfway believable and who is supposed to be an amalgam of a bunch of real arms-dealers. And yet, with all those personalities in him we don't get a schizophrenic person, rather we get a cardboard character. A person completely bereft of any humanity. He just walks through life doing things like a machine, never saying ""why"". He doesn't seem to enjoy his work, his wife or his money. So what is his motivation? Apparently nothing.Beside the shallowness of the character this movie is a true believer in the thesis ""style over substance"". It seems more like an experiment in style and special effects than a real movie with a real message. Message? Well, when you make a drama like this one asking so many questions about guns and the morality of selling them one could actually expect a message. I would have settled for something like ""decide for yourself whether the arms-dealer is evil"", but we don't even get that. This is a waste of time.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

American Style of Black Joke,"It's excellent film, director was trying to tell the story outside the box, let audiences judge on their own way, it's OK, but somehow this way could lead people give gunrunners much more compassion than they suppose to. it is the way how the world runs, not because cage runs it , without cage, it's the same world, others would fill his place do the exact same job. Sound sad , doesn't it. a lots of black joke in the film,I think one way or the other, director tried to turn a serious issue into a funny show.Yes, it is a serious issue. with cage's fantastic performance, just turn the film light on. really catchy film.Cage does the job because he is good at it, not for money, when asked how could he live with the bloody money, personally, I think cause he rarely kills people, so on the moral side, it's not his business. he just provides, he doesn't take responsibility for the kills. So, it's same like I sell cigg, not responsible for cancer, I open a casino, not responsible for the people who addict gambling bankrupted. it's their free will. It is lead to a deepen question, do we have the responsibility for what we do, directly and relatively. we don't , that's the correct answer, but in practice, it's so complex, we are animals, we do things by our instinct most time. we find the happiness in some specific thing, gunrunners like running guns,it's so obvious, right. they just don't think, it's just business, nothing else, I'm so sad after watching the film, because i KNOW everyday, we lose life by other basic animal instinct.maybe it's the way god mades us.whatsoever we have gun or not, we kill others.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Docu-drama? well ... more docu than drama,"Andrew Niccol has a short but exquisite record as writer, producer and director, including 'Truman Show', 'Gattaca' and 'S1m0ne'. He is doing again something different in 'Lord of War' but unfortunately the difference is mainly relative to the quality of his previous record. 'Lord of War' disappointed me, it looks more like a documentary longer than the usual 60 minutes (including commercials) than or a HBO biography feature than like a real feature film.It's not that the subject is not important. Arms traffic is one of the more critical problems in world policy and it certainly deserves a good film. The problem is that 'Lord of War' is not that good film, it is so obviously engaged that even if you agree 100% with the message you shortly become sick of it being repeated again and again. Moreover, there are many details that are superficial and characters that get a soap opera treatment, like all the assortment of bad guys from Ukraine, Liberia and so on.We are certainly left with fine acting from Nicholas Cage. He is good as always, but his character's deepness is spoiled by the fact that he is put to explain himself and philosophize for half of the screening time. Cage does not need this and I believe he would have created a much more interesting character without one word spoken off-screen. The other piece of fine acting is given by Janred Leto. As we are one one night before the Oscars, I wonder why was Leto skipped from the supporting role list of candidates.It's a disappointing film for those who expect a real feature movie from a director like Niccol and an actor like Cage.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The film has a good moral stand. Guns aren't good or bad, it's the people. Yet there aren't really clear cut good guys or bad guys. Some say that this film has bad acting.

Lord of War,"There seems to have been relatively few high-profile films made recently about the business of arms trading, which is quite surprising really when you consider the potential for development in the action thriller genre. This attempt to shed some light on the shady goings-on in the trade seeks to be more of a study of the mechanics of the business with the usual soapy trimmings regarding the conflict between the protagonist's business and family life, than a thriller and, in this respect, it succeeds very well. Having said that, the glimpse we are given into a world that would otherwise be closed to us, is a strangely sanitised one. Little insight  other than the manipulations of one particular West African despot  is given into the life-threatening, nerve-jangling danger into which an arms dealer must step every time he tries to sell his wares.Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, the son of Ukrainian immigrants (the film fights shy of having its protagonist being a true American. The writer would probably have us believe Orlov's background is instrumental to the direction he takes in life, but the cynic in me can't help thinking that the producers were probably a little worried that the cash tills wouldn't ring so loud if the main character, who after all, profits from the misery and death of others, were home-grown). Cage is not a great actor, and he struggles here which, in a way, testifies to the strength of the script in that it can overcome the usual deficiencies in Cage's performance. A better actor would have had more success in subtly communicating through expression and gesture the personal hell which Orlov  through choice  endures. Everything about him is fake: he lies about his name, and he lies to his family and his trophy wife about what it is that he does for a living. He even seduces his wife with a lie then secretly becomes the only buyer of her ordinary painting when she becomes an artist. There is a rich vein to explore here, but unfortunately Cage muffs it.To survive in his business, Yuri can't afford a conscience so he has one provided for him in the form of his younger brother, ably played by Jared Leto. His conscience, who was once his partner, snorts copious amounts of drugs and has copious amounts of sex with women with names like Candy, and his fate is as predictable as the source of Yuri's eventual 'downfall.' Where this predictability is a (perhaps unavoidable) weakness, the repercussions (or eventual lack of them) is the key to what the whole film is about, and has a veracity about it that is rarely found in mainstream movies. It sums Yuri up more succinctly than the previous 90 minutes of heavily-narrated exposition, and goes some way to explaining the bland, suited disguise behind which he hides.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"War! What is it good for? Well, business...","Nicholas Cage utters a line in this film about how we can't fight our own biology, and this idea is shown throughout Lord of War; most notably on the plotting side. The film follows the familiar 'rise and fall' plot for most of the duration that films the likes of Blow and Goodfellas have used before it; and the only real difference between them is that here the story is about gun running. This could have been fatal for the movie - nobody likes seeing things they've seen before in cinema - but Lord of War gets over this fact with the themes that run throughout the movie. The film is definitely very anti-war, but it portrays this mood sarcastically by following the exploits of gunrunner Yuri Orlov. Soldiers wage wars; but Orlov is one of the men that actually make wars happen. He provides the weapons that provide the killing; and doesn't care too much about the morality implications because the business is lucrative for him, and if he doesn't do it; someone else will anyway. War is an atrocity; but for some people it's a good thing. Peace is bad for Orlov's business; and he's prepared to keep his morals in check if it makes his wallet bigger.Lord of War may irritate some people as there isn't a clear story, and the characters serve more as a way to portray the movie's themes than add any emotional weight to the proceedings. The characters do have their moments, however; and a scene that sees Cage having his hand forced by one of his customers expertly portrays the character's attitude and the reason why 'Evil prevails'. Yuri Orlov doesn't want to get his hands dirty; but he's happy to profit from the people that don't mind dirtying theirs. Despite not being a film about characters, Lord of War definitely belongs to its main star. I'm usually indifferent to Nicholas Cage; but here he does very well, both in convincing us that he's an amoral profiteer, and holding the audience's attention. He enforces himself in every scene, and that is the reason why he will always be the headlining star. The supporting cast don't really get to do much; but Jared Leto stands out as Orlov's brother, and the slimy Ethan Hawke is perfectly cast as the Interpol agent on Yuri's tail. The support cast members that really made a mark for me, however were Eamonn Walker and Sammi Rotibi; who are excellent as the father and son that Yuri makes arms deals with.Lord of War isn't a film for everyone. It lays its themes on thick, and doesn't give the audience much in terms of an actual plot. For me, this makes it all the better; although I can understand if others don't agree. The familiar plot structure doesn't get in the way too much; and Lord of War manages to break free of predictability with it's conclusion. Recommended viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Sarcastic, mentally provocative, tackles a hard subject with great lightness.","This film, allegedly based (very lightly) on actual events, tells the story of a Russian-American gun dealer and confronts the immorality of the war and arm business. It would even be depressing if it weren't ironic. Irony is the key to perceive the taunts of a film that takes for granted the inevitability of violence: just like food, death is a human need and man will always feel the urge to kill his fellow man. This provocation is the starting point for a trip to the world of arms trafficking, through the eyes of a trafficker who has surely killed more people than a nuclear bomb and who seems to live in a parallel reality. For him, the death of a child-soldier is sad, but its worse if its with arms purchased from the competition. All this shows us that this is a sarcastic movie, but with little drama and no characters that we can enjoy.As far as actors are concerned, the film is based on a good performance by Nicholas Cage, perhaps one of his best film performances to date. He is not one of the actors that I particularly like, so I was surprised to have liked his work here. The rest of the cast merely seeks to support him with poorly structured and developed characters.

"generally entertaining, but overly familiar territory...","If it were the only film of its kind, ""Lord of War"" would probably play out a lot better than it does; not to say it's a bad film--not in the least. The semi-factual story is suspenseful, engaging, dramatically convincing, and occasionally witty. Writer-director Andrew Niccol's tale revolves around Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukranian who emigrates to America only to discover his true calling lies in supplying arms to third-world countries; Jared Leto plays his coke-addict brother, who provides an occasional assist; Bridget Moynihan is Yuri's trophy wife; the underutilized Ian Holm is a fellow dealer; and Ethan Hawke enters periodically as a persistent Interpol agent out to apprehend Orlov. With a fine cast and a lot of stunning visual ingenuity, Niccol has a seemingly infallible formula for success. Unfortunately, ""Lord of War"" quickly reminds us that we've been down this road before, joining such embellished, voiced-over productions as ""Goodfellas"" (a young man's rise to Mafia power) and ""Blow"" (a young man's rise to international cocaine dealing) as a moralistic, 'rags-to-riches-through-illegal-means' story with a script that just isn't distinguished enough. The sentimental material between Orlov and his wife could have easily been excised, as it feels contrived and unnecessary (I would have preferred more time spent with the characters played by Leto and Hawke).

Obviously 99.9 percent of the viewing public in the US ignores it and thinks ""wow, how do they come up with these ideas in Hollywood?"", well, that's how, they take an old European or Asian movie and they copy every aspect of it (aside of the FX and fancy camera work) and they sell it as brand new, without giving the original any credit.

"Decent concept, bad delivery","Lord of War is an interesting concept for a movie: an illegal arms dealer, Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), making his way up through the ranks, eventually becoming successful enough to supply the world's armies. This is a movie that tries to raise some moral questions about the business of weapons dealing while simultaneously instructing us about it, but its downfall is in how it is presented. On the one hand, the film seems to be glorifying weapons, through heavy use of gun-porn and informative bits of narrative from Cage that could have been taken straight from Wikipedia. On the other hand, you have the ethical side: Cage's character contemplates his position as the movie makes it clear that his job is to give people tools to kill each other with. You get the sense that the director is trying to be ironic, but the acting and writing is so bad that you don't really know (or care).Cage has never been my favorite actor, but his performance here is especially wooden and uninteresting. I think he was going for the cool, calm feel, but it just comes off as boring. The whole time it sounds like he's reading from a legal document. Bad things happen to Yuri but you'll find it hard to care. Jared Leto and Bridget Moynahan are equally mediocre in supporting roles. The film's potential depth is ruined as much by its uninspired script as it is by its uninspired acting. It spends a lot of time informing us; some stuff is kind of interesting but you'll often find yourself thinking ""okay, but how does this relate to the plot?"" The movie basically becomes a documentary trying to make a political statement.The best thing about this movie is probably its darkly humorous portrayal of third-world plight, led by Eamonn Walker (Kareem Said from HBO's Oz) as a sadistic West African dictator. Somehow being able to smile in light of genocide, child soldiers, and AIDS makes it seem that much more real, and this film does a good job of making the viewer think. It's an unusual approach to making a social statement but it has the same effect as the typical depressing-scene-after-depressing-scene. Walker's performance, along with Sammy Rotibi's role as the dictators bloodthirsty son, saves this movie.All in all, this is a decent film with a premise that will keep you interested if you can stand stale acting, annoying narration, and a plot that doesn't really exist. I can't say I liked it, but it impacted me enough to go ahead and write this review. That's basically what you'll get out of Lord of War: not necessarily enjoyment, but food for thought. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Things become difficult when another arms dealer Simeon Weisz, played well by Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins in Lord of the Rings) goes against him, a terrorist leader in Africa buys his pocket and does not let him retire and the presence of an interpol cop (Ethan Hawke). Orlov isn't really a likable character and he gets his comeuppance at the end with consequences that are severe (which I won't say about) as he sells weapons that go in the hands of children and he cheats on his wife, but somehow through Cage's charm and his predicament, he becomes likable. Lord of War is nothing special but it is an interesting exploration of the culture of arms dealing and is entertaining to watch also with some great laughs. The only thing I would say is that him and the model (whoever the actress is lack chemistry) but that's only a small gripe. Overall it's a great film to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

an open-minded viewer will love this movie,"i walked into lord of war expecting a movie that was good in all aspects, but by no means great. i figured it would have a decent plot with some action and some comedy.after seeing it i am a changed person. this review cant even do the movie justice because i don't want to spoil anything. it tackles a topic that has been relatively untouched by Hollywood, after all, why would movie producers want to promote thought and emotion amongst their viewers. real political issues are hinted at, all the while we're enjoying an overall fun movie. then, the serious plot kicks in as the movies characters test not only their own, but our morals. just see it, thats all i can say.however you feel about guns, you cant deny that they kill people, and you cant trash a movie just because it presents a point.it is comparable to crash, not because of the plot content or any technical aspect of the movie, but because just like crash forces us to self-evaluate, lord of war forces us to re-evaluate the very world we live in. see it with an open mind, and you'll love it, guaranteed.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Happiness is a warm gun.,"Selected as a random DVD on its way out the door - I'm pretty sure I did see ""Lord of War"" at the Cinema, at the time of it's release but I've certainly not seen it since. Its' an interesting but perhaps its message is perhaps too broadly written to be truly successful.A second-generation immigrant to the US from Ukraine, Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) sees little future in the family restaurant and instead begins to sell guns to local Russian Mafia operatives. From there his business slowly builds, as he begins to provide weapons to various liberation or military forces around the world. His profitability though takes a massive step up when, following the end of the cold war, he's able to utilise family connections and 'liberate' thousands of weapons, of all sizes, from behind the Iron Curtain.I suppose, one of my problems with this film is that the target of its ire doesn't appear to be the focus of the movie. At the end, it points out that five countries are the both the worlds biggest arms producers and then five permanent members of the UN security council. Which is an awful circumstance that needs exploring, but the film is about a single independent arms dealer and his (fictionalised) story. There story is about one aspect, the denouement another. It's honest about the situation and corruption that this trade thrives on, but it does make for a particularly melancholy and dispiriting experience.The opening scene is, alas, starting to show it's CGI age a bit - but it's still a powerful image of a bullet being carried all the way from first cast, right through to entering the brain of a child soldier in war torn African nation. Less forgivable is some of the performances, with Cage in particularly and Jared Leto as his younger brother. They're performances, particularly in the opening section came across as false and amateurish to me.Whilst highlighting one of the worlds real and unsolvable problems, the film doesn't quite have the depth or performances it needs to have an impact.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

You do notlike the main character, nor the ""Lords of War"", but you are not supposed to. He is the ultimate anti-hero, yet the bad guy is the federal arms investigator, always the coyote to Yuri's (Cage's) road runner. Yuri is consistently true to his self-justifying rationale: ""I sell guns so people can protect themselves;"" and "" I don't do it for the money. It's because I am good at it."" Here is a gritty movie that turns on a dime of old international truth: Illicit arms dealers are protected because they can do what governments would be disgraced to do.

Probably one of the most satisfying films you'll see in ages,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA film charting the rise and fall of Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) an arms dealer, from his early days in the early 1980s in Little Odessa selling weapons to local mobsters through to his ascension through the decade of excess and indulgence to selling guns on a global scale. The film also charts his relationship through the years with younger brother Vitaly (Jared Leto), his marriage to perfume model Ava (Bridget Moynahan), his pursuit by determined but moralistic federal agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) and his business transactions with a powerful African warlord (Eeamon Walker) and his psychotic son (Sammi Rotibi) that finally make him start to really question the morality of his work.Cage is the lead star of this film, and as so is ultimately the driving force behind it. And that's great, because it's hard to imagine anyone but him in the lead role. His snazzy, edgy, downbeatenly charismatic persona fuels the film perfectly. It's even better that his character is such an interesting and thought-provoking one. The film paints an earnest examination of him, a man sub-consciously aware through-out of the wrongfulness of what he does, but also always on hand with a quick-fire justification of it. Whether or not these are really genuine or just him trying to cover up for the high-flying, money driven guy he is only the viewer can decide but this is what will make the film so engaging to some. It's also interesting how the film doesn't simply zoom in on him in a current storyline, but charts his rise from nothing up to when he was really somebody then to crashing down again in the years from 1982-2001. The 80s was, of course, the decade of excess, greed and indulgence where everybody wanted to be a success and wanted to have lots of money and material wealth, so in many ways as a character study it's very similar to Al Pacino in Scarface, as both are men who come from nothing but, in that decade, dream of the wealth and success that everyone else seems to have and are prepared to do anything to get it themselves, even by breaking the law.Cage may be the man running the show, but everyone in the supporting cast is also flawless. Moynahan is fine as the kindly wife receiving the sudden shock to the system of what her husband really does, as is Leto as Cage's weary, coke-addled little brother (maybe even his best role ever!) Walker and Rotibi as the father/son psychotic African tyrants also played their roles well (amazing, since there seems to be so little of a real age gap between them) but really the best out of all of them is Hawke, who has a very well-written/conceived role as the federal agent determined to stick by his morals even when the best option would really seem to be to step over them.In seven years of directing, this is actually the first film from director Andrew Niccol I've actually seen. Maybe I need a bit of time to get used to his style but this has certainly been one of the best films I've seen all year, a great character examination and a definite, eccentric Cage movie. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Movie with a punch and a punch line,"First of all, I think this movie is funny. Its humor is very dark, some would even say it is hopelessly dark (triumph of evil, blah, blah, blah). If one is expecting to see the self-delusional, self-medicating, feel-good mental mas...tion that one usually get from Hollywood escapism, one should look elsewhere.Lord of war makes one look the dark recesses of our foreign policies, which most of us chooses ignore. For some of the film critics this might be too much reality. One of the reviewers from the village voice, I think, kept insisting that Ukraine is the same country as Russia. Mind you that a master's degree in eastern European geopolitics is in no way required to enjoy this movie, knowing things like that the soviet union has dissolved over 10-years ago (with it's unavoidable consequences) does help in parsing the fast-paced narratives of this story. I can see how someone can get lost into snoozeland if he gets surprised if you told him that: ""hey Ukraine is a country too, and they use to have nukes!""This is not to say that this movie had been filmed as a documentary. Not at ALL. It tells a story of a man who deals arms rather than the arms deals themselves. And I think that is an important distinction to draw. Our antihero, Yuri Orlov, is a ordinary man, under extraordinary circumstances. Although his actions are deplorable to say the least. One can easily see how any one of us may justify these actions and turn an apathetic eye towards the moral outrages that are his actions. In fact, the much more subtle message (which Andrew Niccol did not beat you over your head with) is that we are as nation states doing exactly what Yuri Orlov is doing as an individual!There is also plenty of humor in this movie. If black humor is your cup of tea than you would find yourself chuckling your ironic chuckles through out this movie. It is simply the best in edutainment I've found in movies in years.

"The ones who know don't care anymore, the ones who care don't know","Lord of War takes a glance at the world of arms dealing through the story of one particular trafficker played by Cage. It goes through two decades of wars & conflicts and how the business and politics of gun running works.The film begins impressive, where you follow a bullet from the factory to the battlefield, were it finds its way to the head of a young African boy. The industrialized world manufactures the bulk of weapons, and happily shares it with the world. But sometimes the receiver has a bad PR-rating, for example a ruthless dictator.So here comes Cage in the picture. Cage is the middle man, the one who delivers the weapons to anyone who pays. He does so very coolly and professionally. Cage doesn't have real moral issues, when he wouldn't do it someone else would, and besides he's only small fish. The big ones are the U.S., England, France, China and Russia themselves so why bother.Besides being an interesting look at the gun trade market.

"""I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there""","For some reason, these days I keep coming back to the same films. Whether it is because of repetition of actors or because they share similar locations, I continue to talk about these types of movies. And I'll tell you what the reason is; it is that they deal with the same issue: War; and I put it in capital letters because it is definitely a big one.Let me recapitulate: ""Hotel Rwanda"" tells the story of a massacre because of a big Civil War; ""Blood Diamond"" goes through the 'conflict diamond' smuggling among the War in Sierra Leone; ""Lord of War"" pretty much explains itself: it's the life of a Warlord. Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a man who does the only thing he is good at: dealing with guns. If he cares about it of if this makes him a good or a bad man lies in the plot for you to discover.Though this 'job' has given him enough money to get the woman of his dreams (Bridget Moynahan) and support treatment for his drug-addict brother (Jared Leto), who used to help him but couldn't take it. I forgot about another film, ""The Constant Gardener"". When it comes to dealing with real-life issues, that film was better than ""Children of Men"", but not better than ""Blood Diamond"". However, ""Lord of War"" is above all of them; because it treats the issue right, almost perfectly: and that's its blessing.Courtesy of dynamic writer Andrew Niccol, the screenplay of the movie has the main character telling us his story in the first person, which is a different and appealing narrative structure. This way, we don't miss anything and the script becomes automatically the driving force of the film; explaining everything in careful detail and providing a documentary feeling in the way it gives information; however never loosing the movie style.This style is also supervised by Niccol, who wears the director's hat once again, but this time in a way that accompanies the fast pace of his writing. Achieving a better balance than in his last directing effort (""Simone""), Niccol's work is figuratively a gunshot, beginning with a wonderfully constructed first scene which follows a bullet that ends; of course, in a gunshot. But the screenplay is so intelligent and well based that it concludes in a film that escapes some conventionalisms ""Blood Diamond"" sadly had to take.Everything feels true because it actually is, and that makes it less predictable and more of a pleasure to watch and follow. We get the experience of Nicolas Cage to make it all more worth it. Cage, and actor who apparently doesn't take supporting roles anymore is as well cast in this as he is in ""National Treasure"" or ""The Rock"" and in a romantic journey like ""City of Angels"". Here, he was also a producer of the film.The cast also includes Eamonn Walker, putting in another great performance, you'll realize; Ethan Hawke is flawless as the good cop who can never get to Cage's character; Jared Leto is more than good as the loyal brother; and it is so nice to see Moynahan again: she is such a convincing actress. And ""Lord of War"" is the most convincing of films like the ones I've talked about yet.""Every faction in Africa calls themselves by these noble names, like Freedom Fighters; I guess they can't own up to what they usually are"". That's' one of the great phrases in Niccol's script. I suppose that what he means is they are just killers; and that it's a big word, WarStill.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I want my two hours back,"The problem with this movie was that there was no character development. Yuri decides to be an arms dealer (while working as a waiter in Brooklyn) and with almost no build up or development is suddenly present at major arms bazaars in Russia, rubbing shoulders with the big boys bidding on MiGs and what have you. its like he looked in the ""whats happening this weekend"" poster at ticketmaster and decided to show up at the super-duper-top-secret arms bazaar in the soviet union. A suitable analogy would be if they made a movie about Madonna and the first scene was her singing in front of the mirror with a towel around her head and the next was her selling out a giant stadium, with absolutely zero transition. I'm not sure how one gets into the arms dealer racket, but if I'm watching a movie about it, i certainly want to see a bit of character development, some steps in between garage band and international pop star. besides this the movie was a general waste of time. They basically took Blow (similar idea: local-yokel boy gets into selling illegal stuff, lives the fast life, makes a bundle, loses wife and kids, and then realizes and regrets the error of his ways after its too late) substituted guns for coke, and then made it crappy when they decided to cast Nicolas cage who, unfortunately for all involved, cant act to save his skin.

One of Nicolas Cages' best performances,"Lord of War revolves around a man's tough path of evolving from a negligible weapon dealer to a literal lord of trading killing machines. The story is as cynic as the whole industry is. Moreover, the cynicism is made even more palpable by being narrated in a rather indifferent manner by the main character himself. Additionally, under all this thick glowing shell there is the gun powder of explosive black humor wrapped up skillfully. It goes without saying, that all these layers feel very much in place.What there is even more in place though is the main hero of the movie played by Nicolas Cage. It's definitely one of his best performances: a wicked shrewd person, always in control of the situation, although capable of care, empathy and love too; always in clashes with his conscience deep down. However, some characters - especially villains - make an impression of rather caricature personalities typical to the Hollywood's images.All in all, the movie is a great choice for those willing to think again about how everything is intricate and interconnected in this world: peace, war and hypocrites.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

'Lord Of War has much more to offer than many other conflict-based Hollywood productions',"In Lord Of War, Andrew Niccol is superbly artistic in his presentation of the international arms trade. He combines clever personalities and a witty script with a number of deeply gripping and powerfully realistic scenes. In watching the movie I was entertained, educated, shocked, and above all, drawn in. Because of this, I feel that the movie has much more to offer than many other conflict-based Hollywood productions, many of which provide only a non-controversial piece of historical escapism that has little to do with current issues.One of my favourite aspects of Lord of War is that, although effective simply as a good bit of entertainment, it does demand a certain element of thought to fully understand the point that the director- Niccol- tries to put across about the state of the modern arms trade and the lives of both those who live off its profits, and those who are dedicated to stopping it. On top of this it, he effectively explores the moral dilemmas experienced by Nicolas Cage's character (Yuri Orliv) and his wife and brother.Overall, this is a movie that provides everything needed to create excellent entertainment, whilst exploring real-to-life moral issues in such a way as to make the audience think more about the world in which we live and why these things are allowed to exist.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Impressive,"Edgy, moving, and strangely inspiring, Lord of War is probably in my opinion, one of the best movies I've watched this year. Nicholas Cage's dreary persona compliments Yuri's discreet character very well. And though it's hard to imagine Jared Leto (who's come a long way since My So-Called Life) as Nicholas Cages' brother, both actors do an extraordinary job in their portrayal.The story lines spins out from Yuri's sudden discovery in the fact that he'd been blind to see what could make him a powerful cash crop was right in front of his face. Living in a neighborhood in which the obituaries should be fives pages long, Yuri set out with his capricious flighty brother to sell illegal firearms to foreign countries. At this point, it's hard to tell whether he's oblivious or just plain uncaring to the fact he's assisting in the murder of thousands of people this way.Enter the alluring Ava Fontaine, or Yuri's 'dream girl' as he had previously named her in his days of admiring from afar. But after stocking up on enough cash and guts to double-deal his way into her affection, those days are clearly over. Bridget Moynahan's chemistry with Cage could be/should be better, but she does an exceptional job in playing out the anguished trophy wife Eventually, Yuri find himself pulled deeper into his baneful role as the supplier of lethal weaponry, or as third world country tyrant Andre Sr. dubs him, ""Lord of War."" And it's not long before he realizes that he's dug himself into a hole deeper than he could climb out of.On a slightly different note, if you're easily disheartened or distressed by volatile images or situations, this movie is not for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I liked him though and enjoyed the dark humour, especially in his narration.

Fun and Funny,"Lord of War is a fun, often hilarious, and uncompromising look at the life of a gun runner named Yuri Urlsov. He narrates his tale from his late teens to late forties. He starts out a amateur gunrunner who just sells to the punks and the mob in his area of Brooklyn. It takes him several years but before long he is selling bigger guns to bigger people, and by the late eighties he is on a first name basis with all the major warlords(Or Lords of War) in the world. He doesn't take sides and will not just sell weapons to two people who are killing each other but will sell them to people planning to attack his own country. He has Interpol agent who knows he is doing something wrong but can't prove it so follows him attempting to catch him red-handed. His name is Jack Valentine and is played wonderfully by Ethan Hawke. Speaking of performances Nicolas Cage is wonderful. He manages to make you believe he is all the age's he goes through in the film without a pile of make up to make him really look it. Jared Lito on the other hand is horrible and it is impossible for you to believe he is one of the age's much less all of them. The direction is very good as is the screenplay and visual effects.

Cage's easy charm makes the film work,"Since being cast in one of his uncle's lesser-known works in the early 1980s, Nicolas Cage has appeared in a steady stream of titles ranging from the blockbuster to the way-out-there alternative piece. Much like Tom Cruise or Jack Nicholson, when Cage does appear in a film, you pretty much know from the beginning how he is going to play his character. A combination of smooth, quiet, easy-going charm mixed with intense, furious outbursts gives him nuances that are more in the realm of Nicholson than Cruise's bland, unidimensional self-worship. Which, I am not hesitant about saying, is exactly what the role of a successful arms dealer requires. Were this film being made thirty or forty years ago, Nicholson would be in the lead, and apart from the depictions of some very tragic violence, little else would change. As much as Lord Of War takes advantage of its modernity, it is also a piece as timeless story that will be just as relevant when wars are fought with energy-based projectiles as they are now when we're fighting with lead.The publicity materials claim the film is based on facts, and aside from one moment where the characters get a little too simplistic in their effort to put one over on the authorities, this really is the kind of stuff you could not make up if you tried. I must confess to being just slightly disappointed at the traditional structure, where our hero (if you want to call him that) begins with an idea, rides it to triumph, has a personal crisis, and then goes into a downfall before recovering somewhat. I would have liked to see the wife embrace the husband's business (it certainly pays well), or the villain remain unrepentant to the end because he has no reason to be otherwise. That, after all, is what generally happens in the lovely land of reality. Rather than emphasising the title character's personal conflict about his business to the point where it gets stale, the film explores the real-world effects.The support cast is in great shape, too. Bridget Moynahan scores major points for her understated performance as the model Yuri goes to absurd lengths to woo. Her slow conversion from an uninformed believer to a horrified and informed critic is handled amazingly well in her limited screen time. Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian only get a small handful of scenes as the parents of Yuri, but they get one moment in which to deliver the most poignant yet simple dialogue, and they deliver it brilliantly. Ian Holm also gets a brief but compelling turn as one of Yuri's more scrupulous rivals. After he exits stage left, one is left wishing that he had more time to influence the story. The real surprise here, however, is Jared Leto as Vitaly, Yuri's younger brother. Leto has already proved his salt in left-of-centre films such as Fight Club, or taut thrillers like Panic Room, but here he proves that he is a versatile actor capable of playing nearly anything. You can see in this film how Cage benefits from the presence of an actor who may rival and even exceed his own skill.One other criticism I have of the film is that it does not seem to quite understand the reality that drives the global arms market. Yes, it is terrible that African nations with no money for food (but plenty for guns and tanks, of course) send fourteen year olds to fight battles. And it is terrible that we have men from foreign lands ready to supply them with the weaponry so long as the price is right. But much like the cocaine market, our police services attack in exactly the wrong manner. Supply results from demand, not the other way around, and if the five largest arms suppliers in the world were to stop exporting tomorrow, the nations so ravaged by the supply would knuckle down and build their weapons locally. That is, after all, how the AK-47 featured so prominently in this film came to be one of the most popular assault rifles on the market. Nobody would supply the Russians for fear that the Russians would turn their product upon them, so the Russians began to build the guns themselves. Necessity being the mother of invention and all, so the attempt to moralise does sour the film just a little.But, like I said, Cage's everyman charm is more than enough to overcome this small flaw. He has good support from Andrew Niccol's direction (no shaky-cam here) and clever screenplay, as well as a haunting score from Antonio Pinto. The strings and acoustic guitar heard towards the end of the story and through the ending credits will remain in one's memory long after the film itself has finished. It is one of the few pieces of film scoring I would hold up as worthy of comparison to some of the bands in my music collection, in fact. Which makes it all the more amazing that no American studio would back this film, as it is truly a piece of modern art that will come to be called a classic ten to twenty years from now. Sadly, because Hollywood chose to treat it as a leper, it barely made any money, and thus less people in the system will be inclined to take this kind of risk. That is a tragedy right on the level of those shown in the film (well, not quite, but you get my meaning).Because of the deductions I mentioned above, I gave Lord Of War a nine out of ten. If you are a fan of Nicolas Cage, this is one of his best performances. Jared Leto fans will also find much to celebrate here. Those who prefer their cinema as non-mainstream as possible will also find something to like here. It has been overlooked, but Lord Of War may well be the most daring film of 2005.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
I was an equal opportunity merchant of death. I supplied every army but the Salvation Army.,"Remember the cocaine factory scene in Robocop where everyone has the barrel of a gun in their face and Clarence Boddicker (played by Kurtwood Smith) says ""guns guns guns!""? That quote is Lord of War in a nutshell. This is a movie all about guns. It's about illegal sales involving quantities of military-style firearms on the black market, the peaks and valleys of those who deal in them, and the power of guns, including the deadly force they employ and the sense of empowerment they give to those who wield them. It's a story of survival, not from the barrel of a gun, necessarily, but of surviving one of the deadliest games in the world, where your best customers are the most unscrupulous scum bags on the planet with more blood on their hands than many a headline-making dictators while the most ardent of crime fighters hunts you down day and night, and where cunning and, in some cases, the law are the only defenses you have.Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashankov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists. One thing's for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars.In one of the better performances of his career, Nicolas Cage portrays Yuri, a man who builds an empire of illegal arms dealings from humble beginnings, selling a couple of punks two Uzis in a cheap hotel room. He and his drug addicted brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) sell to anyone and everyone (except for Osama Bin Laden, not on any moral ground, but because he has a habit of writing checks that bounce), from the post-Soviet Russians to the African dictator Andre Baptiste (a brilliant Eamonn Walker), and even covertly to the U.S. military. Yuri's 20-year journey will see him rise and fall in power and prominence, gain new allies, find himself in competition with fellow arms dealer Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), marry the girl of his dreams, Ava (Bridget Moynahan), and deal with a determined and incorruptible INTERPOL agent, Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke).Evil prevails.The most fascinating segment of the film, and one of the most original I have seen, is to be found at the open of the film. We become witnesses to the birth, life, and death of a single 7.62x39mm bullet (those used in your everyday AK-47 rifles). We witness its production in a factory, its shipment to a war-torn African battleground, its loading into a magazine, and its final destination, the forehead of a child soldier. The bullet's journey, from the factory to the target, looks rather gimmicky on the surface, but the segment's power is undeniable when taken in context of the story that presents itself over the next two hours. Not only does the opening scenes show us what Yuri deals in, how his weapons work, and what they are capable of, but it is a representative of the various themes found in the movie, too. What we see in the opening minutes tells the story of the movie in a condensed, metaphorical sense.Lord of War is also a smartly written drama that is well-directed (by Andrew Niccol) and performed to a high level of professionalism by all the actors involved. I was most impressed with Eamonn Walker's performance as the African warlord (or ""Lord of War"" as he is known) Andre Baptiste. His character is oddly likable thanks to the bigger-than-life smile he wears, but that is just a veneer for the cruel person he is underneath and the massive bloodshed brought about by his ongoing war efforts. His is a character hard to define. At the end of the day, we'd feel no remorse were he put down by a shot to the head (as he so easily guns down a character late in the film), but the way Walker portrays the character we cannot help but enjoy his presence in the movie and his scenes prove to be the best in the film. Nicolas Cage is, well, Nicolas Cage. He brings the same attitude and vocal inflections we've seen and heard in countless other film's he's starred in, but as always, he manages to meld his personality just so to capture the essence of the character he portrays.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Horrific and distasteful, yet one of the best films I have ever seen.","Have you ever felt like you wanted to walk out of a film but couldn't? That's the type of movie this is. Before I continue, I must state that I will never willingly watch this movie ever again. Why? Well, I'll get to that.This movie is superb. Niccol does a masterful job in telling a story about politics, war, and the darker side of the human spirit. Is this a movie with specific political intentions? I'm not sure. But it is definitely a movie with a lot of sarcasm towards ""good"" governments.When I left this film, I had a horrible taste in my mouth. Do I blame the film? No. It took me a sleepless night to discover the reason. This film may not be a documentary but it is still very real. I am disgusted with the politics of war. I am humbled at the thought that it could be me committing any number of horrid deeds. It probably would have been me, if I was unlucky enough to be born on the wrong side of the globe. Am I a soft, sentimental type?

Dreadful,"I expected far, far better from the director of Gattaca.The script was so bad it was laughable.And it was incredibly racist. Apparently all (black) Africans are mindlessly stupid and are the only ones in the world who like dirty little wars (as opposed to whites who prefer dirty big wars).Strangely, there was no mention at all of any of Americas wars (well there wasn't before I walked out).What was Ethan Hawke thinking of? I walked out at the point where he suddenly appears in the middle on nowhere co-piloting a FIGHTER JET.And exactly why was Ethan Hawke pursuing Cage in the first place? I don't believe that arms dealing is illegal. And if it is, why wasn't he out arresting the directors of Boeing?

"Finally, A Lucidity Pill...   Nice Rush!","Someone commented that this movie was not political, but pure enjoyment. I'm so sorry for him. What I enjoyed about this film was seeing people around me waking to what is going on and and where we are while it's happening. If I had to sum it up in one word, I couldn't. It takes two: Brilliantly Educational.I didn't go ""10"" on this because of several cliché' abuses (baby on runway, etc.). But there is a portal here in a point of view montage and throughout this film that says, ""We do need to know, and care"". It is a taste of real events served by the composite character ""Yuri"", that achieves a level of voyeurism desperately needed amongst the ""yippee, Ki-Yay"" narcotic candy affect of the action genre.This film is one of many must-see films (Pink Floyd's The Wall, and American Beauty"" come to mind...) that one should not declare them-self ""breathing"" without understanding the material presented. In a brilliantly woven screenplay seasoned with genius use of CG, we are lead through a part of our world we could not otherwise see through the mud of sheer mindlessness and greed that covers the lens, that shoots the talking heads, that read the scripts, that transform reality, into the sensationalistic news ratings war, that blocks the sun, from shining on what is really happening, as we cower from reforming our social consciousness and believing that something can be done.Leaving this film left me with a small spark of an idea that maybe turning out in record numbers to vote is the wrong way to have our say. Maybe if there was an election and literally no one came, our countries would finally know that we really don't want to keep going down this same road, completely in the dark, to the BUSINESS of government.If you want pure entertainment, eat candy. If you want to grow and feel a proud spark of accomplishment, plop your fat, numb brained butt in front of THIS screen! And when the shock passes, watch ""thinking"" sprout from a hearty seed that isn't just another stalk of popcorn. I know I'm glad I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"some brilliant spots among a few flaws in the script, most of 'Lord of War' crackles with interest","Lord of War is a film that inspires the historical, almost documentation-like, interest (via a constant voice-over) in a similar way like with Demme's Blow, only here used far more frequently, for better &/or for worse. Nicolas Cage, at times, brings more fascination to the film for a viewer with his narration than does his performance, as his character Yuri Olyev, gun traffic man extraordinaire, tells his first-hand story of the past twenty years. Not that his own story isn't gripping at times to watch, and sardonically funny, but there is something about just hearing Cage's voice, as opposed to hearing it alongside his physical performance (not always top notch, here better than most), and writer/director Andrew Niccol collides his panache with usually incisive and ambitious direction with the narrative.If I could really point out the parts that I thought were keeping Lord of War from being a better movie, even a great one, I would, but it's just certain things sometimes left un-said (maybe for the better of the story, or Yuri's history), or un-tied, or tiny patches of dialog that just don't work for me at times. However, this may be not much of an issue with many moviegoers; Niccol, who's best work to date for me (and I haven't seen Gattaca yet so it's an inconclusive statement) was his script for the Truman Show, which like here takes the right jabs at societies gaping flaws in human nature. Yuri is a terrible man, but he is honest about his dishonesty (again, like Blow), and Cage seems to understand that just as much as Niccol, and while its not his best tortured soul performance (that would go to Bringing Out the Dead), he brings the right amount of humanity that the character needs. There is also a good performance in Jared Leto, and some standard, dependable fare from Ethan Hawke. But performances aside, the juiciest bits in the film (like an un-scheduled landing on a road in Africa, both amusing and horrifying; Cage's trips to Liberia) make it really worthwhile to see in the end, despite a lot thrown in the way of the audience. Perhaps that is one other flaw for me, is that there is so much given to the audience in way of learning about trafficking, as well as Yuri's story, its slightly over-loaded. The parts, in the end, are probably far greater than the whole.However, in a time when parts in films are not even good let alone great, it makes Lord of War a semi-important film for its time. It's a character study as well as a history, a romance as well as a thriller, and a comedy as well as a dark drama. As Hawke's character says to Yuri, ""you know, I'd tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there"", sums it up for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I give full recommendation for the US government to watch this movie,"9 out of 10 people who watch this movie may think that the message it's trying to send to the entire world is to stop arms dealers to stop supplying fire arms to countries that require them, and to stop warlords to slaughter people, and to help helpless children in countries that are having war for so long no one can count the days. But the real message it wants to send to is not from all of these, it's for the US government, especially the president to stop supplying arms to other countries. Countries like Taiwan. Stop helping them, because when you give them fire arms, you give them the will and power to defend themselves physically. When they have machine guns and grenade launchers, they will surely fight back, and that means more casualties. If you really want to help them, let them settle their problem politically. Just an example, the issue with China and Taiwan, they can work it out the peaceful way, or if US helps Taiwan to become an independent country, China will surely use force to take over. If this happens, there will be blood bath, there will be casualties, and there surely will be innocent children dying, because the US government wants to make money out of it. Taiwan belongs to China, and it will become a stronger country by joining with China, whether the government of Taiwan is willing to let China to take over or not, China will finally take over, it's just a question of when?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
I don't want to be remembered at all. That means I'm dead.,"I watched two Cage films the other night. This was one that I had not seen previously. It was an extremely good satire about the arms business.That was the point of the film. Selling arms does not have a moral component. It is a business. After all, the United States is the biggest arms merchant in the world. We end up disarming countries of arms that we provided. Or arms we provided comes back to be used against us later.Nicolas Cage was brilliant in this film. He was cool and calm and just what I would expect of an arms merchant. After the cold war ends, he immediately realizes that he can get access to Russian stockpiles and make a fortune.Of course, Ethan Hawke is trying to prevent him from making all that money, but Cage is just too cool. He wins every time.I don't think the film could be summed up better than when Cage tells an audience, ""I never sold to Osama Bin Laden. Not on moral grounds, but because his checks were always bouncing back then.""",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Smart and Beautiful,"Nicolas Cage is totally up to this character, unfortunately his narrative isn't.I use to think that voice acting was the easiest of all the acting jobs. It isn't. The actor must bring the character to life through their voice alone. Nicolas Cage does not deliver on this single point. However, the entire movie, and Cage's performance, is so well done that it doesn't damage the value of the movie very much (10/10 -> 9/10).His commentary is very dry but not sociopathic or detached as the main character (Yuriy) is supposed to be. But for the rest of the movie he is totally convincing and a real joy to watch flawlessly making this character real... which later you find out... well, let me just say that you learn things you never hear about on the 6 o'clock news.The photography and juxtaposition of the scenes and images is exceptionally well done.

Cage at his best,"This movie features Cage in a ""Morgan Freeman POV"" You know, like in Shawshank Redemption where he narrates the movie while being in it himself. Great tool.As Cage says early in the movie; This isn't about twisting the truth to something that makes him the good guy. This is a movie that illustrates what might be something not so far from the actual truth of arms dealing.There isn't really a plot, but more like a story about a mans life, and how he ends up in the business of arms dealing.

A Movie That Surprised Me...,"This movie is impressive because it shows what is, and not what can be. If you look at the description you can probably understand it is yet another movie trying to show the ills of the worlds and how you should change things.While it tries to do that it succeeds on a completely different plane. It succeeds by not looking at the macro picture, but the micro picture of a single gunrunner. It shows his world and how he likes his world.When ""Hollywood"" gets these types of films it tries to show the evils and then has some ending that says, ""see this is how things should be."" But this movie does not do this. This movie says this is how it is. The fact that the gunrunner was so emotionless made it very hard to digest the film.If you think that he kills in cold blood like most movies make people to be then you are sadly mistaken. This is not classical ""Mob"" and honor type movie. No, this about cold, emotionless, calculations and strategy.

I suspect that a more accurate depiction of the child soldiers hacking out each others livers and hearts to eat while the fallen from the other side was still alive would have been politically unacceptable in the USA. And so false history is made because of political squeamishness.But aside from that, it is very well done and really accurate. That probably explains why critics didn't like it much.

"Keep 'em coming, Niccol","If not necessarily by the start, then by the end, of the opening credits, you should be well aware of what the point of view driving this movie is. Like this piece or not, it doesn't really try to pass itself off as anything but what it is. I've liked all that I've seen of Niccol's(not always equally much), and this was the one I looked the most forward to. It lived up to my expectations. With an ironic tone lasting the duration, this takes you through the world of gun-running, with Yuri being our guide, also filling out the role of obvious metaphor, something not exactly foreign to Andrew(do not worry, this is by no means another S1m0ne... that would turn making fun of it into a ridiculously easy task, what with it featuring the actual, real-life kid of the director and star of said other effort). While there are moments of see-through material, and the occasional poor lines of dialog, this is a solid contender for the best film helmed by the man. It's fun, it's dramatic, it's fairly unpredictable and it does build tension when it seeks to do so. And when all's said and done, like the rest of his movies(again, to varying degrees), this'll provide something important to think about. The plot is great, and develops well throughout the running time. Pacing is rather good, neither boring nor in a hurry at any time. The acting is pretty spot-on for the whole thing. Music isn't bad. This has violence, language and sexuality, and plenty of them, for anyone either avoiding or seeking out such.

Boy meets tank. Falls in lust...,"Yuri Orlov(Nicolas Cage) is a Ukrainian boy from the wrong side of the tracks 0r, as he puts it more succinctly, ""the end of the line."" He comes from a family where to survive they've had to lie just to leave the old country, just to find its not too peachy on the other side. He finds a niche in arms dealing, initially small stuff and works his way into the big leagues.Cage plays him in his usual laconic style, making him a likable anti-hero, even when you know you can't possibly agree with him. It's not that he doesn't necessarily know what's wrong or right, but that he has come to the realisation that if he doesn't do it, it's not going to make the slightest bit of difference. His brother, played by Jared Leto, is along for the ride till he can't stomach it any longer and opts out, a broken wasted man. Ethan Hawke (seen in the Niccol directed GATTACA) is an interpol agent who is determined to bring down YuriAlong the way we are given a couple of truths about the industry and reminders. Among them the most startling is that the number of gun shops in the US outstrips the number of McDonalds. Scary stats. Even these hustlers with their multimillion dollar deals skating on the edge of the law, wouldn't be missed if they disappeared, in relation to the countries with their multi billion dollar industries.The writer and director, Andrew Niccol, was responsible for both THE TRUMAN SHOW and GATTACA; both original in concept and beautifully realised. In common, their central character ends up having to fight for his choice, damn the consequences. Yuri is apparently based on an amalgamation of the stories of five different arms dealers. The film found difficulty getting produced, with its off-beat and controversial theme.With the nomination season coming up, I'd like to see it getting at least a best original screemnplay nod.

"Stick to what you do best, Andrew","Andrew Niccol is the greatest screenwriter of our generation. He thinks deeply, writes intelligently, and is blessed with an incredibly fertile imagination. Above all he has passion and isn't afraid to show it, when most writers today hide their real feelings, if they have any, behind cute, cynical inanities. When his screenplays end up in the hands of good directors, like Weir in The Truman Show or Spielberg in The Terminal, the result is a masterpiece. But, regrettably, Niccol feels driven to be a director himself, a trade for which he has no talent at all. In 2002's Simone, his hand on the helm hobbled his own brilliant script, reducing a potential all-time classic to an ordinary good movie. And now, directing his own script again for Lord of War, Niccol falls flat on his face.The story: If you've got money, Yuri Orlov can sell you guns. Or tanks, or helicopters, or whatever weapons you need. It's his job, and he's good at it. He sells African dictators the weapons they use to slaughter their own people. He sells arms to terrorists for their mass murder jobs (though not to Osama bin Laden, who is always bouncing checks). For some reason, although he will sell guns to anyone, good people never end up buying his wares. He uses his blood money to buy a beautiful wife, a nice home, and to support his drug-addicted brother Vitaly. The development of the plot is essentially a moral version of the Limbo: how low can Yuri go?This is not one of Niccol's best scripts. It suffers badly from the worst kind of political naiveté, the kind that imagines itself to be sophisticated, making profound insights like ""somebody makes money off guns,"" while cluelessly confusing Liberia's HIV+ rate with Zimbabwe's, attributing non-existent arrest powers to Interpol, and equating the single misguided Bush v. Gore decision to the rampant every-election cheating of a Third World despotism.But the script still had potential to be good, as it studies Yuri's growing self-loathing, and his suspicion that his brother Vitaly's worthlessness stems from his shame for Yuri's way of life and his own failure to do anything about it. The best and most tragic scene, where Vitaly finally does take action both to stop and to save his brother Yuri, represents what the movie could have achieved. A better director than Niccol would have focused on these character-driven moments and ditched the naive political nonsense.But alas, thanks to Niccol's directing, character languishes in the background while sloppy political thinking stands is spotlighted. The essential problem is that nobody in the movie, Yuri least of all, honestly examines gun-running as a profession. Yuri tries once to justify himself by saying that he sells people the tools they need to defend themselves. In Yuri's case, that happens not to be true. His clients, or at least the ones we are shown, use their new-bought weapons to massacre political opponents, wipe out ethnic minorities, and otherwise commit mass murder, not for self-defense. But the movie never addresses the fact that lack of guns, and the arms embargoes that Agent Valentine castigates Yuri for violating, also can facilitate mass murder. For a famous recent example, an international arms embargo against Yugoslavia in the 1990s left Bosnian Muslims and Croats defenseless against Serbian nationalists bent on genocide, and the resulting carnage went on for years before the international community decided to do anything about it. Yuri's sin is his choice of customers, not his choice of merchandise.This basic error percolates. As the movie points out, private gun suppliers like Yuri are small potatoes on the world stage. The five members of the UN Security Council sell far more weapons than all the world's private dealers combined. What is not addressed is whether these nations behave like Yuri, arming any murderous psychotic with ready cash, or whether they can legitimately say that they are helping people defend themselves. It is again simply taken for granted that all arms dealing is evil.The movie loses the opportunity to examine the ethics of arms dealing through the underused character of Simeon Weisz. Weisz has some kind of ideological basis for his arms dealing, but it's not clear what it is. Weisz believes that ""Bullets change governments far surer than votes""  an absurd claim, as in fact challenger candidates win far more often than armed rebels do. Eventually Weisz ends up selling guns to the enemies of Baptiste, the African dictator that Yuri is arming (or I think he does, anyway; Baptiste denies it but is probably lying). But there is no clue whether Weisz has chosen to arm Baptiste's enemies because he is morally opposed to Baptiste's brutal rule, or merely because Yuri has beaten him to Baptiste's pocketbook.However, Niccol's direction has other flaws than self-indulgent and sloppy political moralizing. He has also taken an above-average actor, Nicolas Cage, and wrung a bad performance out of him. Cage is monotonous and shallow, with none of his trademark appealing vulnerability. I blame Niccol not only because Cage is normally better than this, but because the supporting players who get less directorial attention are mostly doing good jobs.

The Dark Mirror of Humanity,"The biting humor of Lord of War almost leaves one sickened to have made light of such a dark subject. Almost. Instead of taking sides this flick teeters on the fence of judgment, leaving the viewer locked and loaded to make his moral decision sans any Hollywood influence. The opening credits, in a tragically spectacular fashion, allude to this, placing guilt in the appropriate lap such that the movie can get back to the business at hand and manifest a flick free of the PC crowd's wishful thinking. Nicolas Cage is perfect for this role, the middleman of evil whose mantra of inevitability forms the Teflon skin that sheds any and all icky guilt that might cling to his vocation of choice. Deep down though, his character simply has found his role in life, something fate seems to have gifted or maybe cursed him with, and is fate to be denied? The story slightly veers from highlighting the typical storyboard anatomy, concentrating more on human nature and purpose of being. In doing so, it sets up an uncritical canvas upon which the viewer must come to terms with the reality of the human creature without the filter of rose tinted glasses. Not a film for everyone, it is a flick for those not afraid of the mirror of humanity. Merci beaucoup.Genruk of Evil Eye Reviews",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
An awfully realistic show of life,"This film shows the fascinating cruelness of reality. It is a movie which can really touch each and every one of us. Nicholas Cage delivers an extraordinary performance, highlighting the thoughts, reasons and consequences which lie behind the activity of an arms dealer. Though he seems really wise and clever, a perfect negotiator and predictor, all in all the ideal arm dealer, he hides the bloody consequences of his actions under the naive excuse that he gives people the choice of killing someone. The sad part is that he doesn't really believe it himself, but he needs to in order to continue doing what he does.Abandoned by wife and son, by parents, by his only brother, killed during a negotiation, Yuri Orlov continues doing what he does best - being the LORD OF WAR -.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Really quite bad,"Watched this film in two sittings as I fell asleep during the first one and wanted to see if it got any better. It doesn't. Trite dialogue not helped by Cage acting for his pay cheque and nothing more, leaving the audience without even the slightest trace of empathy for the character. Some of the quotes from the film are laugh out loud funny without meaning to be, is the first rule of gun running, 'not to get shot by your own merchandise' surely it's just 'not to get shot'. There could have been an acceptable, maybe even interesting film but was shockingly pulled off.

It has the same quiet character driven beauty of Matchstick Men with a faster plot and information about munitions that, while you might know it, is still shocking to see. I was emotionally involved throughout this movie, and I haven't been able to say that for a long time. Jared Leto is fantastic. Nicolas Cage his usual amusing powerful self, and Ethan Hawks was quite great. I am sorry to say that I don't the name of lead actress, but she played her minimal part to a quiet perfection. The guy who played the president of Liberia was also fabulous.

Strong movie featuring VERY strong performances,"Lord of War is written and directed by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca)After seeing only the trailer once before I saw this movie, I was completely interested in this movie because its a movie that reminded me of The Insider. This movie talks about the business of gun running and I was completely intrigued. Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a person who never met a person he wouldn't do business with. Jared Leto plays Vitaly Orlov, Yuri's younger brother and drug addict. Leto and Cage have entertaining, yet outstanding scenes together that truly does define 'character driven', its amazing because you completely believe them as siblings, yet on another level you completely believe that the younger brother is trying to put his older brother's grips on reality and on the final level you do believe that they're just trying to convince one another that what Nicolas Cage is doing is for the benefit of his family.The reality of this movie starts off as entertaining, yet once you get into it you realize that its very chilling and nonetheless TRUE. You soon realize that Vitaly is very well justified in having his addiction because he just can't handle the fact that LITERALLY right next to them the war is being fought while they are making these deals. Cage isn't bothered with that.Nicolas Cage gives a VERY strong performance since his work in 'Leaving Las Vegas'. This movie covers 20 years of his life and he isn't bothered trying to look young or acting more energetically, he is focused, poised, intense and intensely fascinating at every turn of the movie. Jared Leto gives his best performance here, shadowing his work in movies like Panic Room, Fight Club and Alexander. He steps up his skill for his Co-star, an Academy Award Winner and his director who has made legendary films.Also featured in this movie is Eamonn Walker as Andre Baptis Sr, in an entertaining yet top defining performance as a psycho killer in a dress suit.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
solid story telling,"The film tells the life story of Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant who turns to gun smuggling, a job he's very good at, as it turns out. The story manages to portray him both as a ruthless merchant of death and a sympathetic underdog trying to work his way up in the world. Cage, playing the lead character, pulls this off pretty neatly, never letting the story degrade to a simple morality tale.Apart from one or two moments of shaky dialogue, both script and acting performances are rock solid. Cinematography is nothing groundbreaking, but wonderfully playful and engaging.Overall the film engaging, well-paced, craftily told. It's a film for people who like their story telling without the usual black-and-white, good-vs-evil scenario. It manages to bring humor and shwung to subject matter that is pretty gruesome, without ignoring its seriousness.So that's an 8/10 easily, in my book.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"terrible, not even in 32x  on my DVD player did it go quick enough","From the unbelievable casting of Leto and Cage as brothers, through to the inane plot set up and disjointed story telling this film was terrible.

And the premise behind Cage's character 'meeting' his future wife is so unbelievable, even within the context of this film, it's laughable. However I must say the one redeeming feature was Ethan Hawke. From what I could sit through of this film, his performance is commendable. This film could have been done so much better.

Adding colour to a very grey area,"Writer/director Niccol's uniquely-spun morality tale is a worthwhile watch. With Nic Cage, he makes gun-runner Yuri an ethically bankrupt but rather likable chap, which has an unsettling effect on the audience. Should we admire him for his undoubted acumen and pragmatic approach to the distasteful arms trade or vilify him as a human leech who grows fat on the misery of others?Yuri takes us through his business (to him, it's all just business) in a first-hand account which pegs him as smart, smooth and inventive. His justifications for what he does are questionable at best, but at least he gives them - ""I'd rather people fired my guns and missed, just as long as they're being fired."" But he's sometimes too confident for his own good - and that of others.In many respects, this is like 'Blow' with guns, only better. It's all very Faustian but Niccol keeps it informative (What's an AK-47? Here's a quick history...) and sharply paced, keeping a dark sense of humour but largely staying true to the ultra-serious subject matter.The film's weakness lies with the secondary characters (though not the actors playing them; they're fine) - the younger brother (Leto) who goes off the rails; the loving wife (Moynahan) who says she doesn't need to know the truth but reacts predictably when she does; the dogged lawman (Hawke); the evil dictator (Eamonn Walker) and his trigger-happy son... We're familiar with these people so their fates hold no surprises.But the jarring life-of-a-bullet opening sequence is inspired, and scenes featuring seas of bullet shells, mountains of guns and tanks as far as the eye can see leave the audience in no doubt that this is a very grim business.One question Lord Of War doesn't answer is this: why do they call them 'assault' rifles? Don't all rifles assault?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A fantastic movie - not your average Hollwood blockbuster. Cage deserves an Oscar,"Nicholas Cage was at his ever most impressive and deserves an Oscar nomination, along with the supporting cast of Jared Leno, the actor who played the Liberian President and the beautiful actress who played the lovely Eva.The film was one of the best I have seen come out of Hollywood in the last year, and would thoroughly recommend it. I would compare it, in the mould of Catch Me If you can: with the good cop chasing the bad guy; mixed with Blow and Sword Fish.I especially liked the realism of the West African set.

Excellent movie with some intense acting in the smaller parts,"Cage is good as usual but some of the best acting has to go to Eamonn and Robitibi who play the Liberian strongman Bapiste and his son respectively. I don't know that I have seen a more menacing and unpredictable duo. Their parts are well written and the scenes look like they were really shot on location. Both men layer on believability that is unnerving.Leto, who plays Cage's younger brother is very good but has some scenes that seem over-written. He does make the best of even those.I don't know whether to place this in the extremely dark comedy category or just straight drama. I think Americans are used to violent comedies but most of those are too unbelievable (Beverly Hills Cop) to be close to real life - however, Lord of War, like Fargo, are too tragically true to life (murderous dictators in one and psychotic killers in the other) to not be taken seriously.I like that Lord of War didn't get too preachy. Yes I know the US and Russia and China really are the world's largest manufacturers of armaments and that is pointed out in Lord of War, but it is done almost (literally and figuratively) as an afterthought.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The film was very realistic in dealing with actual events and countries.

This I like about the movie because you can watch this movie, and feel realism in it, and as well a clear vision of ideas in the way they are executed. By far one of the best movies to spend your money on, even if you don't have any because I know I don't, and it was worth.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

No tacky blockbuster here. Cage ROCKS!,"You'd think a movie about guns starring Nic Cage, Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke would be just another explosion-laden atrocity of a movie, wouldn't you? It's OK to admit it - I did too.But it's really not. OK, there are explosions, and a couple of them are quite spectacular and dramatic. But that's OK too. Drama is good.I think I am going to be so bold as to compare Lord of War to Scarface. I'm not saying Cage is Pacino standard (not yet anyway, I do have quite a soft spot for Cage - he's just so sardonically cool). Anyway, Lord of War is a relatively modestly-paced account of Yuri Orlov's (Cage) career in the gun-running (or arms trafficking) industry. A Ukrainian immigrant to New York, Yuri is bored with his life and finds his calling in 'sales.' He then deals guns to pretty much anyone, disregarding the highly respected illegal arms trading 'code' of choosing sides.Cage plays Orlov fantastically. He has no self-pity and pretty soon, we have no pity for him. There are a couple of points in the movie where Cage has a choice - he can prove he's a good guy at heart, or lock his soul away forever. Lord of War overtakes more obvious movies by taking the harder road. It makes difficult decisions in choosing how to engage the viewer. Instead of puking its guts out to secure the audience a blind and ultimately useless identification with the protagonist, Lord of War sticks to its guns and tells the story as it should be told: painfully.Don't worry, I haven't finished yet. Although Lord of War exceeds many many expectations and structures itself as a well-intentioned, political and cynical movie, it does have its Kaboom moments, where subtlety is replaced by nice, white subtitles which ram the point home, where voice-overs feel the need to clarify the blindingly clear and where characters decide to express their emotions too overtly.Overall though, Lord of War works so well because of it's ambivalence towards Hollywood. It's a film that critiques Western attitudes towards war ethics and war-torn regions but it also capitalises on Hollywood's slickness, its euphemistic ability to justify its actions and sell itself to its most sincere enemy. Orlov is the smooth charmer who can talk the hind-leg off Andre Baptiste, let alone a donkey. He fails himself and his loved ones and can still be redeemed again and again. Is he a nice guy or a smooth talker? Sincere or a great actor? Just like Scarface capitalised on its action, graphic violence and spectacle even though it was really the story of the rise and fall of a flawed man, Lord of War re-invents the gangster genre and uses the very Hollywoodness that Scarface tries to escape from to turn Lord of War into a post-Hollywood epic which doesn't need morals to philosophise about ethics.In a word: it's a cool film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It is essential to see this film if you have an interest in the political realities of this world. As such it is factually and visually educational. It is also a suspenseful adventure film, a horror movie with relatively little blood, a psychological study and a debate on ethics. There are a couple of sequences with amazingly inventive visual techniques. Production values are elaborate and flawless. It is well paced; never flat for me. Even if you know the full story it is suspenseful, dialogue is witty, some brilliant. This is a subject that has never been dramatized. The finale factoids blew me away. As such The Lord of War can be compared to and said to have as much impact as a Michael Moore film. The films are not comparable in any other way as Moore's film is pseudo documentary while The Lord of War focuses on the entertaining story of family relationships and interplay of interesting actual characters.

Before Syriana (released Dec 9/05) and Charlie Wilson's War (released 2007), there was ""Lord of War"" released two months before ""Syriana"" which unlike those films that involved several characters making one's film experience baffling and unrelatable! The difference is that this film takes it's time in stating who Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage)is and why he does it which could jeopardize family and friends and how. I can relate to this type of character study when leading character says ""I was never good at doing anything else"" regardless how morally unethical and how many hurtful consequences it may bring. Never boring, this film is a major milestone to existing problems of politics of today! One critic by the name of ""Paul Byrnes"" who gave it a negative rating remarks ""this is what poor people are doing to each other with the guns the West sells them, it screams -- but there's no suggestion it might be stopped, or slowed."", except that this film only states the flawed bureaucratic system which has nothing to do with the film itself- for the film only states it's problem leaving viewers this problem by their own, and should not have to ""offer"" any viewers any solutions to the existing problems amongst the bureaucratic system, it's only a movie for heaven's sake.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Blow To Arms Dealers,"I had apprehensions over this movie, could Nick Cage pull off the complexities of such a demanding character as an international gunrunner without making his character look lampooned.

Jared Leto was a good choice as the troubled brother, Vitaly. He brought a nice dimension to Cage's character that helped complete the overall picture of who Cage's Yuri actually was. On the other hand, Bridget Moynahan was likable as the supermodel Yuri was obsessed with...again, adding a dimension to Cage's Yuri to complete the tapestry of who his character was and defined Yuri's motivations.This movie is a really good film from some of the cinematographic aspects as well. The opening sequence of following a single bullet from it's manufacturing to the end use was really powerful and put into perspective the volatile nature of the subject matter. After watching this movie, I could easily compare it to the Johnny Depp movie, Blow. What Depp did for Cocaine traffickers in his film, Nick does for the arms dealers in Lord of War.

Also the film's focus is on Orlov and not on his merchandise making the movie a look into the arms dealing business not just a look at it.

The writers manage to educate the audience quite a bit about the gun trade, while keeping you moving ahead with Cage's increasingly large-scale and dangerous career. While issues of the morality of gun-running (both individual and government-sponsored) get brought up, they're kept second-place to the story.

What a waste,"The budding screenwriter in me admires the craftsmanship of the story and the direction, editing, and acting -- but the journalist in me spent the whole time cringing. Despite claims of authenticity, this story mixes gun-running and arms-dealing -- blending those who operate legally, albeit in a moral gray zone, with those who simply sell guns to child soldiers. I'm not sure about the claim that the US simply leaves its guns behind because it is cheaper than to take them with -- that does not ring true, but I would not be surprised to find an element of truth in it. If so, then it certainly should be exposed -- but the real crime in the arms trade is one that exists in this film, but is not properly explored: namely, that that arms travel through loopholes all over the world. There are no raids on arms dealers the way there are on gun runners. Arms dealers are clean and above the fray. And the problem isn't a conspiracy from the top down, but rather a failure to cooperate multilaterally. Interpol, far from being a solution, is part of the problem -- it does not exist the way portrayed in this film. There are no James Bond-like Interpol agents, because that treads on issues of national sovereignty. All Interpol can really do is pass information on from one agency to another. The real stuff gets done by agents of governments working with each other in a legal gray zone that is truly fascinating to explore. My experience with intelligence agents, by the way, is that most of them are conscientious, truth-obsessed, and and professional. That reality is actually quite fascinating, because it contradicts our preconceptions. This film, on the other hand, plays up to them. This film tries to portray incidents like the Iran-Contra Affair as being the rule rather than the exception. The film works dramatically because they chose to over-simplify reality -- but that is an artistic cop-out. I'm giving it a much lower rating that it should get if I were basing it just on its technical merits, but because the film pretends to be revealing a disturbing reality to us, it has taken on a degree of difficulty that it comes nowhere near achieving -- and judging by the comments from other people, it has done a disservice rather than a service.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
An excellent surprise,"The initial advertising for this film seemed to bill it as another Nicholas Cage action vehicle in the mold of The Rock or Con Air. With the trailers focusing heavily on shots of planes crashing, explosions, and bullet-holes, I wrote this movie off. That was a mistake. Lord of War might be one of the best films of 2005. Its look into the worldwide arms trade acquires the authentic feel of a documentary while remaining an exciting ride. Cage has been hit-or-miss in recent roles but is excellent here as brutally cold arms dealer Yuri Orlov. Jared Leto likewise excels as his guilt-ridden and drug-addicted brother, perhaps drawing on his previous experience in Requiem for a Dream. Bridget Moynahan serves as Cage's romantic interest in the film but is not given all that much to do.

Serious movie with a serious political subject that is really rivetingly entertaining to watch.This movie is a possibly a parody on America(?). In my understanding. It could be an analogy?Well if there is one gun for every twelve... how do you arm the other eleven. No. We are not talking about shampoos here. See we use shampoo to clean our hair. but we don't generally use guns do we? but then you can just buy them for fun? Well don't know. Guns are needed for the other 11 people especially since that ONE person will be all powerful because he has the ONE gun. But that is common knowledge we generally choose to ignore. If you are a gun seller and want to do your job well...This movie is really a ride you will not forget. Nicolas Cage is riveting. Never digressing. Awesome presence.But then there are rules to being a ""Gun Vendor"". As you will see. Definitely worth spending money on this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not Good,"Andrew Niccol, while clearly an intelligent person (and occasionally filmmaker), takes his second misstep after ""Simeone."" While the movie's pace is cleverly orchestrated, it lacks firm decisions tonally - it's an activist movie without a thesis.Nicolas Cage delivers an enthusiastic, if somewhat uneven performance, but is hampered endlessly by his own narration (which dominates the film, often spoiling the plot in advance). In the end, the film is predictable, stilted, uneven, and indecisive. It's not dramatic when it intends to be, and the humor is too held back by whatever dramatic aspirations Niccol was after.But hey, nice photography.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cage is not only the main character for Lord of War,"Cage is not only the main character for Lord of War, but, since the entire film is told from his perspective, he's also the narrator of the film, which means his voice and emotion serve as our guide through the events of the movie and really set the pace for the story on screen. As such, the film is truly dependent upon Cage's abilities, which takes a little getting used to. The first half hour or so feels like it drags a bit. As I adjusted to a narrated movie flow (instead of having the events unfold without a narration) the pacing got better, making a big difference by allowing that extra touch of character that comes with an internal dialog to come into play.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
REVIEW OF LORD OF WAR.,"I was told to watch this movie in my postgraduate studies, I had already seen it before when I was a kid! Illegal trade or smuggling should be banned worldwide, such actions only bring chaos into the system and are not necessary! Precautions, should be taken while fire arm licenses and the use of weapons should be checked, this could also be done with the help of artificial intelligence. No one wants 8.1 billion people of Earth, using fire arms whenever and where ever they want, and go on shooting spree. This movie actually shows the reality of the smuggling business. The security agencies and thr tax agencies should check this if they are legally bought or not and should also check the source of origin!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Gripping and Thought-Provoking Exploration of the Arms Trade,"""Lord of War,"" directed by Andrew Niccol, is a powerful and provocative film that delves into the murky world of international arms dealing. Starring Nicolas Cage in one of his most compelling roles, the film combines a smart script, strong performances, and a moral complexity that makes it both entertaining and thought-provoking.Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, an ambitious arms dealer who climbs the ranks in the dangerous world of international arms sales. Cage's performance is nuanced and charismatic, capturing the complexity of a man who is at once charming, cunning, and morally ambiguous. His narration throughout the film adds a personal and introspective layer to the story, offering insight into his character's motivations and rationalizations.The supporting cast, including Jared Leto as Yuri's brother Vitaly and Ethan Hawke as Interpol agent Jack Valentine, deliver strong performances. Leto portrays the moral conflict and eventual downward spiral of Vitaly with depth and emotion, while Hawke's Valentine provides a persistent and righteous foil to Yuri's operations.Director Andrew Niccol, known for his thought-provoking films, does not shy away from the moral and ethical questions surrounding the arms trade. The film balances action and drama with moments of dark humor and irony, creating a narrative that is engaging and reflective. The script is sharp, and the dialogue is both clever and insightful, adding layers to the characters and the story.""Lord of War"" is visually striking, with cinematography that captures the global scale of Yuri's operations. From the war-torn landscapes of Africa to the opulence of Yuri's lifestyle, the film portrays a stark contrast between the glamour of the arms trade and its devastating human cost.One of the film's strengths is its ability to humanize the complex issue of arms dealing. It presents the harsh realities of the trade without glorifying or sensationalizing it. The film encourages viewers to consider the ethical implications of arms dealing and the broader issues of conflict and corruption that fuel the demand for weapons.The pacing of the film is well-handled, maintaining a balance between the development of Yuri's character and the unfolding of the narrative. The story spans several decades and numerous geopolitical events, offering a historical context that enriches the plot.If there are any drawbacks, they might be that the film occasionally risks oversimplification of complex political situations. However, this is largely overshadowed by the film's overall depth and quality.In conclusion, ""Lord of War"" is a compelling and thought-provoking film that offers a unique glimpse into the world of arms dealing. It earns a well-deserved 8 out of 10 for its intelligent script, strong performances, and the thought-provoking themes it explores. Nicolas Cage delivers a standout performance, and Andrew Niccol's direction ensures that the film is not just engaging, but also a meaningful commentary on a controversial and often overlooked aspect of global conflict.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best movies I've seen,"I think Cage was born for this role. He delivers a role that suits him incredibly well. But a good movie, or a real one, can rely solely on special effects or even good actors. It's all about the script, and then putting the rest of the puzzle together. And that's exactly what Niccols does here. Everything's top notch, from cage itself, to the soundtrack and of course, the script. Maybe this movie is not for everybody, but if you enjoy thinking about a move during and after watching it, this one will have you doing that for a long time, since it approaches the gun subject, and we all know how delicate it is. Definitely, a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An intelligent action picture with a punch..,"Nicholas Cage has made a mint playing action figure roles and this movie is no exception. Except it has a layer of intelligence beneath the surface that comes back to grab you toward the end. The casting, direction and acting are superb. The shots of a gun-running airliner crash landing on a remote highway somewhere in West Africa are spectacular. The visuals of this movie have an impact and it is not a hollow one. The plot takes some interesting twists and turns. Some sniff at the political aspects of the movie but it really is not about politics. It is about the realities of those who profit from war. As such, ""Blessed are the Peacemakers"" for they will not make money.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This movie was awful,"The only reason I gave this movie a 2 (rather than a 1 for awful) was because it reminded me of ""Blow"" (the writer/director should have consulted this movie before proceeding to make this disaster). ""Lord of War"" was devoid of plot, human characters - especially Nicolas Cage's character, and generally lacked any real entertainment value. From the beginning, Nicolas Cage's mournful narration keeps the viewer lulled into a sleepy sense of restlessness and anxiousness for the plot to begin. I saw the potential for where the movie could go and where possibly the writer wanted it to go. It alluded to the harmful effects of gun violence worldwide, and seemed to foreshadow Cage's downfall. In the end though, despite his brother's death, his wife and son leaving him, and being disowned by his parents, he was free to continue to reek havoc on the world by mass distribution of artillery to poor desperate people. The writing was bad and reminded me that Hollywood can and does make movies just for the sake of making them - to Hollywood, it seems that any idea is legitimate no matter how meaningless.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cage's Performance Makes A Dirt Bag Character Actually Likable.,"Yuri looking for a way to find fortune beyond his dreams, decides to turn to arms dealing. Supplying arms to every army except the salvation army. It turns out that he has a natural talent for the gig and brings his brother in for the business. Although when Interpol agent Valentine starts to shake things up, Yuri finds himself slowly losing his mind. Will this dangerous business ruin his relation with wife and son, what will it cost him to stop?Andrew Niccol hasn't had a really good successful film as of yet, both Gattaca and S1mone had lackluster box office. Here Niccol has the support of Cage, who has a long list of films as of late. As well as a controversial topic, perfect for these times that we live in. Niccol does score with his biggest opening for a film and great reviews, yet the box office seemed to fade away. Well, with no US distributor funding money for this project, who could really guess why?Lord of War opens with the production a bullet, going through every single stage until it reaches it's target, which is a young African boy. This is the best opening for a film the whole year. It's quite unique and ultra cool. If you went into this film expecting action left right and centre, then this will be a huge let down for you, because Niccol's films are about characters, and Lord of War is one of the best character driven movies in some time.The main character is Yuri and Nic Cage hands in a great performance by making a dirt bag character actually likable. He gives the character a certain charm, as he does with every role. Leto is Cage's brother, who is a drug addict, going to re-hab to get his life straight. Leto does a decent job and in the last scene showcases the highlight of his talent. Then we have Hawke, who is surprisingly not in the movie that much. War is more about Cage's character and his life as a dealer through the decades, then it is about Hawke tracking him down. Hawke gives a good performance with what little he has.If you are interested in the topic, then Lord of War is a great film. It will give you insight of what the world of arms dealing is and how it affects everyone. With every character driven movie, there are bound to be some parts that will drag on, and Lord of War is no exception. I found that when Cage is stranded in Africa and starts to really lose his mind, it was kind of dull.Lord of War is really a film that you either love or hate. This is Niccol's best film as of date, with Gattaca right behind it. Ian Holm, Bridget Moynahan have small roles that play an outcome of Cage's character. But it's the ending of this film that will have the biggest effect on you. Love it or hate it, Lord of War has something to say and in these times it's best to listen to it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It really is a great movie, and if you liked ""Blow"", you will definitely like this one!It seems as though some people on here do not appreciate true stories like this one and would much rather some cheap Hollywood plot with a lot of special effects and drawn-out action seines.They have been giving it poor feedback because of this and not giving it its due respect.I for one enjoy a good true story, now don't get me wrong a good action film is fun, but I like a variety.I gave it an 8 as it is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it is still a good show and worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Lord of War (LOW)...Passes the Pee Test,"The Spent Shell:A compelling and thought provoking film, surprisingly different from what one might expect by its name, or from Nicholas Cage. LOW is Cage's best acting in years, a role well suited to him, with a superb supporting cast. More importantly, beyond fine acting, is a movie with a solid core: a strong script, commanding cinematography, and a great story of moral and social significance.Not reading other reviews or even a storyline, I took a chance on LOW, expecting an action thriller. I was wrong. LOW is based on real life events, and is better painted a docu-drama that contains action and suspense. But its heart is the story, and this is never overshadowed by Hollywood antics.While it may not sound like your beyond the pale, morally objectionable subject, this eye-opening exposé of the illicit gun running trade makes a personal connection at every level of human life, including yours in the theater seat. Not a moment passes where some deeper conflict is not underway, from personal moral choices to big socio-political issues concerning the greater good of humanity. That's a pretty fat range which could be easily mishandled, but is carried off masterfully in LOW.After watching LOW I read some IMDb reviews that said, ""preachy"" and ""didn't need to be spelled-out."" I simply disagree. For me these things were delivered comfortably within the context of the movie, mostly as questions juxtaposed by opposing points of view. For me this was helpful, and nothing felt shoveled down my throat.Woven throughout was the question, ""does a gun runner have any moral obligation or connection to how the guns are ultimately used."" Asked many times, and answered with various layers of rational, it is best handled in a scene between Cage's character ""Uri Orlov"", and his wife, ""Ava Fontaine"" played provocatively by Bridget Moynahan, who says, ""Because it's wrong.""If anything, I would have liked to see stronger development between Uri and Ava. Not because Moynahan is a classic over-30 beauty, but because the relationship was interesting and had chemistry, and made for an engaging sub-plot. Of course the movie would have been longer. Okay by me.Note: ""A Bullet's Life"", is the opening introduction to LOW, depicting journey of a bullet from gun powder to its deadly result, and this small gem of a moment could easily stands on its own as a great movie short albeit short even for a short.In the end LOW definitely passed the Pee test, and is well worth seeing in the theater, or for sure with your undivided attention when it comes out on DVD. And you are asking, ""what is that Pee test."" It's the test for a movie based on a medium Diet-Coke. How long you are willing to hold out, or better said, in?",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The movie ""Blow"", but with guns.","There is nothing better going into a movie and having no idea of what you are about to see. I do have to say, the opening scene was very artistic and creative with following the ammunition, and really set the stage for the rest of the movie. Nicholas Cage is great, if you cast him his part in a movie. If you need a smooth, charismatic, yet somewhat scum-bag of a guy, Cage is your man. His narrative addition, kept you interested in the film.A lot like the movie ""Blow"", starring Johnny Depp, ""Lord of War"" breaks down the art of dealing arms starting at the first step. One always recognizes that we have gun problems throughout the world, but do they ever stop to think how it becomes a problem. This movie does a great job of accurately portraying how it is done. Anytime I can watch a movie and say ""that is exactly how I would react in that situation"" I find that scene a success. Cage does a great job in portraying reactions of what would really happen being put in certain situations he is put in. The light humor keeps a good rhythm. Not only are you entertained in this movie, but also leave realizing real life problems that are affecting our world everyday. I recommend seeing this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Nicholas Cage's best,"We all want to make quick bucks, especially if you got the talent for it. You're young, underprivileged, and there's nothing going for you in life - so you've got nothing to lose.This was the situation Ukrainian immigrant Yuri (Nick Cage) was in. He latched on to one of the most lucrative trade business in the world - arms dealing. This sort of thing has a way of catching up to you, and eventually it does. There's a point where you've made enough money that price of taking short cuts are no longer worth it, but unfortunately, life won't let us go so easily. What do we do then ?This has to be one of the top three movies Nicholas Cage has starred in. He's great as the main character. His portrayal of Yuri is so spot on. The highs of out smarting the justice, getting your dream girl, are all portrayed in a stylish way I've rarely seen in recent movies. Of course there's price to pay for all this, and he's paying it. In the end I felt that he wasn't as bad as the justice department that was after him. There are bigger evil in this world, and compared to them who runs the system, guys like Yuri is small fry.

But there are some things that should be best left to documentaries.

"Guns Don't Kill People, People With Guns Do","In the modern era of warfare, nothing has been more important than a good firearm at your side. Thus, the gun runner was born. The film ""Lord of War"" tells the story of one such man, Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage), a Ukrainian refugee living in America who decides to sell weapons for a living.The opening of the film begins with you the viewer following the path of a bullet from the factory to the battlefield, an interesting vantage point. The story moves rather quickly, staring in the late '70s with Orlov trying to make it in suburban Brooklyn, New York. Progressing throughout the '70s and '80s, the film really picks up speed after the Soviet Union's fall in 1991, and continues on right up until modern times.The acting is what you would expect for a film such as this, good, but not great. Cage is easily the stand-out actor in the film, although Ethan Hawke does a good job as well. But in this film, acting was the smallest part of what made this film great.The story alone is worth at least a rental. All of it is based on actual events, stories, and actions that are played out every day across the world. This film isn't necessarily an entertainment piece, but more of one in which you would learn something in the process. Its something Americans should know about, on both sides of the isle. As a politically active conservative, I was well aware of what was going on in the film, but it did a good job of further expanding upon what I already knew. The DVD's second disc also contains a good documentary about the gun runners, I recommend watching that as well.If you like your films with a bit of political background, this is one of the best we have seen in years.

The Poorest Of The Smuggler Films,"We get a lot of movies about protagonists who smuggle drugs, guns, or some other such thing. There's a host of those films to choose from.
This is the single worst one I've seen.
Mainly because as we follow the story of our gun smuggler, we see the aftermath of his successes constantly. We never actually see them.
At all times the story tells us he set this up, and now he has this going, and now he's selling to these people, and those people.
But we rarely see how these things came to be. We aren't shown HOW he became more and more successful in his career, just that he did.
Most of the time these kinds of films follows the intricate details of how a person rises in the smuggling profession. This one absolutely does not.
Nicholas Cage does a voice over for most of the film, talking over the film, telling you things you should have seen in the film. But did not.
You'll see him do the occasional gun sell, or walk around and look at items he intends to purchase or sell while his voice over tells you how he got to this point. That's 90% of the film.

It gave great detail about what he did in a long way but short feeling. It showed the outcomes which is a great deal when watching a movie like this one.

An Entertaining Look Into A Hidden World,"""Lord Of War"" is probably the most in-depth, cinematic look into the world of gunrunners, which is a world that many know nothing about.Starring Nicholas Cage as Yuri, a Eukranian-American who stumbles upon the world of selling firearms and becomes the greatest gunrunner in the world, ""Lord Of War"" is an educational, entertaining, wonderfully written thrill-ride. At times, it is difficult to watch because the subject matter is so intense and disturbing.Guns, in the film, are seen as merchandise, not weapons of death. They are thrown around as though they are food or clothes for sale. But there is constantly that thought, in the back of everyone's mind, of what this ""merchandise"" will be used for. But Yuri does not let that thought in.Cage does an excellent job, as always, in the lead role. His character seemed, at times, to be the cliché, suave, bad-ass criminal that everyone hates to love, but he takes Yuri to places that many of these type of characters have rarely been. He is vulnerable. He is incredibly smart and very aware of his flaws. Of course, he is the hero of the piece, but American audiences are most likely getting used to the bad guy being the good guy nowadays. Good and evil don't mean much these days, and this film strongly represents that.Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke are the other stand-out performances in the film. Leto stars as Yuri's lost brother who seems to always be getting himself into trouble. Hawke stars as the detective who is after Yuri throughout the entire film, and is outsmarted for most of the time.The greatness of this film lies in its writing. Andrew Niccol created a script full of beautifully flowing humor, tragedy, violence, suspense, satire, and political education. So many great lines, especially with the character of Yuri, are present in the film. Of course, having Nicholas Cage deliver these lines doesn't hurt. Cage has a way of saying a line in a way that nobody would have thought to do, but he blows everybody else out of the ballpark.The underlying message of the film (there always has to be one) is stated in the last lines of the film, spoken by Yuri: ""The art of survival is never to go to war - especially with yourself."" The battles we go through during life are unavoidable; all we can do is try to keep living. That's all we can do.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

There's nothing illegal about what I did!,"***SPOILERS*** On target and chilling movie about he dirty business of arms dealing with Nicolas Cage who personally financed the film as Ukrainian, passing for Jewish, immigrant Yuri Orlov who realized the American dream in making it big but not the way he at first expected to. Seeing the deadly gun play among the Russian mob in his crime infested neighborhood in Brighten Beach Brooklyn Yuri decided to get in on the action. Not by joining any Russian/Unkainian gang but in providing them with the guns to kill themselves. It's not long before Uri works his way up from providing local street gangs with guns but entire nations, mostly in Africa and the Middle-East, with not only guns but missiles hand grenades tanks and even attack helicopters to not only wipe out their enemies but their own people.Yuri for his part stays away from the action or bloodshed and just concentrates on the money, tens of millions of dollars, that he gets for selling his merchandise of death acting as if he's an legitimate businessman making and honest buck to support himself and his family. Always a step ahead of US Government ATF Agent Jack Valentine,Ethan Hawke, Yuri seems untouchable from the law both in the USA and the International or World Court. But he's not immune from those that he deals with, a bunch of lowlifes like himself, to whom the law means nothing to. It's when Yuri who was later trying to go straight by cleaning up his act, and getting out of the arms dealing business, is contacted by a former client of his Monrovia Dictator Andre Baptiste, Eamonn Walker, with an offer that he couldn't refuse that his life turned upside down. Yuri is blackmailed to supply Baptiste with modern arms and ammunition in order to massacre his own people who don't support his bloody regime or he'll give Agent Valentine all the evidence he needs to hang him. It was in fact Baptiste who forced Yuri to personally murder, with a .357 magnum, one of his biggest competitors in the arms selling business Simeon Weisz, Ian Holm, and that alone can have him sent up the river for life. That far more then the thousands of innocent people who were slaughter by ruthless dictators like Baptiste whom he sold his merchandise of death to.Having his kid brother Vitaly, Jared Leto, a recovering cocaine addict come along with him to Monrovia to iron out a deal with Baptiste things go dangerously wrong for Yuri. Vitaly who incredibly enough had no idea of what Baptiste was all about, a ruthless bloodthirsty maniac, saw his soldiers machete a mother and infant, who tried to escape, to death outside one of his concentration camps! Realizing what he'll do to his people with the modern and state of the art arms that his brother is selling him Vitaly flips out and ends up, with a live hand grenade, destroying half of the arms shipment Yuri brought for him as well as getting himself gunned down by one of Baptiste soldiers! It's then that Yuri realizes that there's now no turning back from the road that he choose in life. And now with him disowned by his friends and family,in finding out what he's in to, Yuri like a puppet on a string goes back to selling arms to anyone or any third world country who's willing to pay for them. With him now knowing, as if he didn't from the start, that for the time being until it gets someone better to replace him with Yuri is totally immune from being arrested and prosecuted by his own government for what he's doing because he has its full backing and support in doing the work, as a middleman, that it doesn't want to be accused of.Honest and disturbing movie in what's really going on in the world at large in the proxy and civil wars and conflicts that are being supported under the table by the likes of arm dealers like Yuri Orlov with the full support of the five permanent members of the UN Security Console the USA UK France Russia & China who's job it is to promote world peace. But who are in fact the biggest arms dealers, legal & illegal, on the planet!P.S Check out former Soviet Premiere Nikhail Gorbachnev in a cameo appearance in the film announcing the dissolving of the nation that he's in charge of-The Soviet Union- as a Christmas present to the world on Christmas day 1991.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A exceptional film that dives in Yuri Orlovs' inner life as a arms dealer.,This film at its core is a character profile of Yuri Orlov. Everything from the plot to the cinematography of this film does an superb job of reflecting Yuri's inner guilt and separation from the terrible acts he preforms. It gives us a strong impression of what Gun Running is like and it's a impression that leaves us the audience down right uncomfortable. The core message of the film is that evil prevails and it pulls no punches in delivering that message. definitely not for the squeamish even though there is little violence Lord of War proves to be far more terrifying than any horror film because it's based on true events. Not that Yuri was a real person he is a amalgamation of real people and events though. Easily one of Nicholas Cages Best films well worth your time if you are interested in dramas or politics.

"This was a great movie, and true!!","I saw this at the Scottsdale Mall because I was bored on a Sunday afternoon. I sure don't regret it! Nick Cage didn't want to HURT anybody. He just wanted to make money. It's too bad that he got on Ethan Hawke's bad side. It's amazing how cool Nick played everything when he was gun running. He sold guns to that Muslim dude from OZ. That was intense!! It was also intense the way He snorted cocaine mixed with gun powder! I have never heard of that before. All in all, I would suggest this to all my friends, even Jake. This movie was not an ACTION movie per say, but more of a narrative on the gun running business. Look out for Jaret Leto as the brother. And the cameo by Owen Wilson was odd, but fair. All in all, I loved THE LORD OF WAR. I prefer it to other movies that are currently out.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A meaningfully deep film on the state of international arms dealing marred only by unnecessary dramatization,"Nick Cage is one of the stranger actors in Hollywood. His name associates with a cult following in memes and low-budget films. In fact, the more I write this, the more I'm unsure if he was the best choice for the casting of this film (he's not bad in this movie, but it's hard to say he added value to the script). The merits of Cage aside, the story of this film is wonderfully well fleshed out. The opening sequence of Cage's Yuri Orlov musing on the ""undersaturated state"" of global firearms followed by a quick and brutal montage of the life of a bullet from production to a child soldier's head sets up both Cage's character and the tone of the movie well in an impactful and concise manner. It's one of the best opening sequences in film and something that really sets expectations for the movie.The strongest aspect of the movie is far and away the writing. The movie is speckled with gems like ""They say, 'Evil prevails when good men fail to act.' What they oughta say is, 'Evil prevails.'"" as it trots along in it's unfortunately realistic sense of pessimistic narration. For the most part, the writing is enough to hold your attention and redirect it from the immersive and superfluous dramatization of INTERPOL agents, women, and Yuri's ""melodramatic"" wife, but these parts didn't contribute positively to the narrative of the overall movie.In all, Lord of War is a good movie that executes on it's themes and narrative well but could improve with several revisions in casting and dramatic portrayal.7.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Deceptive and depressing film that seduces its audience into a world of humour and inappropriate glorification.,"How sad to stumble across a film like Lord of War, a film that thinks itself to be a powerful and political statement on the world as we perhaps don't know it, whilst at the same time trying to incorporate conventional action film ideas but ends up as a morally inept, casual look at the life of arms dealing through a character that we are led to believe really exists. There is no justice in Lord of War; there is no feeling, just an air of arrogance as the film flies through scenes; voiceovers and scenarios of great danger with so much ease, we are perhaps tempted to laugh at it all. But whilst films that are morally bankrupt and centre around an anti-hero of sorts can be good fun, they should never be produced with the idea in mind that the anti-hero's actions are right or 'just'.Alas, Lord of War makes that mistake. I wonder how many kids, or indeed stupid people in general, came out of the cinemas or watching this film thinking ""Wow, doesn't being an arms-dealing look cool!?"" We don't come away from films like Scarface, Blow and Layer Cake thinking being a gangster or a drug dealer looks like great fun with cash, women and a lifestyle because of what happens to those films' anti-heroes but Lord of War seems to want us to think that being a gun runner with similar lifestyle traits is a very good career move. If we look at Layer Cake, the opening voiceovers provided by Craig's character inform us of his situation and the fact he has the audacity to assume himself to be a 'business man' rather than a drug-dealer; we are not immediately on his side because of this terrible assumption. But later he is given a drug-unrelated mission by a boss and this propels him into a world in which he must prove himself to himself as well as us. The film becomes a passage of the protagonist showing us he can cut it when heart and soul is required to win through and adversity (traitorous employees, etc.) needs to be beaten. By the end, we feel he has proved himself and maybe we have forgiven him for getting 'business man' muddled up with 'drug dealer'.In Lord of War, protagonist Yuri Orlov (Cage) does not have heart or soul. He is like one of those hormone fuelled young male adults at a grotty nightclub; ever sensing and ever looking out for the next lay. In Lord of War, Yuri wants the next batch of guns so he can sell and re-distribute to places run by people he couldn't care less about. Much like a drug-dealer would not care if his customer overdoses on the stuff he supplies. But this is the film's problem, it assumes we will care for Yuri despite who he sells to. Unlike Layer Cake, Yuri is never given a chance to redeem himself like Craig's character is; he is constantly buying and selling to the nastiest people imaginable without care.The majority of the trouble with the film is its seductive mannerism and its tempting way it goes about its subject matter. In Nicholas Cage, we have an actor who very rarely plays a really nasty character. This seductive piece of casting of a name and a face we have an opinion of before even going into the film immediately draws us to 'side' with him. Secondly, the film has been constructed in a very clever way that brainwashes its audience. The film is full of funny voiceovers and situations we are supposed to laugh at. I wonder how many people actually laughed at the opening quote about 'arming the other x% of them'. Similarly, when Yuri finds himself in an African village with two girls specifically there to sleep with him, despite the high presence of AIDS, I wonder how many others will have laughed at the manner in which Yuri established the situation, the camera cutting to the two women trying to seduce him, the voice-over accompanying the scenario and the editing during which they are dismissed. This four pronged technique creates a light atmosphere in a situation that is dangerous; political and definitely un-funny.And yet the film continues in its siege on the ridiculous, glamorising the depressing and serious, while making jokes out of serious political issues of recent years. There are numerous shots of the AK47 assault rifle in slow motion, slow motion being powerful and significant tool to use on any subject in any film. Then there are the voiceovers dedicated to the gun and the close up montage of it, further fetishising the product: aren't guns so cool? Just look at them. Lord of War is the sort of film that will show us an execution during a particularly nasty scene but will cut to the next situation and have it accompanied by some upbeat music. The film is not in good taste and the immediate ending which brutally betrays the rule of thumb for anti-heroes in films fuelled by crime is very disappointing; not on a dramatic level but on a moral one. Remember that Scarface quote: 'Don't get high on your own supply'? Lord of War's tagline is 'never get shot with your own merchandise.' This is the only connection between one very good and one very poor film that tackle the glamorisation of a certain element within the crime genre. Given how delicate America's gun situation is at the moment, maybe we should all stop making films that make guns and people who have guns look good.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brothers in arms.,"Nicolas Cage, without serious doubts as one of the finest actors of this generation, gives a very strong performance as a gun-happy salesman who trots the globe looking to supply anyone and everyone with all kinds of machinery for all reasons. In the film, we are introduced to him from his humble beginnings to his climactic rise as one of the top gun merchants in the world.The story does take a moral turn in many instances, especially with the character of his coke head younger brother played by Jared Leto, and his beautiful and unsuspecting wife played by Bridget Moynahan. Still, all morals aside, writer and director Andrew Niccol is not afraid to show all sides of this terribly bloody business and it helps the audience to really engage in the story. All points of Cage's character are discussed, including his relationships to family as well as the simple goal of staying alive in hostile territories. From the opening sequence of showing a bullet's complete life span to every scene of Cage scouring the globe for people to buy guns, Lord of War more than satisfies the crowd that wants to be entertained, as well as gives a good bit of food for thought on the very rational reasons to use or not use guns. Certainly worth checking out, if only for Cage's outstanding energetic performance as well as some great direction and action sequences. Definitely one of the best international thrillers of the decade.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Guns and War are big business and Cage is on fire at delivering the message.,"Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) is a Ukrainian immigrant bored of his insignificant life in the Brooklyn neighbourhood of Little Odessa, a small community dominated by guns, sleaze and mafia rivalry. When Yuri witnesses his first violent act he finds his calling; as long as there are people wanting to kill each other there will always be a market for guns. The story follows Yuri's rise from petty gun dealer to international arms baron, as he discovers he has quite the gift for the business. Money, girls, trophy wife, warlords at his beck and call  Yuri has them all. Ethics and morals  Yuri does not. As the danger escalates Yuri must confront his lawlessness. Does he still have the conscience to redeem himself? Niccol's imaginative visual style is evident from the start. A panning shot across a carpet of spent bullet casings focuses on the back of its main character. Yuri turns and narrates a beautifully crafted introduction, leaving you in no doubt as to the sort of man he is: ""There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?"" A spectacular introductory credits sequence charts the journey of a single bullet from manufacture to shipment to its final short, sharp, sickening flight into a child's head.The anti-gun, anti-war message makes this film one of the most important in the market today. Few directors have Niccol's ability to present a provocative and controversial subject matter without succumbing to political slander and anecdotal references.The casting of Nicholas Cage as Yuri is perfection, producing a confident and mature performance combined with a unique air of coolness that is Cage at his best, creating a character capable of attracting sympathy and revulsion in equal measure. There is never a moment that glorifies or glamorises his violent and unforgiving lifestyle; instead the film portrays an atmosphere of distaste and horror and you always see Yuri for the cold, heartless person that he truly his. Is it possible a normal human being could empathise with Yuri Orlov? This really is Cage's film but, as with any mesmerising performance, there usually lies a host of decent supporting actors to bring it home. Of these, most notable is Leto, who shines as Yuri's misguided younger brother bringing a much needed lighter atmosphere. The locations are magnificent and the direction is solid. If there is a flaw its that the first half, as Yuri picks up the skills of his trade and moves to the big time, is far more enjoyable than the second half, even if the ending is unexpectedly compelling.Lord of War is a rare film. It is a film that is well told, acted and directed that leaves its audience pondering its gut-wrenching central theme: there will always be people making money from other people's misfortunes. The difference between this film and the majority that reach the screen these days is its directness. Lord of War delivers its message like a smack in the mouth. Guns and violence are big business. It is not gun-runners like Yuri but the great powers of the world, the US, UK, France and China who are responsible for the worldwide supply of arms. Lord of War stays clear from the front lines of battle; as Yuri puts it, ""it's none of our business"". But by sitting on the sidelines and showing us a different angle on where the blame for war might lie, it invites us to consider the moral ambiguities of arms production.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overall great movie,"The movie was surprisingly very good. The best i've seen in a long time. The script, the cast, cinematography was excellent and i'm sure that ""Lord Of War"" should get lots of attention at next year's Oscars,although at first glance it seems that the jury will go with other pictures, dealing with lesser delicate issues. Cage's performance is excellent, so is Ethan Hawke's. The movie deals with the horrifying facts of war, and the power of money. It's kind of surprising how easy it was to get in to the business, at least in the cold war era. Being the biggest,most influential,most important arms dealer in the world,Cage's character couldn't be locked up no matter what,showing that political interests are above moral and human values.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Why not make a movie about a real ""Lord of War"" - Joachim Von Ribbentrop?","This bizarre, troubling, yet excellent movie is about a sociopath masquerading as a legitimate businessman who is so deluded, cynical and out of touch with his own feelings that he is able to effectively rationalize his own criminality without giving it a second thought. Indeed, according to this movie, the way to make a ""fast buck,"" and to marry the woman of your dreams, is not through hard work, or being a law-abiding citizen, but by being a gun runner - and a gun runner who snorts cocaine and flaunts all laws whenever it suits his criminal purposes. But what makes this movie even more chilling is the outstanding performance by Nicolas Cage who aptly portrays a man who on the surface projects an image of civility that belies his sinister activities that promote war. And what is worse, the character works in collusion with government officials of other countries, further underscoring the corruption that marks his nefarious enterprise.This movie brings to mind the career of Nazi Germany's notorious Foreign Minister and war criminal, Joachim Von Ribbentrop. Like the Nicolas Cage character, Von Ribbentrop was also a warmonger, and also like the Nicolas Cage character, was socially adroit, fluent in several languages, a fancy dresser and had a successful marriage to a beautiful woman and had a nice family. Yet anyone familiar with the history of Nazi Germany knows the havoc Von Ribbentrop caused and how his suaveness was a mere facade for a man who was an irresponsible opportunist who promoted war and recklessly helped lead his country to total destruction. The Nicolas Cage character fits the Von Ribbentrop mold. Joachim Von Ribbentrop was the ""Lord of War"" who engineered the infamous Nazi German-Soviet Union Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939, which is arguably the biggest single example of outright warmongering in history, where two countries, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, connived, in secret, to obliterate a third country, Poland, and then, to the utter amazement and disbelief of the entire world, DID IT, marking the the start of World War Two. So what about making a movie about Joachim Von Ribbentrop? Or what about making a movie about an actual historical case (a pun, get it?) of gun-running, such as, for example, Lend-Lease where the United States, acting as the ""Arsenal for Democracy,"" shipped weapons to the British while ostensibly remaining neutral, or the Soviet Union's amazingly reckless decision to sneak nuclear armed missiles into Cuba, which almost caused a nuclear war? What WERE the Soviet bureaucrats and militarists thinking when they concocted THAT crazy scheme to sneak missiles into Cuba? What WAS that arch-warmonger and real ""Lord of War"" Joachim Von Ribbentrop thinking when he concocted that insane treaty with the Soviet Union which all but guaranteed a war? These might provide interesting material for a movie.P.S.: That both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union no longer exist is evidence that even in our war-ravaged world, justice occasionally still does prevail.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
How is it that New Zealanders make such great films?,"The Australian Prime Minister has been celebrating his ten years in office this week.I disapprove of the Australian Prime Minister.He's a ""rear-view mirror vision of society"" kind of guy. It is often suggested that he hankers for a return to some long gone, probably mythical time. Some golden era when virtuous and upstanding citizens carried on their cloistered lives behind white picket fences.He denies it.But then back in 1997 he denied the state premiers and their health ministers the opportunity to participate in a properly supervised medical trial, to establish whether there were more suitable approaches to the problems of drug abuse then simple-minded prohibition.The Prime Minister did not want the issue confused with evidence based upon observations made under controlled conditions. His attitude was reminiscent of the Renaissance Catholic Church and its opposition to the early Enlightenment practitioners of the scientific method.The Prime Minister still believes the Viet Nam War was a just and worthy exercise in the battle for freedom. Never mind that its best-known proponent, the former US Defence Department Secretary, Robert McNamara, has publicly expressed his heart-felt regret over his, and his country's actions.And of course the Australian Prime Minister was vociferously happy to make a puny contribution to George Bush's coalition of the willing. So puny that, to my recollection, Australia is not even mentioned in the list of unlikely allies catalogued in Michael Moore's film, ""Fahrenheit 9/11""My charge against the Prime Minister is simply this.He is guilty of sapping the spiritual, intellectual and moral resources of my country.Think about just three of the rash of truly amazing films by American film makers hitting the cinemas at the moment, questioning the spiritual, intellectual and moral fabric of that country.Good Night and Good Luck Syriana Lord of WarIs it possible that they are a direct response to the re-election of a power clique that flagrantly mislead (read ""lied to"") their constituents and were exposed in their perfidy?Cut. Back up a minute. Did you spot the odd one out?Lord of War was written and directed by a New Zealander, Andrew Niccol.He's a countryman of Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) and Lee Tamahori, who's criminally under-rated Mullholland Falls, was a profound insight into the state of the post war American malaise and its causes.How is that New Zealanders can produce such great films?I love Australian films, but I have to admit the last few years have not really produced anything astounding. I have to go back to David Caesar's 2001 film, Mullet to nominate a film I consider to be truly great, and who has heard of Mullet?Could it be something about the cultural climate the form and pressure that has moulded the age and body of its current fabric?America, Australia and New Zealand are, or were, members of a military alliance until New Zealand had the temerity to insist that American ships bearing nuclear armaments would be denied docking facilities in its ports.Tiny New Zealand, the shaky isles, that antipodean outpost where the population suffers an irrational and guilty fear of pronouncing vowels, found the internal strength of character to stand up for a conviction.Of course Australia, then led by a nominally left wing government, had no such scruples. And of course Australia supported the invasion of Iraq, not heeding the lesson taught by the Viet Nam fiasco. that such modern day crusading should not be attempted without rigorously defined and specified goals and a pre-planned exit strategy.But then Australians are apparently fearful of causing any trouble that might endanger their life-defining, life absorbing obsession with amassing wealth, in the form of land and buildings. And God help anyone who does anything that might upset the delicate balance required to keep this chimera of prosperity intact.Is that the reason that Australian culture is currently so second rate? Is that the reason that the local film industry that is capable of producing such great art is currently struggling to produce even mediocre films?Let's not delude ourselves. New Zealand is probably no ""heaven on earth"". And yet it keeps throwing up players who strut the world stage with such assurance and artistry.Take Andrew Niccol.He wrote the script for the Truman Show, only to have it taken from his capable hands and given to an Australian director, who did a competent but not breath-taking job.Then he wrote and directed Gatica. Films about androids, clones and genetically modified humans doing battle with mere mortals are not really my thing. But Gatica was engaging, intelligent and well made.But with Lord of War, Niccol has really hit his straps, An unbelievable plot line that is totally credible. Its denouement catches the viewer unawares, after watching the arms dealer Nicholas Cage manoeuvre his way brilliantly through the minefields of international arms dealings for one hundred and twenty minutes. This is George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara retold for a twenty-first century audience.The film looks great - apparently it is cheaper to gain access to warehouses full of real guns than to mock up sets with fake ones.All the performers are first rate.The narrative maintains a forward momentum, built as it is around Cage's engaging off camera addresses to the audience. And the inventiveness of his character's ploys to escape prosecution and maintain good relations with amoral killers while wooing and winning his childhood femme fatale keeps the viewer constantly entertained.Australians have made amazing films for relatively small amounts of money. They have cobbled together a laconically passionate and yet surprisingly morally self aware and searching film culture.But it has not been evident for a while.Maybe around ten years?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Political overtone and weak action spoils movie,"I went into this movie expecting what I saw on the trailer, a good action movie with plenty of shoot 'em up and explosions. It turns out I was deceived. The movie starts out with Cage standing in the middle of a sea of shells talking about how there's enough guns to arm 1 in 12 people on the planet (as you saw on the trailer). Fine, that's a good kickoff to a movie about guns and war. Then immediately on the next scene they go into their political rampage. You start by seeing a bullet being stamped out on an assembly line (actually very fascinating) and you see it go from a factory, to a box, to a general, then to a warlord in Africa. Finally they show the bullet being loaded into an AK-47 and being used to shoot a pre-teenage African boy.OK, at this point I immediately became skeptical about the rest of the movie, but decided I could tough it out for the action promised in the trailer. Well I was deceived again; the rest of the movie plays out like a documentary with Cage doing a running commentary as he grows up from a humble beginning and becomes this arms dealer. The action throughout the movie is very light, and the plot does not involve anything other than the greed of this man in specific and all gun manufacturers/dealers in general.On top of the fact that there is little action in the movie the writers seem to be preoccupied with the idea that guns in and of themselves are the source of all evil in the world. They go through many scenes where guns are used to commit genocide against people and to prop up evil dictators.The movie finishes by saying that this is based on real events (yeah right) and that the largest manufacturers and exporters of weapons in the world are the US and other western nations. While also implying the fact that the US is one of the countries that supplies arms to these genocidal dictators. If I wanted to see a movie about how evil guns and the US are I could watch a Michael Moore movie; I was looking for a good action movie without any political overtones. This movie could not deliver it.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Classic Political Dark Comedy,"I must say I have really liked the way the movie is presented, combining comedy, tragedy and thrill with the narrative of the main character Yuri(Nicolas Cage), makes this movie a very versatile one and easy to stay entertained. The majority of the movie proceeds as a dark comedy but they know when to get serious and increase the tension.This movie has many positives; but undoubtly the strongest side of it is the ending. You probably might have heard about how striking this movie ends, you can count on it because it does. There could have been no better way to end this political dark comedy.Lord of War also does a good job with casting. Actors are fitting perfectly to their characters. This also easily is the best performance of Nicolas Cage, his cold and emotionless way of acting actually works quite well with Yuri character he is playing. Also Leto and Hawke -as always- are giving great individual performances. But I must say, I think Eamonn Walker wasn't a good choice for his character, I loved his work as Kareem Sayid but as a tyrant dictator, he wasn't really above average. I thought that role could have been casted and portrayed in a better way.For the conclusion, Lord of War was quite an entertaining experience both with it's comedic and tragic sides. Well-written, well-acted and well-directed, this is an all around successful movie.8/10Positives: Well fitting actors, entertaining storytelling, an unforgettable ending.

A rare movie with a message,"This is the story of a small-town man bored with his simple life. He decides to sell firearms and begins as a very small criminal and eventually escalates into a worldwide gun-running expert, the man to call if you need guns. But as he does this, he slowly loses all his ethics and eventually loses touch with all reality, all that he is doing. He only concentrates on doing what he is best at: selling guns. This is the powerful message carried behind this film. That this is actually happening.It begins in a very poignant collage of the life of a bullet, from regular metal made into a bullet, shipped to a country, hauled somewhere else, goes into a gun which shoots someone. Another of the better shots of the movie that conveys the message is the dismantling of an unattended plane when it crashes in the middle of Africa. And, of course, I couldn't go this whole review without mentioning Nicholas Cage. The man is in top form in this movie, pulling off the unattached man with a conscience effortlessly. He really adds so much to this movie; it truly wouldn't be the same without him.This film uses fantastic acting and a good story to get the message across.

Unique and unusually entertaining take on a dark subject matter,"Nicolas Cage outranks all others under the column heading ""schizophrenic actor,"" but when he hits, he hits. Playing characters such as lovably deplorable gun-runner Yuri Orlov fans the flames of the public's love-hate relationship with the big-screen veteran, reminding us of how much great work he could do if he had any semblance of screenplay taste buds (or fewer problems paying his taxes).Andrew Niccol's ""Lord of War"" fits Cage scarily well. The film creates an fictional arms dealer and imagines what his life would look like throughout the years from the Cold War to the many African civil wars. It then focuses inward on what kind of a person could possibly live with themselves dealing tools of power and genocide.Cage thrives with the opportunity to be slick and clever yet off-kilter and morally troublesome. Niccol's snappy writing, especially the voice-over narration, gives the film some edginess. What could be a darker and more dramatic tale of a man who deals guns to some of the most despicable people on the planet has a comedic tone that further muddles how we should feel about the main character.Orlov immigrated from Soviet Ukraine as a child and grew up pretending to be Jewish in Brighton Beach. In awe of the power that guns had, he quickly made his way from gang supply to arming full-on wars. He stuck with it because he was good at it, and it made him rich. He had enough money to contrive an entire scenario that would allow him to meet and woo his dream girl, a model named Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan). She grows wise to the fact that he's not what he says he is, but takes no issue with the extravagant lifestyle.A counterpoint to Yuri is his brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto), who begins as Yuri's partner but caves to the moral pressure of the job and develops a fierce cocaine addiction. So while he's the screw-up, he still has his moral compass in check, and we're left wondering which is the better of the two evils.Compared to Niccol's previous work (""Gattaca,"" ""The Truman Show""), ""Lord of War"" seems like a much more grounded and gritty affair, but the New Zealander filmmaker employs levity throughout and gives the story some Hollywood-y or fantasy-like characteristics. As Yuri begins to have run-ins with an Interpol agent played by Ethan Hunt, their relationship feels very cat-and-mouse in the truly archetypal sense. It's evidence that Niccol wants to make an entertaining film on a topic that some would probably regard as being too sensitive for such a treatment.Yet the tone of ""Lord of War"" is consistent throughout. As shocking as some of the violence can be and as much as you'll think about what a horrible thing he does for a living, there's a riskiness to the film that echoes the volatile nature of Yuri's line of work. You might be having a ball living it up one moment and find your life in danger the next, just as any moment in the film could flip around entirely.""Lord of War"" doesn't condone Yuri's choices or suggest you should be rooting for him, which is one of the film's biggest strengths. Niccol wants you to ask yourself why this happens; why someone can get filthy rich off selling guns. The answer might leave you a little sick inside, but it's true. Rather than asking the audience to assess Yuri's character, the credits roll on ""Lord of War"" with much bigger questions on the table.~Steven CThanks for reading!

My Thoughts on Lord of War,This is my first review so please go easy on me. Lord of War is by far one of my favourite movies unfortunately I was only introduced to it about a year ago. I truly love the idea of a poor man from poor beginnings becoming the worlds most notorious arms dealers.I highly recommend Lord of War to any movie watcher that loves movies about greed because this all of what this movie is about. Another reason I admired this movie is that it was directed by Andrew Niccoll a fellow New Zealander.In my personal opinion Lord of War is one of the best movies I have ever layed eyes on.-Shaun,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
'Caged' down,"Not to say that Nicholas Cage is a horrible actor, in this film he is the best I have seen him, it's just that he lacks an edge to make great narratives such as that in Lord Of War a successful film. Not to say that Nicholas Cage completely ruined a perfect film, of course some parts were predictable and some parts should have been omitted due to the fact that they made it quite dull, the opening sequence was interesting but at the same time far too long and dull. Overall the film is an 8/10, Jared Leto was fantastic in this film but unfortunately not enough to make up for the rest of the ensemble. Withsome more acting talent perhaps a 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Books on Tape with a plot called BLOW with guns.,"Go watch BLOW instead. It's a better movie with the same plot, only revolving around coke instead of guns. Nicholas Cage sleepwalks through this linear tale NARRATED WAY TOO EXTENSIVELY by the dull tones of Nicholas MonoCage's endless voice overs. Cage seems about as ukranian as a french poodle. He was miscast for this role but that's understandable since there is hardly any plot so perhaps they didn't put any thought into his character.It seems likely he was making up his character as he went along- bland does not even begin to describe. I classify this piece of crap as super mega ultra dog poo times ten.

Deeper than one may expect,"I saw LOW today with practically no expectations. I didn't expect to @see a high tension action flick. I didn't expect a sappy drama tale. I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. This movie is far from the norm. It doesn't deal with international terror like some modern movies do; it tells the story of a man, his life, and his lie. Cage does a more than adaquette job of playing his character well. This is no normal anti-hero movie; this is tale about the soul.

An outstanding film. It's Forest Gump with Guns!,"I saw the latest showing of this film, and I have to say that it was well worth it. Nicolas Cage has you routing for him, and against him throughout the film. You side with Ethan Hauke, but you don't really like him. Now, one of the best supporting performances of the year is Jared Leto's portrayal of Vitaly. Leto is very talented. He breaks away from his rising band 30 Seconds to Mars and delivers a fantastic performance as Cage's loyal little brother. The characters are involved in actual events in a fictitious manner, much the way Tom Hanks was involved in Forest Gump. It is funny, and yet also has its tragic moments, and most of what I didn't like about the movie was birthed from an emotional response to the story. Bottomline, SEE THIS MOVIE! 9/10 Grade A+",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Powerful Depiction of The Dark World of Arms Dealers,"The ""Lord of War"" offers us a powerful depiction of the dark world of the global weapons-smuggling. It follows the story of Yuri Orlov (Cage), a poor Ukrainian immigrant, who one day decides to sell guns for a living. Starting as a small fry, and derided by his ""competitors"" such as the powerful dealer Simeon Weisz (Holm), Orlov soon discovers that he has a talent for this job, and he takes full advantage of it. His brother Vitaly who had started along with him soon realizes that he cannot follow his brother's fast and steady ascendancy, and Yuri goes all way towards the top alone; even his beautiful and beloved wife Ava (Moynahan) is not aware of her husband's business activities. Yuri Orlov seems unassailable, and only Agent Jack Valentine (Hawke) looks determined to stop him...Apart from the top-notch performances and the exciting plot, the film offers us something far beyond that: It serves as a resourceful documentary regarding the weapons trade, giving us insight on the machinations, back-room deals, and style of the people involved in this ugly business.What is interesting, is that Orlov is not portrayed as an evil man: He is simply portrayed as someone completely amoral and detached from the evil activity he is engaged in. This approach to be very realistic and persuasive to the viewer, as it avoids the clichés that a typical ""bad guy"" would produce.Director A. Niccol has done a very good work throughout the whole movie. His highest moment by far however, is the introduction where we follow the ""life"" of a bullet from the factory to the victim! 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An intelligent, witty and gripping movie","From the imaginative opening credits tracking the short life of a bullet to its conclusion, ""Lord of War"" is a humorous but thought-provoking film. Director Andrew Niccol educates the viewer without being too preachy or obvious, the film is an insight into what really goes on with arms trading (albeit delivered in an explosive and exciting Hollywood manner).The always-likable Nicolas Cage is convincing and entertaining in the lead role as the arms dealer who enjoys working in the grey area of international laws. The lovely Bridget Moynahan plays his ex-model wife who has to come to terms with the reality of her husband's career.A very strong film, I have no hesitation in recommending ""Lord of War"".

Unconvincing,Being a gun nut I was told I would love this movie. I didn't. The movie tries to make you believe it knows guns or politics or both but it knows neither. Reminds me of a poser dropping names to appear to know something. Cage's character never for a moment made me be think he was doing anything other than reading a script. And a bad script at that. It does not try to tell a story but rather it tries to make a point. The point was simple and shallow did not even try to imagine the complexities of the modern world. So much more could have been done. I watch movies to be entertained not to be preached at. One of it's worst points is how easy Cage's character went from working in his fathers restaurant to being a big time arms dealer with no more cleverness than to hand someone a envelope of cash.It has high ratings and a lot of people liked it but I can't imagine why.,3.0,Anonymous,Crime

....wow,"Upon viewing many TV promos for this movie, I thought I would be sitting in the theater watching a comedy. But, Lord of War is nothing even close to that. While there are a few funny moments, the movie is actually pretty depressing. While the movie starts out in a light, airy, sort of comedy, Nicolas Cage's character's (Yuri Orlov) life changes for the worst. This movie is very intense, as well. One would think this is a ""guy's movie"", but even this movie will make men think a bit about the world we live in. The movie also makes one think how good we have it here and how lucky we really are while there is slaughtering of innocent people in other countries. Morals about greed, vanity, and selfishness litter the movie. If you're thinking you're going to see a comedy...think again. The movie is well-made, well-acted, and very powerful.

Of a beginning? What is considered worth profitting over and why? Should we ever look the other way for money or should we find favor with what lies are being told?

Rating,Before I have seen the movie I didn't find the Title very clear. My first impression was that the movie was going to be about some kind of Rambo on a killing spree. When I was watching this movie the title became very clear and it is well suited.I think it was a great movie in the since you can see the story from a weapon dealer instead of some one putting bullets in every thing he sees.The band that the bother have with each other is special and well set up in the movie. A band you can really find in the Russian brother to brother relation ship.A bit of a down site was that the movie could get a bit boring for people who are not into this kind of movies. In this case the point was that the movie was sometimes to match story. But this is not a point I dislike though.,8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Guns are Bad,"Lord of War attempts to say something meaningful about the global arms trade however it's trapped by the two cardinal rules of big budget Hollywood action movies. Firstly, the star must be likable, even if his actions have evil consequences. Secondly big budget action films must be lively and entertaining and that means lots of violence. Although the film shows some of Africa's problems and implies that selling guns to psychotic leaders is bad it also uses violence to make the film more exciting.Nicolas Cage is excellent as Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant living in New York. Yuri finds working in his parents' restaurant unfulfilling so he decides to become an arms dealer. He starts off selling guns to local thugs. He expands internationally, does well, acquires a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) and becomes an instrument of U.S. foreign policy. Cage narrates the story and like Aaron Eckhart's character in Thank You for Smoking, Yuri refuses to accept any moral responsibility for the guns he sells. He convinces himself that the resulting mayhem is not his responsibility  he's just a businessman providing a product. He also really enjoys his job.There are some aspects of the film that are pure Hollywood invention. Ethan Hawke plays an Interpol agent with unlimited resources who follows Yuri to the Ukraine, New York, Colombia and Africa. In the real world Interpol can't arrest anyone and doesn't have a global SWAT team or own fighter jets in Sierra Leone. Yuri travels to dangerous locations either on his own or with his coke head brother. He doesn't have a bodyguard, which makes him seem more vulnerable, but it's not really believable. The film is good fun if you don't take it too seriously. Writer / Director Andrew Niccol also wrote The Truman Show and Gattaca.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lord of War is Just Plain Wonderful!,"I just saw this movie tonite ... 9/16, opening night in my area. And I thought it was just wonderful, from one end to the other. Lots of action, lots of irony, lots of humanity, lots of darkness ... for this is really a ""Neo-Noir"" film. And if you don't like Noir, you might want to pass on this film. But if you *do* like Noir ... I sure do ... this is just a wonderful, wonderful movie.The plot could be summarized as sort of a ""life and times of an international weapons dealer / gun runner."" If that sounds like it makes for fast-paced action, it definitely does.The opening scene ... with Nicholas Cage the weapons merchant standing amid thousands and thousands of spent casings littering the ground in a civil war scene ... is gripping. It's also a perfect segue into the opening sequence: tracing a single bullet from manufacture through distribution to deadly use in a street battle. This opening sequence seems to very effectively set the mood and the theme for the entire movie.Nicholas Cage as Yuri Orlov is perfect as the very damaged merchant of death ... cool, cynical, ironic, engaging. This is a type of role that Cage has already given us, very successfully, so many times before, in Snake Eyes, in 8 MM, and more. He brings to this particular role a crisp energy and professionalism that are simply flawless. His ongoing soliloquy-like monologue is classic Noir ... in the very best sense ... and matches the pace of the film perfectly.Jared Leto as Yuri's brother, Vitaly, is excellent throughout, in a role that doesn't get a lot of screen time, but which involves an amazing series of personas that Leto enacts with a compelling reliability that is entirely credible throughout.Bridget Moynahan as Ava, Yuri's wife, is very fine in a role that naturally reminds one of The Godfather's wife; but which is fresh and believable at every moment in her rendition of this appealing and tragic character.Ethan Hawke as the Interpol (?) agent turns in a solid performance in a role that had weight throughout although we actually see very little of this character on screen. The final confrontation between him and the Cage character shows Hawke at his best, and is a very convincing foil indeed in this setting.The remaining cast are quite simply excellent as well, providing a wonderful array of fascinating yet ultimately tragic figures.The cinematography is excellent as well, and some of the visual sequences are superb: as in the back-and-forth camera action on Yuri's son and his mother and Yuri's ""base"" hideout. Similar scenes set in Africa are particularly effective as well.There's an interesting sort of historical device that we saw first in modern times with Forrest Gump. The entire story is stepped through the years from pre-Glasnost to ""today"" with historical allusion after historical allusion. We see depictions of Gorbachev, of Reagan, and of more chronicling the years from the 1980s thru 2001. The scene of Yuri sitting on a fallen statue of Lenin while doing business is one of many that will both please and tug at the heartstrings.All in all, a fine movie, by a fine cast, with a great action pace, a wonderful plot line, skillfully told story, and an appealing darkness that is truly the best of Noir.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent real-world fable,"Nic Cage is the world's most successful arms dealer in LORD OF WAR, which follows his story from childhood to middle age, at which point he is on the verge of losing everything that is dear to him as he continues to heed the call to arms. The script is a marvelous distillation of the madness and mayhem of the wars that have taken place across our globe in the last 30 years. Cage is compelling as a manic gun dealer, and plays his role in a most deadpan and droll manner. The cinematography is astonishing, especially in depicting massive convoys of war planes and tanks and endless weaponry rolling through the war-torn landscapes of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Russia. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Jared Leto as Cage's drug-addled brother and Bridget Moynihan as Cage's adoring but disillusioned wife. A must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Some scenes, like the ones in Liberia, shine in particular for the way they are pictured. The story however stinks of predictability. They want you to hate the protagonist and his despicable moral choices. This is perfectly OK. But there are several scenes where what was going to happen played out in my head just before it did on the screen. The movie pulls low punches on your conscience and sometimes it backfires. It does when at the end the way this story is told makes you think ""nonsense, it's not really like this"". And there are several parts when it does. I expected more.

A standard Sicilian wise guys' narrative packaged in a firearms mafia background and a very superficial attempt at that.,"A standard Sicilian wise guys' narrative packaged in a firearms mafia background and a very superficial attempt at that.Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) gets fascinated with gun business (rather unconvincingly) when he witnesses a mafia hit in his neighborhood. Convinced that illegal international gun trade is the way to go after a failed attempt to go legal, he partners with his brother Vitaly Orlov (Jared Leto) and embarks on a country hopping mission to arm every warlord he could contact with. Along the journey, he marries his high school sweetheart Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), gets his brother addicted to cocaine, gets a righteous ATF officer Jack Valentine (Ethen Hawke) on his tail and keeps fighting his consciousness. Being a smooth operator he greases enough palms to stay ahead of the pursuit and competition, what happens when it gets personal is the rest of the story.While it is an interesting view of how the illegal international gun trade is run, what affects the overall experience is the lack of clarity. The director doesn't seem to make up his mind whether to present it as a biopic, a documentary or as a work of fiction – leaving it inconsistent and underdeveloped. Apart from the presentation, even the core script seems to be confused whether it should be a dark comedy, a satire or an honest serious view of the gun trade. Also there isn't enough research to surprise the viewer with facts that they wouldn't know of already – considering it was attempting the documentary approach for a moment. With its runtime over 2 hours, I remember looking at the clock quite a few times, however the pace picks up in the third act of the movie even though it walks a very familiar path. Nicolas Cage gives a decent performance as the smooth talking bootlegger and the rest of the cast does their best rallying around this weak script.Lack of clarity in terms of presentation, a very weak and superficial script does not do justice to a very sensitive and timely subject.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"No ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary,"" but still a good effort","To note that ""Lord of War"" falls short of its ambitions is less a criticism than an acknowledgment of a good effort. Writer-director Andrew Niccol always has something to say in his films, and here he plays mad scientist, cobbling together bits of ""Goodfellas,"" ""Three Kings,"" ""MASH,"" and a host of other seriocomic socio-political stews to create a lurching, cynical, sometimes frustrating, often sharp portrait of the global arms trade. Niccol's films like to examine the nature of reality, but with ""Lord of War,"" he drops the allegory to poke around the existing world, and those who make it such a violent place.In the opening credits we follow a bullet from its birth to the death it ultimately causes (this bullet cam recalls, perhaps intentionally, the mischievous police siren from ""The Naked Gun"" movies). We then meet Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage), a Ukranian immigrant who makes a similar journey through the last few decades of global conflict, going from small time gun dealer to the self-proclaimed biggest merchant of death on the planet. Yuri's justification of the immorality of his trade is to practice it entirely amorally, with zero regard for politics, consequences, or loyalties. He explains all this to us in a running voice-over that stretches the entire length of the film, emulating Scorcese's device in ""Goodfellas."" At one point Niccol even throws in a police helicopter to tail Yuri around New York, an unambiguous tip of the cap to the gangster epic that ""Lord of War"" so fawningly emulates.The film spends considerable time on Yuri's family and personal life, and it's here that it has trouble shifting gears. Though there are some good scenes with Yuri's coke-addicted, deadbeat brother (Jared Leto), these family sequences end up repeating themselves, with Yuri tossing out vague, half-hearted defenses of his trade, though it's clear he doesn't think it requires any. The idea is that a family treated with the same ruthless detachment as the gun running business is destined to be yet one more casualty of that callousness, but ""Lord of War"" gets torn between being a character study and a larger commentary on contemporary geopolitical realities. The film is at its best when following Yuri at work, and his efforts to stay one step ahead of dogged INTERPOL agent Jack Valentino (Ethan Hawke). There's a great, absurdly nihilistic scene in which Yuri, forced by INTERPOL to land a carrier full of guns on a dusty West African road, hops about on the deck, exhorting the locals to take all his cargo ""free of charge,"" then watches over the next several hours as they also take away the plane itself, piece by valuable piece.Nicholas Cage is just right for this material; his matter-of-fact drawl is perfect for explaining why an arms dealer is less dangerous than a car salesman. ""Lord of War"" feels like it has more it could say, though, were it less divided between its personal and professional stories. How can we condemn Yuri, it asks, without condemning the society and politics that produce and depend upon him? It's a shame that this film settles for being intriguing and engaging, when more was within its grasp.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Not Perfect, but still pretty good.","While Lord of War isn't the perfect movie, it's still gets it's powerful political message across. Lord of War is the story of Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant from Brooklyn who works in his family's failing restaurant. Unsatisfied with his slot it life (which he describes no better than Soviet-controlled Ukraine), Yuri witnesses an attempted assassination on a Russian mafia boss and changes his profession to arms-dealer, first starting locally then widening to every war zone on the planet between the mid 80s and 2000- during which he spirals into a haze of lies, drugs, pain, and guilt. While I didn't find Cage's performance particularly spectacular, it was enough to bring such a well written character to life. The other characters, while not especially developed, act as good foils to Orlov. I especially like Andre Baptiste, dictator of Liberia based on real-life Liberian dictator Charles Taylor.Simply put, Lord of War has a clear message that it pushes at nearly every point in the movie when it's not developing the tragedy of Cage's character. If you dislike movies that harp on a single point on multiple levels, then this isn't for you. More so, if you don't agree with the point (which many won't, since it implicates the United States and several other superpowers in Yuri's wrongdoings), you won't like this movie. However, most students of history and politics will appreciate how the movie connects the last days of the Soviet Union and the continuing conflicts in parts of Africa with it's tirade against arms-dealing ( most of which is true, especially in Africa) even if they disagree with the moral. It's as much as an objective analysis as it is a cautionary tale.The cinematography and direction is stylish and flashy, and can be compared with Michael Bay in someways. For some it might be a turn-off, but I say if you can do something outlandish with a camera and still have a good movie, do it. It never hurts to have a bit of flash, especially in a movie which has the potential to be quite visually dull.The only negative criticisms I can find with the film are that, in some parts, a bit of plot development is needed, and that it has a tendency to generalize the issue of Africa. Sure, the continent has had it's share of corruption and violence, but not every coup or revolution in Africa has been bloody and not every government is corrupt. The movie redeems itself by making Yuri the true villain and by making a division between good, evil, and desperation in West Africa.All in all, a powerful, highly enjoyable movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Cage as an arms dealer is pretty awkward, but he manages to convince me that he can definitely play that part with a sprinkle of comedic performance. Leto's acting is great, but I would like to see him play a part other than becoming a drug addict. Some of the dialouges are complex and the story is pretty face paced, but the film allows the viewers to get back to pace. The ending may have mixed reviews, but I love.

Best movie of 2005,"This film is based on a true story and it feels very alive because the things that happens in the film is really happening every single day and this makes me see the situation of the world in a different way, the way the bad guy sees it. It is a very well told story and if I'm going to be honest the story isn't the important thing in the film. It's about explaining the way the world ends. The Day After Tomorrow is about the same thing (Only the day after tomorrow is about global worming and we have enough of that crap from the news.) and I didn't like that film, but this one's different. I believe that it has a point which many people don't care about. And if we continue to not care about it it will come and bite us in the end. It is very well made and I liked it a lot, but it is a documentary in my eyes and not a movie. I loved it as a movie and I respected it as a documentary.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A brave thought provoking and  brilliantly scripted film,"A dazzlingly intelligent movie combining a thought provoking and clever script with first class acting, and an amoral anti-hero who you cannot help but love. The fact that no US studios would back the movie makes it a brave choice for Cage, Hawke and Leto, and they all put in excellent performances, particularly Cage as the laconic, self-deluded arms dealer. This movie does not deal in the normal Hollywood black and white morality, but in the thousand grey shades of real life. The movie presents a thought-provoking look at the men who buy and sell arms to the world's dictators and bush-fire conflicts. This is a brave movie that doesn't shy away from showing the reality of the darker side of the modern world. A brilliant, and intelligent movie with superb acting and incisive characterisation, with the possible exception of Hawke's somewhat one-dimensional, crusading Interpol agent (though in fairness he does the best he can with the slim pickings the role offers). To cap it all, the director has given this film has the best opening credit sequence of any movie since Hitchcock.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Guns, Guns, Guns! Everything goes!","The film starts as a comedy-crime then gradually blends into a noir- drama. The poster may seem deceiving here since the movie doesn't belong to the war genre. That's interesting, because that probably makes this the best anti-war film you'll see with no battlefield action.Probably what's more fascinating than the movie itself is it's lack of accolades. You may agree that it demanded at least one, the best writing award. Yet the film goes unmentioned at the Oscar's. I suspect that this has to do with the political theme of the film; the ruthless condemnation of western administrations and the affair between the ""Security Council"" and the ""Freedom Fighters"".You will never see a weak moment in its entire runtime and the performances are excellent. Nicholas Cage does require a special mention. Andrew Nicole proves that he's no amateur (or was he ever!) and the best at what he does.So go ahead grab a copy, sit back and let the narration run accompanied by outstanding cinematography and the bone chilling background score.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Serious Topic Gets a Very Dark Comedy Treatment,"""Lord of War"" is a very black comedy that turns quite serious. It deals effectively with issues that ""The Interpreter"" botched because this uses real place names in real conflicts with no trussed up sympathies for white victims, assisted by vivid location shooting from Brooklyn's Brighton Beach to South Africa.Nicholas Cage is another ""Gordon Gekko"" as a Ukrainian immigrant who finds a knack for using his gifted entrepreneurial skills to achieve the American Dream, but as a quick-witted, film flam gun dealer very like the dapper drug dealer in the comparably stylish ""Layer Cake.""In an arch narration, Cage's ""Yuri Orlov"" shrugs that his business is no morally different than a tobacco or car salesman. With its eye on international affairs, the film doesn't touch on second amendment issues of the U.S. gun market or on what goes around comes around in terms of terrorism, except that he blithely notes that he didn't sell to Osama bin Laden because his checks bounced. The film is full of dark and absurdist humor, from the opening description of how his family faked being Jews in order to get out of the U.S.S.R. to what happens to an abandoned airplane on the African plain.Seen through the prism of ""Yuri""s burgeoning career and family, the film is particularly good at tracking the impact of the end of the Cold War and the small conflicts around the world that have emerged as an export business from the resulting surplus ordnance, especially those between various liberation fronts that have found their horrific full flowering in Africa. I think this is the first feature film to show the sickening impact of the boy soldiers and blood diamonds of Sierra Leone, while it is equally filled with grim ironies about African realities and contradictions of living in a daily war zone.Ethan Hawke, as his ""Inspector Javert"" type nemesis, gets stuck with the clunky idealistic dialog, making obvious what we can already see are the consequences of ""Yuri""s actions, even as we are entertained by his flamboyant, Milo Minderbinder type tricks to outwit the law. The ending is appropriately cynical and probably realistic.Jared Leto, who is much more than his beautiful blue eyes, again movingly embodies a troubled soul, as in ""Requiem for a Dream."" He and Cage establish a warm chemistry that makes their brotherly trust palpable.Eamonn Walker of ""Oz"" is not over the top as a corrupt Liberian power monger, given the horrors that have been perpetrated there. Bridget Moynahan gets to poke fun at her own talents, as she plays a model turned wooden actress who is content on her husband's worshipful pedestal until she slowly wakes up from the fantasy.Writer/director Andrew Niccol's whooshing camera angles get a bit gimmicky as they reinforce ""Yuri""s sales pitches, but they are chilling in showing the enormity of the business and how that volume gets used one on one. It is also a visually exciting way to keep our attention on a serious topic instead of preaching at us, which is reserved for informational text before the credits.The choice of '80's songs into African and other world music helps to create the appropriate ambiance, though I presume they couldn't get the rights to Dylan's ""Masters of War"" and Warren Zevon's ""Lawyers, Guns and Money.""",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Morals versus Reality,"I waded through the Lord of War, just last night. The opening scene  ""The Life of a Bullet""  paraphrased the theme of the movie. Mankind mindlessly produces the components of war, without moral introspection, or without even thinking about their end use. We ascribe morality only after an event. This is not to say, however, that the production of everything man invents should be evaluated purely on a moral basis. If we did that, we would still be sitting in caves naked, and without fire.Mankind has had this uncanny ability to turn almost every invention into some kind of weapon. All we have to do is look back to the opening sequence of a film classic  Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Here we see the early seeds of mankind bashing in the skulls of rival hominids with a bone clubs. Today, our clubs have evolved into nightmarish, mechanical, mass-produced weaponry. We have always killed one another, its just, that over time, we have improved on our ability accomplish this end.Yuri Orlov, played exquisitely by Nichols Cage, is simply a very successful opportunist and realist. He knows what his product is, and what it is intended to do. He is simply filling the middleman role in the supply and demand process. If not him, someone else will. Every successful businessman is much like Yuri, maybe not to the same degree, but they almost need to be amoral about how they conduct business, or they are out of business. Do the names Enron or Tyco ring a bell here?In the scene, where Eva confronts Yuri about what he does, he states: ""Its not the money. Its just that I'm good at what I do."" There is no such thing as an ""honest buck."" But, shouldn't Orlov take a certain pride in what he does? We all know what that the weapons produced by every capable government are meant to do. Some regimes simply don't have the capacity to produce their own weapons. Should these governments be left defenseless? Enter the Orlovs of the world.The beauty of the film, which, by the way, I thought was exceptionally well done, is that it did not moralize. It was not a morality play. Instead, it more like a documentary. The moral issues are left to the audience to resolve. Sure, by our very nature, we will align ourselves with Yuri, his addictive brother Vitaly, the African warlord, or the Interpol agent (played exceedingly well by Ethan Hawke). Every one of them had a defensible reason for doing what they do, albeit naively.My only criticism of the movie was that it was a bit slow. Otherwise, the content, the acting, storyline, and cinema photography were exceedingly well done. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It was entertaining, as well as thought-provoking.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Boring,"I rented this movie to watch with my husband. We were both bored by it. I found it lacked passion. There was no chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Bridget Moynahan. The relationship between Nicolas cage and Jared Leto as brothers seemed cold as well. The narrative performed by Nicolas Cage during the movie was monotonous. Perhaps if the lead character had some passion for his wife, brother, or son the movie would have come across better.Although there was an underlying message to the movie, I don't feel it was worth watching for this alone. I expect to be entertained by a movie, but Lord of War did not do this.The movie was rated 14A in Canada. In my opinion it should have been restricted. There sex scenes, although not as revealing as they could have been, were explicit. The violence was also graphic.

Makes you feel in awe for what you've just learned..,"Truly one of the most grabbing movies I've seen in a long time! From the stunningly perfect visual start to the in-your-face rant about the reality of things at the end. It is also very daring in that it comes from Hollywood. The movie is accusing itself a lot, without being too apologetic or dogmatic or moral. Very well crafted script, fast pacing, cynically harsh and evil, telling, revealing, shocking, yet done in a way that is almost laughable. All while realising one is not allowed to laugh about it, because you *know* the world is like this, or worse. And even when the Cage character tries to excuse why he does it, you feel how difficult it has been to stay in the clear when writing and directing this, and it only just barely stays on the good side of itself, warning us all: Chaos will prevail. On top of all that it's got an amazing choice of music illustrating the beautifully shot images. A definite must see. No doubt about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Opening Sequence,"I loved this movie but nearly fell out of my chair as the opening sequence played.In 2004, well before this movie was released over a year later, I composed a poem entitled ""The Bullet's Tale.""

I don't want to violate the rules of posting here by including a URL, but if you go to Google and type in ""Scott Ennis Bullet's Tale"" you will find the poem easily enough.The opening sequence of Lord of War is so close to a visual representation of my poem that I have considered challenging the producers on it.Of course, it's entirely possible that someone came up with the same idea as me to show events from the bullet's perspective, but it makes you wonder.Since mine is clearly a biased opinion, I'd love to know what others think once they have seen the sequence and read my poem.Thanks!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nicolas Cage is the Lord of War and not the Warlord....I prefer it my way!,"Now thats a movie worth watching. I think Nicolas Cage is one of the finest actors alive who is still imparting class to his roles. He adapts himself to the character in such a fine manner that one would consider him ""born for the role"". Now that is exactly what he did in this one as well.Nicolas Cage is an arms dealer who has an obsession with selling arms and he is damn good at it. While doing his monkey business he encounters various problems from the interpol as well as from his conscience. The morality keeps on nibbling at his soul, however he never gets exhausted. Things mess up pretty badly for him as he fails to justify his veracity in front of his wife. It costs him a lot eventually. Ethan Hawke plays the guy from Interpol who is on a hunt to catch him. Andrew Niccol wrote a brilliant story about war and politics. His earlier ventures as a writer The Terminal(a movie you can never forget) and The Truman Show happens to be my all time favourites.This movie was exceptionally well directed by Andrew Niccol and brilliantly performed by Nicolas Cage(No one could have done it better).",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Purpose of Guns,"Wars have always been an integral part of humanity's suicidal efforts to destroy itself. In The film, Lord of War, Nicolas Cage, plays Yuri Orlov, who's weapons, allow the process of death and mass murder to become an art form. The film is unapologetic and quite brutal as are the actors who portray the various waring dictators, soldiers and merchants of death participating in the gun-trade. Following his transformation from drug dealer to arms dealer, Yuri displays a genius for circumventing international law and becomes an expert at delivering death to any infant nation struggling for survival around the world. Chased by a persistent Federal agent from the U.S., as well as inter-pol agents, the film is set to the background of various conflicts around the globe. The film is a social statement which reminds us, there are many nations who'd rather prostitute their country's resources and the lives of their people, than establish a future for them.

Also Jared Leto gave a good performance his character was weak and literally a lot of things happens to him starts from the beginning that suddenly Nicholas (The narrator) tells us it happened and it ends in the next scene by Cage.

"A movie about the most dangerous thing for humankind: Nor religion, Nor women, but Weapons ! (DVD)","My title is cynically shocking but my intention is to arouse consciousness about what really kills: WEAPONS. Not words, not ideas, no differences, but real objects made by humans whose aim is to kill other humans But a weapon is harmless if nobody touches it. So, the ""Thanatos"" side of humans (its death pulsion) needs to find somebody who can be the middleman between those who built & those who use.This movies is about this kind of ""lord of war"".From a realistic point of view, the movie is respectful: indeed, Africa is the main consumer because it is the poorest civilization, thus unable to have massive weapons of destruction. In addition, the movie acknowledges the situation of child-soldiers, and the director is honorable to refuse casting ""disabled"" child. At least, it denounced the bigger sharks which really pull the strings of those lords of war.From a drama point of view, the story has good dynamics: a brother relationship, an attractive & moralistic wife, western background against natural sets. All the same, as the character of Nicolas Cage compartments his life (his container is a symbolic home for him), the movie is maybe too much rigid, too cut.Cinematography, the director is a good visual one: excellent opening, intelligent frames (the ads of his future wife, the automobile design viewed as target, etc.).But finally, the movie lacks something to motive several viewings but the first one isn't a loss of time also. It has the value of opening a high political issue from the basic level. This debate could go on with the insight of the Philip K.

lengthy satire with dry first-person narration,"Gun plays essential role in many movies produced nowadays. However, there's still not enough films which depict gun industry and the involvement of governments in gun trade (apart from Bowling For Columbine I haven't seen any). Lord of War is one of those sparse, enlightening movies. Although the idea of the flick was ultra-original and interesting, the film itself disappoints. I cannot deny this film bravery in attitude towards the subject which has been presented thoroughly. Nevertheless, Lord of War is mercilessly wordy as well as pompous and that makes it almost unbearable.

For a start, there is absolutely no screen play at all. Facts are just enumerated, backed by pictures of bullets and guns. The story is told, not shown. Then the movie tries to encompass too many themes instead of focusing on one or two leading ones. Finally, it does not look realistic (never seen a love story that is so unconvincing), while actually it is a true story.

Lord of War,"There was a current story in the news that ""Lord of War"" arms trader Viktor Bout arrested in Thailand. This made me interested in seeing the movie that was more or less inspired from 5 such characters of global arms traders like Viktor Bout.Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is Ukrainian immigrant to US, and finds a niche in dealing with arms supply  first locally and then with big money coming in  goes international / global. He pulls his brother Vitaly Orlov (Jared Leto) to join him. The illegal trade fetches Yuri  good money and richness, a super model as his wife Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), global trotting from one continent to another  but he looses his brother Vitaly in drugs, makes many enemies, and distanced himself from humanness and morality that even poor kids from Africa using arms to kill each other does not touch his heart. Even though Yuri substantially faces emotional and moral losses  the movie still ends in a note that ""Arms trade is a chic thing to go into!"" A very good topic to make movie on, which the New Zealand born writer / director Andrew Niccol has always loved to rake contemporary problematic issues. Surely, this movie throws enough light on arms trade and how it takes place. Where it falls flat on its face is the inter-weaving of Yuri's family life with his business. It is poorly scripted. In addition, he has created a very superficial, one-dimensional character of Yuri, and the screenplay does not give enough scope to the Oscar winning actor Nicolas Cage to give his best. He is good, I would say above average in his role, but nothing extra-ordinary. Jared Leto over-acts. Bridget Moynahan has hardly anything to contribute to the movie.The movie has surely some funny and engaging sequences, like the Boeing landing on remote African mud-tracks, or Russian collapse and the boost in trade etc. but it could have been a lot better.Indian musician A.R.Rahman sold his theme music of the movie of ""Bombay"" for a small scene  which sounds so absurd in the scene.

As if this was another happy go lucky American dream story, but in which not computers or hotdogs are sold, but weapons, LOTS of weapons.Somehow the jokes kinda fell flat, most of the time. What's left is Cage's typical mischievous attitude, but that alone cant save this movie from turning into a dud.More bad: the opposing leading actor Ethan Hawke, who plays the character of a determined government official isnt convincing at all.

Tell me something new,"Arms trade is obviously nothing surprising for Americans. Wholesaling them abroad is neither. Its moral implications are completely clear.So this movie was supposed to tell us something new about it. But it falls short in most respects by several reasons.First, it simplifies all characters to the rule...'one of each'. For instance, all world dictators are incarnated by the fictitious Colonel Oliver Southern. All other arm dealers, the 'ones with principles', are incarnated by Simeon Weisz. The military corruption is simplified to one of each side, Ukranian and American top officials... All good men are represented by an ubiquous incredible cop, Jack Valentine. Finally, most of the women depicted in the movie are faceless prostitutes, besides Orlov's wife, an ex-top model. So, in the big picture, we have a frustratingly simple scene. The usual salt and pepper of violence and sex completes this moral 'fast food' product, that never goes deep into any character background or motivation.Second, the whole movie turns around Mr. Cage's performance, who stays in the screen since the very beginning to the last shot, with the only exception of a notable trailer introduction that may summarize the whole thing probably better than the 120 minutes lenght of the movie that comes next. Is it hard to tell apart the many truculent parts Mr. Cage has played in the past from this new character. Only brief appearances of Ian Holm, as sole competitor of Orlov, dignify the poor acting of the rest of the crew, never seeming to believe their own parts.Finally, the movie fails to dare going further in revealing the intrincated associations of the industry military complex. The only mention to US military, the world's number 1 arms exporter, is a top rank US General with no face that appears briefly a couple of times.Maybe, Andrew Niccol faded before this dangerous subject when compared with his previous very interesting films, as GATTACA or The Truman Show, or maybe he had to surrender for the sake of average US people's understanding, but a lost chance, in the very bottom line, to tell us something new, something powerful enough to recommend this movie to be watched.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pathetic,"Lord of War looked like it had the potential to be a really good flick, but looks can be deceiving. It turned out to be nothing more than a Hollywood bashing of the arms dealer, and guns in general. The storyline deals with a Russian immigrant and his rise to power and wealth in the arms trade. The whole object of the film was to vilify and make international arms dealer Yuri (Nicholas Cage) pay for his sins. The subtitle for the film could have been ""Die, gun guy, DIE."" They went so far over the top in punishing him that it was laughable. They made him a liar, adulterer, drug user, murderer... they even tried to give him AIDS. It was absolutely ridiculous. I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say it doesn't end up well for poor Yuri. The filmmakers were not at all shy about showing what their political views are. So successful in their mission were they, that I actually contemplated throwing myself in front of a bus out of guilt because I saw a picture of an AK-47 once. I realize that movies are often made today just to advance a certain political agenda, but this was the most obvious attempt I have seen yet. The movie is actually a rip-off of an 80's flick called Deal of the Century with Chevy Chase (which was excellent, by the way). Lord doesn't deliver any of the comedy that made Deal of the Century great. It is so dark and depressing that I wanted to slit my wrists before it was over just for a few laughs. The only amusing part of the film was the cat and mouse game between Yuri and the dedicated law enforcement agent (Ethan Hawke) trying to nab him. The opening sequence was awesome and original, but even there the political message was still obvious. It shows a bullet (from the bullets viewpoint) being made, loaded, shipped, put into a gun, and then going down the barrel to blow someone's brains out. I wonder if Handgun Control Inc. had anything to do with the making of this movie? I give it a 3 out of 10 just for some of the great one-liners that Cage gives in his voice-over narration, which are quite good. If I wanted pure propaganda, I would have rented Fahrenheit 9/11.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Flashy but difficult to wade through...,"Nicolas Cage plays Yuri, the son of Ukrainian refugees in 1980s Brighton Beach who is inspired to go into the arms trading business after witnessing a shootout between a Russian mobster and two assassins with Kalashnikov assault rifles. During the 1982 Lebanon War, Yuri sells guns to all sides, despite witnessing various atrocities. Does he have a conscience or is he only in this for himself? One assumes he dulls his pain with cocaine, an addiction that lands him in drug rehab. Eventually, Interpol gets wind of Yuri's success and sends an agent to arrest him. Audacious, in-your-face direction by Andrew Niccol, who also wrote the screenplay and co-produced, cannot quite make lugubrious story worth wading through, despite being based on factual accounts, while Cage's hollowed-out narration seems like a shortcut.

Bridget Moynihan is a model who is actually turning herself into a pretty good actress.How about a movie about a big bad Hollywood director with a progressive ax to grind?",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nothing special here,"Yet another one of the many films were Cage's monotone narration has destroyed what could have been great.
Glad I watched it but wouldn't recommend or watch again.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A machine gun fire of clichés,"This movie is lost time and overrated. I saw the first half hour and I am particularly annoyed that you have to accept everything for true. The structure of the story is miserable. The main character played by Nicolas Cage sells weapons but it is not clear where they come from. He has customers all over the world from shadowy areas to which he can deliver weapons. Never is clear how he get this customers. He has an unstable brother with whom he cooperates and who can not bear the wealth when they have succes. He goes to the coke and then goes downhill with him. He tries to help him with a lot of tearjerking brotherlove. An other thing, he gets a handsome woman who does not find his work completely pure and suffers from remorse. This problem also must be resolved. In short, this movie has a machine gun fire of clichés whereby the critical film viewer has dropped out before the end",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Art of War for East,"Its a pretty good movie, for Nicholas Cage and his ""brother"". It has a cool vibe that goes through it and a touch of the ""co;d reality"" of trafficking guns.A bit like. Iron Man and Romeo and Juliet in the world of Ukranian (ironically enough), world of ""how to train your dragon"", with so much trafficking deals that it spins your head around. It actually makes the. War Dogs of Jonah Hill lokk a much better movie by the sense of it. It is the reason why this kind of humor makes politicians have to put an arms embargo on the East, although it never works successfully. The movie is also quite funny and even more cynical than even Cage can normally handle.Personally though, I do not like the theme as gun trafficking or any kind of trafficking is very dangerous business, although very profitable in the Eastern part of Europe. But, the spin of it is also too American, because people like Nicholas Cage is playing would never have so much philosophy about it and they would almost all be like his brother, who by the way plays the role a whole lot better than Cage if we consider the ""reality"" spin of it.The movie is quite entertaining for the guilty pleasure it offers and it is quite resourceful even for security agencies. ""Gun Running"" in former communist countries of Eastern Europe cant be that adventorous and the Russian metaphor is quite hilarious and the music fits the film like Danko with wild shots of guns, planes, stars and drugs with sex.The music is good and the documentary of Nick Cage is entertaining, but its not a movie, its a show of Quarantino on drugs and guns.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
So bad it's funny,This is a hilarious watch but not in a good way. Horrible script that made good actors seem bad. 2 hours of nothing really happening or changing. Very clearly written by and for men in the worst way possible. Was fun to watch and make fun of tho.,1.0,Anonymous,Crime
