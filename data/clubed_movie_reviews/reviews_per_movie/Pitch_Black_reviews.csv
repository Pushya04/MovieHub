How to survive in pitch black?,"Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group.The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's well-written characters.The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty- hunter with a drug-habit; Imam, a holy man facing the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. Characters start to live in the movie. They aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick though that feels quite odd. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both.Other thing that works in this movie is the casting. Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be.So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting and entertaining with a good cast of mostly unknowns and great special effects.,"The opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible.  I've seen a number of sci-fi movies with great special effects but my roommate and I looked at each other after the opening sequence and he said plainly, ""sensory overload.""  The plot of the movie is pretty simple but the nice thing about this sci-fi movie is that it lets the audience figure out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to ""subtly"" explain it. The creatures in this movie are also very interesting.  You don't get a really good look at them until about two thirds of the way through. Overall, a very entertaining movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Relentless and gorgeous sci-fi action film,"Let me waste a moment of your time to explain how I approached this film. 1st I dismissed the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of Aliens, which I consider to be one of the weakest films in the Alien series. Stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after I heard positive things about it from people whose opinions I trust, I missed the theatrical run completely. I then became hooked on Farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found Pitch Black on cable one night around bed time - so I said ""oh why not, at least it has Claudia Black in it."" Soon, I recognized Keith David, and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, I do not know). I was captivated. I have now remained captivated for four years. I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.This is not an art film, not an independent, and its not entirely original, but where it fails to break a lot of new ground, it utterly succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound to good to be true? Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would go on to star in the somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles thereof (which I also enjoyed, though recognizing its rather huge flaws) and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big, and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but a smart one too. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.The film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). Is that all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry.As unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told, and very nicely performed. Don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think a whole lot, but do expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is a great film!  If this is your genre', you won't be disappointed . . .","I will admit, I was already a fan of Serenity, Riddick Chronicles and all that, so I did go into this film with a bit of predetermined anticipation. On the flip side, I'm not always that much of a Vin Deisel fan, in that he is somewhat mono-dimensional in his range of characters, but for the embodiment of Riddick, he does fit perfectly. As for the story and how it plays out, the pace is good, not too encumbered with gratuitous special effects and all that, but where it does fit, the CGI is well done and appropriate.The one really glaring technical defect in this story is how everyone just gets out and starts walking around, breathing in the air without the slightest concern for differences in the atmosphere, microbes and so on, but this is a common flaw that is often somehow glossed over in many such stories, so I can't harp on that detail too much.As for Radha Mitchell, she is smokin' hot here, not in a ridiculous or frivolous way, but as her tough, seasoned interplanetary merchant marine ship's captain character ""Fry"", she nails it perfectly. If anything, she very much reminds me of Andrea Osvart (see her as the Hungarian assassin ""Gilda"" in the film ""Two Tigers"").Now, if these two ladies ever appeared together in a film, I would drop everything and go check that out in a heartbeat . . . but I digress.In any case, I have no trouble with granting 8 stars to ""Pitch Black"".",,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Pleasant Surprise; Good Performance By Vin Diesel,"Exciting and interesting from the start, I have to say that while I approached this movie with at best limited expectations I came away from it pleasantly surprised. Vin Diesel is not really my cup of tea as an actor, but in fact he put on a very good performance in this futuristic sci-fi drama as Richard Riddick, a convicted murderer who's being transported to prison on a spaceship that crashlands on a strange alien world. Once there, the survivors discover that there are terrifying creatures who come out only in the dark, which at first doesn't seem much of a problem since the planet has three suns and is never dark. They then discover, though, that the planet is about to go into an eclipse, plunging it into complete darkness for an unknown length of time, and releasing the creatures to hunt them down.Diesel's Riddick ends up as the hero of the movie, because he has surgically enhanced eyesight that allows him to see in the dark, and so he takes on the task of leading the others to safety. This movie is at times frightening, and on the odd occasion graphic, but not gratuitously so. A lot of effort was put by director David Twohy into developing the character of Riddick, and into portraying the change as the others slowly learn to trust him with their lives. I thought it slowed down a bit in the last third or so of the movie, and somehow became less interesting once the creatures were actually released by the eclipse. There seemed to be far more suspense as the survivors tried to figure out some of the mysteries of the planet and as they faced the approaching darkness. Once the darkness came, in some ways the movie became a pretty standard sci-fi monster type of movie. Still, it was a lot better than I had expected it to be. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The director just loves Riddick,"I remembered this as a tight, well made and exciting little sci-fi film, but either I've become more judgmental twenty three years ago or this just hasn't aged well. Actually, it's just the first third or that is a problem. The beginning has quite a bit of poor acting and preposterous behavior from the survivors of a crashed space ship on an unknown planet. They adjust to the monstrous crash they've just been through, which is well done, and new surroundings astoundingly rapidly. They barely seem shook up and are not remotely believable. However, it gets better and the last two thirds are still pretty exciting. I kind of remembered the final scenes, but not the actual ending, so I was a little surprised, which is always good. Bottom line, this is a pretty good sorta Grade B type movie that gave the world Vin Diesel for better or worse. There was a terrible sequel to this, with Judi Dench no less, and another that I don't think I saw. The director hasn't made a film since Riddick 13 years ago and is now making two more. This character is this guy's directing career!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Impressive creature feature,"A nice twist on the Alien formula, with a surprisingly good script and a great performance by Vin Diesel. Riddick is one of the most likable anti-heroes in recent memory, and in this film he's given equal doses of hero and villain. The exposition is nearly perfect, introducing all the characters very well and setting up the story adequately. It moves a little too fast after that, though, bypassing a lot of the story in favour of quick kills. Still, the visuals are solid and the direction is quite innovative - I liked the high contrast showing how bright it was on the planet. Diesel carries the movie, but Radha Mitchell is pretty solid opposite him. Some pretty nice gore scenes too. Just a pretty good creature feature.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Excellent use of Sci-Fi as a story telling medium,"While most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra terrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the 'Aliens' series, Pitch Black stands as a fine piece of Sci-Fi, and an excellent movie all around.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting.  This movie beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself, something different than the 'normal' movie lighting we are generally subjected to.  Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner, skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal.  After all, the film is about Riddick's (Diesel's character) personal journey, so thankfully Vin doesn't drop the ball.  The remainder of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous Claudia Black) were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances, animating the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms.  Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget.  The special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus, as in many high budget 'blockbusters'.  It's a great movie because it uses Science Fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, provoking story, rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of Science Fiction.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great,"The 2000's great times for movies, the CGI is opening the possibility for new ideas, combine that with some great actors and you get Pitch Black a Great movie for the time.The Director did a great job I could not find any mistakes so he gets a 10⭐
The actors did a nice job, maybe some improvements here and there but nothing major they get a 8⭐

In Darkness,"When their spaceship crashes on an outskirts planet, fears mount in regards to an incarcerated convicted murderer who fled captivity in the crash, however, the crew and passengers soon find something far more terrifying on the planet itself in this action thriller with a sci-fi twist. Relatively simple as the premise may be, it is undeniably effective with the film's best moments coming from the crew and passengers scurrying about in fear of Vin Diesel's killer, accidentally shooting one another in the process. The tension is not quite the same once Diesel decides to unite with the group to overcome the vicious alien presence on the planet, but there is still plenty to ponder over as all concerned find it so hard to trust Diesel even in the face of a very real alien threat. As for the alien presence on the planet, it brings up a whole gigantic slate of unanswered, perplexing questions, particularly in relation to their allergy to sunlight. Then there is the amazing coincidence of the characters crash landing just before the planet is about to plunge into several days of complete darkness - but this is a pretty decent film when one focuses on trust/mistrust themes and the portrait of diverse individuals all banded together in the name of a common goal to survive. Diesel is very good too in the role that really kick-started his career; he has an awesome line towards the end about saying good night, and with his blacked-out contact lenses and designer goggles, his character leaves an indelible impression that lasts long after the movie has ended.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good movie which takes a new approach to the sci-fi genre,"Even though this movie starts off with the usual: something goes wrong, spacecraft crashes, people are stranded etc. it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas. Riddick is somewhat of a bad-ass convict and has modified his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the ship-crew and he gets in. The cutting in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique that shrouds around the anti-hero and male protagonist: ""Riddick."" The story in Pitch Black is, as already mentioned, to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the clipping and cutting in the movie blended with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel acts really well in the role as Riddick and even though his character is a hardcore, tough survivor he still takes morale decisions almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end... Why destroy an already perfect reputation? All in all this is a very good movie though not perfect. The story seems very unoriginal at the surface, but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain. Some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average. It could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a spiced up sci-fi story blended with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely Riddick.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average and quite disappointing,"Let me be specific why i called that disappointing movie because its story is quite boring n plain with no twist at-all.it could be ignored as there are many films with simple plot.but id film is carry star names like Vin Diesel etc then u expect a bit more.few people are stranded at some new planet after crash and only there hope is to escape through space craft abandoned by some early settlers.the alien predator are same like we have seen in some ""crash and survive"" type of alien movies.scenes were pretty bad directed some times.it does not have any interesting element.quite boring concept ""person with no faith + person with faith"" was repeated again.so if you guys are Sci-Fi fans you will be very very disappointed from this.so i will recommend you to avoid if you have some other option.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Forget the first half hour, then it's great!","This film gets off to a bad start. An incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly-done, truly amazing spaceship crash. Then things go downhill again, as you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster-fodder. Hell, half of them don't even speak English, preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all. You feel as if you were watching ""Deep Blue Sea"" meets ""Silence of the Lambs"", minus the good bits. And unfortunately, the entire thing tries to hard to be ""Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter"" during the daylight scenes. Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he is no Anthony Hopkins, and he frankly annoys as the smart hyper-cool psycho. There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor - but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so...But then things take a turn. I can't exactly pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. It also feels less chopped - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show-stealer. By the time the first monsters appear, the film is actually quite enjoyable. By the time night falls, it is great. Thrilling, horrifying and exciting. And even the character development of most main characters is well-done. If you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you're in for some GREAT entertainment.Besides, the visuals are eye-candy, and I honestly admit: I love the colour and the tone of this movie.7/10 (could have been 9/10, if only....)",,Anonymous,Horror
Riddick the Great,Pitch Black is one of those examples that prove that movies with a rather limited budget can be very entertaining - and well made.

"Slow first half hour, amazing special effects and cinematography, decent acting, gory second half, complex plot, some corny dialogue- you have Pitch Black","What were my concluding thoughts on seeing this film? Impressive, uneven perhaps but well worth the look.First things first, technically it is mind blowing, the special effects and the cinematography were brilliant, and the crash was spectacularly staged.The plot is quite complex, people complained it was illogical, but I didn't find that, it was an original concept I give you that.The creature attacks are also well done, though I will say the second half is so gory, I admit I lost my lunch.The first half hour of the film is a little slow, but the rest of the film manages to redeem itself in terms of pace and was quite compelling.Some of the dialogue was a little on the corny side, especially the monologue after the crash.The acting was decent, Vin Diesel the standout of the bunch with a brooding charisma that is quite rewarding,and Radha Mitchell is good as Pilot Fry.The music is excellent, and the direction was good.There, you have Pitch Black. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The next Alien...,"From the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black I was hooked.  I had walked into this movie thinking that it would be just another cheesy sci-fi movie. Instead I found a highly entertaining, on the edge of your seat, thought provoking action film.  The movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick. The actors are amazing, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and other..) as Fry is truly a joy to watch on screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again.The look of the movie is breath taking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing. Followed by the complete darkness of nightfall. I would truly recommend any lover of the ALIEN movies or Radha Mitchell (which is why I went to see it) to check out this film. I'm sure by the end you'll look at the dark in a whole new way.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie is really well done even though the special effects weren't the best but overall it was good, there were even a few edge of seat moments throughout the movie. Also Vin Diesel did a really good job at playing Riddick the escaped murderer with Gray/silver smoke eyes.

Good science-fiction adventure,"A crippled spaceship lands on a planet with three suns that only experiences darkness once every 22 years, things come out in the dark, and the crew must fight for survival, or die - that pretty much sums up ""Pitch Black"". The concept of a planet bathed in (almost) continuous light was the premise of Asimov's classic short story ""Nightfall"", but rather than being our own worst enemy, the ""Pitch Black"" planet is home to fierce, flying nocturnal carnivores. As space adventures go, this one is pretty good. The look of the glaringly illuminated desert planet is very well done and the various backgrounds (the bone filled canyon and the hollow towers for example) look great. The acting is what one would expect for this kind of movie, lots of gruff tough-guy posturing, semi-comic relief from the less-heroic characters, and the usual alien-chow that only live long enough to establish the threat. Vin Diesel's 'Riddick' character was so popular that he front-lined a couple of less-than-stellar 'sequels', but I didn't find that he was any more interesting that the rest of the main cast. Of course, the raison d'etre for this kind of film are the aliens, which, although usually only seen briefly, in the shadows, or through Riddick's enhanced eyes, are excellent. The plot does hang on some coincidences such as the crash occurring just hours before one of the rare eclipses and the abandoned geology base having an orrery (a somewhat archaic tool for an interplanetary mission) that conveniently explains the whole three-sun eclipse scenario, but those are minor problems in an otherwise pretty good story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Diesel's Best,"A totally brilliant movie!!This is a wonderful blend of sci-fi, horror and action as Vin Diesel teaches everyone not to mess with him!Diesel brings the appropriate amount of menace to the character and the story that winds around is he a good guy or a bad guy or both. You never really know how he is going to act, right up to the end. This doubt really serves the movie well. Who is the actual enemy is it the aliens or is it Riddick?The style of the movie draws the viewer in and makes you feel like you are on the ground with them, feeling their fears.Totally brilliant movie :)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good as it could have been, but a very good movie at that","When I first saw ""Pitch Black"" about seven years ago I didn't know what to think of it, I thought it was a very good Sci-Fi horror flick and that was pretty much it, But now seeing it again I has a whole new meaning. Pitch Black is the first movie in the chronicles of Riddick series and it introduces the world to Riddick.This film is not perfect, nor does it pretend to be, there's allot of bad dialog and sometimes the movie just seems to trail off in some places and doesn't follow a steady pace. But if you can over look that this Vin Diesel vehicle is pretty good.Pitch Black offers you a new insight to the creature feature genre. Instead of dinosaurs , croc's and giant bugs it gives you a whole new species to fear and loath, with that this film delivers only good creature violence and some awesome CGI but besides that it's not much more that a loud clunking action film nothing more nothing less.

When humanity needs the animal side.,"I think Pitch Black is one of the few movies I consider to be the pinnacle of sci fi story telling.

The universal physics doesn't require explaining, you never get pulled out of the moment. The build up is perfectly done. It touches you. I think a Hitchcock lover would be proud.This movie remains on my top 10 sci fi movies.

On a Planet with Three Suns,"As Brandon said in 'Rope', ""Everybody's afraid of the dark.

A great ride!,"From the opening crash scene - a classic, even if it does mess around with the laws of inertia - to the closing scene, this is pulse pounding sci-fi horror with a bravura performance from Vin Diesel. The CGI and effects serve the plot, and not the other way around.The critters are fantastic (although I have to wonder what they eat when there are no hoomins around).As with all films like this, there are a couple of troubling plot holes, but far fewer per running foot of celluloid than the average George Lucas movie, and far, far fewer than average. The direction is taut.Quibbles. Soundtrack is very derivative in spots. To keep the George Lucas comparison going, it's partly dumbed down John Williams. That said, the score has some great creepy parts too. Science quibble.. Low oxygen results in non existent flames and complete inability to run. Character quibble... Vin Diesel's character Riddick's unusual skillset is not explained enough for my satisfaction.But heck, none of this was enough for my willing suspension of disbelief to get more than a few spare cables cut. If you don't normally watch SF movies this is definitely one to consider, and if you like SF horror this is a must see - in fact true horror buffs might find it tame.I am variable in how squeamish I am. Some days I can handle pretty disgusting stuff and other days I can't. This movie has a couple of pretty scary scenes, but I didn't find any of it particularly disturbing, and Vin Diesel made the whole trip worthwhile, in this, his breakout role.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
great sci-fi horror,"The spaceship Hunter-Gratzner crashes on a desert planet. Pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) tries to take control after the captain is killed. Bounty hunter William J.

Best sci-fi movie ever!,"This movie is about the crew of a spaceship who crash land onto a strange bright planet with three suns.

During the eclipse, Riddick comes into his own, as his eyeballs have been surgically shined, giving him night vision.  The crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety.This is a very stylish film, with the colour of the sky changing scene by scene, giving it a very strange look.  Vin Diesel is brilliant as Riddick, truly menacing but forced to help people who otherwise would only see him as a threat.  There is also an underlying humour in his performance as well, which adds another dimension to the character.  This is the sort of role that Vin excels in, the anti-hero, whos character is not as one-dimensional as first appears.

"Mixed feelings, interesting flick.","This movie is actually very entertaining. Although when watching through it I found myself very intrigued in hindsight the movie was quite shallow.Don't let that discourage you though, I have given the movie the rating of 7 for a reason. Vin Diesel is perfectly casted for his role and the mysterious man he plays really makes the film alot more interesting.The movie feels like an episode of Doctor Who, without the Doctor. I think it could very much pass as one. The movie is very Sci-Fi but still remains quite down to earth. It's sort of a double edged blade in that sense.All in all I really wanted more from the movie. There isn't really much at all to it. The things it does, it does really well.

"A Film For The Eyes, Not The Brain","In this sci-fi action flick, a spacecraft full of youthful, photogenic people crash lands on a desert world lorded over by hostile creatures that have an aversion to light. The script does a nice job of allowing the space travelers to change as the plot progresses, or rather for their true selves to emerge, as a result of the alien threat. But we never really get to know the characters in any depth, and I was indifferent to all of them.Lack of depth is noticeable in this film. The premise lacks scientific credibility, and the screenplay has a couple of obvious plot holes. There is no cerebral message or subtext that I could discern; there is nothing to think about or ponder. The film is pure escapist entertainment, with an accent on high quality special effects. Visually, the film strikes me as a cross between ""Alien"" and ""The Road Warrior"".""Pitch Black"" will appeal to viewers who like fast action sci-fi films that emphasize visuals, not dialogue. The film also will appeal to people who have no need to infer, contemplate, question, analyze, or read between the lines. What you see is what you get.",,Anonymous,Horror
Little originality but still a decent thriller.,"Pitch Black is a decent cross-genre movie, that ups the ante the deeper it goes. Starting as a fight for survival, PB is an upheaval of frights for the marooned party we know so little about, on an unknown planet after their plane crashes. With limited food, water and no shelter, the odds are against them, especially with a known murderer in their midst. The temperature drops, sun begins to fade, and the creepy crawlies come out to play. Pitch Black holds no originality to its name, displaying facets of thrillers like Alien and Predator. The computer-generated beasts riddling the survivors' breathing space are imaginative; covered by the darkness to make our imaginations run wild, but also to hide the fact the CGI is below par. The darkness settles, scaring them and us respectively. One terrifyingly cool scene sees the group fending off hordes of monsters with big glow sticks. At the time in 2000 none of the actors were glowing stars. This means everyone and no one can survive, from Diesel's hard-edged mystery man to Radha Mitchell's likable captain. All you need to know is what's right in front of you. Like other thrillers, the who's and the hows aren't necessary.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien-like movie but absolutely worth watching,"I haven't really liked Vin Diesel before watching the Chronicles of Riddick as I am not enthusiastic about action heroes but yesterday when browsing the TV program it seemed to be worth watching and I was not disappointed at all. Superb action, outstanding photography and great actors - and tension, tension and tension for one and a half hours. Vin Diesel id undeniably the central figure of the movie and plays his part as it is written in the book for a runaway prisoner. Yes, it is similar to the Alien series but the climax of the movie is different: the hero here proves sooner that he is able to cope with the seemingly invincible mutant creatures that eases the tension and gives the audience a final relief and faith that all will come to a happy end after all.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
They finally made a decent sci-fi movie.,"Most sci-fi flicks are usually a dud from the start.  Not this one.  It starts at a hundred miles and hour and keeps going.  Good special effects and interesting characters (Vin Diesel, you don't know if you want to like him or hate him) are what make this movie.  However, the storytelling seems a little ""made-for-TV-movie"" to me.  But overall, an awesome flick.  If you're into the sci-fi or horror scene (or not), I definitely recommend you see this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pitch Black Shines Bright!,"Pitch Black is the first movie in the Chronicles Of Riddick movie series. It's made in the year 2000 and I am only watching and reviewing it 22 years later, but by god does it hold up well. In fact it's a lot better then half the trash Hollywood is releasing nowadays.Pitch Black has a very simple storyline, there is nothing unique to it and odds are you've probably seen a similar story in another movie. However the story which is basically: 1) group of people crash onto hostile planet, 2) have to work together to escape, and 3) Are unable to trust everyone in their group, works really well for Pitch Black. What makes such a simple storyline work so well is the characters along with the actors and actresses picked to portray them on screen.Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Keith David, Rhiana Griffith and Cole Hauser really stand out. Cole Hauser plays the Bounty Hunter William Johns, who we at first pin the hopes for the survivors on until we slowly grow to dislike and hate him throughout the movie. As Riddick tells his father in the 2013 Riddick film, William Johns really has no spine. Rhiana Griffith plays a girl who goes by the name Jack and pretends to be a boy until Riddick eventually outs her. She does a really good job at playing Jack and I was as surprised as the rest of the characters when Riddick announced that Jack was in fact a girl and not a guy. Keith Davids plays the holy man Abu Al-Walid and is just an all round interesting character, with his perception of god and amazing portrayal of his character. Radha Mitchell is absolutely stunning in the film as a bad ass, strong pilot who takes over the role of captain and tries to ensure the survival of everyone. Vin Diesel plays Riddick and he absolutely nails the character from the way Riddick moves and speaks to the way he fights, just a brilliant job by Vin Diesel.The movie also makes use of different colours and shades to portray the day and night times. It's not the usual shades used in every movie but it works well and masterfully portrays the fact that the planet has 3 suns on it. That combined with good CGI and special effects for the monsters gives you a very enjoyable film indeed.All in all Pitch Black is a really good movie, it has a simple storyline, well developed characters and good CGI, SFX and VFX. Together it all comes together to create a lovely first movie in the Riddick movie series. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Eclipse,"A group of space crews abandoned on a planet where everything has been doomed by an unknown force. Thus they come to know the force is not other than the creatures which attack only in the dark. They must deal with the eclipse in the three suns planet.The first half builds the story, the second half implement the elements. So the slower first half is less important than the slow second half. Overall, a slow sci-fi as well as an action movie with some thriller moments. Not great as I expected.Vin Diesel is good. The Muslim group is also very good. The leading lady is good. The direction, cinematography, editing, background scores are good.

The film sci-fi/action flick that introduced the world to Vin Diesel,"Very suspenseful sci-fi action film is essentially ""Assault on Precinct 13"" in space, but while the story lacks originality, I'd consider it the most suspenseful sci-fi film film since ""Alien"" or ""Aliens."" From writer/director David Twohy (writer of ""The Fugitive"" and writer/director of ""The Arrival"" and the underrated WWII submarine ghost story ""Below), the story involves a transport ships crash landing on a seemingly deserted planet. When they discover the planet has deadly creatures who only come out at night and that a month long eclipse is about to happen, our heroes are in for a lot of trouble. The heroes include a scrappy female pilot, the excellent Radha Mitchell, a bounty hunter, Cole Hauser, who is transporting an infamous killer, Richard B. Riddick, played by Vin Diesel in his star-making role. Diesel steals every scene and he deservedly became a star following this film's release, landing roles in ""Fast and the Furious"" and ""xXx."" Twohy's script has a number of unexpected twists I don't want to spoil, but the film has a bit of an Agatha Christie ""And Then There Were None"" vibe with a rogues gallery of characters that is a lot of fun. The most interesting of of the supporting characters is Keith David (""They Live"" ""The Thing"" ""Platoon"") as a holy man. My main complaint about the film is the amount of time it takes to get to the dark (almost 60 minutes). I also didn't care for the harsh photography during the sunlit scenes, which were done to contrast to the later dark scenes, but I didn't care for the bleached blown-out look. However, those are fairly minor quibbles for what is otherwise a smart, suspenseful film that boasts a dynamite performance form Vin Diesel. A must see for sci-fi fans!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Nice pick me up after Supernova.,"This movie certainly isn't the holy grail I have seen some people make of it, but it is a solid, competent effort. The biggest thing I would change about it is replacing the female lead with Claudia Black instead, who I think would have made it more compelling, but what can I say, I'm a Farscape fan.The movie definately is influenced by the Aliens canon, but doesn't reach that level of greatness. It does however, despite a small budget, feature solid acting, some originality, and a nice little theme of redemption.One interesting note I read on here, and I would agree with it totally, is that I was never really 'scared'. Sure, I'm used to these types of movies, but the aliens did leave me with a pedestrian sense of deja-vu. The aliens seemed to be clones of the ones in Starship Troopers. Predictability is often the pitfall of these types of monster fests, and this one suffers its fair share of it.I give it a 6, for a solid hour of sci-fi diversion. Think of it as a really good Sci-Fi Channel original movie (a rare beast), which in the end I think describes it's level of quality best.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
How can a simple movie bring out such hatred?,"Seeing some comments, I really wonder how a simple sci-fi movie can bring out such anger.  It's just a movie - and they have made worse (remember The Avengers?; now that's a BOMB)It is true that Pitch Black is not for those who seek originality.  It is filled with extremely one-dimensional characters and a thin premise.  But non-campy, sci-fi movies are so rare that any credible attempt should be appreciated. (Unless you think Mars Attacks! is the highlight of film-making).I was not disappointed because I paid a rush-hour price.  But I understand those who were let down if they stood in line and paid a full ticket price. I give it a 6/10.As a side note, I liked the direction when the movie was in daylight.  It was different, and fast-paced.  However it was a different movie in the dark. As if the director got tired.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Is not With Riddick that They Have to Be Worried about,"When the transport ship ""Hunter-Gratzner"" is hit by a meteor shower, the pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) is awaken from the cryogenic sleep and tries to control the vessel with forty passengers. She is forced to release a module and only Carolyn; the bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser); the religious Abu ""Imam"" al-Walid Lewis (Keith David); the dealer Paris P. Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz- Gerald); Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Claudia Black); the runaway teenager Jack (Rhiana Griffith); John 'Zeke' Ezekiel (John Moore); Suleiman (Les Chantery); Hassan (Sam Sari); Ali (Firass Dirani); and the dangerous criminal Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) survive. Riddick escapes and Johns scares the survivors telling how dangerous he is. The group is stranded in the desert and find that place is heated by three suns and they team-up to seek for water and supplies. Soon they discover that there are under siege of flesh eating aliens that attack in the darkness; further, the planet will be pitch black with a total eclipse. They conclude that it is not with Riddick that they have to be worried about.After sixteen years, ""Pitch Black"" is still a great B-movie that may be considered a new-classic in the present days. The story is engaging with good special effects. But the most amazing is the direction and the perfect casting of unknown actors and actresses. ""Pitch Black"" brought the attention of the audiences to Vin Diesel in his first success; Radha Mitchell, from ""Everything Put Together"" of the same year, is perfect in the role of Carolyn Fry; and the always efficient Cole Hauser and Keith David have also great performances. The noncommercial conclusion is also a plus of ""Pitch Black"". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil) ""Eclipse Mortal"" (""Mortal Eclipse"")Note: On 04 September 2023, I saw this film again.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun on a budget,"Usually special effects movies are very expensive but ""Pitch Black"" does not respect this rule. And it succeeds in creating an excellent movie. Well, excellent within its limits. The movie is an ""Aliens"" clone but it works very nicely on its own.The cinematography is the victim of the low budget. It took me half an hour to become accustomed to the almost 'black-and-white' images. The colours are very basic and general. But the special effects are flawless and scary. Another problem is the very small screenplay. Read out loud and it wouldn't have taken more than 30 minutes.Characters are more or less sketches, with one exception. The anti-hero Riddick is the only character well written. Under the very odd and evil eyes, lies a good conscience that just needs help to come to the surface. But Riddick needs help in order to do that. He is the only character that I cared about and I am very happy that he survived. The actor, Vin Diesel (don't laugh at his name) is one of the best looking out there, and I hope he is also talented.I recommend this movie entirely and I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great concept, competently executed.  Nice photography.","Well, this certainly was a well thought-out concept.  It seems that Jim and Ken Wheat spent a lot of time working out the most convoluted way that this film could be presented.A freak crash-land on a desert planet, devoid of life... only it's not devoid of life it has millions of horrific flesh-eating creatures living under its surface.  Hang on though, they are afraid of the light and the suns never set on this planet.  Phew!  Uh-oh, once every 22 years a conjunction of planets means that the planet is plunged into pitch black. Big problem.  What they need is someone who can see in the dark.  Luckily they have someone who can.  Unluckily he is a re-captured escaped convict who has committed many mass-murders.  Things are not really easy, are they. Take away any weapons or real means of power and they are all in trouble.The first half of this film is excellent, with a good command of suspense. I watched this film late at night in the dark and it was very effective. The second half (you know how it is with horror: the bit where they show the monsters) was not quite as effective, but had some reasonable action to keep the plot moving.  Competent acting from another ex-neighbours cast member, as well as the rest of the cast.The other thing I liked was the use of colour in the photography for the different colours of the suns.  It looked really nice in the first half before the suns went down and it went all black.In summary:  Worth watching.  Competent and good fun, but will not be a classic in years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Probably the worst film I have ever seen!,"I went to see this movie, not expecting much, but still was curious and hoping for something good.  After I saw ""Event Horizon"", a film I liked that garnered an enormous amount of negative criticism, I kept my eyes peeled for something like it to resurface.  ""Pitch Black"" looked like it, and I was attracted to it.  The theater was packed, and the ads labeled it ""the scariest movie"", so I was in exceptionally good spirits.  What the projector and celluloid strip revealed was probably the worst film I think I have ever seen in my life!  Never, ever, have I been so cheated and so offended by a movie!  I'm ashamed to say that I watched it!First off, there's no plot.  Next, the casting and acting is bad. Following that, it's not scary.  It's boring, actually.  Also, it's unoriginal, whatever the point of this...thing may be.  And of course, nothing is done with the characters, so you don't care about what happens to them and find yourself enjoying watching them die.   For the first time in my life, I wanted to ask for my money back, and the hour and a half of my life.  For the first time, I felt like I wasted my time.  I was upset all afternoon after it, and I woke up this morning thinking of all the different, more useful ways I could have spent my money.This movie shouldn't have been released in theaters.  It could have been released direct-to-video.  I take it back, it's not even that good.  This should have been released as a ""premiere-TV-movie"" on the sci-fi channel, which loves illogical, mindless sci-fi garbage.  The best alternative would've been to shelve this movie permanently and make absolute certain that it never saw the light of day!The effects and de-saturation of colors are nifty, but that becomes boring in and of itself and fails to save this shit.  Hell, this movie is so bad, it doesn't deserve to be called shit.  For those of you who like laughing at bad movies, stay away.  This makes Ed Wood look like Stanley Kubrick!  I can't help but be deeply saddened by this movie.  It'll take me a while to recover from the shock of how I wasted my money, my hard earned money, so crudely and so thoughtlessly.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Interesting survival horror sci-fi, keeps you coming back","Pitch Black is a movie that I find myself continuously going back to. This must've been my fourth or fifth rewatch of the movie, and it's still just as captivating as ever. The plot itself is very interesting, and the overall set up and brutal environment the characters find themselves in are enough to carry the movie through any cheesy dialogues - of which there are plenty, but that only adds to the vibe of the movie. This is also very stylised movie, but some elements of the stylisation have not aged well like the bluish white filter over a few of the scenes which just wash out a lot of detail in the scene.Vin Diesel here gives a very reserved acting performance which leaves us guessing about his intentions. Intentions in this movie is a key theme, and a correcting them becomes a redemption arc for the characters who are all not very likeable to start off, but this is by no means a happy or feel good movie - there is unfair killings and carnage. The monsters are genuinely frightening and effective at hunting to say the least. I liked the inclusion of the religious Muslim character to tie down the crew to some level of sanity. I like more that his religiosity does not waiver in the face of extreme loss; an all to common theme now in Hollywood movies.The 4K Blu-ray, that I watched, was still rife with film grain, much more than other movies, such that it made the 4k not feel very 4k, but I imagine this is still the best it will look and as a fan I was willing to pay the premium for it (on sale of course). This is one of those films that doesn't have to score a high review rating to keep you coming back for a rewatch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic characters.... Story gets the job done.,"For a genre so littered with cliche garbage like Event Horizon and Starship Troopers, Pitch Black stands as one of the top in its class.See the film, if for nothing other than the lead character, Riddick, a real gem of science fiction anti-heroes. His voice over sets the tone early on in the film, and distinguishes him as the major player.""They say your mind shuts down during cryo-sleep.... All but the primitive side, the animal side.... I guess that's why I'm still awake.""Pitch Black is more about the development of a few of its characters as they learn more about themselves and others, than it is about surviving an alien assault.Sure, the story is pretty stock, but it's driven by believable people, people I could identify with, people faced with fear, distrust, prejudice, and an army of creatures that forces them to open their eyes to each other, lest they be devoured from without and within.Impressive special effects, little things like sepia toned lighting on the desert planet that shifts hues as the world's three suns rise and fall. Similar insect-like alien feel to the creatures of Aliens and Starship Troopers, but again, this film isn't really about the creatures. It's about characters, and that's why it works so well. It succeeds where so many movies of its kind fail.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Decent Sci-Fi Fare,"Like the original `Alien', `Pitch Black' is a sci-fi/horror hybrid -- a group of people in the far-flung future find themselves confront by an alien menace in hostile, unknown surroundings.  `Pitch Black' clearly owes a lot of its influences to Ridley Scott's `Alien', but it never sinks so low as to blatantly rip `Alien' off -- `Pitch Black' has a couple of neat touches that make it stand out.  However, it's typical movie cliches that drag `Pitch Black' back towards the realm of mediocrity, and keep it from being a really good film.Somewhere in the distant reaches of space, a freak meteor storm knocks a star freighter off course, sending the freighter crashing to the surface of an unknown planet.  The survivors, which include pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), bounty hunter Johns (Cole Hauser), and Riddick (Vin Diesel), a sociopathic killer who was being transported back  to prison, discover strange alien creatures lurking beneath the surface of the planet.  These creatures, which cannot stand light, have a taste for blood . . . and soon, they'll be swarming the surface, as a rare eclipse that sends the entire planet into darkness is only hours away.The story, while uneven, has some neat moments -- the inclusion of the Muslim leader Imam (Keith David) and his ragtag band of religious followers added some unexpected dimensions to the film; and the way the kid Jack (Rhiana Griffith) develops a macabre form of hero-worship for the killer Riddick, while disturbing, is probably somewhat realistic.  What truly brings `Pitch Black' down a few notches is the sheer number of unbelievable things that keep piling on top of each other.   The crashed ship just happens to have landed on a sun-drenched planet mere hours before an eclipse that only occurs every twenty-two years is set to begin.  The ship also just happens to be holding a ruthless killer, said ruthless killer just happens to have surgically-adjusted eyes that can see perfectly in the dark . . . the list goes on and on and on.  A few of these would be fine -- willing suspension of disbelief is all part of the movie-going experience -- but after the first dozen or so, it's sheer overkill.  Any small, cool original moments created in `Pitch Black' are inevitably lost amidst the big, steaming piles of unbelievable nonsense.As Riddick, Vin Diesel injects a large amount of coolness in `Pitch Black'. He gives the character enough nuances to keep things from getting boring. Radhia Mitchell was also quite good as the pilot Carolyn, who's forcibly thrust into being the leader after the captain dies in the initial crash. Her struggles in taking charge of the survivors is very believable, and very good.  The rest . . . well, they're predictable stereotypes.  They do a good job, but their every action is incredibly predictable, making `Pitch Black' a lot less tense than it should've been.Of note is David Twohy's excellent direction:  the way the planet is initially bleached blindingly bone-white after the crash adds a real sense of desolation to the desert plant, and serves to contrast nicely, with, well, the pitch black darkness of the eclipse.  He keeps things moving along at a fairly quick pace, adding enough tension to constantly keep things interesting.  The idea of keeping the CGI creature mostly unseen in the dark is also a good one -- they're a lot creepier that way, and by using them prominently, they might've looked lame if the CGI effects weren't perfect.A pretty respectable thrill ride; definitely check it out if you're a fan of sci-fi films.

original entertaining sci fi with the excellent Vin Diesel,"This film is when i first saw Vin Diesel and saw his person as an amazing acting silent mysterious lethal type. Definitely want his help when in trouble. This film is when i decided i loved him as an actor, and if hes in a film - i will watch it. Then there was the actress i know from farscape - claudia black. Yep she is a good actress and with the others, they did the film justice.All the actors made the story flow in a believable sense, no corniness or stupidity. I dont like films where im saying thats stupid or whyd they do that or thats obvious no one would say do that. But on the whole this film doesnt do this at all. Its simply surviving and obviously trying to escape a strange planet after crash landing on it. (not a spoiler is in the main info on the film)It had a good script, with cool twists and explanations. My main negative is i thought why'd they have to have someone in a film with an ""issue"" who played someone obnoxious!So i hope you love this like i did - if you like an interesting story with some scifi action and fun.

Richard B. Riddick. Escaped Convict. Murderer.,"One of my biggest guilty pleasures. I love this movie and the franchise as a whole. I've seen all the entries and beaten the games. It all started with 'Pitch Black' and the intriguing anti-hero known as Riddick.As a science fiction film it does an incredible job on a modest budget, and looks fantastic for the year 2000. The dialogue is great, especially from Johns (Cole Hauser) who comes off being so hard-bitten which speaks volumes to his character. Riddick is a cold realist; yet still has some form of a moral code. Mostly though, Riddick is a certified badass that you don't want to mess with. Very few can compare with his wits, resourcefulness, survival instincts, pain threshold, and combat ability. It served as a catalyst for Vin Diesel's action stardom. The soundtrack is also one of my favourites.I sincerely hope they commit to making the next installment 'Furya', and delve more into Riddicks backstory.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A ripping ride,"The bleached cinematography nicely conveys the shimmering heat of the desert. Some great shots and quality action sequences with a solid plot. Diesel's not-unpleasing voice delivers some of his best lines as the anti-anti-hero. The accents of the various players added a lot to this for me. Claudia Black's northern-suburbs-Sydney was particularly lyrical. Solid turns by Cole Hauser, Keith David and Rhiana Griffith and others. Radha Mitchell could have kept her accent too but it seems that films contractually require American accents from ""lead"" characters so much these days that it's become a real pain in the ear.This is Diesel's best film in my opinion and an entertaining ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What were they thinking?,"This was quite possibly the worst movie I've seen this year and this is not exactly the best year for movies. The story line was interesting but the characters were one dimensional and boring. The ways the characters reacted to their spaceship crashing on an unknown planet was like they just woke up and were like, hey were on a strange freaky planet we're not suppose to be on, and oh yeah theres some booze. Like they didn't really care, like its something that occurs to them every day. That certainly was really unrealistic. I think anyone would be in shock. And they just happen to have a guy who can see very well in the dark. How convienent! Yeah I know a whole bunch of those people. And I know someone who can breathe underwater to save me just in case I'm drowning. Another part of the movie that displayed how poor the directing was handled was in one scene they are walking towards this abandoned station, theres a few buildings there and a spaceship, then they're coming back to their own spaceship and suddenly out of nowhere they have this space car that their driving around. What is this some kind of magical movie? Where we're supppose to fill in all the holes in the plot ourselves? The sad thing is that there are people who actual liked this movie. What kind of world are we living in?",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable  but visually a mixed bag and lacking in originality,"When something goes wrong in a deep space crossing, a passenger ship crashes on a desolate planet losing most of it's load along the way.  Once on the surface they discover signs of past human life and soon discover that the planet is populated by dangerous creatures.  They discover that the creatures come out at night to feed just as a solar eclipse begins.  The crew's only hope of survival is one of the passengers  a dangerous murderer with the ability to see in the dark.This film has the reputation as being Vin Diesel's breakthrough movie and I therefore expected it to be pretty good.  The plot is quite clever if you say the whole `seeing in the dark' thing, but really this is more of a plot device than a plot  the actual plot will not surprise anyone who's seen any alien movies before.  The cast are eaten one by one  you don't have to look at your watch to see if the film is nearly over, just count the number of characters left onscreen!  There are some exciting moments in the second half and the film manages to be enjoyable without being that good.I understood that Riddick can see in the dark, but didn't get why (at the start) he was walking round in daylight and the characters seemed unable to see him.  His being able to see in the dark is also a bit of a leap and all smacks of lazy writing if you ask me  it would have been better to not have this twist rather than making it feel like it was forced.  The actual aliens themselves are not well designed  when half seen they are fast and exciting, however seen in more detail they are quite basic or, as my friend said, look like Big Bird's cousin.The film is really over-edited which in one way works but in others doesn't. The thing I liked was the use of washed out film stocks to show different times of day and to give a different feel to every part of the film. However the constant jump cuts etc just got annoying and suggested a director who lacks confidence and has to resort to visual excess to compensate for his lack of faith in the film to carry itself.The cast are all pretty awful if you ask me.  Diesel does have a good screen presence, even if he is lacking in charisma (in my opinion).  He is just like a young muscle man actor but does quite well here I suppose.  At least, he does in comparison to the support cast who are all clichés who await their death scenes with impatient hamming and cardboard delivery.Overall this is an average film as it lacks any new ideas (other than the central one) and feels like a retread of other films.  Visually bits of it are impressive but then other bits just are over the top, edited to within an inch of it's life for no benefit.  I enjoyed it but really failed to see what all the fuss had been about in the first place.",,Anonymous,Horror
An original story,It's hard to find new stories in sci-fi genera. Most of the movies just circles around some basic themes. This movie is a breath of freshness in this genera. Although there is a spaceship in this with a not so unique fate assigned to it at the beginning but the plot changes its course to some uncharted territory pretty fast after that.The making and acting is decent. The interesting story creates a thrilling experience throughout its runt-time. Vin Disel nails his part with perfection. It was more than impressive to watch him act.There are some unnecessary events in the story that felt forced to me. These were avoidable and probably were there just to get the audience emotional(if you have seen this you might understand what I am talking about). Without these I would've probably considered this to be a perfect sci-fi classic.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't eclipse 'Alien',"There have been few films as influential as 'Alien' and the first thing to say about 'Pitch Black' is how closely it follows the template laid down by that groundbreaking film. An ensemble cast of characters, landed in circumstances unknown by presumed hostile, try to keep their cool in the face of a growing but undefined sense of unease, but in the finale have to fight to the death with aliens (and traitors among themselves); not all will survive. Add to that a grungy, poorly lit aesthetic and you might consider the film almost a carbon copy. But if you're going to copy a film, then copying one known for it's atmosphere of claustrophobic tension is not such a bad idea, and there's a lot of original detail in 'Pitch Black' as well, some of it good, other bits less so. For example, the central idea is of a spaceship crashing on planet bathed in near-permanent light, thanks to three suns; but on which, like a desert in the rain, all sorts of things come alive when (every twenty years or so) there's a solar eclipse. The three suns also provide three alternative colours of light (before the darkness strikes, of course), which allows director David Twohy three visions for the price of one; but he doesn't seem quite to know what to do with this gift, and while the colour of the world changes from yellow to blue to red, it's unclear what this adds to the film except for a superficial jumpiness. As for the indoor scenes, shot unfailing in half-light only, the use of semi-darkness as a cheap way of creating an air of menace has surely not been this overdone since David Fincher's 'Se7en'.As for the characterisation, the dynamics of a group whose members have their own selfish agendas are well portrayed, but the film lets itself down by making clear its sympathies for two crew members over the others, especially as the two characters it favours are essentially the least believable: vin Diesel's super-criminal Riddick, and the unlikely babelicious ship's commander, played by Radha Mitchell. While the moral darkness of the plot's conclusion is offset by the willingness to grant vin Diesel corny, Schwarzenegger-style lines, usually involving at least one word starting with the letter 'f'. Another flaw is Twohy's exaggerated preference for constant cross-cutting between scenes, which sometimes increases the tension, but sometimes makes the film appear more like a pop video than a movie. He undoubtedly succeeds in capturing an interesting look, but only at the price of also acquiring a certain corollary shallowness.In conclusion, this certainly is not a wholly original film. But it looks good, and is plenty scary. Moreover, the whole somehow feels a little more distinctive than the individual parts. Still, one can't help but feel, this movie is just 'Alien' with better special effects, less judiciously used.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Was Surprised,"Let's face it. David Twohy has written some good screen plays, and he has also put out some real stinkers. I didn't know quite what to expect with this work, but what I didn't expect was this gritty, fresh science fiction work. I don't know that this will make ""cult classic"" status, but in my opinion, it should.The characters, while vile-mouthed, are enigmatic; the story, which has been classified by some as a rip off to ""Alien,"" has been done before, and done well, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of this work. The aliens themselves more closely resembled those of Starship Troopers than Alien, but I believe those other critics were indicating the plot, rather than the creature effects themselves.All in all? It delivers. I found it highly enjoyable, and quite frankly, it caught me by surprise.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The formula, predictable, and yet fun to watch.","You do not want to know too much about this movie ahead of time as the few places that are not predictable are all that it has. Here are all the standards, space rocks break ship, crash decisions, the survival of the ditziest. Throw in a few bug-bats, other obscure toothy critters, and stick your head in a hole. To make this movie unique and give it a name you throw in ""Pitch Black"" darkness caused by (watch the movie and find out.).Not to sound snide, you can tell that a lot of time and money went into the project. They had to pick exotic Australian locations for the planet scene (thank goodness it was not Mars again). Those Vin Diesel eyes were experimentally designed metal contacts. The orrery was a cute touch mixed with the otherwise hi-tech atmosphere. There is lots of action and even the obligatory waiting to be surprised did not drag out.If this is a shoot-um-up movie and an ""and then there were none"" movie, it is done well. If it was supposed to be a sci-fi movie, which should have a moral to it, then it was lost in the shoot-um-up scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Low Budget, But High Effort, 90s Sci-Fi / Horror Combo Pack","Shipwrecked on a desert planet, the survivors of a doomed commercial spacecraft explore the sharp sand dunes and bleached alien skeletons of a foreign landscape, seeking water and, with luck, the means to escape or send an intergalactic SOS. They aren't many in number, and even that sum soon begins to dwindle as untimely seasons shift and the sky falls into a months-long eclipse, instantly unleashing flocks of wild, hungry native night-hunters from their subterranean lairs.Fortunately, one of the survivors is well-equipped for precisely this situation. Riddick, a violent prisoner headed for the high-security slammer, boasts extensive combat experience and a set of augmented eyes that work best in the dark. Vin Diesel is effortlessly cool in that part, one which clearly evolved during the writing process to grow from a simple, gimmicky tough guy stereotype into a well-rounded, wonderfully unpredictable instigator who throws the plot over one shoulder and almost single-handedly hikes it down the home stretch. We don't always like him, but we're constantly intrigued by him, and Diesel (in his breakthrough role) really makes the most of that duality. He's not just grunting and grinding; he's assessing and scheming, too, with the physical performance just as essential as the strong, fluid character writing.The rest of the show is a little more mixed. It's an obviously over-performing low-budget science fiction / horror film, so some slips can be expected. Much of the egregious stuff is masked with low-grade film techniques or by abusing quick jump cuts and extreme close-ups. What serious special effects there are vary from shockingly effective (Riddick's tense, quiet staredown with one of the monsters) to downright bad (all exterior shots of the ship). It's efficient, though, visually ambitious and thematically novel. Those virtues, plus one star-grade acting performance, add up to a bit better than average in my book.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sad flick,"Bad bad bad.Wannabe Alien-like movie with wannabe sci-fi action, and a wannabe Schwarzenegger/Stallone #2 - Vin Diesel - who absolutely can't act to save his life. I'm glad I've never watched Triple-X. I might have died early.Story is mediocre and it's been there countless times. Cast is absolutely horrible. I hope the people being responsible for the casting never get jobs in the business again. The CG effects are mediocre as well. Not the worst, but then again not really good or up-to-date. Dialoges are simply dumb. Same as the characters, not even including the story holes yet.Only positive mentionable thing in this movie is the okay cinematography and the nice colors (including oversaturated and/or overbright picture that looks nice) of the first half of the movie.Here's my ratings (and there is only basic things to rate here): cinematography 6/10, colours, first half 8/10, overall: 4/10.NOT recommended, NOT worth watching, NOT worth wasting time on.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Dank, Rank Sci-Fi","This tale of futuristic space travelers crash-landing on a planet and battling vicious beasts that are afraid of light suffers from undeveloped characters, phony special effects and enough plot holes to fill a spacial black hole. Vin Diesel, while a good actor, reads with a too-sophisticated Greenwich village New York theater background that belies his character's psychopathic origins. Radha Mitchell makes no impression as the spaceship's gutsy female captain. Cole Hauser over-acts outrageously as a bounty hunter. The computer-driven special effects are, as usual, cartoon-ish and unbelievable. One character escapes from a cave with a can of worms, literally, (or florescent slugs) which the monsters resist. Other characters are so disposible we feel nothing when they are banished. To see how this type of film is done most competently, see the ""Alien"" series.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly enough a  good Sci-Fi movie,"I had never heard of this movie when it came out, probably because no-one ever wrote a review on it in the magazines and because no-one ever paid any attention to it before. Let's be honest, who knew anything about Vin Diesel before ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""xXx""? Probably not many of you and I'm not saying that I did. So when ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was released I was very surprised to hear that this was actually a sequel. And of course when a sequel is released in the multiplexes, at least one TV-channel will program the first movie and this time it wasn't any different. That's how I first saw ""Pitch Black"" and even though I'm not a fan of Sci-Fi movies, I have to say that I had a good time watching this one.The story is good. A space ship has made a crash landing on some seemingly lifeless planet, scorched by three suns. One of the passengers that survived the crash is Richard B. Riddick, a convicted murderer who is feared by all the passengers. But they have to find water to survive and a base to get help and they will need all the help they can get so they release him. When they reach the base, there is no-one to welcome them. It's completely deserted. Some kind of animals, who fear daylight, have eaten all the inhabitants. Normally there is always plenty of light, but once in a few years there is a solar eclipse. And this is exactly the time that there will be such an eclipse...Overall this movie reminded me a bit of Aliens, but I'm already glad that it didn't copy it completely. Somehow it tried to be original and that's not always easy. OK, you'll still encounter many horror and Sci-Fi clichés, but it's all done in such a way that they get away with it. It's all still believable. The different characters were OK, but could perhaps be deepened more. I mean, you'll never really know who the bad guys and the good guys are, but I sometimes wanted to know more about certain people. I wanted to know why they reacted in the way they reacted, I wanted to know what drove them...However, what I loved most about the movie were the special effects and the lighting. The creatures or aliens or whatever you like to call it were really cool to watch. Same for the lighting. The idea of a blue sun was cool and something I hadn't seen before in a movie. Also the use of different shades and intensities of light, as well as Riddick's night vision were interesting.All in all this movie was certainly worth a watch, even for people like me who don't like Sci-Fi at all. If I have to recommend it to anyone than it will of course be to the people that adore this genre. I'm sure they will be blown away by it. Personally I give it a 6,5/10 and that's probably the highest score I've ever given to a movie of this kind.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Furious Sc-iFi Flick,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Greetings from the dark...We will have a break from Streep movies and look at a personal favourite sci-fi character of mine, the underrated Riddick....Tonight's movie review is all about survival, how to survive in a hostile, alien world against even more hostile creatures. The first entry of this series is the science-fiction horror flick Pitch Black (2000) where a commercial spaceship is transporting through hyperspace a crew of people who are in suspended animation (deep sleep) to a new outpost. After a brief monologue around animal instinct...boom! Something hits the ship and we see a cool spaceship crash-landing on an abandoned planet which has three suns so pretty much there is no night. So, the survivors try to observe where they have landed and survey the interesting landscape until one by one each survivor gets killed by a creature who lives underground. Soon the remaining survivors find out that they have marooned on a planet full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night and guess what...as fortune fits the month-long eclipse is about to occur straight away....The survivors are a mixture of interesting people including the only member of the crew who is dealing with her moral dilemma around leadership and overcoming her own fears, a holy man on a hajj to New Mecca, a supposedly police officer who is hooked on morphine and the prisoner he's transporting, Riddick played by the furious Vin Diesel. To me this film truly belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence and is a show stealer with the execution of his dialogue. As a movie goer who watched this when it first came out pre Fast and Furious days, I wasn't sure whether Riddick was a villain or the main core character who tries to do good. And still to this day I have the same feeling. Diesel plays Riddick in a creepy and dangerous manner while trying to avoid the typical hardened criminal. The character Riddick and the deal with his eyes and his development in the flick really brings out a raw protagonist.The overall acting from the others isn't the best, the choppy scenes of some of the deaths are interesting, however the colour and the tone really places this flick on a different level which enhances the thrilling, horrifying and exciting elements through the movie. This sci-fi flick is a perfect example of making a good film without having a massive large budget. Overall, this an entertaining film 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Celebration Of Oscar Minor Categories Film-Making,"Which shows just how much mileage you can get from top-of-the-line production design and special visual effects, particularly when combined with inventive camera angles and lighting. To be fair, in a film which relies so much on 'make-the-audience-jump-out-of-their-seats' shocks, quality acting probably wouldn't have made a huge amount of difference, but it might have made those 'internal conflicts' of the group dynamic so much more credible. Too often, those conflicts smacked too much of 'Primer' calibre 'pulled punches', which fizzle out before they've built up a sufficient head of steam, at least until the next unconvincing argument rolls around. It didn't help, also, that the group's character profile smacked too much of quota-filling and genre stereotypes.Story-wise, we've probably seen it all before, probably dating back 60 years and more: a spaceship crash-lands on an uncharted, unforgiving planet, and its motley crew - including one dangerous criminal - recognising that compromises need to be made, and unlikely alliances formed, if they are to make it off the planet alive.
Story-wise, too, you can probably fill in the blanks although, to be fair, you can probably do likewise with the best of that sub-genre.
Except that from early on, I frequently found myself comparing it unfavourably with far superior films, made by longer-established, if not also superior filmmakers: like the 1950s 'creature-feature' 'Them!' which, perhaps benefitted from being more homebound, and its creatures being a product of radioactivity, and from the presence of a lead actor of considerable and plausible gravitas; and 'The Thing', whose director, John Carpenter had acquired a certain facility in the short sharp shocks department; he was particularly well-served, though, in that film, by an ensemble of actors who knew their place and their roles, and rose to the occasion, no matter that the subject matter might have been just a little hard to swallow for them.
Although, though to be fair, that's august company who would put most genre directors in the shade.A feast for the eyes, rather than the brain: file under 'honourable failures'",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun Little Alien Sci-Fi Horror Film,"This film I remember when it was released to the movie channels, but didn't actually see all the way through until this viewing to be honest. I'd seen parts as well as the sequel, but never actually watched it beginning to end. This is an intriguing one that has Vin Diesel during his heyday. The synopsis is a commercial transport ship and its crew are marooned on a planet full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night. But then, they learn that a month-long eclipse is about to occur.We begin with some voice-over narration done by Diesel. He talks about being the animal and some other things, revealing some of his characters thoughts and how he operates. He is on a spaceship as it travels toward its destination. The crew is woke early when they run into a meteorite shower. They are pelting the ship and actually kill the captain. The other two crew members help right the problem, preventing it's destruction. One of them is Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) and the other is Greg Owens (Simon Burke).Carolyn takes over the controls and the ship crash lands on a planet. She dumps as much as she can from the ship, trying to get it righted, but they're still too heavy. She comes to the moral decision that she is going to dump the passengers of the ship in order to save it, but there's a malfunction. It crashes and we get some survivors.Of the survivors is a bounty hunter, William J. Johns (Cole Hauser), and a religious man, Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David). There's a collector Paris P. Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Claudia Black) and teenage boy Jack (Rhiana Griffith). There is also John 'Zeke' Ezekiel (John Moore) and three boys that are following Imam. There is also Diesel who is Richard B. Riddick. He is handcuff to a post while they try to find a way off this planet. It should also be pointed out that he has escaped from prison, is a murderer and has had a surgery on his eyes so he can see in the dark.The planet is covered in desert. At first they believe that it has two suns, but as one goes to set, a third one appears. It seems that this planet is never covered in darkness. It is pointed out to everyone that Riddick is dangerous and they should stay away from him. They start their search for water and a way off this island.Riddick ends up freeing himself by dislocating his shoulder and grabbing a nearby blowtorch. He flees into the wilderness. William is upset and starts to look for him. Zeke is tasked with burying the dead and digs a hole. Riddick ends up back to where he is and watches as he is attacked by a creature in a hole that he uncovered. Jack also sees what happened.This causes the survivors to blame Riddick. Carolyn isn't buying it and wants to get to the truth. The more they explore the planet, they realize there is something wrong here and things are made worse with an epic eclipse coming that only happens once every 22 years. They need to band together to survive or fall victim to these monsters.To start this off, I have to say that when this film first came out, I figured it was just going to be another sci-fi action film, but this one is actually pretty solid. This is one of the first films with Diesel that I saw and made me like him. He does well in his role and I would say across the board everyone does as well. I really like the idea of him as a space criminal and that he had a surgery on his eyes that allows him to see in the dark, for the reason though that he is in prison where it's always dark. The core group with him is Mitchell, who I think is solid in everything I've seen her in. David is a legend for me in cinema and Hauser really just plays angry characters well. They all round this movie out for what is needed.A problem I do have with the story is the lack of interaction with the creatures themselves. We don't get to really learn much about these aliens outside that Riddick discovers they have a blind spot and he exploits that near the end. I also found it odd that only one is really killed by anybody and it is Riddick with a knife. I understand this is to show his dominance. We just have characters like William and Imam, that are played by veteran action movie actors, I think we should have gotten a bit more.I thought the aliens were scary and despite being CGI which didn't look horrible. This film does a great job at making you feel like there is very little chance of them making it out alive, which and that works. We never see them really getting the upper hand, which is something else I enjoy. I thought it was shot well in building that up and using darkness to its advantage. The cinematography is used strategically for that.I'd like to preface that I really like this film, but I did find myself a little bit bored right after the eclipse happens. It takes them a little bit before they decide to try to make it back to the ship there going to use for escape. There were also some lulls early in the film right after they crashed that had me waiting for something to happen. The ending was good for me as well. One final thing I will add here as well was that this film does a great job at showing us who is good and bad in the beginning, but we slowly see this change which I love seeing in a film.Now with that said, I would recommend this film. If you are into horror films that involve aliens and take place on distant planets, this one is up your alley I'd say. The acting is good, the concept is solid and the story isn't bad, but could have been better. There is some good action and there are quite a few deaths in this one. It does have a depressing feel of there is no way they survive, which I really liked as well. If you're a big fan of Diesel, I would also say to give this a viewing as it is enjoyable for sure. I did find this to be above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Simple but nice...,"""Pitch Black"" is a Thriller - Sci-Fi movie in which a spaceship crash-landing on a desert planet, where the survivors must contend with deadly creatures that come out in the dark.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I was happily surprised. The interpretation of Vin Diesel who played as Riddick was simple, flat some times but good enough. His portrayal of the tough, anti-heroic fugitive adds an interesting layer to the film, making him someone the audience loves to root for, despite his morally ambiguous nature. The tension-filled atmosphere of the planet, with its haunting darkness and alien predators, is well executed, and there are plenty of thrilling moments that keep you on edge. The plot feels a bit predictable in some moments and the secondary characters lack enough depth to make their fates matter. The pacing also slows in some parts, which distracts from the overall excitement. Despite these flaws, ""Pitch Black"" is still an enjoyable movie for and worth watching. To sum up, I have to say that ""Pitch Black"" is offering an entertaining experience but lacking the depth and consistency to fully captivate so, before watching it I suggest you to lower your standards.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

An entertaining pulpy sci-fi actioner featuring a memorable turn by Vin Diesel as an iconic anti-hero,"Set in the far future, when a transport vessel suffers a malfunction, the ship crash lands on a desolate leaving only a handful of survivors. As Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) is the only surviving crew member, she takes up the role of captain and rallies the various survivors under her command for their safety. However also on board the ship was a police officer Johns (Cole Hauser) who is transporting ruthless killer and fugitive Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel). Johns recaptures Riddick after one of the survivors is found killed, but Riddick tells them there's something far more dangerous than him on this planet.Pitch Black is a 2000 sci-fi horror film written and directed by David Twohy and co-written by Jim and Ken Wheat who wrote the initial story. Initially written as a more supernatural story involving ghosts, the script got re-worked until the film took on more physical predators as antagonists. Twohy who had worked on early versions of Alien 3 understood there's be similarities inherent to Pitch Black and the Alien franchise as written particularly in regards to the characters. Made for a relatively modest $23 million, the movie became a sleeper hit earing $53 million worldwide and as a result started an expanded media franchise based around Vin Diesel's Riddick character which along with the success of The Fast and the Furious would position Vin Diesel as a prominent leading action hero in the early 2000s. Pitch Black doesn't stray too far from the space monster genre, but it is filled with interesting characters that help overcome the familiarity.What makes Pitch Black so unique in its initial setup is definitely in the shades of grey it establishes with its ensemble of characters. From the opening crashlanding sequence wherein Carolyn Fry considers purging all the passengers in order to land safely, there's no feeling of camaraderie or trust amongst the group as many of the survivors are purely motivated by self interest and their own survival even at the expense of others. With Riddick's opening monologue (well played by Diesel) about how he remains awake in cryosleep and discerns where they are from the sounds and smells on board, the movie creates a very threatening character who in a more conventional movie would probably be like a slasher killer but as the movie goes on it plays with the murky morality especially when certain revelations come to light. Now there are some morally good characters in the mix especially in regards to Keith David's Imam, a Muslim holy man on a Hajj to New Mecca along with several young Muslims in his charge and not only is David really good (as usual), but it's also a case of a religious man being positively portrayed as well as a Muslim man who is heroic and good. The actual monster movie stuff that takes place in the back half of the movie is serviceable even if it's not particularly interesting. The alien creatures just aren't that unique with them feeling like light takes on the Xenomorphs and there's also a lot of questions regarding them that don't make a lot of sense if you think too much about them. Frankly maybe it would've been better to keep the more supernatural angle because it wouldn't have opened that level of dangling questions, but considering Ghosts of Mars came out a year later and did that kind of thing and isn't well regarded maybe it couldn't be helped.Pitch Black is pretty standard monster movie fare that I elevated thanks to Twohy's direction and an engaging cast especially in regards to Vin Diesel's Riddick. While the actual scenario that plays out isn't all that interesting in the back half, the character of Riddick along with Diesel's performance does make it very engaging.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Film Noir SciFi Ever!,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was edgy without being sociopath.

(The snowmobile movie - oh yeah, it's called ""Triple-X,"" or ""xXx"" - was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black he plays an anti-hero to the max. I don't think you can go wrong when Vin stars in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood might type cast him as an adventure action movie star - wrong! I think the script for ""XXX"" was weak for which Vin couldn't act down to it.Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi - see it!-Zafoid",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable action adventure survival horror.,"'Pitch Black' is the perfect alien adventure horror film. I love the combination of action, adventure, drama and horror. Above all, this is a film about survival.The film's opening sequence is marred by extremely shaky camerawork - so much so that one (almost) misses some of the action. Fortunately they abandon the shaky camerawork after the opening sequence. Oh, and don't adjust your TV: some scenes were shot in monochromatic colours, especially blue. This is to accentuate the alien planet.Vin Diesel stars as Riddick, who has unusual eyes (thanks to surgery) which makes him see in the dark. This is relevant especially since much of the film takes place in the dark. As it turns out, the planet is infested with creatures that prey at night on anything living. As it is important for us to see in the dark, much of the film is viewed through Riddick's eyes, and it's effective. It elevates the suspense since the other characters can't always see the danger, and Riddick only replies with a dry ""you don't want to see"" remark. The mystery surrounding Riddick makes the viewer wonder whether he is actually good or bad.The antagonists here, however, are undoubtedly the creatures, despite William (Cole Hauser) also having ulterior motives for his actions. I liked the way they gave us a sense of what was to come by showing the creatures via glimpses in the background, without blaring scare music.The horror and survival element intensifies as the film progresses, and its good fun! 'Pitch Black' is a thrilling adventure horror that satisfies. I enjoy it every time I watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Solid Sci-Fi!,"Pitch Black is a decent movie. Because this fits the genre that I love the most, I thought I would love this. When I saw the concept, I thought there was no way this would be a bad movie. I was right in a way. It's not a bad movie but it's nothing spectacular. The first fifteen or so minutes of the movie actually sucked minus the superb crash landing. By the end, I was enjoying the movie though.This is about a group of survivors who crash landed on a barren planet and its up to a convict to lead the group away from monsters and off the planet to safety.The acting is not so bad. I think this is the movie where Vin Diesel makes a name for himself. I liked him here. The other actors were decent, nothing special.Overall, this is a decent sci-fi film that is enjoyable except in the torrid beginning. I also liked the design of the monsters. They were very creepy. I rate this film 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Yet another Sci-Fi B movie,"Gosh, where to start? I felt like they were insulting our intelligence from the beginning. I have no problem suspending disbelief on Sci-Fi movies, but that goes only so far. There are a few things that made this movie really lame. First of all, they crash-land on a planet with three suns. This is simply impossible. If a planet orbited three suns, it would have one hell of a bizzarre looking orbit, not to mention some really screwed up gravity. Second, let's not even get into the odds of a nitrogen-based atmosphere way out in the galactical boonies. In other words, how could they breathe? Finally, I loved the wonderful ""Soylent-Green""-esque camera tinting. Please, hollywood, or wherever these half-baked movies come from, stop. Put a little more work into the movie before you ask the average viewer to buy into this nonsense. If you don't, you insult our intelligence.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pitch Black is SCI/FI at its best,"Science fiction movies are either so good they are instant classics or so bad it goes into the back of the shelf of Blockbuster never to be seen again.  The movie Pitch Black, I believe, is a classic.  It is by far a bizarre little film, but in no way is it a gory alien movie.The story is fairly complex.  In some time in the future, a passenger ship caring dozens of people causing the computer to fly it to the nearest planet that can sustain human life.  The nearest planet is a hot, windy planet barren of life, or so it seems.  Three suns encircle the planet creating a weird yellow effect on the camera lens.  It is easy to tell the director and cinematographer had some fun with this.  Through out the early part of the film, the camera has been distorted and creates the illusion that the actors are on a hot, sunny planet.After the ship lands, only a few of the crew and passengers survive, the ships last member of the crew Fry, the antique dealer, a group of Muslim priests, the Prisoner Riddick, and Riddick's guard Johns.  Riddick soon escapes.  The rest of the survivors wonder the planet for water in fear that Radik will find them, and murder them.  Eventually they find a human mining quarry that has been empty for twenty-two years.  They soon discover that the planet goes into an eclipse every twenty-two years.  Soon, the entire planet is covered in darkness, and the real fun begins.Earlier in the movie, Riddick explains that in prison he had surgery on his eyes to allow him to see his victims in the dark.  This seems a little too coincidental because once the lights go out, as they say, strange creatures start to fly out of the planet to kill them. This forces the group to keep Riddick around to help guide them to safety.  I'm not a physics major, but how does a planet that only sees darkness every 50 years have aliens that any come out at night?  As it turns out, light actually hurts these creatures.Seeing this movie, I was amazed at its special effects.  This is an independent movie, meaning some large production company like Warner Brothers or Universal did not pay for it, but out of someone's own pocket. This person must have had a very big pocket.  The camera effects I mentioned earlier guarantee this movie a best cinematography Academy Award, or it at least deserves a nomination damn it.  The acting does leave a bit to be desired, but that is not the point of this movie.  This movie surprised me also with the fact that the humans fight each other more than they fight these creatures.This has become one of my favorite science fiction movies, one that rivals the Matrix and the Terminator.  I highly suggest this movie to anyone who doesn't have a weak stomach, the camera does some major shaking and quick turning.  This film will make you have a new appreciation for the light. Overall, it's a fun little movie and you all should see it.My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent action/horror.,"When I heard Vin Diesel was in this, I decided to give it a try. He's really a great actor and no mistake. He was the the whole movie in ""XXX"", truly a magnetic force. He put a pretty good performance in for his screen time in Saving Private Ryan, and was also in the hottest movie of 2001, The Fast and The Furious. His only bad (REALLY BAD?!) performance, and movie, for that, was A Man Apart. But this couldn't be that bad...could it? Defiently not. This is not a great film, but it's a pretty decent action/horror (definitely better than A Man Apart, anyway). It's reasonably exciting as well, and it's only dragged down slightly by the occasional corny script. The fact is, although this may disappoint some horror fans, it definitely serves as a welcome antidote to a stressful day. Silly, dumb fun, Pitch Black is a above average thriller that will probably please most Diesel Fans.Final Analysis: *** out of ***** (3 out of 5)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""You're not afraid of the dark, are you?""","When a starship crash-lands on an arid, desert planet with three suns, the survivors are left in quite a predicament: should they fear the serial killer who's been let loose among them, or fear the monsters systematically stalking them from the dark? Pitch Black is a pretty unique thriller, and a lot of it is in its visual storytelling: it's a brutal universe with oppressive planetscapes, freaky alien monsters, and a whole cast of cut-throat characters.However, the film has always felt like a mixed bag to me. A lot of it is simply because it's split evenly down the middle. The first half of this film is a survivalist story, with the characters moping around, getting their bearings, and trying to figure out what to do with themselves. With some hushed dialogue and so many character beats to run through, these acts can be rather dry. When the solar eclipse finally hits and all the nocturnal beasties come out, things pick up quite a bit, with frequent chases, fights, and thrills. The experience is marred by the film's style though: a lot of the more exciting parts have some of the most erratic editing and flashing images ever put together, and it can be unnerving.The film does tell an inherently interesting story though. Most of the characters are pretty dry and flat alien fodder, but one character stands out: Richard B. Riddick, the strong-bodied low-voiced serial killer who doubles as both the story's nemesis and hero. His progression as the anti-hero provides the best dynamics to the story, and it is ultimately interesting how this dark character is pitted against such dark monsters (in essence, using a monster to fight monsters). The film overall is pretty decent and original sci-fi material, but aside from Riddick, it doesn't really have many characters to like or root for.This film does its best to be stylish and hip. It boasts some pretty decent photography, but it gets really erratic with the editing at spots, using a few too many flashing images and fast cuts for my tastes. Weird color schemes are also dispensed liberally throughout the film's first half. Acting is okay: everybody plays it tough in this picture, especially Vin Diesel, whose performance matches up pretty well with the character. Writing is not bad. This production has okay-looking sets, props, costumes, and locals. Some of the special effects haven't aged well, despite being well-conceived. Music is pretty standard.This film has an unrated director's cut available on DVD and Blu-Ray, which offers a few extra minutes of dialogue and character-building scenes. To me, the differences between the director's cut and theatrical cut is very slight, and I find it hard to really tell them apart.There is a lot to like about Pitch Black, except for the supporting characters, some of the long drama, and the gaudy editing. Horror and sci-fi fans should enjoy it the best, but for most, I'd recommend it as a rental.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Less (FX) is more....,"Like Spiderman 2, this movie succeeds because if focuses on character development and emotion. FX and action do not overwhelm the story, but rather serve to advance the story and our investment in it, as good cinema should. Too bad Pitch Black 2 moved away from this formula! Radha Mitchell makes a substantial impact in a Sigourney Weaver (Ripley/Alien) role. But this is not an Alien knock-off.... Real, flawed characters in a morality play touching on issues spanning the existence of God to the redemption of even the most cold-blooded of killers. On more superficial levels, Pitch Black also serves as a good popcorn movie, with funky lighting effects, good tension, and cool creature FX....",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Twohy manages to find a new angle on the premise of humans being stalked by aliens,"Pitch Black obviously takes it's cues from both Alien and Predator however thanks to director David Twohy it manages to find a new angle on the premise of humans being stalked by alien lifeforms as swarms of vicious creatures violently devour their prey as soon as it gets dark and, unlucky for our stranded crew, a planetary eclipse blocks out the many suns shining down on it and consequently plunges the planet into darkness.Twohy gives the film a nice visual style and Vin Diesel seizes on the opportunity to steal every scene as we witness a new action star in the making as hardened criminal Riddick. However despite some tense action sequences and moments of gore I didn't find it as engaging or as exciting as it could have been. This could be down to the uneven pacing.It's certainly more action and sci-fi than horror and, while the CGI dinosaur like aliens are quite impressive and sufficiently creepy, overall the script is low on ambition and the story remains narrow with under developed characters despite everyone's best efforts.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pitch Black - An Enjoyable SCIFI/Action flick,"Pitch Black is a very unusual movie. While action at its core, with Vin Diesel as Riddick (as Bruce Willis was to John McClane, Ah-nold Schwarzenegger was to the Terminator, Sylvester Stallone was to Rambo, and (more notably) as Sigourney Weaver was to Ellen Ripley), this movie somehow take a generic spin on SCIFI and make it incredibly captivating.While I thought the beginning was kind of slow to start and a little ""meh"" considering the writers threw in Muslim stereotypes and other generic spaceship cadets, with Riddick being the only one who stood out as the more interesting one out of the bunch, that all changes 15 minutes into the film. As the movie stretches out and reveals what exactly is going on, the cast becomes more captivating. Cole Hauser (William J. Johns), Keith David (Abu al-Walid), and Rhiana Griffith (Jackie) are the ones I grew to like over the course of the movie.The acting is not particularly strong thanks to the weak performances given by supporting cast members like Radha Mitchell (who's current claim to fame among fans is 'Rose Da Silva' in the 2006 Silent Hill movie) while Vin seems to come out okay and pop out the occasional 'one-liner' joke when he's not trying to be the ""cold-as-steel"" badass.One of the things that I liked were the different hues used to portray the different parts of the world (which is inhibited by three different suns). I imagine some people wouldn't like that and will find it distracting, but I wouldn't agree. I think it gives the movie an interesting ""edge"" and makes it a little more captivating to look at.By the end of the movie, I came to really like it. Despite the fact I didn't care for the sequel, Chronicles, Pitch Black actually made me walk away with satisfaction. While it's not the best SCIFI film i've ever seen, and it didn't have the best story or action either, for what it was and how it performed it...it was all worth the entire view.

The machinery of retooling sleep,"I have been following the Alien trail starting with Jodorowsky's collapsed attempt to make Dune, it seems so interesting to me, and this is very much an Alien film. The filmmaker's involvement with Alien 3 - prior to the Vince Ward phase - is pretty well known in fan circles, it seems at least the prison planet idea was his.And this does take place in the same universe of deep-space corporate exploration and lurking horrors, though of course the fact cannot be openly acknowledged. Which means, with a small tilt, you can enjoy the film both as an effectively revamped Aliens as well as pretty clever cinematic annotation of those films post-Cameron.A few things. Among several shifts from Scott's to Cameron's vision, a pivotal one was the transition of Ripley from a person who survived on the basis of steely-eyed reason and sense, to obsessed and emotionally damaged woman, the whole plot about motherhood also mirrored in the creature, much less abstract this go around both in terms of narrative and presentation.Aliens 3 and 4 sought to extend this notion of locally internalized narrative opposed to the original's abstract fabric, both failed because of either a poor set of metaphors or creative dissonance among the filmmakers. The fans however seem to have made a pretty cool observation. A theory that has some traction in the Alien community is that both those films are cryosleep hallucinations of Ripley.And you should know this was originally written around a female protagonist. What is the film about?The film begins with the protagonist having a cryosleep hallucination as the vessel he is on board with others shoots through the 'back roads' of space. It is said that, in the inner space of cryosleep, only the animal side of the brain is active - so we encounter on the journey a lot of impulsive horrors and ugliness, both 'xeno' and moral.He is a bad guy, but not completely without conscience. So the journey is about desired redemption and salvation, this is mirrored in both the Islamic passenger's hajj to New Mecca and the pilot's desire to redeem herself for an unscrupulous decision early-on - you will see during the crash landing shots of rapid eye movement inter-cut with disaster, reinforcing implied dreaming.More. This is a desert world of three suns so perennial day, but complete darkness every 22 years - the catch is that 'horrors' can only roam the surface when it is night, and our team crashes hours before it happens. The coincidence will seem far-fetched and fated, unless of course you keep in mind this is his journey through his own back roads.And all of that is nicely capped off by having our guy be able to 'see' in the dark where no one else can, because - karmic chain - he was in prison and had surgically enhanced his sight to keep alive.Both his night-vision and newborn aliens have as their base a sort of bioluminescence, which is the way Twohy and his team envisioned the interiors of consciousness - writhing patterns of light in skulking darkness.The catch is that, depending on what viewing skills you have honed, the above will either not register at all excepting the 'redemption' arc, or will seem slightly obvious and sophomoric.The desert world is a big plus here, real sand and diffused light opposed to the usually fabricated studio space of Alien films. The creature on the other hand is much less memorable.",,Anonymous,Horror
Action is quite ok but script sucks,"Every single character was annoying, at least. Riddick was least badly written. There was so many cliches and plot intended stupidity.

All lights-off for ALIENS lite.,"My Take: Derivative yet entertaining.Slick but inferior, David Twohy's PITCH BLACK, even with its slickness, is just another monster movie, and quite a decent one at that. Although it won't break the sci-fi barrier, even if it doesn't have an A-list cast and even without some great special effects work, it makes for a worthy twist to the age-old ALIENS formula. You know the set-up, a spaceship-load of passengers crash land on a desolate planet system. Without the benefits of communication and refuge, they are forced to fight for their lives against the planets hostile inhabitants, this in case, ALIEN lookalikes.To benefit from the charisma of the lead character of the ALIEN films, PITCH BLACK also has a female heroine to lead the brigade of survivors. She's Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) who assists a batch of plucky to bad-ass characters, including a convict named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who plays hero later on in the picture. They arrive on a bizarre world which has a strange weather condition: It's approaching a season where everything gets dark. The time where the planet's inhabitants, strange creeping Alien-types, start crawling out of their crawl-spaces and stalk everyone. You know the rest! There's not much plot to speak of, as the film goes on as a typical creature-feature then on. But the movie is not nearly as bad as it might be. Derivative enough, PITCH BLACK still satisfies as an enjoyable attraction, even as a simple time-passer. Diesel is a satisfying anti-hero, who actually proves he can act. He's cold and emotionless, but I guess that's a plus. There's no character development whatsoever, even if the film spends enough time with them. The plot is empty and derivative, but as a creature feature, the film is slick and enjoyable. Even if it's not quite as unbearably seat-gripping as those in ALIENS, Twohy manages to create suspense in the most unexpected of places. There's enough action and decent acting to provide a sufficiently enjoyable action fare.Rating: *** out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A good prequel.,"I'll begin with a brief outline of the general storyline.A transport ship, known as the Hunter-Gratzner, while travelling through space, is hit by a sudden meteor shower, and is forced to crash-land upon a desert planet. A scorching-hot planet with three suns, no water and no apparent wildlife. Just barren rock for miles, and eternal light. The few survivors from the crash (a group of Muslim pilgrims on Hajj, a jump-pilot, a mercenary,a band of settlers, an alcoholic entrepreneur and an escaped convict) salvage what they can from the ship, now damaged beyond repair. During their explorations of their surroundings, they discover the planet is scheduled for an eclipse, where an orbiting planet crosses in front of the suns, casting the world into pitch-darkness. I won't spoil the rest for you.The surprising thing about this film is that it was produced under quite a tight budget and schedule, yet it yielded extremely good results publicly. Scoring no marks for unpredictability, yet 10/10 for originality, this movie introduced the deep and mysterious character of Riddick, and acts to fill in the background and history of this certain individual. Unlike its unplanned and extremely overrated sequel, this film earned Vin Diesel the reputation he deserves, along with its Director David Twohy.8/10 in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
best sci-fi of 2000,"""Pitch Black"" kicks right off with a pretty spectacular scene. In this scene a spaceship serving as a sort of inter-galactic subway train crash lands on a strange planet.  Among the surviving passengers is a convicted mass murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel from ""Saving Private Ryan""), being transported back to prison or somewhere nasty.  There's the co-captain of the ship, Fry (Rahda Mitchell from ""High Art""), who finds herself in charge. There are about ten others to begin with, but that number of course is reduced to about four by the end.The planet is very desert-like (what world of your typical sci-fi movie isn't?) Luckily (by golly, what a coincidence!) they land near a settlement now seemingly abandoned. There's also a canyon nearby filled with the bones of alien creatures. The group sets out in search of water, concerned by the presence of Riddick. But then something else starts killing people. They discover that the planet's only remaining life forms are these nasty, hammerhead shark-looking things that fly. The planet has three suns and for some reason, these creatures can't live in sunlight. Day lasts 22 years. At night, they hunt. Thing is, night lasts maybe as long as the day (a very cool concept that put a grin on my face). Oh and wouldn't you know it, after almost 22 years of daylight, these poor people crash land on the planet only a few days before the long night falls. sucks to be you I guess.The film is actually the best sci-fi flick I've seen lately (which only demonstrates how bad the sci-fi has been this year). It's quite entertaining if you can get past how absurd it is. The trick is not to think too much when you're watching it. The script cleverly plays the personalities of the characters against each other. It plays the horror movie game of ""who's the real bad guy?"" for the entire length of the film as well as another old favorite, ""who's going to die next?"" If you just concentrate on these questions and not the story itself, which is full of holes, you'll have a good time at ""Pitch Black.""Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is one movie to miss the first 10 minutes though as they will make you more nautious that the Blair Witch.After a totally stupid beginning, with flashes and jolts, throughout the 10 minute credit/pre-planet sequence, ""Pitch Black"" takes off.It steals a little bit from Alien, Star Trek, Bats, and The Mummy, but it does so it a good way, as every bit adds to the story and makes us want to hate some characters, while liking others (and this is not always the obvious choice).The writing, makes the story evolve (like the creatures) and showcases Vin Diesel amongst others.It is a nice entry into the sci-fi (with some horror) drama.  It may obtain some of a cult following, but otherwise it is not a classic.All-in-all, on the better half of early 2000 movies, but not a must see.Rating: 6Viewed: in theatre (scope)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too many absurd premises but visually interesting and good cast,"Pitch Black begins with the most spectacular and harrowing spaceship crash ever put on film. Unfortunately, while the film is superior to most other recent screen SF, the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to the promise of the opening. It is also unremittingly bleak and violent, and some plot premises rob the film of credibility. A long-range space transport is carrying about 50 passengers and crew in a distant region of space. One of the passengers is a captured escaped convict (Vin Diesel). The ship flies through a comet's tail (why couldn't the ship's nav computer automatically avoid this?) and micrometeorites punch holes in the hull and kill part of the crew before they can awaken from cryosleep. The docking pilot (Radha Mitchell) manages to bring the ship down on a nearby planet (where did it come from?) but the ship is wrecked, with only a handful of survivors among the passengers. The planet is actually a large moon of a Jovian-type ringed planet in a 3-sun system, so it never gets dark---they think. The ragged band of survivors discovers an encampment (lucky it was so close to their crash site) set up by mining geologists for test-core drilling, but it has been deserted apparently for 22 years. They find a small emergency rescue vehicle, functional but without power. The survivors return to the wreck for power cells when the planet passes behind its primary and ""pitch black"" night falls, which, it turns out, happens every 22 years (you guessed it, these folks arrived just in time). This is the signal for thousands of winged creatures to issue forth from underground roosts (why do they have wings if they don't come out but once every 22 years? And how does this barren wasteland support thousands of these creatures?) The surface rover is solar powered, so the rest of the film involves the steadily dwindling group toiling to get to the escape shuttle, on foot over open country, with a shaky supply of artificial light to ward off the photophobic creatures. Their hopes are pinned on Riddick (Vin Diesel), who was incarcerated on a prison planet where it was perpetual night and who had his eyes surgically altered to be able to see in the dark. The climax is not the final dash to the shuttle but what happens immediately afterward. The eyeless creatures (created by CGI that is not as good as we have recently become accustomed to in other SF offerings) are a cross between Ridley Scott's Aliens and pterodactyls, and the noises they make are quite unconvincing; they sound like the electronic music soundtrack for ""Forbidden Planet"" rather than the more realistic animal sounds of, say, Jurassic Park. The human characters are more complex than the average SF or action thriller. The two leads, the gorgeous Radha Mitchell and the imposing Vin Diesel, both play highly flawed characters; viewers who note that the film also features Farscape's foxy Claudia Black will be disappointed as she plays only a supporting role and her character's demise is rather gruesome.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Good - Despite the reviews,"My wife and I watched this movie last night, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  This movie received lots of bad reviews, but I think they missed the intent.  This is not a deep thinking science fiction movie.  This is nice effects, cool looking creatures, good sound effects, and a pretty decent cast.  The acting is definitely carried by Vin Diesel; however, since the other characters are (at best) supporting characters - who cares.  If you want sci-fi high cinema, watch 2001.  If you want a good time, watch Pitch Black",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Eh, it could have been much better..","I've seen sci-fi thrillers and I personally thought this one was at the bottom of my list. Yes the acting was great, the animation was great, but certain parts of the movie could have been different.A quick summary: the crew of a huge ship suddenly awakes to find that their ship is going hay-wire. After trying their best to land the ship, the ship crash lands on a seemingly deserted planet. However, as the plot unfolds, they find that they're only real danger is the darkness which is like day time for the evil aliens that live on the planet.My, it sounds like wonderful right? Not entierly true. As the plot unfolds more and more, you only learn about the escaped convict which they rely on to escape. Everyone else, it takes you almost half the movie to learn their name. Some of the characters I didn't even know until the credits rolled by. It gave you no background on the characters except for the ""cop"" and the ""bad guy."" Everyone else is hard to get attached to except for the main character, Fry.Of course, the whole crew of the ship relies on the macho ""bad guy"" to get off the planet. He figures out everything, everyone else follows him almost without questioning him. The characters don't think for themselves except for the very beginning where they are forced to make a choice without him.Well, ""Scariest Sci-Fi Movie of the Year?"" Not really. Although one part made me jump, others made me nervous, and the simply amazing music (no sarcasm there folks ; )) tries to tie it all together it simply doesn't seem to work. I think because of how short the movie seemed, they never had time to build you up as you went through the movie. Perhaps they could have made it so that it goes between night and day and the characters slowly get picked off rather than having a few hours of an eclipse every 22 years. They could have made this movie a lot better.The ending, I hated, because of what the writer of the movie did to a certain main character. If you saw the movie you know what I'm talking about. I hated that part. When movies do that to me, they drop down a few points on my, ""List of best movies"" list.Overall, it was a fine movie. It was not in the least scary. I am a four-teen year old and guess what. I could have fallen asleep if my care for what would happen to the characters did not keep me awake. Do not expect this movie to be a nail-biter. Do not expect that what you think the movie is about, that is what it is about. It isn't. Would I recommend it? Yes...but from there you have to tell me your opinion. 7 of 10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting Sci-fi film.,"Vin diesel, the black dressed guy with black spectacles is appropriate as the convicted guy who silently observes everything giving the final say, retaining his mysterious nature. He is neither bad nor a nice guy but a lead in escaping from dangers of the universe, a world of man hunting creatures. The sci-fi set up is praiseworthy with Vin diesel as the exact cast. Radha Mitchell is also exact to the role fitting at the right place. It's basically a survival film with scientific atmosphere where Vin takes the lead. A well watchable film with action adventure and mysteries all tied together properly.The film is technically good, good presentation, good acting with not much developed characters though. But still it managed to retain the Suspense, avoiding the details of the creatures, showing bit by bit to preserve the thrills. Vin's strategy is cool to watch in leading the entire group towards safety implying his good heart somewhere. He is also disturbed by the black sheep of the team as usual in other stories too.The scene where there is pitch black everywhere and an attempt to illuminate the area through a lighter is one of the best to watch. The whole set up of the film with Vin diesel reminds of the 90s famous 'Hot dog' song by 90s semi metal Band Limbizkit, fitting exactly the sci-fi settings and Vin with his round black spectacles with its hardline tunes. This is seperate from its BGM, which is average I feel.The climax is shown as 3 people out of entire crew surviving the planet. Vin shading tears for the girl seems flawed as he is a type of hard guy with sci-fi mind and an event on far away cosmos with less survival rate. The statement of the believer aiming at Vin saying 'Here is my God' is praiseworthy reply, retaining both visible and invisible aspects of the faiths, respecting the orthodox and secular minds at the same time. The surviving characters are to be understood as the unbeliever, the believer and the little kid implying the innocent. A brilliantly developed sci-fi film with thrilling and interesting plot. A 79 on a scale of 100.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good B-class Movie,"The B-class science-fiction movie is surprisingly good. The plot is simple, and has logic - Survivors of a long distance space crash fight for survival on a three suns planet. They have to face unknown dangers, but also their own characters. Acting is good, violence is never cheap, and the effects prove that you can do a lot with little money. It is worth watching, and better than the sequel('Riddick', after the name of one of the main characters) which was released in 2004. The quality of the cinematography is especially good, from the filtered light of a always lit world to the darkness of an eclipse happening every 22 years. Another interesting and original concept is presenting a group of Muslims in the future - taken into account the stereotypes too often met in recent movies their presence is fresh and different here. Overall, good science-fiction and good action, worth a watch, certainly for the fans of the genre but not only.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
sci fi that's better than shlock,"1. Vin is da bomb. 2. Although Radha was fab in High Art, she doesn't feel right for this role. Too much of a thinking sort.

Nice look to the film: slick visuals, original colorsense. 4. Liked the Allah component. 5. Good scary beasts. Memories of Alien. 6. Intriguing gender commentary. 7.

Deep Blue Sea Meets Lost in Space,"To cut a long story short, this is an OK rental flick, not, in my opinion worth seeing at the movies.Seriously if you loved deep blue sea, you'll probably go for this one too. Whilst some of the direction and plot had originality to it, and the characters were mostly watchable (Vin Diesel notably), I was disappointed that the story which starts out so promisingly in terms of its sense of danger and eerieeness, decays so easily into yer average monster shoot-em-up flick.SEMI-SPOLIERS - It would have been great if the monsters were much more insiduous, intelligent and scheming as a collective in their dealings with the poor trapped humans. That is most significantly why the Alien flicks are truly terrifying and this is just average.It would have been really entertaining if the pitch black of the title led to some greater unseen evil-from-within kinda of thing, but as it is once you've seen the monsters, that's all there is to it.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An interestingly diverse group of people crash land on a planet infested with nocturnal predators...,"This movie was surprisingly good.  The cast, although not super star-filled, was very high in quality and did an excellent acting job, without which, the movie would've been ruined.  Another feature that made this movie a must-see is the superb directing from a man whose name I didn't recognize (sorry). His sharp movement of the camera, captivating and stunning transitional shots, and unique motion clips made this movie one with which the audience can really interact (and not to mention get frightened).  The screen play was great as well, with some twists and unsuspected turns that will keep you failingly anticipating what's to happen next.  This aspect was enhanced due to the lack of stars....without stars, anyone and everyone is fair game to get killed.  This beautiful blend of elements made for a very entertaining and scary movie.  Thanks and good job to all that participated in its production",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cool idea, not so cool execution","There are a lot of people who think this a great sci-fi flick, why is that? Because Vin Diesel flexes his muscles very prominently on screen, because of the cool photography or leading actress Radha Mitchell. Or could it be that they like the idea of the movie and not so much the movie itself.I think this movie is lacking a lot of things, for one: suspense. When you call a movie Pitch Black it might be a wise decision NOT to start the Pitch Blackness 1 hour (!) into the movie and not have the story be dragged on for such a long time. After an hour the audience doesn't care anymore about creatures coming out of the ground because it is now dark. Even the great visual depiction can't help you anymore at this stage.The story starts out with a blast but after that it gets lost in its own desert of improbabilities and impossibilities. If this movie was supposed to be pitch black, then there was an awful lot of ambient lighting in the second part of the movie.A plus is the Unrated Director's Cut DVD. On this DVD Director Twohy has added a number of scenes that were not included in the theatrical release. These scenes clarify the story some, but they don't save the movie, regrettably. This could have been a great movie, let's hope Twohy does a better job next time.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Watching the film 7 years later, it still hits the spot.When a ship carrying 40 passengers, including 1 Vin Diesel, is forced to crash on an unwelcoming alien planet, the 10 shocked survivors find themselves facing unexpected horrors.Vin Diesel is an interesting and enigmatic lead character as Riddick. Supporting Diesel are Radha (""Silent Hill"") Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David and the delightful Claudia (""Farscape"", ""Stargate SG-1"") Black.Containing more than a few surprises along the way, this is a great monster movie with some very memorable scenes.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Predictable but above average sci-fi thriller,"Despite the limited budget the makers managed to pull off a film that had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. Comparison with movies like ""Alien"" are inevitable, but this is different enough to warrant investigation. The characters were all fundamentally flawed and irritating in their own ways but then life's often like that! The aliens were handled well - getting better with each appearance. Acting and cinematographic effects were excellent and the ending wasn't quite as predictable as I'd expected. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good movie,"I don't say surprisingly because I don't like SF movies; more because cheap SF movies tend to be kind of bad -- and they certainly never challenge social norms.But then comes Pitch Black: four Muslim characters who are not terrorists (I'm looking at you, True Lies, and any season of 24), plus, and this is the biggie, a movie that acknowledges that women menstruate! I haven't seen that since ... actually, I've never seen that ever, unless you count embarrassing high school ""Now You Have Become A Woman"" movies.Also, Vin Diesel has never been hotter. Call me shallow, but those arms make me (when I'm not actually menstruating) (ok, I lie, pretty much all the time) those arms make me go squee. I'm only human.Anyhoo, I'm sure that there are people who will compare this movie to Alien, but really, it's completely different, and it's well worth seeing if you enjoy the SF thriller genre, or, indeed, if you just enjoy your basic thriller that's well paced, has hot guys, chicks who kick arse.One small criticism: I felt that it was a little bit anti-Australian. And to be honest, I'm a little tired of the way Australians are portrayed in the movies and in the main stream media. Some of us prefer to de-nasal our accent. And not to die horribly in the first ten minutes. Just saying.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but not great.","Pitch Black benefits from having Vin Diesel in the main role as the anti-hero Richter.  He's smart, he's witty and he could be the next big action hero.  Pitch Black has some nice touches. The bleached out look that the planet has is an interesting touch, not one you usually see in science fiction films.  The creatures are interesting, and I like the idea that they only exist in total darkness.  Rahda Mitchell is gutsy and resourseful as Fry, and as I said before, Diesel is primed to be the next big action hero.  Pitch Black borrows from earlier films, most notably Alien, but it doesn't improve on the formula.  It's a good movie to go see if you want something to do for a few hours.  It doesn't really scare you, but it also doesn't bore you.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worst EVER,"I saw this movie thinking it was going to be either really bad or really good.  Both would have been entertaining.  But it is just plain bad, and boring.  I saw this movie at the 8:00 showing, and fell asleep.  The first half was sooooo boring.  I caught just enough of it to catch the plot.  Then stayed awake for the second half, which made me want to leave the theater.The special effects were decent, but nothing really spectacular.  I could probably do that with several million dollars and a computer.  The coolest parts of the film was when you see through Diesel's eyes, and the monsters' eyes.  Although I have done the special effect of the monsters' vision with Paint Shop Pro, I have not seen it on the movie screen.  In fact, it looked like they just used PSP to get all of their visual effects.The rest of the movie was shoddy.  The one-liners were not that great (sometimes movies have some real winners, which this movie did not have), the plot sucked, the sub-plots were pretentious, and the story has been done.  It could have been such a cool movie if it had better directing, writing, editing, cinematography, visuals, etc.  In fact, I would not wish this movie on my worst enemy (although I could stomach forcing them to watch Deep Impact or Kazaam or Leonard Part 6 until they died) simply because it was so painful.  I kept hoping for a good ending, but it never came.Also, why were the day time visuals so washed out?  Was it just to create a contrast to the dark?  It was so pointless.  At least in Three Kings, the visuals were meant to look like a Xerox copy because of the news prints, and such.  This did not have a reason to look like that except it was a bad Xerox copy of other better movies.  Vin Diesal had potential in his role, but it was never reached.  Also, I should have drank some of the alcohol that they burned for fuel to get through this movie.  Snore!----------------------------1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Man, I've never heard this one: points for creativity there.  You're bashing the director for giving us creature vision.  For god's sake, he only does it 3 times, and nowhere near to the effect of Daredevil or Predator.  Basically, you are saying that the director should sit passively by, with his thumb up his crack, and leave out special effects in a SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE.  Are you looking for something innovative?  Maybe like, showing us crotch cams every 30 seconds just so they could be first?Now, I know that not everyone will agree on whether this movie is above-par for the genre or not.  Just go into it with open eyes, and push away your bias and pointless criticism.  I swear to you I could pick apart any movie out there based on minor unimportant details and use that as my sole argument for it sucking - but that just doesn't cut it.This movie is very formula in some parts.

"Not great, but not a bad rental.","There was nothing particularly brilliant nor bad about this movie.  I borrowed the DVD from a friend and watched it late one Saturday night and found it entertaining.  There was a cool visual feel that sucked me in right away and the script and direction actually did a very good job at creating an eerie alien world.  It reminded me of the world that Riddley Scott created in the first Aliens.  You don't know very much about the world, but you know enough to let your imagination fill in the oh so creepy AND curious details.  Its rare these days that a movie actually assumes you have some imagination and even rarer that it tries to engage it!  Case in point, some characters don't speak English. Instead of giving them bad accents or putting up subtitles, the director intentionally keeps you in the dark.  You don't really need to know that `ensign green #1' says to `ensign green #2', `I am scared.'  `Yes, me too.' Instead, the director relies on the actors to *emote* that, and again, your mind fills in the details-far more effective.I am not really a big fan of Diesel, and knew nothing about the supporting cast.  But they could actually act!  Even the minor characters played their `ensign green' roles well.  You know that all the characters will not make it and many will die in a morally `appropriate manner' and I get annoyed at films that try to kid us about this little fact.  The film generally does a good job not trying to play this silly game.Overall the film is more horror than Sci-Fi but it did a good job of creating tension and is worth a rental.

The film has a group of space flighters, including a convict (played by Vin Diesel in his least performance on the chain, but only because the other ones in Saving Private Ryan, Iron Giant and Boiler Room were classics)  and a muslim (Keith David) and a woman (Randha Mitchell).  On the planet, things are quiet in light, pretty barron, but in the dark, things come out.

Nice Shine Job,"There were outer-space ghoul stories before ""Alien"" (""Space: 1999"" had a few) and since (""Event Horizon""). Most of them are pretty bad and ""Pitch Black,"" which is utterly unoriginal, could easily have been, too. Instead it's a cool, character-driven yet action-packed, dark thriller. An interplanetary space transport crashes on a desert planet with 3 suns and apparently perpetual daylight. Like ""Alien,"" the film begins by exploring the handful of survivors. Like ""Lifeboat,"" it gradually divulges that some of them have things to hide. Not Riddick (Diesel), an escaped murderer being returned to prison by bounty hunter Johns (Hauser, effectively icy & sleazy). When perpetual day suddenly turns to perpetual night, the creepy-crawlies come out to kill, rend & chow down on Fresh Human. To survive, the others must accept Riddick, who is tougher than all of them and has had a prison ""shine job"" on his eyes that lets him see in the dark. But Riddick must also overcome the hatred he has for all of his own kind, a rage that he covers under a cool, wry facade of independence. Will Riddick eventually sacrifice the others to ensure his own survival, or maybe even just for one universal up-yours to the human race? Diesel has a star-making role, making a repugnant character sympathetic, giving us fleeting glimpses of Riddick's sadness & loneliness while never, ever detracting from his granite-souled strength. Several other actors have more work to do in this film than most action flicks, but they are all up to the task. The guilt-ridden pilot Fry (Mitchell), a dark, refreshing break from the butt-kicking babe stereotype begun with ""Charlie's Angels,"" holds the others together while Riddick comes & goes. Mitchell has a steeliness & style that belies her blonde cuteness and holds up well opposite both the brawny, in-your-face Diesel & the taut, cool Hauser. David, as a Muslim space pilgrim, brings religious faith (""Because you do not believe in God, does not mean God does not believe in you"") to counter the others' anger, despair or wry selfishness (""Look to thine own ass first""). The dark, percussion-heavy score is perfect for ""Pitch Black's"" visual effects, which are somewhat less spectacular than recent ""Star Wars"" but more effective, a background rather than a replacement for the action. ""Pitch Black"" is as entertaining as any old Saturday matinée, much better suited to our know-it-all times, without the condescension & stereotyping to which Hollywood is usually so devoted.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vin Diesel versus aliens,"""Pitch black"" isn't a cheap imitation of ""Alien"" . Is it inspired by Ridley Scott movie ? Yes (look at the ship design and the creatures design).

It isn't exactly original , but it's well done to give us enjoyable movie.The director David Twohy beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself . The movie is well paced and has some ""wow"" moments and a heart as well. It switches from drama to action to horror very naturally.The special effects are more than adequate, despite the fact that this movie didn't had a big budget.Along with Fast and furious"" this is Vin Diesel's most known movie . A star is born ? Yes. Vin Diesel acts really well in the role as Riddick – an anti-hero bad-ass convict. He's got a magnetic presence. And Diesel doesn't trivialize the character, as could so easily be done, by giving him a ""heart of gold"" .We also have other interesting characters with unique quirks and mannerisms such as Lewis Fitz Gerald antiques dealer , Imam (Keith David) the Muslim guy , pilot Fry (great Radha Mitchell ) , Johns the cop , Jack the boy . Every character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad.The relationships between the characters are interesting and the movie is a good sci-fi drama driven by the characters.A really solid , emotional , and not stupid piece of entertainment .

a limited success on a meager budget,"Screenwriter and director David Twohy has made a career out of crafting challenging, well-mounted science fiction films via limited means. With this somewhat derivative but enjoyable action thriller, he nearly succeeds. Most of the casting in Pitch Black is by type and thus instantly forgettable, though given the story's haunted-house horror movie structure, this is probably by design. The film is anchored by Radha Mitchell and the strutting, grunting Vin Diesel, relative newcomers who prove their mettle on the big screen with reflective performances marked by detailed, intuitive choices. As he did with Warlock (1988), Disaster in Time (1992), and The Arrival (1996), Twohy takes what was intended to be a straight-to-video genre potboiler and transforms the project into something at least a cut above other examples of its type. Unfortunately, in all of these projects, the writer/director is at times overcome by shoestring budgets that hamstring his creative efforts to impress visually.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ironic?,"I personally thought this movie was riddled with amazing coincidences and horrible acting. The movie starts out with a space ship taking off with a monstrous criminal on board (Riddick). The trip is going OK until they crash land on a planet that seems deserted. However, they find out that the planet is rare in the fact that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the entire planet turns pitch black. Seems believable...... until they realize there also happen to be hundreds of aliens that thrive in darkness living on the planet - ironic? Well, that's possible too, until you factor in the chances that they happen to be on the planet right as the eclipse happens - which is a .0037% chance..... Oh, and one more thing..... Riddick has a rare talent - he is one of few people in the history of the universe that can see in the dark and must lead them to safety. - Yes, this is a science fiction movie, but I felt the story was written very poorly, with outlandish ideas and it wasn't helped by the horrendous acting by Diesel and his fellow co-actors.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Asimov's Nightfall with a few monsters thrown in for screams...,"I loved the concept when I read Asimov's story Nightfall. In that, Asimov writes about how an entire planet's population goes crazy when night descends on the planet with 6 suns due to a simultaneous multiple eclipse of all its suns. This film uses the core idea of a planet with multiple suns falling into darkness once every 22 years. (Asimov's story had night descend on the planet every few millenia or so).For a few screams, the writers threw in a few million light-hating, flesh-eating things (that look like the aliens monsters brought out of retirement) and you have the film Pitch Black. The characters crash land on the planet just as the eclipse is about the occur and they have to find fuel for their ship before they get eaten by the thingies. Period.On the positive side, the characters don't indulge in the usual clichés one expects in such a flick. There are no unnecessary love issues or melodramatic displays. The acting is not Oscar material but suffices. There is a sequence where a ringed planet obscures the suns causing the multiple eclipse. It's very nicely done.

"Good, effective Sci-Fi/Thriller...","We begin with the standard view of a ship drifting through space. A voice-over gives us a little background as we're slowly taken into the ship. Comet fragments begin piercing the hull(and one or two people) and the cryogenicly frozen crew is woken. So begins the ship's decent. During that decent the pilot(Mitchell) attempts to jettison the passenger section in order to land safely, but a malfunction prevents her from doing so. Nevertheless, they manage to make a rather ugly emergency landing(played out with awesome visual effects). The Captain is one of the unfortunate souls who dies in the crash. Now that everything's calming down, the passengers begin to assess their situation(not at all promising). Given that the planet has three suns(it's a giant desert, basically), some of them set out looking for water and stumble upon an abandoned mining outpost. A survey turns up no signs of life, just a lot of solar powered machinery and another(functioning) ship. Obviously they have a way off the planet. Kind of odd, though. Why would someone prep an evac ship and then abandon it?The setup is probably the greatest asset of ""Pitch Black"". A standard Sci-Fi plot, heightened by the pacing of Twohy and a few genuine people mixed in with the fodder, is all it takes to create a good, if unexceptional, Thriller.As I mentioned, the setup is superb, building tension by developing the current and forthcoming situations. For instance, the clues to the miners' disappearing: the final update in the research logs occurring 22yrs ago; the mobile that shows the alignment of the planets to be a 22yr cycle; the preped ship; the numerous animal carcasses scattered about. They all lead one to the conclusion that the miners didn't simply disappear, and that whatever happened 22yrs ago is about to happen again.The films only major fallback is the hyper-active camera movement of Twohy. I don't know about you, but I got tired of it during the crash, but that's not to say he doesn't do a good job of putting the film together. On the contrary, he paces everything perfectly. He does a wonderful job with the latter half, where all the action is shrouded in darkness. The problem is, he doesn't change his tactics much in the light. Though there are some impressive visuals(kudos to Eggby for the beautiful coloring) Twohy never seems to take full advantage of his landscape. This is just a difference of artistic opinion, though. The only real complaint I have is the sometimes shaky camera work. It's become a trend of the Action genre in recent years and I don't care for it. Used sparingly, it can work, but constant use(like the crash) looks haphazard.The final examination is of the actors and their characters. To be honest, I don't expect much from this genre in terms of acting, but every once in a while I'm pleasantly surprise. This is one of those times. The majority of the cast is expendable, so their characters aren't given any attention. On the other hand, there's the three leads, Mitchell, Diesel, and Hauser. Mitchell was willing to kill the passengers at the beginning of the film and she's faced with a similar choice later. Diesel plays a murderer who wants to get out alive as much as everyone else. It's not the typical ""bad guy turned good guy"" scenario we've seen countless times before. Instead, we have man who's struggling with the idea of leaving the rest of them to die, or risking his own life and it's not as predictable as you'd think. Last, we have Hauser, a drug addicted bounty hunter who's caught Diesel after chasing him for years. Their history will come into play, as well.All together, ""Pitch Black"" is worth at least a matinee viewing. If nothing else you're going to enjoy it. Good Sci-Fi films are rare these days and it'd be a shame to miss this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"How long should a tri solar eclipse last, anyway?","Apparently, longer than it takes to finish a movie.  This movie tries hard to rise above the cookie cutter alien clone genre of sci-fi films, and to a certain degree it succeeds.  It does succeed thanks to its beautiful artistic vision and artistic direction.  But, its artistic merits rest atop a script that relies too much on some very traditional and tiresome sci-fi plots.The acting, especially the transported criminal played by Van Diesel (who has a great voice for the part) is above average.  The special effects have some novel and quite interesting approaches to portraying an alien world with three suns.  Artistic direction gets very high marks, several scenes seemed to be almost framed and contain a certain attention to detail that is rare today.  The aliens themselves are also very interesting, if a bit derivative from Aliens.  Although, we never do get a real clear look at them, but this ends up working well since it lets the imagination of the viewer fill in the details.Overall, a very good attempt a making a worthy derivation of the classic aliens genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"average sci-fi flick, could be better","i watched this movie in the midst of my finals cramming... which is probably a mistake... because about 40 minutes into the movie i was already glancing impatiently at my biology book wondering why i picked this movie as my study break... and thinking how my time could be so much better spent reading and doing problem sets.well... the movie was pretty exciting and intense near the end.  the beginning was somewhat slow...  there wree some parts that were annoying... like why did they have to make Fry die at the end?  it could have been a happy ending if she made it. also i didn't get why the raptors started killing each other (when their blue blood started dripping all over the place)i think they could have developed the characters better.  i didn't feel much sympathy for any of the main characters.  i especailly hated that Johns guy. therefore, i don't feel much urge to watch the sequels (The Chronicles of Riddick).if you're bored... or a fan of vin diesel, then this movie is worth watching.  it's not that bad... Practical Magic, however, is the most worthless piece of crap and is the baseline by which i measure all other movies.i give this movie 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The biggest surprise since the Matrix -- this movie rocks.,"What is there to say, really? Before this movie even came out, people were comparing it to Aliens. Well, in keeping with that trend, this movie makes Aliens look like a flying turd -- and I love Aliens. This movie was made on a modest budget - but you can't even tell! The special effects are as good as I've ever seen. The actors are all rock solid -- Vin Diesel's ""Riddick"" is by far the coolest movie character since Neo or Darth Maul. This movie will become acknowledged as a sci fi classic in years to come. See it immediately! I'm going again tonight!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was pleasantly surprised.,"Having seen the coming attractions for Chronicles of Riddick and learning that the main character is based upon the main character in Pitch Black, I rented it having never heard of it.  Never expecting much from Vin Diesel, I was very surprised to have really enjoyed the movie.  In some ways reminiscent of Tremors, I thought the story was gripping, character development was better than average, direction was excellent, and Vin actually brought some credibility to the character.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining,"This movie was more entertaining than I expected.  The basic premise -- a starship runs into trouble, crash lands on an alien planet, and the crew is eaten one-by-one by the locals -- is hardly original, but the execution is good and the result doesn't feel cliched.  The movie maintains tension throughout and manages to shock occasionally, something horror movies often find hard to do these days.The characters are more interesting and have a little more depth than usual. Radha Mitchell does a good job of conveying the vulnerability of the pilot, though she does seem a little miscast at times (isn't she a little too, well, blond for this kind of movie?).  Vin Diesel has a lot of on-screen charisma, although his character is a too unflappable to convey the emotion that would have made the ending stronger.  Nevertheless, I thought it worked.  Perhaps the director didn't want the movie to be /too/ dark.I could quibble about the world conveyed here -- why, for example, is there a breathable amount of oxygen in the air without plants or seas to maintain it?  What do all the predators eat?  And what do they do in-between eclipses -- watch cable TV?  Why does that gas giant have two sets of rings and how does the second one stay in orbit at a higher latitude (not inclination) than the equator?  (Or did I miss-see something in the effects?)  That said, this movie still doesn't strain credulity the way others have.  The visual and lighting effects convey an effective sense of being on another planet (as opposed to, say, being in Queensland Australia).  The aliens are mercifully unhumanoid and even appear to have complex behaviors other eating starship crewmen.So if the previews for ""Mission to Mars"" had you psyched for an SF movie, skip that one and go to this instead -- you'll be less likely to be disappointed.  I actually felt like seeing it a second time, though at $8.50, it's hard to justify.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A ""could have been great"" movie!","I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be a rather typical special effects sci-fi flick trying to get money without having to write much of a script.  To my surprise I was right for the most part, but there was something in the movie that made it a lot better than the regular no plot sci-fi movies. Usually I dont go to Sci-Fi movies for the direction but the way this movie was directed intrigued me.  The lighting was perfect, there were many cool shots and camera views, and great integration of special effects and characters.  Which brings me to the characters in the movie...they were great.  It would have been nice to get some more character development for most of them but the ones that did get some charcater development made terrific characters...and the actors did well playing their characters which helps.  Van Diesel especially...I'm sure we'll be hearing from him in many more movies in the coming years. So much potential in this movie that just didnt get used at all.  At the end it felt like it was just a bunch of stuff that happened.  I didnt see a point in it...nothing really tied in to anything else.  I gave it a weary 6/10 because it did intrigue me...and I suggest that if you really like Sci-Fi you should check it out.  Otherwise it would probably be a good idea to see the re-release of American Beauty instead!>(8(l)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"one of the worst ever- bad effects, acting and filming","I went into this movie with high expectations. The trailer wasn't all that, but you know...trailers suck most of the time... The idea overall was pretty good, but it never gets really accomplished. What we are left with are two main stories, the people against themselves and the people against the aliens. If they'd stick with the one against the aliens and develop it a bit more, I'm sure we'd see something A LOT better. The acting sucks, the effects blow, and the first 30 minutes lick. I have no idea how this got greenlighted and I have no clue why this didn't go straight to video. I advise you to wait for when it comes to primetime TV... I definetaly think this is the worst movie after Message in a Bottle. If you ever go to the movie theater and you think about seeing this, go see something like Scream 3, The Beach or Hanging Up, I'm sure you'll have a blast!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
who can you trust when the killing starts?,"We follow a group of around nine people trying to survive on a hostile planet where they have crashed with their spaceship. Among them is a prisoner, played by Vin Diesel, who they fear and at the same time have to depend upon as the story develops and this makes the group-dynamic very interesting to follow. They have no chance but to trust him and still they become anxious every time he is out of sight. The fight for survival has been made with a lot of suspense and the little group faces a lot of challenges which they try to solve in the best possible way. On the planet they have crashed upon, they discover a former colony of humans that apparently was abandoned in a hurry so along with the fight for survival comes the effort to try and answer all the questions as to what happened here?I think that this movie is beyond any comparison much better than the sequel. If treated in a competent way the ""survival""-theme is always interesting to follow especially if it is combined with the possibilities and challenges of being in a group. Should I rely on the group or should I only trust myself? Should I try to become the leader or should I accept that somebody else is trying to impose leadership on the group? There are many nuances to describe in the theme of ""survivel with the group"" and I think that ""Pitch Black"" pulls this off in a both entertaining and plausible (if you accept the basic principles of the story) way.Regards SimonPs.

Predictable but above average sci-fi thriller,"Despite the limited budget the makers managed to pull off a film that had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. Comparison with movies like ""Alien"" are inevitable, but this is different enough to warrant investigation. The characters were all fundamentally flawed and irritating in their own ways but then life's often like that! The aliens were handled well - getting better with each appearance. Acting and cinematographic effects were excellent and the ending wasn't quite as predictable as I'd expected. Recommended.Ian",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good action,"This is good action, nothing less, nothing more. The first 3rd is MTV-like and can almost be mistaken for the commercials if you are watching it on cable.

Most of the plot is totally unbelievable, but it's OK for the mental popcorn it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great production design; uninteresting plot,"We haven't seen a really fine sci-fi flick in the better part of a year (since THE MATRIX [1999]), so my expectations were rather high for this one. After all, one of my sci-fi faves, THE ARRIVAL (1996), was made by the same director. While the cinematography and production design are excellent and even plow new fields of creativity, the all-important plot is just a monsters-in-the-dark rehash. The skillful editing gives the film a nice artistic edge, but sometimes it is so jumpy that it is impossible to follow what is going on. Still, the crash scene at the beginning of the film is outstanding, perhaps the best crash scene in sci-fi cinema to date, the relatively low budget notwithstanding.The film flirts with scientific plausibility, but deviances therefrom are jarring. For one thing, an eclipsing gas giant would not be dark against a bright sky. Since the brightness of the sky is a nearby phenomenon due to light scattering by the atmosphere, all you would see of the eclipsing object, if anything, would be a thin crescent, and perhaps some highlights from the rings, as slightly brighter structures against the sky. From a biologist's standpoint, the ecology of a planet that supports a substantial biomass of large predators with little or no vegetation makes no sense. Doesn't anyone ever think about these things?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pitch Black is salvaged by some excellent ideas and Vin Diesel!,"I have just gotten back from my local multiplex and after seeing it all I can say is that before seeing it, recognize that what you are about to see is no sci-fi classic.  That being said, it's also important to note that Pitch Black is still a very entertaining ride, even if you don't remember why you liked it after the film.This film, directed by David Twohy (The Arrival), has a very good concept but it is executed in a way that makes the film fall below what it should have been.  The film has an odd mix of trying to flesh out each and every one of the characters while trying to keep the momentum of the film going.  Suffice it to say, that doesn't work to well, at least not in the context of this film.Unfortunately I missed the first ten minutes of the movie, due to the fact that I was in line picking up a large soda, who knows those 10 minutes might affect my review, but I doubt it.  When I got into the theatre, the main vessel carrying the cast of this film had just crash-landed onto a barren planet and the passengers were just noticing their surroundings. It appears that the ship was carrying passengers to the ""New Civilization"" in addition to carrying a maximum prison escapee Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), but because of the crash, everything is messed up.  The new captain, Fry (Radha Mitchell), is very unwilling to fulfil her newly appointed post, the officer that captured Riddick, Johns (Cole Hauser) is a hot-tempered morphine addict, and the aforementioned Riddick has escaped. Not soon after the crash, there is a huge twist.  One of the crew members goes to explore a suspicous cave, and gets killed by something that isn't human.  This begins to bring a whole new slant to things in the film and it introduces the nocturnal, carnivorous aliens.  Even worse, to benefit the nocturnal aliens and to horrify the crew members, it has been 22 years since the last eclipse on the planet, and therefore, its about time for another one.  From here on in everything goes crazy.  The aliens appear on the surface, an allegience (or is it?) with Riddick must be made, and something has to be done to get off the planet before everyone gets killed.I'll hand it to Twohy and Ken Wheat, the concept of the film is very good.  On the other hand the direction of Twohy is very lopsided, the first 20 minutes are trying to flesh out characters and setup the rest of the flim, but it is a series of bizarre shots and milling around.  From the first attack on, the film loses the look it had for the first twenty minutes and becomes a run of the mill action film, but with some very cool set pieces.  The same could be said for Wheat's screenplay, which is lopsided throughout the whole film, giving some excellent lines to the truly menacing Vin Diesel, or giving cornball one-liners to the various others.  The acting on the whole doesn't benefit the film either.  Radha Mitchell, last seen in the great Ally Sheedy film High Art, gives a performance that could be comparble to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley from the ""Alien"" films.  Cole Hauser, from Good Will Hunting, is the dark law official who gives the deepest performance of the film, but that isn't saying much.  Far and away, the best performance in the film is Vin Diesel's.  Well actually, it's really just the character that Vin plays that makes him standout, along with his gravelly voice and incredible strength.  All in all, Diesel's Riddick is one of the most indelible sci-fi characters in quite a while,possibly since Schwarzeneggers Terminator.My final say on this film is that it is recommended to someone who wants to be entertained by a movie that doesn't make one think that much, but to just witness explosions and violence.  I would say to catch this film at a matinee bargain price, but it could be enjoyed just the same if you waited for it to hit DVD or VHS.My Rating : 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unexpectedly good sci-fi.,"""Finally found something worse than me, huh?.""I'm somewhat of a rabid Radha Mitchell fan (the woman is gorgeous and talented; she should be a much bigger star), so seeing her in a solid, gritty sci-fi/horror flick like this is a pretty good use of two hours for me.The basic story is about a transport ship (piloted by Mitchell's character) that is forced to crash land on an unknown planet. A planet that happens to be inhabited by deadly, light- sensitive predators that come out to feast every twenty-two years when a cosmic event shields the planet from its three suns for a time. One of the passengers of the ship also happens to be a deadly, light-sensitive predator (Vin Diesel) on his way back to the maximum-security prison world that he escaped from. The rest of the crash survivors are forced to rely on Riddick because of his ability to see in the dark and his natural survival instincts, but will he ultimately help them escape, or leave them to their dark fates?Pitch Black isn't perfect. There are a few rather large plot holes (What do the beasts do for the rest of the twenty-two years, just hang out? And what do they live off of on such a barren planet?), but nothing that really took me out of the story. Some of the characters are overly dumb, annoying, or inexplicably antagonistic, but such story devices and character archetypes come along with the genre, more often than not. The special effects and monster designs do look their age, but that can be forgiven in a movie that's more than eleven years old, and they're really not any worse than what you'd see today on the average made-for-TV sci-fi flick. On the other hand, the filmmakers did do a good job of using visual trickery to make the outback of Australia where the movie was filmed look a lot like a harsh, alien world, and on a small budget I'm assuming. So they get props for that.As for what I liked about Pitch Black, it was a pretty entertaining ride. Mitchell was great as the flawed, conflicted pilot unceremoniously promoted to leader, and Diesel was well- suited for Riddick, who's really the main character of the movie. There are likable characters to get attached to and fear for, several tense situations (though calling the movie scary would be a stretch), and a solid amount of action.All in all, Pitch Black was a pleasant surprise. I was more impressed with Diesel than I've been at any other movie of his that I've seen, and none of the lesser elements of the movie are significant enough to stand out much.

"Irritating, boring, noisy, worthless, nothing to recommend it !","I know it's ""stylish"" to like and praise the ""actor"" Vin Diesel but this flick is just a mess with or without him. It started out with a voice-over that I could not understand: mumbled, low speech that was unclear. The titling was in a typeface very difficult to read. The sound effects were loud and noisy, over-blown, accompanied by flashing lights in an apparent attempt to impress (ho-hum). The photography is silly, presumably the director was trying for some kind of imagined artistic effect. Looked as though he'd used the wrong kind of film stock and/or put incorrect filters on the camera lens. Forget ""acting"", what a shambles!

The Best of it's kind since Aliens.,"What amazes me about this movie is that none of it's creators have much of a filmography. The Director has not done much that was great, G.I. Jane makes a statement about sexes obviously, Womens rights etc, and Waterworld is just one of a mob of Costner glorifiers. The writers are the ones you would least expect to be credited with this, they are veterans of trash like 'It Came From Outer Space', 'Nightmare On Elm Street 376', sorry it was the fourth that they catered for and 'The Fly 2'.The premise fits well with thier rep but the characters and the style are way above. Riddick is an elastic and artificially nocturnal crim, the other guy is a back staving mercenary and good old Caroline is a humane ships captain. Them and a few others are caught on a planet and must get a ship space-worthy as time and personnel numbers dwindle. Yeah that's been done, so has pretty much every avenue movies can take nowadays, but the relationships are what make this one soar. Riddick steals the show, he is just too cool for the others to have a hope. A kind of 'survival of the fittest' logic makes him tick but without even realising it her humanity starts to rub off on him. A by appearance respectable mercenary needs to get him off the planet alive to collect a bounty but Riddick is more than just formidable by appearance, he also has a keen, self-dependant and crafty mind at work, how long can the man who would cross him last.Then to the Aliens setup. When getting thier bearings the team stumbles upon a couple of undesirable chamelion-like predators beneath the surface, surveying the remains of the previous tenants they start to realise what they are dealing with, the first bomshell comes when they realise that the planet is about to line up for an eclipse that could last from hours to weeks, the problem is that these predators one weakness is light and they are about to re-enter the hunting ground, the team could well be sliced in less time than the minimum duration of the eclipse. Theres plenty of thrillers out nowadays that you can dismiss on appearance, this isn't one. Vin Diesel is on the short road to stardom, this movie is why. You'll be happy to know all you fans that the director and Diesel are getting together for a follow up, dealing mainly with Riddick. I am astounded at the 6.6 rating this movie is on, I sense opinion changed after 'The Fast And The Furious' hit screens, lets work on flipping that.10/10",,Anonymous,Horror

Enjoyable cult film that benefits from a low budget,"this film is tense, well written (especially by genre standards) and infused with enough action to make it all work. i'm glad the film was a low-budge effort, as it forced the screen writers to focus on the human interaction and the situation rather than over do it with cgi monsters. sure the beasties look dated by today's standards (and looked dated at the time this came out actually), but by the time we actually see them we don't care, as we are engrossed by the very basic but well fleshed out plot. decent performances by relatively unknown actors, including hauser and the woman who played the pilot, added to the appeal, while the increasingly odious vin deisel was at his best here (probably because he kept his mouth shut most of the time, a lesson that most actions heroes would do well to learn.) i give pitch black a 75%, and urge sci-fi/action fans to seek it out as it is sure to become a cult classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Delivers exactly what you want and expect from this type of film,"As far as sci-fi/actions films go, Pitch Black is solid and enjoyable.  The effects are pretty good, some of the characters are okay (though a few are pretty terrible and you find yourself hoping that the cast is eaten in order of acting talent, which is exactly what happens) and there is a sufficient amount of suspense to keep the thing running.If you forgive a few of the fairly major plot holes (eg1: the odds of arriving on a planet on the exact day of a solar eclipse which occurs once every 16 years.....; eg2: it's a scientifc impossibility for just one form of life to live on a planet - once they've eaten everything else, they can't just survive by eating eachother (as suggested in the film)) you'll enjoy this film.

delicious thriller,"As a dyed in the wool sci fi fan it has been years since I've seen anything come out of the Hollywood machine that was so smart and spine tingly at the same time (Carpenter's The Thing comes to mind). The CGI is great - mostly seamless, Diesel is a real sexy anti-hero and the dialogue really keeps things moving. Vin Diesel is a rare one that can pull off the stunts of an action sci fi thriller and not come across as a large block of wood with a toothy smile. I went after this movie when it came out following the career of Claudia Black from Farscape and found a new favorite in Diesel - but still waiting to see Black in a more substantial role. Now all that being said no film is without flaws and if you have watched enough sci fi or horror then the 'plot twist' at the end was lined up for us from the beginning but I for one didn't care in that I fell hook line and sinker for Riddick and wanted to find out what he would and wouldn't do and it was such a delicious way to get there. I'm greatly looking forward to Chronicles of Riddick and if you have the where with all to follow a character and not just a blockbuster then go check out Dark Fury too. It is a great segway and though brief is a good character study.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Thrilling work,"Vin Diesel as Richard Riddick is very convincing in this film, which starts a series of two, and hopefully there will be trequel to this. The movie is very well done, with excellent sceneries, great tension, smart plot and excellent suspense all the way through. Several people survive on a planet and start a bloody fight against horrible man-eating flying creatures, merciless and cruel. Nothing new? Well, Riddick makes it very fresh and upbeat. He is cool, strong, cynical and very clever. He is not daunted or haunted, he acts in cold blood and his actions seem cruel at first, but then it is him who saves at least three people and helps them escape the bad place that they had landed on. Vin Diesel proves that he is a good drama actor and not simply a strong guy with muscles. He does play and does that admirably well. Good work, smart and clever.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
More than meets the eye,"At first glance, Pitch Black seems to be just another sci-fi horror flick. However, when you dig a little deeper, you can see that there's a lot more to this film than appears at first glance. Pitch Black is a story about humanity itself. It shows us one of the truest glances into the depths of human nature we've ever been given in popular culture: when people are pushed to their limits, there's nothing that won't do to survive, but they will *only* survive if they work together. Though the plot is a little lacking (and a bit cheesy at times), the filmography is wonderful. The cameras are used in much the same way as a master artist uses their brush - as a means to make the viewer see what was going on in their head. Pitch Black's camera styles range from jerky, blurred action shots - often shooting back and forth between the eyes of two people - to sharply-contrasted color-toned shots of the harsh desert climate. The movie is, quite simply put, beautiful. I give Pitch Black a solid ten out of ten. Not only is it one of my personal favorites, but it's an excellent film as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oops -- WOW! -- Oops.,"Pitch Black opens with a long, slo-mo shot of a spaceship gliding by the camera.  Oops #1: obvious Star Wars rip-off.  It then presents us with a most improbable crash scene, in which the force of the landing blows out the ship's windshield but leaves the pilot remarkably unscathed.  Oops #2.  The crash scene is edited with MTV-on-Speed cuts, which are both impossible to follow and headache-inducing.  Oops #3.  By the time the spaceship actually touched down, I was regretting losing $4 on this movie.Fortunately, things pick up speed in the middle.  The visuals are gorgeous -- our heroes are on a planet with three suns, and the scenes are filmed in gorgeous washed-out blue and gold tones.  The deceptively calm surface of the planet serves as a backdrop for introducing and fleshing out characters, who are all given more depth than your average cheap sci-fi cast.  The tension climaxes with a gorgeous triple eclipse and the awakening of the underground dwellers of the planet, who look like a cross between Ridley Scott's Alien and a hammerhead shark.  As the characters scurried around huddling behind their meager and failing light sources, bickering with each other, the suspense was thick enough that it was hard to breathe.Unfortunately, the last half hour abandons any notion of story arc or plot in favor of killing of characters at random and twisting the plot in improbable directions.  The most interesting character, Vin Diesel's hulking homicidal maniac, is reduced to arm-wrestling the aliens and spouting Batman and Robin quality dialog.  By the last twist and the by-the-numbers ending, I was disappointed in the movie again.Out of the movie's two hours, the middle hour is great and the surrounding hour is average to horrid.  50% is generally an F, but for the great visuals I'll give it a C.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
worst movie of 2000 (so far),"first off, i'm not a huge sci-fi fan, but i do love star trek tng.  my major problem with sci fi is the fact that it operates in an entirely unique universe than ours, and you have to be introduced to a whole new world and set of rules, ect.  which is exactly why this movie made me want to throw things at the screen.  throughout the whole movie, i kept asking why...why were these vastly different characters on the ship, why was there a criminal aboard, where were they going...the movie leaps from plot points without letting the audience in on the story, which leads me to believe the plot is so outrageous, they couldn't explain why things were the way they were.  or maybe the plot is so non-existant they just wanted to throw some neat scenes and one-liners on the screen.  as far as the acting, i found it lacking...the unknowns seemed to be generic versions of the big hollywood players (not that that would have saved the movie).  but of course, after reading all these raves about the movie, i wonder if it's simply because i'm not a sci-fi fan i can't appreciate it.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not for the usual reasons,"The creatures were not very impressive, and hey what did they live on in between eclipses?And who couldn't guess which one was going to be the hero in the first one minute?And there was way f*ing too much f*ing bad f*ing language. Really tough, really mean, really scary does not rely on schoolground swearing. Perhaps most moviegoers only understand eleven words with one being f* and the other c*, but I don't believe it. I think that most people are better than that and it's time that movie makers recognised the f*ing fact!What the film really did have going for it - which impressed me very much - were three things.Firstly, it relied on the age old rule that what you *dont* see frightens you most.Secondly, the use of light (before the eclipse!) gave a more alien look to the planet than anything I have ever seen before. It was almost black and white - hard light that we just don't see here. It didn't look like a studio, or Mexico (or even Coober Pedy!).Thirdly, we were presented with a 'holy man' who was not a standard Christian eccentric or magically endowed Indian Guru. A plain simple Muslim Iman who lived by his beliefs but didn't attempt to murder, terrorize or convert anyone, nor attempt to exorcise the monster devils, nor to worship them. Just an example of one of the worlds population in the wrong place at the wrong time.So I think it was an interesting film, but not for the usual reasons. Not for the plot which was predictable, not for the writing (which mostly was adequate) and not for the effects (which were relatively unimpressive). No, I 'liked' the film because I could really believe it was another planet, because I could believe in the creatures (till I saw them!) and because it highlighted that the things we *are* afraid of, may not necessarily be the things we *should* be worrying about.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Nothing Outstanding, but a Very Enjoyable Sci-Fi,","Pitch Black is a good movie with a good storyline and a very talented cast that suit their characters very well.While his acting is certainly nothing fantastic,I always really like Vin Diesel in films,his characters always suit his manly personality perfectly and Riddick is no exception,he is a very interesting character that develops well throughout this movie.The movie is also action packed from start to finish,and though the long action sequences too take you away from the story several times,there really enjoyable and shouldn't be a huge issue anyone who enjoys action films.Pitch Black is certainly not an outstanding movie and it's pretty forgetful,but you'll enjoy the ride and I would recommend watching it for fun if your a fan of sci-fi or action movies.A ship that transports criminals crash on a planet filled with dangerous creatures,and must work together to survive before it is possible to leave this planet.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why Couldn't this film have been any better?,"This is one of those films that has so much potential that never gets fully developed throughout the film. You have a few darned good actors such as Keith David and Vin Diesel, and a script that isn't sure where it wants to go or what it wants to grow up and be. There is a sequel coming out to this and for the first time, I can say, I am looking forward to the sequel....that is...in hopes that it covers the areas that were so missed in this film: Character development, story development. Now, don't get me wrong, the film wasn't terrible, but you just watch it and at some point you say...""Huh. What happened there? There's gotta be more of an explanation to this."" or ""Why did they resort to this cheap ploy?"" I liked the eerie backdrop quality of the film, they should have stayed consistant with that. My complaints were that I saw parts of ""Aliens"" parts of ""Mission to Mars""--parts of other sci-fi ""buddy-pick off cast-terrible guy with heart of gold"" films that were thrown into this film where there was no need. The production and writing crew should have been stronger (Dan O'Bannon overseeing the script, maybe????) should have let this film be a stand alone onto itself and it would have been...spectacular.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cut Price Chills,"Reasonably effective horror/science-fiction a la ""Alien"" is fairly well done given its limited ambitions.

The Posiedan Adventure In Space,"This film is a variation of a theme we've all seen over and over again - the Posiedan adventure in Space.

Sometimes this tried and tested formula works - like in this case - but more often not - like the truly mind-numbing ""Red Planet.""So why does this one work? Because it's stylish. The acting is above average. And above all it isn't predictable. The conclusion isn't sign-posted. I really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end. That alone deserves top marks in my book.It's an intriguing and entertaining movie.

"A fun, disposable sci-fi flick","I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel. His ego has inflated to a size his talent cannot match. He's better off in smaller movies and in smaller roles. I refuse to watch utter crap like xXx or A Man Apart but he's better than average in Pitch Black.He plays Richard B. Riddick, a convict for massive, infinite crimes that are never defined in the slightest way. This was probably done to add mystery but I say it's bad writing. He's being transported on a spaceship on his way to spacejail but the ship crashes on a desert planet (as the original series of Star Trek proved, most planets are deserts) and he escapes.But hold on, the planet is just entering an extended eclipse that only happens every 22 years. And when pitch blackness falls upon the nameless rock zillions of hungry bat-type thingies come out of hibernation to gobble-up whoever they can. So guess who the motely crew of survivors call on to help them.Most of the film is simply going through the motions of killing the characters off one by one and it's nothing new. Sure it distracts one's attention for 110 minutes but it's nothing new or astonishing.The best thing about the film is the presence of Keith David. Let's be honest, the man is 10 different kinds of cool. And he acts Mr Silly Voice off the screen very easily.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound and a bunch of extras I simply do not care about.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
All you people are so scared of me. Most days I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.,"Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby.The year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake.Right from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter- Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due...Okies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade ""A"" from those involved.It's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts.The narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department.The setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off...The science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great special effects, mediocre plot.","Pitch Black starts out on a positive note with awesome special effects. It takes several simple undeveloped characters onto a dead planet inhabited only by quick creatures of the night.

Forget the massive coincidences (that shall remain nameless) and forget the two-dimensional crew and just focus on creatures that seem to be the ONLY food chain, that fear sunlight, that know, during an eclipse, when to hoard enmass and when to give our heroes a break when the plot-line seems to need it.

Better judge the film for what it is by comparison with what you hoped it would be when you purchased your ticket.Well if you've seen ""Aliens (2)"" or the silly ""Godzilla"" or even worse ""Jurassic Park 3"" (or 2 for that matter), well you are back on the same roller coaster, and not a good one.Supposedly about ""how we all need to stick together"", the message is coated sci fiction, taking place on a hostile planet with aliens who obviously feed on each other when there is nothing else, and still manage to be quite numerous.Borrowed it from a friend?

Actor's anonymous's latest project,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsI had gone to the cinema with the intention of seeing Memento.I got frustrated as the film started while I was held up in traffic,so,eventually,realising I'd get there quicker running on foot than waiting on the bus any longer,I dashed off ,and,in the cold and damp of winter at this time of year,I raced up to the cinema.After all that strenuous running and endurance of cold weather (besides being late),only to hear they wer'nt showing the printed timeslot of the film as they were having trouble with the projections screen.There were 2 other films to see which were on my current cinema list,so,to narrow it down a bit,I decided instead to get Pitch Black out the way.I've heard many rave reviews about Memento,and I can still only assume it's a much better film than Pitch Black.None of the actor's have ever been heard of before for one thing.This was'nt an initial problem,because nobody had heard of the actor's in Cube,and that was an okay Sci-Fi film.But this was of a different pedigree indeed.The script was as cliche riddled as anything has modernly been,and the characters did'nt make much sense at all.The plot was long and drawn out and was very hard to understand.The young member of the spacecraft itself looked like a mini variant of Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3,once she had her gun with her.The special effects are nothing to write home about,either,as they are so obviously computer generated.Basically,this variant on Alien and Event Horizon is frankly,boring.Still,there are a few genuine shocks here and there,plus some diverting twists that sustain interest in the plot long enough to make it to the end.**",,Anonymous,Horror
Same Old Same Old,"Pitch Black reminded me of Aliens for some reason.  The creatures have the same look.  It had nothing that was spectacularly new.  Pitch Black has the same tired, predictable science fiction plot.  I had some friends that liked it but I guess I've seen better.  The movie, however, was well directed but gaps in the plot made me lose interest.  It's okay for a movie to be unrealistic because that's what makes a movie good in most cases.  On the other hand, if a movie states criteria early on about certain unrealistic things, then later on breaks that criteria, then the movie loses credibility.  It's not a total loss though.

Genuinely Surprising...,"I have to say that this movie genuinely surprised me. I went into the theater thinking that this movies would be another cheezy sci-fi film in the mould of ALIEN with 3rd rate actors.

He's amazingly captivating as Riddick, a convict. You keep wanting to see more of him.Second the story is amazing. I'm quite a sci-fi fan and i've seen quite a few cheezy scripts but this was truly first class. Each character has something hidden from everyone else. You feel something is going to happen any minute now.Finally the special effects are glorious.

Lights Out on Pitch Black,"After reading a few of the comments made by people who'd seen advance screenings of this film, I had a glimmer of hope that Pitch Black might be decent enough to recommend.  Well, that hope waned considerably thirty minutes into the film and disappeared altogether before it was even half over.  I have no idea why this film was released in its current state.  It has an annoyingly unfinished quality about it, and comes off looking more like an extended trailer than a finished product.The premise of Pitch Black is as basic and linear as you can get, which is actually a good thing because a more complex storyline is too restrictive for this kind of film.  What we have are a group of crash survivors stranded on a barren planet who must now find another way home.  Their dilemma is compounded by an untimely total eclipse, which releases legions of hideous nocturnal aliens from beneath the surface of the planet.  Now, this situation could (or rather should) make for some real suspense, but Pitch Black fails to mine it to its full potential and consequently the scare factor goes way down.The acting in this film is mediocre at best.  Since most of the characters are expendable (ie: bait) they are pretty much spared any characterization. Personally I don't care for this.  It would be much more effective, I feel, to have a well-developed character or two die than half a dozen static ones. Sure it takes a lot more work to write this kind of script, but the result would be far more rewarding.  As for Vin Diesel being such a good actor in Pitch Black, anyone could play Riddick's character and stand out simply because his is the only one that's fleshed out to any degree.As for the special effects in Pitch Black, they are strangely minimalistic for this type of film.  The creatures are pseudo-Giger and ultimately very unscary for we don't really get to see them until the very end, and even then it's more of a prolonged glimpse than anything.  The only effect that really impressed me in this film was the actual eclipse, with the hordes of aliens erupting from their subterranean lair against the backdrop of fading light.  Very cool.  But overall, the effects were nothing to scream about.So I left Pitch Black disappointed.  And so did the people sitting around me.  I overheard one of them mutter, ""I knew I should have gone to see the Boiler Room instead.""",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A routine space transport goes wrong, leaving a band of survivors on an uncharted world","When I first saw the previews, I thought this movie looked like it had some promise.  I wasn't mistaken.  Quite simply, it's one of the best science fiction movies to come along in a while.The first ten minutes of the movie are completely engrossing, as the crisis that leads to the marooning of the transport is played out.  After crash landing on an uncharted world, the survivors try to find a way off the mysterious planet, where it is always daylight....well, almost always.The acting is particularly good, especially the escaped convict Riddick, played by Vin Diesel.  There's no way this movie would have been nearly as good without his efforts.  (The very sexy) Radha Mitchell also does a great job as the captain of the ship.In conclusion, if you like an science fiction, an intruiging storyline, good acting, and an engrossing plot, then see Pitch Black.

Typical 90s action flick with a sci-fi feel.,"Even though it technically came out in 2000 I very much consider Pitch Black part of the basic 90s action flicks with unoriginal script, questionable acting, poor directing and editing, and uneven action sequences, but with a clear goal to create something entertaining. The result is messy, but easy to watch. There are some moments that are so bad that it's comical (the cheap ""distortion"" effects to hide the lack of budget for real special effects for example) but as one of the last movies of its kind for that decade I still recommend it for a silly yet entertaining movie night; it's as really decent start if you're planning a whole Riddick marathon like I did.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Terror From Beyond Space_ (and much more explicitly, too).Acting is across-the-board solid, though Radha Mitchell has some trouble covering her Aussie accent (it doesn't affect her performance). The effects are good: in a way I have to admire a ""little"" film that simply processes various scenes in different-colored light -- to suggest the light of different stars -- as a ""special effect."" :^) I won't say anything about David Twohy's direction except to note that I have a very strong feeling he has a desperate crush on actress Radha Mitchell. The camera quite literally caresses her body, and especially her rear end, in a way that someone (not me) could describe as ""near pornographic."" Or maybe it's just my liking of short-haired blondes.That said, there is no nudity in this film. Lots of blood and cussing and nerve wracking suspense, though.

Great movie,"I'm not generally a Sci-fi fan, but i watch this movie whenever it comes on. It sets an unusual, and at times haunting tone, where you are often unsure who or what to root for with an element of simplicity that it's sequel was sadly unable to capture. First of all, it is not (as some sci-fi films *including it's sequel* can be) overly reliant on complicated governmental or moral systems, in fact, if it wasn't for the space travel and what not, the movie would be largely plausible if it were set in the present day. It is human, and you don't have to worry about understanding anything but being human to watch it.Also, considering that it's a ""b-movie"" it has some really excellent performances. Obviously, diesel steals the show (in what i would argue is possible his finest acting work to date), but all of the cast does well at portraying their varied and quirky group. Don't base your opinion of this film on it's successor, they are totally different pursuits. If you're sci-fi fan you'll like it, if you're an action fan you'll like it.

Future Cult Classic,"OK... Watching this movie, I was thinking ""Deep Blue Sea"" meets ""Cube,"" but that doesn't detract from it's entertainment value. A group of very... unusual characters get together and crash on a planet infested of flying, nocturnal, man-eating creatures and, of course, terror ensues. Yes, yes, the plot has been done, but still an entertaining flick. What really saves this film is the group of un-likeable characters. Basically, there is not really a character you find yourself cheering for... and I find that a big plus. You have a criminal with cats' eyes, a pilot who'd realistically save her own ass before thinking about anyone else, a cop-like character who's almost as dangerous as the criminal he's captured, and several other disposable characters that predictably turn on one another as soon as the suns go down. The special effects are good, but I preferred how they didn't focus to much on them. What gives this film the bit of creepiness it has is what you don't see hiding in the shadows. To think of it now, you don't actually SEE the monsters all that much. What you have is a ""Blair Witch"" element of ""sometimes it's what you don't see that scares you."" In any case, not a bad movie, but I can't help but feeling like I was watching a direct-to-video flick that got mixed up with a film with better production-values.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dumb In Its Science. Brilliant In Its Characters.,"This film has a lot of problems with its Pseudo science and CGI that other people are quick to point out when dismissing this film. However, while it may not be the most believable set of event the people in this film are very believable. Each individual character undergoes intense changes under the pressure of this alien situation. The exploration of how people act in survival situations is brilliant, and it provides a superb backdrop to the intense action that this film is full of. Its easy to call Pitch Black a dumb movie, because of the terrible sequels and the quick pace of the film. If you look closer though you can find a rich set of interactions with complex emotions being displayed. Its a lot more than what you might expect out of an sci fi action film, and still stands up as a classic in my books.

"Weak in places, but with some redeeming virtues","A curious little movie, this one. It seems to hover between the world of 'straight to video' derivatives and something rather better. Perhaps it deserves to be classed with ""Slipstream"" - a low-budget SF film with plenty of failings but enough interesting features to make it worth a look.On the face of it, the main theme of the film - stranded space travellers on an alien planet must struggle for survival against nasty local creatures that eat them one by one - has been done to death. The ""Alien"" series pretty much wrote the book on this one, and by reinventing the theme slightly with each iteration, more or less exhausted the possibilities of the idea. The makers of ""Pitch Black"" also deserve a hefty virtual slap for using another of science-fiction's tired cliches, the dreaded meteor storm.One thing that redeems ""Pitch Black"" is the focus on characters. While the characters are cliched - plucky but vulnerable pilot, superhuman serial killer, tough-guy bounty hunter, serene holy man, and a handful of the usual monster fodder - the director allows each of the actors room to work with the material that they've been given and the results are surprisingly good. Vin Diesel's sardonic Riddick is ""Hannibal Lecter"" Lite, but with greater room for depth and development, while Radha Mitchell turns in an impressive performance as the young pilot pushed into taking command in an impossible situation. Between them, they establish an intriguing and often plausible human dynamic that is rarely seen in similar films. That ""Pitch Black"" is able to rise above the level of the usual ""eat-'em-one-by-one"" picture (something that, for example, ""Event Horizon"", with its much larger budget and celebrity cast, was not) is because it becomes a film not about monsters but about flawed humanity, and the largely unknown cast are good enough to make their characters - even the most minor - believable and often likeable.The picture also looks better than you would expect. The cast wear their clothes and equipment as if they lived in them, and the back story hints at a complex, multi-faceted civilisation (albeit one without any wild leaps of creative imagination: the technology and concepts are all fairly twentieth-century). The spaceship sets have a gritty, workaday feel, while the bleached, washed-out tones of the daylight exterior scenes actually make the alien setting seem real. When the characters emerge from the dark confines of the hull into the glare of day, your eyes narrow in sympathy. This is a Star Trek universe, where crash-landings are always made on planets that have breathable air, water and (usually hostile) life, but for all that, the nameless planet of ""Pitch Black"" is as barren and brutal as the plot will allow.""Pitch Black"" is not without serious flaws: there's much, beginning with the main plot premise, that's hackneyed or unconvincing. But at the same time there are definitely things to like about it and food for thought. The fact that it is ultimately a film about the best and worst in human nature makes it deeper and more gripping than the broad outlines of the story might suggest.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Experience in Experiences,"Truly, to try and represent this experience with words, would sell it somewhat short. As to make an accurate portrayal of such strong resulting emotions directly, you truly need a comparitive situation.Shall we start with a reference point, a fine movie example with similar entertainment goals.  Aliens fits this profile with utmost excellence.  Begin by incorporating all positive aspects of Aliens.  The cinematography, the cast, the excellent special effects, everything.  Next, take all that away. Take the worst 5 minutes of Dunston Checks In, noteably, the bathtub scene.

unique HOMBRE in outer space movie with style enough to cover flaws,"This is a very unique science fiction movie. It involves a spacecraft crashed on a planet with hostile life forms, some sort of birds that just cut people to shreds. It involves the characters who have to rely on a fairly interesting and definitive anti hero to help them. This could be called the HOMBRE of outer space movies. The chief character, Riddick, now appears a lot, and makes a very good anti hero. He is not vicious, just a survivor. He couldn't be more unlike the ridiculous characters of spaghetti Westerns who don't make a bit of sense. He is more akin to John Russell of HOMBRE. In fact, this movie's style is based on its strength of character development. There is a lot of action, and the characters are extremely credible, even if the plot is somewhat flimsy. But that's okay, because this is a movie which puts real people in an unbelievable situation, which is far superior to a movie which puts unbelievable people in a believable situation.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great movie, but destined to be a 'B'","I'm a sci-fi afficianado, and I really liked this flick- even though I'm really picky!  It was technically tight- not too bogged down though- and had an original plot.  The visual effects were equally original, especially in the ""sunlight"".  It drew a great deal from the Alien aesthetic... expect H.R. Giger to be raving mad!

"Vin Diesel portrays a thinking killer who displays none of the classic psychotic behaviors we are used to in a ""villain"".","The plot in this film is pretty straight forward, and certainly not original in the scheme of science fiction. The characters are somewhat predictable, with the Imam leading and caring for his three teenage followers on a great Hadj to New Mecca, the docking pilot having her first ""command"" thrust upon her, the bounty hunter a junkie hooked on pain killers, the entrepreneur who cares more about his cargo that the situation, a kid traveling alone, a provocatively beautiful woman who is apparently traveling for work, and a hard core killer with eyes that glow and the ability to see in the dark. Okay, so that last character isn't so predictable. As a matter of fact, Vin Diesel portrays a thinking killer who displays none of the classic psychotic behaviors we are used to in a ""villain"". Instead, Riddick is a cold, calculating man who carefully reads the people around him. Radha Mitchell is excellent in her role, letting the inexperience of command shake her confidence while she attempts to lead the group into the right decisions. Keith David is the man of God, the man who always finds the hope in the situation and tries to encourage others to do the same. Cole Hauser is a perfect sociopath, coldly deciding who should be sacrificed as long as he survives. The film moves at a good pace, makes one or two logical flaws in the plot, but overall entertains and apparently creates a memorable character in the form of Riddick, who we see next in The Chronicles of Riddick, our next review. Rated R for violence and gore, and language, this film is collectible for Vin Diesel fans and anyone who likes good science fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good movie for those of us who like to be scared,"The opening sequence was very good. Lots of action. Then there were many hungry aliens in total darkness, and a group of people tried hard to stay alive. Very good performance by Radha Mitchell (Fry). She's quite cute, so the entire movie I was hoping she wouldn't become someone's dinner. As for Vin Diesel (Riddick), he plays a hardcore criminal who killed many people, but he looks and acts like a teddy bear. Someone you want your daughter to marry. That was a big minus, I think. Also, lots of profanity spoken by small kids. I was sort of offended by that. It wasn't as gross as in Bullworth, but still was absolutely unnecessary. The bottom line: it ain't ""Alien,"" but if you want to see good special effects and get a little scared, and you don't mind mindless profanity, I recommend this movie to you",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Solid Sci-Fi, with a weak ending","Pitch Black is a healthy dose of Aliens with a twist of Mad Max thrown in to boot.  The plot was solid - a ship crashlands on the surface of a forbidding planet where darkness means death from the creatures who live underground (or aboveground during total eclipses).  The characters were simply developed, yet interesting enough to provide surprise for some of the movie's character development twists.  Vin Diesel as Riddick is a true movie tough guy who saves the day, and Radha Mitchell plays the softer side of Lt. Ripley from the Alien series as Cpt. Fry.  A solid supporting cast is assembled as well, but this all gets lost in an ending which becomes formulaic and anti-climatic.  Special effects were also well done, which makes this a good Sci-Fi/Horror movie, but not a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Good & Bad Of This Austalian Alien-Ripoff,"Very good special effects, decent sound an interesting Alien-ripoff sci-fi/horror story are the good points of this movie. The bad parts are the too profane, unlikeable characters.

mediocre sci fi entry,"`Pitch Black' is a ha'penny, two-bit science fiction film that plays like a hybrid between `Lost in Space' and the much-imitated `Alien' and `Jurassic Park' films.  In this film, a space ship carrying a cargo of commercial passengers is forced to crash land on an unidentified planet, which, although there doesn't seem to be a shred of animal life anywhere to be found, still manages to be somehow inhabited by swarms of carnivorous birdlike creatures that only come out at night.  Ask not what these animals must feed on when there isn't a crew of fleshy earthlings conveniently placed there for them to nibble on.  Such rigorous application of logic is not one of `Pitch Black's strongest selling points.Neither, in fact, is the cast of characters it has managed to assemble for the occasion.  Here we have the typical `cross section of humanity' routinely called upon to make its appearance in films of this type.  The ship's crew and passengers include two feisty young women, a hardnosed law enforcer (is he really a hero or a man with something to hide?), an effete wine-guzzling coward, an androgynous teenager (the `revelation' involving this character comes as a surprise only to the dimwitted characters in the film), a family of Muslims and a truth-seeing, muscle-bound serial killer who becomes the group's physical and intellectual mainstay.The story, though simpleminded and derivative of any number of other better films, nevertheless, manages to border on the murky and incoherent quite often.  We often aren't sure who is doing what or why (though, in all honesty, we don't particularly CARE either).  The special effects are generally sub par for a film of this genre and the only real attempt to create an otherworldly atmosphere consists in applying various types of light filters to the camera lens.Completely lacking in suspense, excitement or originality (although the ending has a slightly unexpected twist), `Pitch Black' is strictly one for the video graveyard.",,Anonymous,Horror

Are you afraid of the dark?,"Pitch Black is the first film in the so called Riddick saga, featuring Vin Diesel as the titular main character, Richard B. Riddick, and David Twohy as director slash producer. The films are noted for their dark aesthetic and their focus on an almost unlikable antihero, who nevertheless manages to garner your sympathy and support.And as far as debut films go, I've seen far worse. It's a niche scifi film that chooses to focus on a small crew of survivors stranded on a desert planet where night is fast approaching and hunters eagerly await the fall of darkness. No one has a clear idea of what to do and now they have a certified killer, Riddick, on the loose.Where the film shines is the execution of its main idea. Its modest budget is very well utilized and the character roster is a strong one. Diesel's Riddick has gathered a cult following, but I also really liked Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Fry, the leader of the survivors.The film also uses lighting amazingly. The title of the film refers to a long action set piece near the end of the film where the characters have wade through literal pitch black darkness while avoiding attacks and pursuit. And it is a glorious scene. One of the best of its kind.I wouldn't call Pitch Black anything groundbreaking, but it has enough style and substance to stand on its own feet and withstand the ravages of time.

Aliens anyone ...,"This movie proves what you can do with a small budget and a bunch of people determined to make something with an idea and where profit is not the primary concern over content. Yes, the plot is not new, the aliens are definitely not new and the dialogue is Shatnerian at best. The movie as a whole still works. There are some stunning visuals along with some really good acting by Vin Diesel. Its obvious that he has acting ability, it would be nice to see him use it more, rather than settle for what he is currently doing. The movie is simply a showcase for the main character, Riddick. This movie is not Pitch Black, but Riddick. He is not the first character we meet, he is not the protagonist/hero whatever. Yet through all this, he is the fulcrum by which this movie revolves. We want to hear more about his past, and we want to see what he can do. Apart from the incredible crash scene, the fight scene between Riddick and Johns is one of the memorable scenes of the movie. The most brutal is when Riddick takes out one of the creatures barehanded.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than Alien3 but not that much,"This was a film I enjoyed a little when I sat thought it. It's about a travel plane in I think 2020 that crashes on a planet with 3 suns. After that happens all heck breaks loose. Its an obvious rip off of Alien. There's no question at that but it's not a good one either. The style in the way the film is presented is very cool. The camera angels and the color get you into the film but it uses over done Sci-fi horror cliques that have been over done for years. The dark scenes, jump moments, no music just silence and bad alien special effects. The performances are not that well done and the violence is either not seen or clearly fake. The one good thing to come out of this film is Vin Diesel. He's great as a prisoner being transfer named Riddick. He just commands and steals every scene he's in. This guy is the next Arnold or Sly or maybe better than both. Get him some bad guys, guns and a good director and we've got the action hero for the Y2K.

In my estimation it was more worthy of an Oscar than Babel and so many other worthless and forgotten titles. Seriously, I can't remember any others and I can only remember Babel because it was so boring and bad, and I watched it, which is time I cannot get back.This movie only has one flaw that I will not mention, because lefties will have a fit, but other than that, enjoy and appreciate this fine film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thus Begins Riddick!,"This story is the prequel to Chronicles of Riddick. But don't be fooled. I don't think Pitch Black was ever made with the intention of producing a sequel. I think Vin Diesel just became a big enough star that someone decided to continue the character of Riddick. This whole thing is sort of the reverse of ""Remo Williams-The Adventure Begins,"" where the title would suggest a sequel maybe even a trilogy. But no, they started off with a big-shot title that never took flight other than its original film. I never could figure out why though. I mean, it's not all that bad of a movie.Anyway, excuse my departure from the subject - Pitch Black. This film is a sci-fi/horror about a group of survivors who crash land on a deserted planet. But one of their passengers is a serial killer - Riddick. This surprised me in that I would have thought Vin to be the hero (which in a way he semi-becomes but not blatantly). Soon the unfamiliar companions realize there is something else to fear on the planet that is worse than Riddick. Bodies soon turn up missing.This film does a good job with CGI for the creatures and Vin Diesel's character, while still an enigma at the end of the film, surprisingly portrays a backward struggle to compassion. And Radha Mitchell does will in playing a starship pilot seeking redemption. While these themes transpire nicely in the film, the main focus, of course, is on the alien creatures. The gore definitely brings the sci-fi into the horror level. Some good suspense scenes too, where the director draws you in to sympathize with the stranded crew, each of whom seem to have their own conflict. Just don't be misled in thinking you'll see Vin-Riddick as the superhero that Chronicles of Riddick make him out to be. In this film, his motto is, ""When the Bad Get Good."" 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A True Sci-fi Horror Cult Classic. This Introduced Me To Cole Hauser & Vin Diesel.,"I saw Pitch Black when it first came out in 2000, i loved it back then & i still love it now!!!Pitch Black is one of the most deliriously entertaining sci-fi films ever made!!! Up there with the best of the best.The story is about a group of survivors from a crashed space ship have to try to survive a harsh desert planet that's full of bloodthirsty winged creatures that come out at night to hunt. Also the group has to deal with a violent criminal (Vin Diesel) who they have to try & work with in order to survive. Therefore definitely & old Western type feel to the story structure, we have a wanted criminal & a bounty hunter/sheriff (Hauser) & a bunch of travelling civilians trying to cross a brutal desert landscape with creatures surrounding them (just like Indians) & they must learn to trust each other & work together to survive.Vin Diesel has never been better in my opinion, neither has Cole Hauser, both gave it their absolute all with their powerhouse, intense & fascinating performances. There's such an intense history between Vin's deadly convict Riddick & Hausers cunning & crafty Mercenary Johns, you can feel the tension of anger & distrust between the two right from the very first moment there on screen together. I felt Diesel & Hauser dug so deep into their characters & their history & that is the depth & heart of the movie. I wish we got more of those characters, maybe an origin story of their cop vs convict backstory. There's definitely a richness to these two anti-hero characters in Pitch Black that lifts the film so higher for a B movie type low-budget Horror sci-fi flick. Pitch Black is the definition of a true Cult Classic, a 10/10 of science fiction fantasy. A Masterpiece really that deserves it's place next to the likes of Alien & Blade Runner, amongst others.Pitch Black is the best, easily, of the Riddick franchise, but that's not to say that Chronicles of Riddick & Riddick aren't damn awesome in their own ways.What i love about the excellent Cole Hauser is he isn't a big jacked up meat head, he's got a good build but not like he lives in the gym or is self obsessed, he can still hold his own against the likes of Vin Diesel's Riddick as you see many times in the movie. Hauser is just pure Awesome & ridiculously underrated.Also, equally excellent & captivating is Radha Mitchell in probably her greatest role too.Pitch Black is a great mix of Horror & sci-fi with lots of suspense & a nice deserted setting & eerie atmosphere.Vin Diesel is truly Awesome & Cool as hell as tough Criminal Riddick, he's like a character from the universe of John Carpenter movies, a little bit of the iconic ""Snake Pliskin"" is in there & the fact he's an Anti-Hero with a criminal past!!! Vin is great in this role & this was my first introduction to the cool voiced future Action star, we also have an excellent ensemble cast with Vin. We've got the always good Keith David, a star of John Carpenters The Thing & They Live & we have in the form of a tough captain Radha Mitchell as the 2nd main lead & she's great but for me the best character & performance comes from the excellent Cole Hauser as Mercenary Johns, the equally tough & troubled Bounty hunter transporting his prisoner Riddick back to civilisation. Cole Hauser & Vin Diesel are the best part of the movie. It's a great intense & lively role for the underrated actor Hauser as Johns. Hauser goes from cool, calm & in control to panicked & Angry often, he's a really interesting & conflicted character, he's sly & corrupted & spineless at times, but always interesting & often funny, a great performance from the intense Hauser.The Creatures are Awesome looking, Night time sharp looking bat & shark type things, a really cool monster design & very creepy creatures that move very quickly & hunt in the dark.Pitch Black is an Awesome old school type of Sci-fi Horror film, it could've easily come out in the 80's as it's got that look & vibe to it, the lost desert planet they crash on looks like the wastelands of ""Mad Max"" so it's got a real cinematic vision that feels like we know it!!!There's plenty of excellent action scenes & plenty of cool monster attacks & some cool character bits especially the fight between Riddick & Johns. The performances are all top notch & pretty fantastic.All in all Pitch Black is a Gem of the sci-fi Horror genre, it fits in there with films like Aliens, Predator 1&2 & The Cave (also Hauser) & other greats of that genre.I've loved this since the vhs days & it's one of those films that if you haven't seen it in years, you watch it & can't believe how good it is. I saw at the Cinema way bk in 2000, it still holds up.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is Pitch Black a Passion Play?,"I used to hate sitting in English class and try and find those ever elusive symbols in a work.  But the first time I say Pitch Black, it seemed familiar and the second time it clicked.  This was a story of personal redemption and spirituality.  Riddick admits early that he believes in God, but believes that God hates him.  He ridicules (Riddick??)the faith of the moslem crew members and taunts their suffering as evidence of God's absence.  His survival is paramount, but his increasing interest in Pilot Fry is balanced against her responsibility for the entire group of survivors.  He is willing to save her, but she is only willing to be saved, if all of the survivors can be saved. Riddick is drawn back into human society by Pilot Fry and ultimatly when she is drawn away at the moment of death he exhalts ""NO!, not for me!""  Her death, for the sake of the others, including him, causes him to realize that others are willing to die for him.  He becomes a human, and is 'saved' by her death.

Decent SF,"I saw this at a press showing in Stockholm back when it was first released. Back then i thought it was a decent Sci-fi action movie. Recently i saw it again on DVD (after seeing the horrible train-wreck of a sequel ""The Chronicles of Riddick"") and actually liked it more on the second viewing.A ship containing a mixed group of settlers, traveling businessmen, pilgrims and one dangerous captive (and his captor) crash-land on a deserted planet. The planet is a desert wasteland and the survivors try to survive first the heat and then nasty beings that awake when all the planets' three suns are blocked by a total eclipse.""Pitch Black"" is nothing special really. It doesn't break any new ground and is not very innovative. Rather the strong point of the movie in my opinion is how much they manage to make out of so little. The ingredients are simple. A crashed ship, a bunch of survivors with different skills, a dangerous convict that creates tensions in the group and finally an alien species bent on killing them. And considering how many movies are made with themes like this ""Pitch Black"" feels clearly above average. There is suspense, action, crappy one-liners and CGI to go around and it never really becomes boring.Of course there are weak points as well. I have a hard time accepting Vin Diesel who becomes almost like comic relief with his deep voice and flexing muscles. Also the story is nothing to cheer about although i think it does the job.I would recommend ""Pitch Black"" as a Friday night entertainment. It's a lightweight and entertaining no-brainer without being overly stupid or weak. But stay away from the sequel however, it's a completely different experience and shares nothing with this movie except the main character. Goes to show that a large budget can never get you farther than a good script. I rate this 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I watched in the wrong order, still liked the sequel better","This was a movie whose story was just not that compelling. A space ship full of people crashes on a remote and uninhabited planet.

Well, except when there is a full eclipse which, unlucky for them, happens to be coming in a day or two.The movie goes from a ""Flight of the Phoenix"" type movie to a ""Jurrasic Park"" movie very quickly with the basic goal being to get off the planet. There are variables such as Riddick and Johns and the lack of water, but still there was nothing very suspenseful. You had large hideous creatures, you had pawns that were marked for death, you had a couple of heroes, and you had your cliché acts of stupidity that get you killed.

"Nothing New, But Has It's Moments","This film may not expand the Science Fiction Cinematic Universe as we know it, but there's a couple of twists and turns and enough atmosphere to make it a worthwhile addition to the genre.  `Pitch Black,' directed by David N. Twohy, involves a commercial space flight carrying forty passengers that crash lands on an unknown desert planet.  With three suns above them, there is plenty of daylight in which the survivors can negotiate their quest for survival, and finding water is their main concern.  As they begin to explore the wastelands for sustenance, they find evidence that others have been there, apparently some years before them:  A small ship and a couple of buildings; all of which appears to have been abruptly left behind.  Lead by pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), the small band of survivors have a couple of additional obstacles in their way, as well.  One is Riddick (Vin Diesel), a murderer who was being transported to a penal colony.  But he may not be their greatest danger; because there is someone-- or something-- else close by.  Very close.  An entity that in all probability is responsible for the disappearance of those who came before.  And, if that isn't enough, Fry ascertains that the three suns above them will be setting soon; their world is about to be plunged into absolute darkness.  Soon, they will have to deal with Riddick and the entity stalking them in the pitch black of an eternal night.This concept is nothing new, and there's a sense of been there, done that, about it, but to Twohy's credit, what it lacks in originality he makes up for in presentation by building the suspense and maintaining the tension right up to the end.  The story was obviously influenced by a number of other films, predominately `Alien,' `Soldier' and even `Rocketship X-M' from 1950, but there is a unique characteristic about Riddick and a revelation at the end (that has to do with his true nature) that secures a separate entry in the annals of Sci-Fi lore for this film.  This one definitely has it's moments, enough to take it to a level that even such highly touted offerings as `Event Horizon' and `Alien 3' failed to achieve.The performances, too, are a cut above the usual for this kind of fare, and while no one in the cast is likely to win an award for their work here, they do a good job, individually and collectively.  Radha Mitchell has an affecting screen presence and creates a very real person in Fry, equal to, if not surpassing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in `Alien.'  Diesel is effective, as well, especially in the menace he brings to Riddick, which is subtly honest and believable; the understated way he plays it gives added impact to the character and takes him beyond stereotype (though not quite up to Rutger Hauer's Roy in `Blade Runner').  With Riddick, what you see is basically what you get; there's not a lot of depth or complexity to him, but that's who this guy is, and Diesel plays it well.Also turning in effective performances are Keith David as Imam, Lewis Fitz-Gerald as Paris Ogilvie, Rhiana Griffith as Jack and Claudia Black as Shazza.  As Johns, Cole Hauser is adequate, but he fails to give his character the definition his co-stars achieved with their respective roles.Rounding out the cast are John Moore (Zeke), Simon Burke (Greg), Les Chantery (Suleiman), Sam Sari (Hassan) and Firass Dirani (Ali).  From the beginning, you know what you're in for with this one-- it's a survival story, and few of the characters, if any, are going to make it to the end. But as entertainment, `Pitch Black' does the job; it's thrilling enough that by the time it's over you feel like you got your five bucks worth.  You may not remember it next month, but while you're watching, it's a pretty good rush.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beautifully filmed movie,"While most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra-terrestrials end up being cheap, pointless knock offs of the 'Alien' series, Pitch Black stands firmly as an excellent piece.  The lighting is amazing and beautiful, offering sharp contrasts that operate not only as an effective element of the plot, but also give the movie a unique feel.  While many films limit their lighting to black/white contrasts, Pitch Black employs several different colors, shades and intensities.  Vin Diesel does a great job and brings to life a character that could have very easily been run-of-the-mill. The remainder of the cast, including the gorgeous Claudia Black (Farscape), are lesser-known and very talented.  If you like Science Fiction Pitch Black is a must, but the fact that the film focuses (very effectively) on things other than 'bug-hunting' make it an excellent movie for all.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good twist on standard ""human meets alien monster"" story","Cinematography in the beginning of the movie is really impressive. Shooting in almost one-color monotones really added to the feeling of the movie. Applause to the ending, which really ended up being unpredictable.

One of the BEST Sci-Fi movies out in a looong time!,"Pitch Black is one of those rare movies that lifts iftself ""out of"" it's genre and makes fans of good movies take notice.  This movie has incredible writing and outstanding character development.  Every character starts as a ""throw away"" character but EVERY one of them becomes real and important to the story.  Vin Diesel is simply amazing in this film.  He is very accomplished (as seen in Saving Private Ryan) but this film shows him off in full on ""ass kicker"" mode.  If Alien 5 ever comes out stick Vin Diesel in there with Ripley to whoop some alien ass.  I wholheartetly reccomend this film to all Sci-Fi fans and anyone who wants to see a great film as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great film.,"I though this was a great film, setting the atmosphere brilliantly by hardly showing the creatures until it was too late.Ok, some of the actors weren't too good, and the scientific aspects were a little dubious to say the least, but it's still a very scary movie that grips you from start to finish.Vin Diesel is very good in the lead role, showing that not every main character has to have impeccable moralities, and the special effects make the film even better (eg. Riddicks special vision and the view of the aliens).Not brilliant, but Hollywood does worse with 99 out of 100 films.  Hey - and I didn't even notice one piece of Americanized soppy pap!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
simply bad,"'Pitch Black' is a science fiction thriller about a group of astronauts that find themselves stranded on a desserted planet with creatures that come out at dark and start killing off the astronauts one-by-one as they attempt to find a way off the planet. This film is a typical thriller, and if you enjoy this type of film, then you will probably enjoy this. In my opinion, the film was too slow-moving, and the action and attempt to create an emotional and frightening story just did not work. It had little to offer, and it was dull that the film took place in just one planet, in the darkness. It was also unrealistic in the sense that these creatures are living on the planet, but what do they feed on, besides the small group of stranded astronauts? Simply a bad film, but I don't like thrillers, so this may appeal to some.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some pretty good action,"I knew nothing about this movie when a friend dragged me off to see it. But I must admit, it wasn't half bad!  It made for a pretty good action flick.

"""Alien"" but with better characters","I didn't expect much from this but I was pleasantly surprised.I didn't think the effects were all that brilliant  (the aliens were great but never seen in enough detail, unlike in ""Alien""), but I liked the characters, especially those played by Radha Mitchell and Vin Diesel.It started really badly -- in fact, I had to replay the DVD three times to understand the voiceover, but the spaceship crash was spectacular and the realisation of the planet was excellent.Diesel made the film for me.  He is massively calm  and he brought some complexity to his character.The lighting of the film was marvellous and created a sense of a real alien landscape, much better than the Paramount lots in the ""Star Trek"" movies.Mitchell was in ""Phone Booth"" and seems to be getting a lot of parts.  I'm booking ""xXx"" to see Diesel again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A unique pleasant surprise - highly recommended,"I saw this on video - and was pleasantly surprised. The sci-fi/horror genre is very tired and trite - but this film managed to take a pretty standard premise and give it some interesting and creative twists. I also like the fact that the actors are not big stars (which obviously changed for Vin Diesel). Unique to have some Muslims in the future - what a concept. As a Muslim, I thought that was dope! This movie is far better than the sequel, the Chronicles of Riddick, which is visually more stunning and complicated, but absolutely lame in the plot department.What really makes this film unique is the alien/monster. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It makes a change to see a film where you really don't know who will survive.,"This is a very underrated movie and worth a look even if your not a fan of the genre.The plot is rather similar to Aliens, and like that movie the cast are apparently stuck on the planet with the aliens. However, these aliens only come out in darkness and darkness on this world lasts for many years! Despite the plot plagiarism, this movie still stands up on its own. The aliens are different enough to be interesting and the characters are not just ""bug-fodder"" like the marines in Aliens.There is a plot hole concerning the ecosystem in which the aliens exist and what they survive on between the periods of darkness, and what they eat when they haven't got nice juicy humans to snack on, but one can simply say ""each other"" and be reasonably satisfied with the answer. The film is so good that this minor hole is easily ignored.The cast are all excellent, especially Keith David as the obligatory holy man who puts his faith in God to deliver him. Radha Mitchell is also good as a kind of wannabee Ellen Ripley figure. But its Vin Diesel that steals the movie and rightly so. He has as much charisma as all the others put together and the rest are all pretty good, so that's saying something. This film gave Diesel the status and stardom he now enjoys today, but I still have to say that this is the best of all his films to date.A great film to watch and for once it makes a change to see an action film where you really aren't sure who is going to survive or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Are you afraid of the dark? You will be.,"David N.

Radha Mitchell (WHEN STRANGERS APPEAR) and Keith David (ARMAGEDDON) star along side Diesel as some of the other passengers.Now, the special effects are mesmerizing in this film.

"Loved it, hated them","This was a fine movie - like a ""Survivors"" [TV show] in outer space.  But the characters were drawn so realistically (as in realistically flawed and annoying and too stupid to live), that I was rooting for the native fauna almost immediately.  For my taste, Riddick the Convict was the only likeable character.  Minor complaints about the technical discrepancies: will we still be wearing eye spectacles (like the milquetoast antique dealer) or using heavy iron chains to hold doors closed and keep convicts hobbled in an age of space travel, space mining and space colonization?  I don't *think* so.

Shameless rip offs don't make a movie.,"Hungry, bored, plain stupid? Make your own Pitch Black!Ingredients: 1 blanket, 1 flashlight, 1 pair of swimming goggles, 1 disgusting plastic cockroach that shines in the dark, 1 large popcorn and a coke.The making process: Get under blanket, pretend that you're five and you're hiding from aliens.Turn on the flashlight and put on the goggles. Spend 1 hour and 58 minutes of boring quality time with yourself.Eat the popcorn and take a zip from the coke.After precisely 1 hour and 59 minutes  turn off the flashlight.Wave the cockroach in the air and make scary noises. Take the goggles off, finish the coke and go home you sick pervert!Now, if you didn't understand any of the above it means that you belong to the large group of people which have a life and were fortunate enough to miss this abomination called: Pitch Black.Two major rights were violated during the making of this movie: first the basic human rights of the viewers who had to put up with two hours of this c**p, and various Copy Rights.Pitch Black is an obvious rip off from two major science fiction sources, Isaac Asimov and the 'Alien' series. The idea of a destruction which comes on a planet in cycles of a few years, every time an eclipse takes place, is a shameless rip off from Isaac Asimov's famous book 'Nightfall'.The stranded spaceship, the crew who finds a deserted colony on the planet, the presence of dangerous people on the crew and the endless wondering whether they are trust worthy or not - all this bear a close resemblance to the 'Alien' series.In spite of all the great stolen ideas in it, Pitch Black is still a bad movie. There is no backbone to the story. They just crash on the planet and immediately they begin their rescue. Not much dialogs either, you could probably watch the movie silenced and still understand a great deal.The main theme of confusing between light and darkness and between good and and evil is emphasized in the sudden change of roles between the 'law enforcing' man and the dangerous murderer. Yet instead of adding depth to the movie it lacks reliability and something called 'acting', and ends up adding nothing more than the element of surprise to the movie.Of course one could claim that since this is a horror movie that is exactly what its makers wanted to achieve. But it's very clear when you watch the movie that Pitch Black was intended to be a cross between Science Fiction and a horror/thriller. And for some unexplained reasons it turned out to be a plain horror movie, and a horror movie it is indeed.Oh, you think this is harsh go see the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pitch Black is such a big surprise,"Pitch Black is a sci-fi adventure with strong horror elements.We initially see a spaceship crashing on a remote planet due to a malfunction. The survivors include the notorious (but wrongly accused) convict Richard B. Riddick (played extremely well by Vin Diesel) his guards and several other travelers, entrepreneurs, a father and his sons in search of a better life. The planet appears at first uninhabited but soon the survivors discover human-made installations but no sign of life. Eventually they come to the conclusion that the previous occupants had to abandon the planet for some unexplained reason.Pitch Black is clearly a film that takes certain elements from the 'Alien' trilogy, especially the presence of extraterrestrial specie(s) that attack humans. There is also a considerable drama and tension here between the actors. Richard B. Riddick is a multi-faceted character whose ability to see in darkness and survival skills prepare him better and help him to assess the dangerous situations much sooner than anybody else. The other survivors have to work together with Riddick in order to make it through and escape. The exploration of the planet (at least near the crash site) was also very nicely shown.This film was a big positive surprise for me. It was also a very good introduction of the Richard B. Riddick character that we saw again in the more ambitious but less satisfying 'The Chronicles of Riddick' in 2004.",,Anonymous,Horror
"In the wrong place at the wrong time...If you like sci-fi, you might as well see this.","It isn't a stinker and has some interesting features. The plot isn't totally derivative and the characterization and human interactions are fairly complex. The acting is decent, the low budget is not a problem, and the dialog....well, it sure doesn't zing, but I don't remember groaning aloud at any point like I did in Mission to Mars.  The creatures are not badly conceived and have some cool special effects in their perception of light.Unfortunately, there are some stupid moves on the part of almost every character except Riddick (Vin Diesel steals the show), who is the consummate survivor.  He maintains your interest throughout -- you are never quite sure if he has redeeming qualities, besides some reflective stuff on his eyeballs, physical courage, strength etc.  Not that he is in any danger of breaking out in a spot of bon homie.A boon:  The ending is actually not predictable.   Try guessing if any of them survive, and if so, which.  Well, its clear some of them are just not gonna make it, but after that, try guessing.Low points you can pass over: What lousy luck arriving at just exactly this point in the 22 year cycle. Why doesn't somebody figure out how long the eclipse will last?  How did these dark-adapted creatures evolve on a planet with decades of intense sunlight. How is it that barely fluorescent worms work as a deterrent?

"Good story, great cast.  Best space movie since Alien.","The main reason I went to see it is that I've been a fan of Vin Diesel ever since I saw 'Iron Giant' (He hosts the making of on the DVD).  Pitch Black is a little darker than most movies I see, but it was very good.  The cast was excellent, especially considering I knew none of them except one.  In my mind, it was similar to Alien.  A struggle to survive against a species that views humans only as an organic food source.  I actually liked it better, since after the blood was shed, and the last survivors escape, one has been profoundly changed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than I expected,"Going in, I thought this movie would be some schlockfest. Two hours later, I was rather surprised. While some will call this an Aliens' knock-off, I see as something much more. Its more jarring, just as intense, and just as unique as Alien. Every character had their little background story, which is something that is rarely ever dealt with when it comes to flashy, sci-fi epics. Vin Deisal's performance finally sold me on his talent, and could be the next Arnold Schwarzeneger (and he even has a better voice!). The scene where he is eye to eye with the flying beast is simply heart-stopping! Who would have the guts to do something like that! David Twohy made quite a gem.

Solid Sci-Fi Film,"Pitch Black includes a wide cast with its star coming a few moments afterwards and not making much of a presence, but once Riddick (Vin Diesel) enters, the film becomes better. Although I did not care too much for the supporting characters and thought they were in it a little too much in the beginning. If Pitch Black is a likable sci-fi thriller, it's because it has the heart of a '70s disaster movie beneath the horror trappings of computer-generated mutant bats and winged demon aliens.A spacecraft en route to a galaxy called New Mecca has an accident in mid-flight and must land on the hostile terrain of a scorching desert planet (it was filmed in Australia). Fry (Radha Mitchell), a junior pilot, is placed in command when the rest of her flight crew is killed. Just to show she's no Sigourney Weaver-like heroine, one of her first decisions is to jettison the ship's passengers to save herself. A solid sci-fi effort which one can see why people enjoy it.==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch 08/12/17' Pitch Black is a mildly entertaining and interesting sci-fi action film.

Outstanding!,"I could never truly express how much I love this film.  I have seen it almost 10 times, and still grip the sides of the chair when watching it. There are a few flaws in the plot, some were mentioning the crew not freezing at sundown, and the likelihood of the crash occurring at the same time as the eclipse, but hey, just go with the flow.The special effects they used for Riddick were exceptional, and the tone for the planet was just as effective.  The stark contrasts in colors gave the mood, and added to the creepiness factor.Vin Diesel was excellent in this movie, and the script was cleverly written. You see his and the captain's internal struggles over the importance of their survival in contrast to saving the others.I was very impressed with this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.****FOR BEST RESULTS - WATCH IN THE DARK!!****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rubbish!,"This film IS a cheap imitation of Alien, and ISN'T actually an excellent movie all round.   And a good indicator (for me), to what is a bad film, is when I just want it to end, and that's exactly what I thought, not even halfway through watching this.It's hairthin plot, - spaceship crashes on a desert planet, and the survivors attempt to find a way off it by endlessly traipsing across sand dunes and deserted townships looking for another ship to fly home in (which is conveniently provided for them).  And then there are the alien creatures (uninventively handicapped by an aversion to light) who pose a constant threat to the would be space travellers during the night.  But in comes Vin Diesel (whom I havent seen in a decent film yet... yes, XXX sucked) who, averse to the light but, attired in his shades that look more like diving goggles, eventually comes to the aid of the others with his ability to see in the dark.Anyway, in a nutshell, Pitch Black suffers from a poor script, a substandard cast (Radha Mitchells' American accent is one of the worst I've heard), but most importantly, an unoriginal premise, unsuccessfully rehashed.  It is substandard fare, prosaic with very little going for it except for some nice special effects here and there, but ultimately hard to sit through to the end.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good science fiction is hard to come by,"Certainly true with this movie. ""Hip, Sexy & Scary as Hell!"" as a tagline is misleading.

Very confusing with the way it switches back and forth from different locations and characters. Stupid plot devices stolen from other movies. (Oh... the boy is really a girl! That twist made THIS boy want to cry. :P )I think the director of this movie, himself, was probably as surprised as anyone that this movie was a success at all. Of course with the junk hollywood has been kicking out lately it's no surprise. People have to go somewhere on a Saturday night with their dates.A 'B' flick at best.

The decision whether to see a movie in the theatre orwait for VHS or DVD depends on personal priorities. In my opinion this is one to see in the theatre.

straight up sci-fi actioner whose quality belies its meagre budget,"Saw this movie at a preview screening last year.  I don't think is was the final cut, but pretty close to it.The basic scenario is quite familiar - a disparate group of space travellers is thrown together when their ship crash lands on a seemingly desolate planet whose barren exterior hides a nasty surprise.  However, this film has a gritty edge more reminiscent of independent ""cinema verite"" than the glossy coating applied to standard mainstream fare.  This ""down and dirty"" approach is if anything more evocative of Alien than any plot similarities. The dialogue is sparse and terse and generally manages to stay away from the cliches which so many other films in this genre seem so ready to embrace.The greatest strength of this film is its relatively unknown cast.  The anxiety of this group who don't know or like each other is palpable. Their grudging agreement to work together under the direction of Fry, the sole surviving ship's officer (played by Radha Mitchell) is borne of necessity and practicality - there is no attempt at ""chemistry"" here, just the believability of desperate people facing the facts.  The resolution of clashing personalities as the situation rapidly worsens forms the meat of the story and exposes the character's weaknesses and - more importantly - their true motivations. At the core of these revelations is the relationship between Fry and the convicted criminal Riddick (played with muscular vidour by Vin Diesel), everyone's survival will ultimately depend on whether these two can resolve their distrust of each other.The film is well crafted. The effects work is excellent but never obtrusive, serving the story well.  The cinematography adds a truely weird feel to the alien desert landscape.  For a film that in total cost around what Shwarzenegger gets for a single movie this is an impressive offering from director David Twohy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Movie can't live up to first 10 minutes.,"Pitch Black has one of the most exciting opening sequences I've seen in a long time.  And the plot is pretty interesting.  But the screenplay and especially the dialogue sag at each corner.  Snappy retorts lack snap: ironic demises lack irony...the movie just isn't very clever given that it has the potential to be a great Sci-fi flick. One strong point, I will admit: the characters are complex.  The handsome hero isn't, and the brave captain isn't either.  I liked that. Anyway, some people get stuck on a planet that has three suns and creatures that eat everything in (out of) sight when it finally gets dark, and coincidentally there's about to be a total eclipse when our characters show up.

Classic Sci-Fi with a good dose of action,"I am in a technical profession, and enjoy thinking about the possibilities of science fact and fiction.  However, in my opinion, Science Fiction is at it's best when the technical aspects are not dwelled upon, and the development of character takes over.  This is the case with Pitch Black. Passengers of a transport vessel find themselves marooned on an inhospitable planet.  Fear, trust, and characters coming to terms with their own weaknesses are intertwined with the basic suspense of a classic horror picture.The film has some rough spots, but for the most part, great science fiction. I think this did not do as well in the theatres as it could have due to the lack of sophistication in today's audiences.Vin Diesel is great in his role, as is Radha Mitchel.  David Keith's character lacks a bit of depth, in my opinion, but is interesting in the role of a holy man that doesn't have ALL the answers, yet is still faithful.My biggest regret is Claudia Black's relatively short screen time!Take some time to see and enjoy this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you want to be scared by nasty monsters, rent Aliens","Pitch Black: A ship of interstellar colonists has their plans changed when they pass through the tail of a wayward comet.  They crash-land on a barren planet, with three suns, and no life, or at least that's what they're led to believe.  With an eclipse on the way, a killer on the loose and some scary creatures who come out only at night, things don't bode well for our heroes.I was impressed with the before-the-eclipse cinematography - the landscape was stark, blinding and essentially monochromatic, creating a feeling of desolation and desperation (I know I wouldn't want to be stuck there under any circumstances).  Second, the opening sequence is extremely well done - from the howling winds to the wild debris - the viewer feels like they are in the cockpit with the crew.   I also enjoyed Vin Diesel's performance as the murderer with a conscience.  Unfortunately, the movie never recaptures its momentum and becomes increasingly insipid. What exactly are the odds that you would crash-land on a planet with three suns, with a killer that can see in the dark the day before a total solar eclipse (that occurs once every two decades) engulfs the planet.  I'm guessing slim to none.  To make matters worse, the monsters, are without a doubt, the worst waste of computer animation I have ever seen.  Who dreamed up these walking anvils with teeth? I found them laughable rather than terrifying.  Finally, the ending was contrived and anti-climactic.Unless you're absolutely desperate for a science fiction / action fix, save this one for cheap movie night.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyment lurks in the darkness,"I read a few comments, bringing up the alien films. This is not alien it is better it is a sci-fi horror flick with the right element. Sure the first alien film made me jump the first time I saw it, but for me it will never be as good as the first time. As for aliens well it was little more than an action film, not that that is bad but the horror aspect was completely lost. Bringing me back to Pitch Black and what makes it such a good film. The one thing that scares us all when outside at night and we hear a sound. We strain our eyes to see what unknown evil lies waiting in the darkness. That is what makes this film special and keeps your attention. In alien you knew it was somewhere in the shadows and you waited for it to pop out so someone could shoot it.

good movie,"this movie is pretty good, good enough to rent, but not good enough to buy. The main reason this movie was as good as it was was because of Vin Diesel's performance. He really helped this movie alot. I liked his attitude and the way he presented himself. I also liked his eyes, and the flying....things.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very enjoyable movie even if the premise are from a B movie,"This movie is based on a classic stereotype of SciFi (unknown planet, alien monsters, a hero, ...) but special effect are not intrusive at all; from many points of view it remembers to me Alien saga and there is a good level of tension. In the story high importance for women roles: an action movie for female public? I don't like Vin Diesel as an actor and this movie is not an exception (even if it is his first relevant movie) but the story and the directions are very good and make this movie very interesting. Interesting are also some ideas: the dark sight, the monsters (even if the way they see is really weird), the bad guy that became ah hero and save everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deasel is So Irritating in this crap movie,"When i first saw this DVD, i expected a good movie. I usually don't put subtitles, but i have to this time. Why? because the way Deasel talks in this movie, you cant understand what he is saying. His character is so boring and annoying and is over acted. The characters in this movie do not suit with the plot. Some Muslims, some other people and Vin Deasel all on the same flight. Vin Deasel gives a disastrous performance in this so called horror film. Why does he talk in that stupid way, it annoys big time. Overall this is a dull movie and reminds you of Ghosts of Mars with Ice Cube. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, the sequel sucked and so does this.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Enjoyable, but something's missing","Pitch Black is entertaining, but it feels underdone . It is a great looking film, no doubt there. Twohy has a great eye for color shape and texture, and he directs the film quite nicely, with a mindset toward mystique and subtlety, (which helps generate shock moments, because they come harder). However, there are still a lot of blanks to fill in. The storyline is shallow, and the characters (despite being likable people) are poorly defined, especially Vin Diesel. There is also a fairly strong sense of anti-climax. When all is said and done, Pitch Black is entertaining as a sci-fi, but it could probably use some energy, and a slightly stronger screenplay.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

What a ride,"An extremely exiting film, which very good CGI effects, such as the ring of stones, even if the creatures look a little like the Shadows from Babylon 5.However it is the acting and cinematography that really rank this film, such as the start where the harsh light make this look like a really different planet which is a hard thing to do. The acting was really good especially on the parts of the kid, Riddick, the pilot and Johns.

Greatly Exceeded My Expectations,"Since I know someone working at the local theatre I got in free. I wasn't about to pay $7 bucks to go see what would probably end up being a campy sci-fi flick with cheap effects and bad acting.All I can say is WOW! This is the kind of movie that I plan on buying. Pitch Black was from being the cheesefest I expected from a film I had heard very few positive things about and starred people I knew next to the nothing about.The effects were above-par although the aliens looked strongly influenced by the all-famous Aliens. Nevertheless their movements were realistic and creepy.Despite a plot which could have been summarized in a single sentence, the character development and strength of acting was superb. One of the things I found the most visually pleasing (besides Vin Diesel - yum!) was the hue and contrast of the terrain. Turning what would be a normal ""rocky desert"" scene into something that looked truly off-world and baked bones under the triple heat of its suns.I'm very pleased that I wandered into the movie and was treated to such a gem that I feel this film has redeemed my opinion of Hollywood's recent sci-fi flicks since seeing that waste of film, Wing Commander.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Sci-fi movie,"I enjoyed this movie.  It had good special effects, pretty good acting, and it had an interesting story.  Still, the movie had room for a couple of my complaints.  I thought the movie could of been scarier, or more suspensful. I was expecting to be jumping throughout the movie.  I thought the CGI was good, but not ground breaking.  It looked kind of fuzzy sometimes, and you could tell it was CGI most of the time.  I thought it was a good movie, but I wouldn't call it a Sci-fi classic.  Still, these are just little complaints.  I liked the movie.If you are a Sci-fi fan or enjoy any creature films I think you will enjoy this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unexpectedly gripping, watched it twice.","Before posting this, I read 20 or 30 of the other posts, and wonder if the posters who thought it stunk were paying bills or something equally onerous while watching this terrific sci-fi flick.What did I like? Vin Diesel was terrific, as was the actress who played the pilot. The creatures were pretty good, if reminiscent of Alien with the wide carapace heads. The different lighting to show the three suns effects was clever. The use of music heightened the nail-biting suspense. I never could foresee who would get it next. I felt the aridness of the landscape and thought the costume department did a great job of dressing people like real people dress.It was a good escapist movie with a lot of clever and intriguing touches. Don't try to compare it with '2001' and you'll enjoy it just fine. Remember that when Terminator came out, Arnold was just another body builder doing muscle movies with grunts for dialogue. Every body has to start somewhere. I think Vin was terrific. Have also seen him in boiler room, where he also makes a lasting impact.  Really enjoyed this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good movie, bad ending.","I hate horror movies, but I thought I'd give this one a chance since i heard it was good.Summary: A spaceship crashes on an abandoned planet with passengers and a convict on his way back to prison. Among the survivors there is a pilot, who just wants to find a way off the planet, a junkie policeman who is escorting the convicted killer Riddick, a holyman, a few kids and a few other people, who gather together what they have to survive the drought of the planet, but next to finding water they have to find Riddick, who they fear will kill them eventually, but they eventually figure out they aren't that much in danger of Riddick than what lives in the darkness on the planet. A step into darkness leads to a death and soon they learn that once there is a solar eclipse, what is in the dark will appear and they won't be able to see ""it"" except Riddick, who has had surgery on his eyes giving him the ability to see in the dark, but does he even want to save the same people that want him dead?The plot was great, I fast forwarded most of the ending of the movie to prevent nightmares, but it wasn't that scary or anything (Sure, you'd expect me to say that once I've just admitted I fast forwarded!) The special effects made for Vin Diesel's character Riddick were awesome, as for the monsters, they reminded me of Alien in a way, but the movie was very dark towards the ending and also the ending sucked due to the last person who gets killed, that shouldn't have happened, but sad to say it did happen and it ruined the movie.I rate this 7/10, Vin Diesel was really good as Riddick, the guy you just start to like, but end up laughing at his sarcasm and then end up hating him.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I think I am going to puke....,"""Pitch Black"" was on TV. Cool, I will have a sample of what the newest Riddick film is about. After seeing this, definitely, I am not renting it.The story is basically like this: a ship carrying a top-security prisoner (guess who?) somehow falls on a deserted planet, and soon is cornered by creatures who live in the dark and like to eat flesh. Oh, how scary! The movie in itself is FX. The rest is a ripoff of ""Red Planet"" (but without Carrie Anne Moss walking out of the shower), ""Star Wars"" and ""Men In Black"" (the creatures...), and some dreadful b-sci-fi movies.Diesel pulls out some sort of Dom (the guy he played in ""Fast & FUrious""), while the rest of the cast spend their time trying to justify their being in this film.I never thought a movie would deserve a 1. There's something always worth remarking. Well, it's not enough with FX, and the movie is too sorely bad. COnclussion: 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Imperfect Pitch,"A spaceship crash-lands on a desolate planet. Now the survivors must face the unknown - and each other - in a never-ending game of terror.Sound familiar? Okay, maybe a little. But there are a couple of hooks in this movie. One is that the planet these guys have landed on has three suns, and wouldn't ya know it all three suns are about ready to align, plunging the planet into a complete and lasting darkness. Add to this creepy setting a malicious convict named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who's gone to the trouble of having his eyeballs surgically altered so he can see in the dark, the better to sneak up on you, my dear. This is explained to us rather poignantly early on, and of course his eyesight becomes useful later on.There are two ways to look at this movie - either as generic drama, powered by a plot, or as a horror film. Those of you looking at it as a horror film already have low standards (admit it!), so you won't be disappointed. I don't mean to belittle you, but let's face it - when you want to sit down to a good horror film, the story isn't always a top priority. You want stuff that'll scare you! If you're looking at this as a drama - man versus self, man versus alien planet, and so forth - you still won't be disappointed. In short, there are two things going for this - an excellent use of special effects (and, consequently, a great sense of what's creepy) and a solid plot. You can't go wrong.To complicate matters, the remaining humans - now deep in darkness, with only flares, flashlights, etc. to help them - are besieged by nasty flying alien creatures who only attack in the dark. Seeing the ripe and ready flesh of the humans must seem like an all-you-can-eat buffet to the aliens. And if the outside threat isn't enough, our heroes have to deal with Riddick, who's released from his chains early on. Will he kill them all? Will aliens slaughter them in their sleep?I won't get into the acting except to say that I have movie posters in my house that have more emotion and personality. And the script itself - the dialog sounds as if it were written by a high-schooler. But there are a lot of genuinely startling moments, and there's a magnificent atmosphere to the whole deal. You never get to settle in to the movie, and that's key to a horror film, in my book. At no point did I have a chance to sit back and notice how bad the acting was, and that's quite a feat. So, in short, you can either look at this movie super-critically (in which case you won't be pleased, unless you delight in finding fault!) or simply go with the flow. It's a scary ride, folks, because you don't know what you'll run into when it's dark.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm with the critics,"The basic plot of this movie is that people crash land on a planet and have to hide from the aliens. I think the weakest part of this movie is the plot. I mean, it's just too basic. Critics thought this was just okay while audiences liked it more. I'd have to go with the critics here. I had no idea this set up the Chronicles Of Riddick series.Well, I don't know much about that either. The designs of the aliens are quite good, but the problem is that the special effects aren't that good. I still like the landscapes, especially with how they show the planets. The actors, especially Vin Diesel, are likeable enough. Maybe I've just reached the point where I've seen so many movies that I need to be impressed more. Check out the later Fast and Furious movies for his better movies. **1/2",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""One rule - stay in the light!"" a great sci-fi/horror!","Now this is more like it!! Who needs a ludicrously high budget to get the desired effect eh? This film has everything you'd want from a sci-fi. And everything you'd want from a horror. And there's more besides great SFX and scary moments, there are great three dimensional performances from every cast member, amazing cinematography, and a cracking score which sets the mood of the film! Oh yeah, and of course there's Vin Diesel...He's tipped to be the new Bruce Willis? Yep, I can see where that comes from. He prefers a black vest though instead of Brucie's trademark white! Anyway, judging by this film alone, Vin Diesel should be going on to bigger and better things, mind you, it's hard to see how he can better this film - he's electrifying in it!! (Fast and the Furious? o.k. I just made myself look stupid! He'll be BIG sometime soon. Is that better?)This film is a must see for anyone who likes suspense, shocks, great SFX, superb and controlled performances, and a good plot scenario. If that's not your kinda thing, then why are you on this page?!The usual plot - spaceship crash lands on alien planet, and survivors try to find a way off the planet. But, they encounter aliens which try to kill every single one of them! So, we're on familiar territory. This film gives the sci-fi horror a new lease of life though, and it's mainly due to the new alien species that are in the film. They are really scary!You know what, I cannot be bothered to write a long review on this film, so what I suggest you do is go and see this film. That's it. That's my advice to you.

A nice low-key science fiction,"Pitch Black was the inauspicious ramp into public consciousness for both director David Twohy and star Vin Deisel. Although nobody knew who they were before Pitch Black, nobody who paid attention during the credits would forget later. Twohy has since gone on to direct several B-level features along similar lines, whilst Vin Deisel has gone on to appear in a number of upstart action franchises, for good or ill. Indeed, one of the features planned for next year is called Hannibal. What the hell, it cannot be any worse than the last film I saw that was called Hannibal.In this rather strangely-plotted piece, Deisel portrays what appears to be a vicious criminal. It's only after we're introduced to the rest of the cast that we discover there is more than meets the eye. Once Riddick is introduced, we are given a shallow, but curiously engaging Aliens-style premise. The use of bleach bypass in order to make the desert of Coober Pedy look like an alien world was a master stroke. Indeed, Deisel aside, the real star here is the cinematography.Keith David gets an underdeveloped, underutilised turn as a Muslim cleric who, in spite of having three tenths of nothing to say, is strangely sympathetic. As tragedy befalls him, his dialogues about faith and belief with Riddick give the whole affair an ironic undertone that is strangely enjoyable in spite of being at times a little too confronting. Don't bother looking for other big names in this feature, however. I think they must have pillaged every location they shot in to find people who will play the (very) minor characters. Their artificiality makes it clear that they are from the Antipodes, and they won't be working in much else any time soon.According to the trivia entries, Pitch Black was shot in the same desert as Mad Max. This doesn't seem right, given that Mad Max was short in locations to the North of Melbourne. Mad Max 2 was shot in a place called Broken Hill, a bit of a ways away from Coober Pedy. In fact, no Mad Max film has ever shot in a Queensland location, and the only possibility would be Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome being shot in Coober Pedy, which still makes this statement a little inaccurate (apparently more shooting on Mad Max 3 took place in New South Wales than South Australia, where Coober Pedy is).Nonetheless, this film shows a clear reason why many productions are going to Australia rather than shooting in America or England. For one thing, in spite of all the horrid things I say about them, when an Australian in the film industry tells you they're going to keep quiet about your production, they mean it. George Lucas shifted production of his last and about-to-be-released Star Wars films to Australia for this very reason.Another advantage of working in Australia, locations notwithstanding, is efficiency. An Australian crew can be trusted to get things done without delays or labour disputes, provided you don't abuse them. That shooting Pitch Black only took sixty days should convince one of this fact when they consider that films like this can often take twice as long. The film's estimated budget of a mere twenty-three million is also a mild shock when the opposed impressions of the shooting location and the strangely elaborate special effects are taken into account.I gave Pitch Black a seven out of ten. It's not a classic, and it may not even be remembered in another ten years, but it is entertaining enough to watch a few times. This is an excellent example of how sometimes the smaller budgets produce better films. I'm glad I took the time to see it theatrically.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The hype and advertising they used alone will draw you in, and leave you with a bitter taste once you see it.","Pitch Black seemed like a great movie to go see.  One main thing that will attract me to a movie is the advertising.  Sometimes I will refuse to see a movie if the advertising is poor, even if my friends tell me it is a good movie.  Well the advertising for Pitch Black got me, sadly.  I did not know what to expect going into the movie, but after the first twenty minutes or so, I pretty much knew how I was going to be disappointed.  The characters are all very weak, do not expect any great performances, or good development of any of the characters.  And the character that made me want to see the movie, the creatures or big chickens, thats what they looked like to me, were not any better.  The main problem I guess that made it bad was the story and flow of the movie.  It seems like it is not going anywhere, just dragging along.

"Highly unoriginal, but never boring","As far as being derivative, there are fewer film that owe more to other films than Pitch Black. Aliens, Tremors, Silence of the Lambs, Starship Troopers, etc. This film barely has an original bone in its body. But it is fun nonetheless. Much of the credit goes to David Twohy for creating a pretty interesting world for these people to crash-land on. And the middle section when Fry, Riddick, and the rest begin to realize what's in store for them is by far the best. Much more credit goes to Vin Diesel for his portrayal of Riddick - his voice is like another character in this film, and the narration is so amazingly recorded that it feels like its inside you. Radha Mitchell makes a convincingly flawed heroine, as well. Worth checking out on the big screen if you're a scifi/action fan, especially since pan and scan on it's video release with be very damaging to this film's visual style.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Spellbindingly Mesmerizing!"" says Janet Maslin","I'm usually a sucker for intergalactic junk food action movies (I hesitate to call them sci-fi because science fiction can and should be more literary and thought-provoking, not synonymous for blowing up alien spaceships with lasers/tasers/phasers), but I was a little shocked to find out how delicious this flick was compared to some of the trash I've seen in recent years. For those that don't know the premise, a space freighter carrying an incredibly dangerous criminal crash lands on a desert planet and finds out it is inhabited with ferocious flesh-rippin' critters that hide in the darkness. Well, what happens when said planet, usually brightened by its three suns (no Fred MacMurray jokes), has a total eclipse?  Wackiness ensues!  For such a simple plot, this movie plays out with so many twists (what do you expect from the screenwriter of Elm Street 4 and the Fly 2?  Kidding.) and even more style to boot.  Vin ""Zoo-perr-mann"" Diesel, who plays the criminal Riddick here, is simply a bad-ass and makes this movie his own.  I would love to see a prequel or sequel involving his character, but ecccch, now I'm just sounding like a geeky throwback from the Ain't It Cool News website. So go see this movie in February in a multiplex with an impressive sound system, but make sure you leave your brain in the lobby. Cheers.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pitch Black is one of those monster flicks,"Pitch Black By Dean KishWhen the lights go out, fear smiles a little brighter. Oh so they say. 	Pitch Black is director David N. Twohy's third outing as director and second science fiction film. The story chronicles the crash landing of a passenger spaceship. The spaceship crashes onto a planet that has three suns and is inhabited by underground creatures who live in the utter darkness. The menage of survivors quickly find out that the planet will have a once in 22 years eclipse on the second day of their arrival. Upon the dawn of  the eclipse the planet's inhabitants become rabid and blood-thirsty. Now all they can do is survive the dark. 	To start off with Pitch Black isn't a perfect film or even an `Aliens' or `Terminator' but it does have a lot to offer in the sci fi movie genre. What it does serve up is an interesting look at how a movie's texture and feel can steal the show creating an interesting ride. The cast is hardly worth mentioning and the script is confusing at times but the two stand-outs in the cast and some nasty creatures makes Pitch Black entertaining. The stard-outs would be the `Terminator' presence of Vin Diesel and a `Ripley-esque' Radha Mitchell. Mitchell is particularly good shadowing the brutality displayed by Diesel. Her flawed character wrestles with the guilt of crashing which develops her character for the audience and helps us relate to their unbelievable situation. Diesel, on the other hand, is a star in the making and delivers a convincing villain with a conscience. 	 Pitch Black is one of those monster flicks that belong in the category with classics  `Leviathan (1989)', `Deep Star Six (1989)', `Pumpkinhead (1988)' and `Mimic (1997)'. These are probably little known to the masses but are horror/creature gems on video. What Pitch Black has in common with these films is excellent special effect creatures and little known stars. And they prove sometimes that's not so bad. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good idea - but that's all!,"What can I say about Pitch Black - while viewing the trailer I found this to be a rather exciting idea for the science fiction vehicle, but was terribly disappointed at the outcome.  The opening scenes instantly gave me a bad vibe about this film - o.k it is a low budget film but that doesn't  stop it from being good - but the ham acting and bad dialogue does.  This film also tries to win the audience with some badly thought out humour which wasn't close to being witty or sharp.  Allright I hear you say it's just a sci-fi movie but it could have been so much better - what seemed a good idea (spaceship crashing on an unknown planet with several survivors trying to re-launch before the planets 3 suns eclipse and unleash winged beasts who only come out in this period of darkness to kill and destroy etc ), this film tried to play with this idea and failed.  I felt cheated by seeing the trailer before-hand, which showed probably the best clip which lasted 30 seconds (honestly), and had to suffer the remaining 1hr 29 minutes and 30 seconds.  The characters I found laughable; the convict (wanted for murder - which by the way is glorified sadly throughout the movie) who is bad-guy turned good-guy , the English antique dealer ???? (thats what I thought!!), the totally unconvincing captain of the ship - I could go on but I'm not going to.  I honestly am a big sci-fi fan but I would class this as a straight to video release from the eighties ( YES that bad!!) and find the only thing  frightening about it is how this movie has become so successful. The special effects are rubbish and look like  rejects from the Starship Troopers studio and that along with a pathetic script ruins what seemed to be a pretty good idea.

Very Well Done!!!,"In the late 1990's and early 2000's some movies had been made which seemed to try to imitate the greats of science fiction, Lost In Space and Supernova are just two examples of these poor copy-cats.Pitch Black just sitting there on the rental shelf seemed to have a dangerous chance of being one of these duds, but I took the risk anyway.  I am glad I did, because I was dead wrong.Pitch Black is one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen.  Combining great acting, great storyline, and great action, Pitch Black makes for a high quality, satisfying, non-cheesy, flick.  Cheesy being what so many sci-fi movies have come to be.Up-and-coming Vin Diesel as Riddick quietly steals the scene.  An escaped convict being taken back to the slam, Riddick begins the film with his narration, his cyro-sleep speech, if you will.  Diesel's deep, almost mysterious voice absolutely sucks you into the time and place, setting the stage beautifully.  And when he escapes after the crash landing, one thing everyone wanted to do was find him, not necessarily to meet him, but to lock him up again.  At one point our dear friend, Paris, is driven, for certain reasons, from his comfy lawn chair.  As he is talking to the others you suddenly notice that Riddick, unbeknownst to the others, is sitting in Paris's lawn chair, enjoying Paris's beverages.  It was Riddick who told Fry to look deeper in the hole for Zeek.  It was Riddick who had the simply spoken statements bringing what the others dared not think, to words (All you people are so scared of me, most days I would take that as a compliment, but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.)Fry was great.  A courageous young woman trying to, at all costs, get of the desert planet.  Her guilt for trying to drop the live cargo (namely human beings) to save her own skin is what motivates her to do everything in her power to save the survivors.Johns, who was taking Riddick back to the slam, was a flat out jerk, or as Riddick put it ""a blue eyed devil.""  He was meant to be a jerk, and boy was he ever, a well acted jerk at that.Shazza, Zeek, Paris, and the Middle Easterners were very well acted, as were all the above characters.  All of them well developed, well portrayed people.Don't get me started on the kid, Jack.  Jack tried too hard, but you will find Jack very interesting.The storyline held my attention, I didn't find a need to ask myself any questions as the video was rewinding.  The plot was airtight.The movie belonged to Vin Diesel, Fry or no Fry.  He didn't take over the movie, making the others appear miniscule, as could have easily been done. He was fantastic.  I do believe that he just might be the next Arnold, who didn't exactly play a Conan the Destroyer in his come-back movie, End of Days.  His character, Riddick, was very believable.Gore was minimal in the rated version  What was there was not bad, granted it was gross.  A friend of mine, who has seen Alien numerous times, always starts watching it pretty early on in the evening, so she'll have time for the second movie she always needs on Alien nights just to go to sleep.  This is nothing like THAT.  The one scene that made me go all out and declare ""Oh yuck!"" was when, or rather how, Riddick escaped the second time.  Tied, hands behind back, to a pole that didn't quite reach the ceiling, there was only one means of escape.  Purposely dislocating, then relocating, his shoulders, I believe, up and over, he was free.  (Oh yuck!)The editing was beautifully done, quick, not dragging.  One minute you see Shazza staring at the general place in the hole where Zeek met his end, and where he no longer was, the next minute you see Riddick looking emotionlessly at Shazza, and the next minute you see Riddick racing away.Pitch Black is a GREAT movie!!!  Totally worth the rent, or buy, or whatever.  Just don't watch it in the pitch black.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good idea, bad work","Pitch Black is a good example of a movie with a good idea but was down poorly.  It has all the elements of a excellent movie, but it was down so half-assed that it ruins the movie-going experience.  I was extremely dissappointed with Pitch Black.  The special effects were astounding, but they weren't good enough to mask the emotionless and static acting performances. This movie could have been great if only it was directed by someone with a little more experience in the genre.  It's a little sad to think that a film with so much potential could have been an excellent movie if it was directed by someone else.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stunning in every way,"Pitch Black is a movie that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. It makes you really believe what actually makes all those bumps in the night. Brilliant uses of colours light up the screen (literally) and seems to exactly portray the environment that surrounded the characters in the film. From the pitch black darkness to the overwhelming light that the ""three"" suns give off, this film is visually outstanding.Acting, special effects, and a unique and interesting storyline, help boost momentum into this flick. A great movie, and is highly reconmended for sci-fi and horror fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scariest Sci-fi Ever,"This film is not one you would EVER see in the list for Oscars orEmmys. It's one of those ones the critics would loathe. But if you'rein the mood for action, suspense, and a terrifying sci-fi, THISMOVIE IS PERFECT!I cannot think of anyone who would have been better at playing therole of Riddick than Vin Diesel. He's just cool about everything,even when he's an inch from death. A bit like the characters VinnieJones plays, but I cannot see Vinnie Jones playing Riddick.I have seen scarier movies than this, but it is truly a scary movie, inthe style of the monsters leaping out of the darkness, anddreading and not knowing who will die next. Definitely the scariestscience fiction I've ever seen.The aliens are truly brilliantlyanimated, and you would expect them to shriek, but they do not.The sound they do make actually makes it more frightening than ifthey did shriek.The only drawback is that if you have a favourite character, he/shewill most probably get slaughtered at some point.I give it 9/10; it's a great popcorn flick!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I know of better ways to waste 2 hours,"I went to see this film with a hope that I might have been surprised. For the first half of the film I was. I credit the production team with making a great looking first half of a film. The washed out colours and hews helped create an incredible landscape. Unfortunately, once the lights went out this film tumbled into second-rate sci-fi. Pitch Black was not suspenseful. It was not scary. It was laughable. There has to be someone in the entertainment industry that can come up with a better creature than a cross between a hammer head shark and a rooster. The only reasons I gave it a '3' are because of the first half's look and feel, and the credible performances by Vin Diesal and Radha Mitchell.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Some wacked Australian perspective.  Radha Mitchell who was so amazing in High Art is the curvaceous crewmate thrust into the reluctant role of Captain which she continually denies to be.

The basics,This movie is about a merc who has captured riddick and is going to take him back to his cell but with them they have 40+ passengers. They end up on crash landing on a strange and completely dead planet with scary blood thirsty creatures that only come out at night but when an eclipse happens the whole world becomes infested. So then the dieing starts and the movie is basically about getting off of the planet.I enjoyed this movie very much. The script was very cool and Vin Diesel got to say some cool lines. This is definitely a movie that I can watch over and over again. Also seeing the hot bod of Vin is also a turn on for all of us girls.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Dark, tense sci-fi stunner in the tradition of Alien","Some critics will say this movie is derivative of Alien, but it sure was a fun ride.  I have two words for you: Vin Diesel.  Watch him -- he makes this movie more than just another stalk-and-slash exercise.  Some people are calling this ""Scream in Space,"" which I think is unfair.  I loved Scream, but I didn't find this movie to be jokey or littered with pop-culture references.  It is just a tight, well-executed, tense and clever spin on the ""we crash landed on an alien world and now creatures are trying to eat us"" tale.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Glad I Saw it For Free!,"I'm going to make this short and quick since many of the other reviewers made many of the same points that I would.  This film had sparked my interest from the moment the teasers and trailers came out.  Finally, it came to my University where I can watch it for free...and thank goodness it was free.There were many promising characters and a very promising plot.  However, this sci-fi movie fell into the hole of a horrible 'B' movie.  The special effects were great and the action was decent.  The problem lies in the badly developed characters...except for Vin Diesel's.  There seems to be a character to fit every niche of society.  Dialogue between the characters seemed to be forced and rather boring...once again the exception being Diesel.Then there is the over simplified plot.  There is absolutely no thought required to view this film.  As long as one can tell the difference between a human and an alien, you're all set.  Also, if you are looking for a good movie to give you that little scare...don't bother to look here.  The most frightening thing about this movie is that it did so well in theatres.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
an entertaining stylish movie,"If you go and see this film without much expectation, it will amaze you, and if you do, it will still entertain you more than other horror/sci-fi movies, that came out after Aliens.Set up on a barren planet, the lighting, landscape and equipments were stylistically filmed and beautifully set up. The shades of blue, yellow, red and white, polish the film with an edge that is equally balanced with good performances from the mostly not-famous actors.Although there is not much science in this fiction, there are bits of pieces of how the world work in this alternate future. The interaction between the characters and how they quickly work as a team is very well conceived, as it also fills in the lack of background or scientific rationalization of the crew's history, the planet's or the creatures'.Vin Diesel as stated elsewhere, steals the highlight of the movie, with a charismatic presence and a cool portrayal of an anti-hero. There are surprises along the way, with little humour here and there.It could've been longer and more gory, but I guess the director/producer didn't want to overdo it. So when you count on the low bodycounts and how people die, it is not so much of a horror movie as it is more of a survival thriller.My only complaint is that the creatures are animated, so they don't look/feel that threatening, as opposed to Alien/Aliens animatronics, courtesy of Stan Winston.Overall, this is a highly entertaining stylish movie.Log out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A tasty little snack, anyone?","I bought the DVD of Pitch Black yesterday, without seeing the film before hand and so far have watched it twice, which is unusual for a film. I am normally not very complementary about most of the films I watch and had heard mixed revues of the film but I must say that I thought that it was an extremely enjoyable film to watch.  The plot is definitely a no brainer, with most of the tension being character driven.  All the actors in the film are excellent, especially  Vin Diesel playing the convict Riddick, who has to be the best anti-hero since Snake Pliskin in Escape from New York.The films plot reminds me of two films, Aliens and Deep Blue see, almost as good as the former and far better than the latter.  Visually the film has some amazing moments and David Twohy can be extremely proud of what he has put together.  Special praise has to go to the David Eggby and also lighting department, for the excellent cinematography and lighting.  The editing is good, but their are no really scary moments which would make someone jump out of their seats.  The computer stuff is done extremely well and is never aloud to overwhelm the film or over shadow the actors.  The fight sequences are well put together and extremely exciting, especially when Riddick goes one on one, with one of the creatures, maybe the highlight of the movie. Praise, also has to go to Graeme Revell for putting an amazing score to the film, which I now cannot get out of my head.Overall, this is the movie that Alien 3 and 4 should have been, its exciting, thrilling and also stunning to watch.  Pitch Black also shows what can be done with a limited budget, take notice Hollywood.  Definitely a film to watch.  The DVD also has a couple of extremely good commentaries by the cast and crew, which are very useful to all the film students out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
no need to see this movie...,"...if you've seen the following:  Alien, Silence of the Lambs, and Boys Don't Cry.  Pitch Black takes elements from each of these films and combines them with poor acting, a horrible screenplay, a stupid storyline, and cool special effects.  It was also too long, and not gory enough for a movie with killer aliens as an integral part of the plot.  If you need a sci-fi/horror fix rent the Alien series on DVD, dont waste your time with Pitch Black.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
You'll Never Guess Who Makes It Out Alive...,"I would have to say that this movie is outstanding! The first 45 minutes of this movie are totally gripping. Visually, I have never seen a movie like this before, and that's a very generous compliment.This movie has outstanding special-effects. Even though this is a sci-fi spectacle.. there are some outstanding performances here. Australian actress Rhada Mitchell commands your attention as the strong but sometimes insecure Second Commander Fry. You may recognize this actress from the movie ""High Art"", where she also nearly dominated the movie. This movie proves Rhada Mitchell is every bit the leading lady, and I look forward to seeing more from her in the future.Vin Diesel, under-utilized in ""Saving Private Ryan"", also proves he has real acting chops with his performance in ""Pitch Black"", and he has some of the best lines in the movie. I can't quite place the actor, he looks a lot like Matthew McConaughey, but I think his name is Cole Hauser, and he turns in some excellent supporting work in a thankless role where he is primarily the challenger to Second Commander Fry.Sadly, several of the more interesting characters die as the movie progresses, certainly not the ones I would have picked, and the movie ends cynically and on an unpleasant note designed to keep everything open for a sequel, but overall a fantastic and gritty sci-fi actioner that does not let you down, that does not disappoint, that has the real feel, texture and taste of a possible near-future.Whoever handled the cinematography here is worthy of an Academy Award, and would be my ideal selection to film adaptions of any books by Bruce Sterling or William Gibson that ever have the fortune to make it to the silver screen. Excluding ""The Matrix"", also filmed in Australia coincidentally, this is probably the best sci-fi movie made since Robert Zemekis helmed ""Contact.""",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Anyone here heard of alien/aliens?,"Well, what you know. The world has another alien-ripoff sci-fi movie that tries to surprise people with a twist. Yes, this movie is one of the decent ones in its genre, but it still fails to make my spine shiver with horror as did Alien and Aliens, the cult movies of sci-fi horror.The twist in this movie is the murderer, who can see in the dark and how the rest of the group has to depend on his help to get out of the planet they're stuck in. Not wanting to spoil the plot for anyone, but I got serious Deja-Vu when the group of people were reduced one after another. Ok, the actor's aren't that well known (except Claudia Black perhaps, yummy), yet they do rather decent work on the film. Except when it becomes to playing shock/horror at losing someone dear to one etc. At that point the film loses a lot of its creditability.Still, if you like sci-fi, then this film might be worth watching, but have all your lights off before starting the film, you will not be too drawn to atmosphere of this movie unless you are in darkness, with only the dim light of the screen to comfort you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wonderful in Its Way,"Who's soul is so dead that they can't respond to a really fine monster sci-fi movie?The critics were luke warm and the box office wasn't that good either. Bah! What do they know.The opening sequence is simply great cinema. Like the recent Mission to Mars and Red Planet the space ship runs into a meteor shower in the first frame and must land on the nearby planet(this plot device I hereby declare off limits for the next ten years). Of the three films, Pitch Black handles this event by far the best. This is real exciting movie making reminiscent of the plane crash in Alive! or even the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. It's that good.The alien planet and the monsters have real punch. It's true that ecologically speaking both make no sense whatsoever, but you must overlook that little detail just like you overlooked all the extra water in Waterworld. Pitch Black is miles better than Waterworld.One of the joys of this film is that it stars mostly unknowns. It introduces the new star Vin Diesel. He is dynamite. He just oozes menace. In Waterworld the over exposed and ever so sensitive and sympathetic Kevin Costner tried to make us believe he could be cold and heartless. It didn't work. There is some internal resource that Costner lacks that mere acting can't simulate. In the old days Robert Mitchum could do menace. Robert De Niro has made a big career out of his small allocation of natural menace. Diesel is the real thing.This is essentially a 1950's style ""B"" movie made with state of the art special effects and excellent production values. Just great. A hoot.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is not the next ""Aliens"" movie","Actually, I think calling Pitch Black the next Aliens movie is unfair. Ripley and company had some high tech weapons and the Pitch Black crew do not...and therein lies the strength of this movie.  This movie is about characters and characterizations.  Most notable was Vin Diesel as Riddick. I didn't really pay attention to him and his character in Saving Private Ryan but I sure paid attention to his character in Pitch Black!  I thought he was excellent in his portrayal of an amoral murderer going through a metamorphosis...becoming someone with a consience.  If you go to this movie looking for a high tech thriller then don't go see this movie.  If you want to go to a movie to see solid characterizations of people stranded on a planet with little water, few weapons, and a pretty ferocious predator stalking everyone after dark then this is the movie for you.  Some scenes were predictably pat i.e., Riddick grabs one of the creatures before it can get him...you know one predator against another?  Other scenes were rather riveting i.e., Riddick tries to convince Fry to just get on the transport and leave the others behind.  Some aspects of this movie do evoke images from the movie ""Alien"" (the first one) such as sounds and atmosphere (remember the clinking chains in Alien?).  When you hear those scurrying sounds you know its not the pitter patter of little feet. I'd give this movie 7.5 points out of 10.  I'd go see this movie again in a heartbeat.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Okay concept expanded to good movie,"Pitch Black isn't really a classic, but it takes a basic science fictionscenario that's been done to death since Alien in a lot of low-grade B- and Z-movies, and makes it a fairly high-budget decent production with good characterization of most of the players. van Diesel is the definite star and a definite anti-hero (not a villain, really, although people often confuse the two). The rest of the cast isn't really that well developed, and there are some gaps in characterizations (Johns in particular is never really drawn convincingly enough to explain his eventual betrayal).The alien monsters are well-done, although one wonders why the evolved a sensitivity to light on a light-intense planet. There are some other plot holes, such as the fact that the original colony had lights that weren't solar-powered: how'd they all get killed? And sometimes the characters can move around quite easily.  Riddick gets from the cave to the colony pretty easily with no lights, and Fry does the same with one puny little light. And they both get _back_ to the cave. But on the way back with Imam and Jackie they have no end of problems.Still, the movie moves along at a pretty good clip, and there's no character so weak that it really flaws apart. Overall, I'd recommend it to fans of the genre.  It's more action-adventure and horror with sci-fi trappings, though.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
classy,In this day and age producers of sci-fi films think if you stick in some good special effects then you have a good film but miss the point that the story comes first regardless of genre.  Thankfully this film has a cracking storyline and a very good cast which is complemented by the excellent use of special effects.  This film is both entertaining and scary and also demonstrates why Vin Diesel is going to be such a big star.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Eclectic cast clashes and Riddick is awesome,"I thoroughly enjoyed this. Riddick is written well and a straight up badass. He has some great one-liners. I have a lot of good things to say about this. First I want to point out the writing for each character and how they were portrayed. A lot of films think that simply having an eclectic cast will make the movie better or more interesting. Pitch Black is not of those films. The variety in races and accents adds character to an already well-written script. The theme of faith was also presented well and made for some really interesting conversations. This film is one of my favorite examples of the third act being the best. First two acts are great but the third act is just about perfect. ""There is my God, Mr. Riddick."" My only complaint about this film would be the character development and resolution of Johns. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good alien monster flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Aliens"", but with an indy flavor","Very cleverly created, ""Pitch Black"" combines the general premise of ""Aliens"" (shipwrecked on a hostile planet at the mercy of hordes of ravenous monsters) but with the willingness to break the rules and stereotypes found in mainstream movies.The film is artfully done, though sometimes the camera work can get muddled. (I suspect that this is partly deliberate to obscure flaws in the special effects or fight choreography.)  The coloration is brilliant (often literally), and the score adequate.  The sound effects leave something to be desired.  (Every time I heard the creatures, I felt that the heroes were due to have a school of whales decent upon them ...)Still, this had the raw, quirky edge to it found in some of the lesser-known works of Australia and New Zealand, like ""The Quiet Earth"" and ""The Last Wave"".  It's quite scary for most of the film, and while it's not flawless, it deserves quite a lot of credit for what it's accomplished.Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

True science fiction,"There are so few true science fiction movies made, this is one of the very few that passes the bill for me. This is not a disguised horror film, though it certainly drifts that way quite a bit. It is certainly not a science film - much is implausible - what do those tens of thousands of indigenous creatures eat when there aren't a handful of humans on the planet and mass extinction is obviously in progress? Let along how do three suns revolve around a group of planets (Newton would shudder in his grave)? But this film does the one thing science fiction is supposed to do - and does it well. It creates an alternative reality and lets you imagine real humans living in it. The alternative reality works, and the psychological elements of the drama are icing on the cake. As a lifelong science fiction fan (in written form), my disappointment at the weakness of science fiction in film is nearly endless. This film encourages me. It is part way there. I'm looking to seeing the sequels (and probably will soon). I would also rate movies such at 13th Floor, Contact, Mission to Mars (and of course, Forbidden Planet) in that class - true science fiction films, as well as the more popular and mainstream original three Star Wars movies and the Alien series.... but not a great deal else....

An impressive homage to the genre,"Truth to be told, I went into ""Pitch Black"" unsure of what to expect.  I'd read a couple of reviews in the paper, largely forgotten shortly thereafter, and naturally seen the previews and ads.  Given how movies have disappointed in the past, these days I go into theatres with as few expectations as possible.I was thoroughly impressed by this movie.In the tradition of Aliens, Predator, and the like, Pitch Black makes a fine addition to the genre.  All such films share some common factors -- unknown beasties, a limited area in which to move, and people getting killed off in sundry nasty ways.  But although the basis is similar, the plot and implementation was still impressive.  The cinematography and imagery were superb, the acting excellent, and the special effects impressive.  (My primary concern with effects-generated beasties is whether or not you can tell it was effects-generated, that is, does it look like a Harryhausen stop-motion beast.  Pitch Black passed that test with flying colours.)I have to give a nod to Vin Diesel, who probably was a significant part of why this film was as good as it was.  Each of the main characters had their flaws nonetheless, Vin stands out above the rest of the pack, and not merely in physical stature (though that certainly was a part of it).  In sheer presence and in deeds his was the character that had the audience's attention.  The entire theater was clapping and cheering at one point!This movie portrays an interesting trinity of protagonists and how they react to the situation they've been placed in.  The ""taste"" of the movie, if you can consider it so, was savory and thick.  It's certainly the best sci-fi movie I've seen since ""The Matrix"" -- ""The Phantom Menace"" was shallow and ephemeral, ""Galaxy Quest"" was decent but too much of a satire to find a place in my memory, ""eXistenZ"" was too bizarre, ""The Astronaut's Wife"" possessed of a weak storyline, ""The 13th Floor"" not bad, but too predictable- you get the picture.  And let's not even talk about ""Supernova"".The only real difficulty I had with it was the choppy editing during the first 20 minutes or so.  A few more moving shots, used to emphasise transitions, would have upped my rating that final point.Overall:  9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This one has 'Cult Film' written all over it!,"I just saw this film and it is great! It's not perfect, but it comes close. It's got a monster that lurks around just off screen and that appears only briefly. This is not a disappointment...it's a cool device for keeping the mystery going.  It's got a heroic anti-hero. A killer with a heart o' gold. Vin Diesel kicks serious ass as the lead character Richard Riddick. When he's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else. The dialog is filled with lines that you'll soon be hearing everywhere. Diesel's raspy voice intoning ""You're not afraid of the dark, are you?"" puts him firmly in the One-Liner Pantheon with Willis, Stallone, and Schwarzenegger.  Other characters hold their own, (I enjoyed Keith David's portrayal of the Imam. His voice is great too, for the record.) but this is Diesel's film and he runs with it. He's got a couple other movies out right now but this one will blow him out into the mainstream. Go see this one, ya'll! It won't disappoint you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Excellent Sci-Fi flick that doesnt bite Alien too hard....,"I had my doubts. Another space movie with people trying to dodge bloodthirsty aliens. I kept thinking back to Outer Space movies like Event Horizon and Alien 3 and wondered why I was giving this tired genre yet another shot at winning me over. I must admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised after I saw Pitch Black. My first thought upon sitting down in the theatre was that the 3 or so movie previews that I saw would have summed up the best parts in the movie, but not in this case. The movie doesnt fall prey to starting slowly and ending quickly as most Space thrillers do (Before you shake your head no, think of the last couple space movies you saw...zzzzz) Pitch Black jumps you right into the action.. Good performances by a virtually unknown cast (at least to me). With the exception of Vin Diesel and Keith David, I didnt much recognize many of the other thespians' roles in movies except for some bit parts. The movie has some excellent special effects but doesnt fall prey to overusing them like in Event Horizon or (to a lesser extreme) Supernova. Overall, this movie has repeat watching written all over it. It isnt the best Ive ever seen, but it did what most others fail at doing.....It entertained me.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Gigantic Disappointment!,"I expected Pitch Black to be entertaining, fun and horrific. It was neither of them, and it has few good things about it.After a freak mishap, a spaceship crash lands on a desolate planet. The survivors include an escaped convict (Vin Deisel), his captor, and a bunch of devout Muslims among others. This unlikely collection of people have to team up together when they realise that the planet they have landed on not only has no water, but it is also infested with a bunch of nasty aliens intent on eating them. These aliens don't like the light, so it's a good job the system's three suns ensure 24 hours a day light ... or at least, that is, until a total eclipse arrives.This is basically an Alien clone done in a dumb-ass I've-seen-it-all-before style. There is one good performance from Diesel, who was given a poor script and crap, newcomer co-stars with no potential or future. There are no scary or tense scenes in the film, just a mix of moving shadows, slimy tenticles and objects going through people's stomachs, which isn't disgusting at all, just, embarrassing, try-hard horror. The use of colour is unwatchable and the cinematography is blurry and done in a boring way, unlike most horror films. The set decoration and art direction are neither bad, but they can barely save the film.Seriously not worth your time. You have been warned.I rate Pitch Black 2 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

You can cut the suspense with a knife, while clutching your significant other in terror of these fantastical creatures (reminiscent of Alien). I would see this movie again and again!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vin Diesel not enough to save this turkey!,"One of the truly bad first films of 2000.  Weak, hackneyed plot, stock characters, stiff dialogue, illogical premise(even for a sci-fi film set on another planet) and an ending that's disappointing and non-sensical.  From the opening sequences of this low-budget rip and run nod to Alien, I found myself hoping against hope that rag-tag band of refugees might actually bite the dust sooner rather than later.  The only thing that made this film remotely enjoyable was the charismatic, sexy presence of Vin Diesel.  Even he labored under the ridiculous storyline and inane dialogue.  Take my advice, save your eight dollars.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sci-fi fans will love it,"If you read the comments, you'll see that this is a ""love it or hate it"" flick.  If you're a sci-fi fan who liked Alien, you should love it.  With the exception of the Matrix and Star Wars, science fiction just doesn't get any better than this.  Packed with tension and not completely predictable, I found it scary and not at all boring.  Clearly some deep thought went into the morphology and habits of the aliens.  The main human characters were more than one dimensional stereotypes, as you get peeks at details of their personalities that conflict with your first impressions of them.  But clearly some of you will hate it, so if you don't like sci-fi or didn't like Alien, steer clear.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Despite what some critics may say, it's a great movie!","I find it easy to understand why many critics don't like this movie.  It's not the most original movie ever created.  At times it can be far from scientifically accurate.  But it's a Sci-Fi movie, so who cares?  Just because a few things might not be possible, doesn't mean it ruins the movie. If you really stop and think about it, half the stuff in most sci-fi's are impossible.Ignoring the complaints, I rented this movie and highly enjoyed the whole thing.  Start to finish I was paying great attention to the movie.  The actors and actresses did an amazing job and it shows.  The use of light isn't always perfect, but it can be stunning at times.In my opinion, to really enjoy this movie wait until you are in a good mood and have time to set back and relax.  Then, just enjoy it.  Don't try and pick out all the little details that's wrong, and don't spend the whole time comparing it to the sci-fi movies that came before it.  There is a lot of great acting and a interesting story in this movie.  And to make the whole thing even better, the special effects are at times stunning.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Nice (ha, ha)!","I actually like this little sci-fi thriller. It's very psychological, in-your-face without being excessively graphic or mystically weird. It has some nice suspense moments, good character tension, tight action scenes and a few neat little twists. (They surprised me at any rate; the characters who survive to the end aren't the ones I'd usually expect).I thought the color filter tricks and warped lenses got a bit annoying. And also some of the arguments felt a little over-forced; but I've come to expect that from low budget fare.All I can say is I've seen a few better, and many a heck of a lot worse than this one!

Just when they're about to lose you...,"I went to see this movie with two friends of mine and was not sure what to expect. I got the feeling during the whole movie that, just when I thought, ""This could get cheesy really quick at this point,"" I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn't. This could have been a really bad movie with very little effort, but, instead, it turned out to be a good, solid piece of work that kept me interested in what happened to the characters the whole time. Granted, there were a couple of characters that I hoped wouldn't die but did, but there were also a couple of characters I ended up hoping would get horribly eviscerated and, thankfully, they were. I'm confused as to how this movie gets called ""scary"" by some. Full of nasty, dangerous situations at practically every moment in the movie, yes, but scary?

"Are you afraid of the dark?, I am now!","I watched this after seeing Fast and Furious which instantly made me a fan of Vin Diesel purely because he is an action star with acting ability, a distinctive voice well suited to the genre and impeccable timing of his line delivery. In Pitch Black he excellently plays the likeable baddie Riddick with a frightening menace and charisma. THe film was only 22 million but this doesn't show woth the superb speccial effects that put some big budget films to shame. Aswell as the effects there is a decent atmosphere to the film and Twohys direction was excellent. All in all I highly recommend this it is simply put a sci-fi classics.

It is a Science-Fiction film with elements of action and horror. With Vin Diesel in one of his best performances, David Twohy has achieved making it, in my opinion, one of the finest action movies of year 2000. Probably the biggest advantage of this film is it's original story and pretty cool visual effects. If you'are not expecting a master-piece, you might just like it. Like any other horror movie it is full of blood and violence, so I wouldn't recommend it to people that don't stand those kind of stuff, but for those that do, take a look at this one!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Painful would be a complement,"This movie could have been very good.  Unfortunately, it was some of the worst trash I have ever seen on the big screen.  The photography/effects were interesting at times, but most of the time it seemed to be there just to say ""we're so cool, we can shake our camera and do flash edits!""  The worst part of the movie was the writing.  Every single piece of ""dialog"" was an idiotic one-liner.  The characters were one-dimensional, and some of them were even less.  The Muslim kids served no purpose except to act as ""red shirts"".This is a movie that had it been well written and shot with a little more restraint, could have been up there as one of the best sci-fi movies.

"Movie over, ""Supernova""","During the past few years, an alarming trend of movies with respectable cast lists, massive special effects budgets, and little or no plot has swept through the Hollywood scene. Such examples include ""Godzilla,"" ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,"" and the recent example of cinematic stupidity, ""Supernova."" Those who felt completely ripped off by ""Supernova"" should go to see ""Pitch Black.""  The ""Pitch Black"" experience will remove the sour taste left by ""Supernova."" In an age where character development has been all but forgotten, ""Pitch Black"" returns to us our ability to develop a kinship (or in some cases, disgust) toward the actors on the screen.  Another selling point for this movie is a genuine trace of realism; although the story doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd like it to, it concludes in a way that is believable and reasonable, with just a hint of Romanticism.  Vin Diesel, Rhada Mitchell, and Keith David are superb. All in all, an extreme movie experience for any fan of the ""Alien"" series or ""Starship Troopers.""

A Reason to cheer for the bad guy,"In most cases, the villains in movies are made to be hated but for Pitch Black it's different. Vin Diesel is perfect as the villain as his voice is cold and his acting is dark. You couldn't help but to cheer for the villain. The story is similar to Alien but expanded to a greater scale. The killer aliens didn't look threatening at first but after a while their deadliness was up there with the alien from Alien. Cole Hauser's performance would make anyone hate his character. The chemistry between Hasuer and Diesel in their fight scene reminded me of the ""grudge match films"" such as Demolition Man, Face/Off, Broken Arrow, Universal Soldier, and Virtuosity. The film itself had a shock ending, but I'm not gonna tell you, just go watch it. Better yet, just go buy it. It's worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Movie!,"I'm astonished that Pitch Black didn't do better, it was a wonderfully realistic and well written movie!  And why can't people just enjoy the darn flick?  People say the science is bad.  WRONG!  Gravity is what holds planets around a sun.  If the planets are dense enough or big enough and the suns are small or less dense, than they very well CAN rotate around planets! Nobody even mentions the glow-slugs later!  Of course it makes sense that on a planet like this evolution would create phosphorescence as a defense mechanism.  Lovely detail! And quit whining about contrived plots and ripoffs!  You CANNOT make a movie today without ripping something off! For everyone who called this movie a wannabe or compared it to Aliens or the Matrix, I hate to break it to you, but the critters from aliens were almost IDENTICAL to a critter in a novel called Voyage of the Space Beagle by AE van Vogt written at least 20 years before Alien came out.  Likewise, the Matrix was ripped off from an RPG called Shadowrun which was released in the mid 80's!  And yes, it seems a little hokey that they just happened to crash in the 22nd year when the darkness came, but you'll notice in Alien that out of the whole gigantic refinery ship, the creature just happened to hide in the little teeny-weeny lifeboat ship.  And the queen in Aliens just happened to hide in the one place where they couldn't get her without killing themselves  And finally as for those who say the characters are shallow. When was the last time you saw a character admit they did something stupid? (Fry crawling down the hole) or when survivors thanked the pilot for the extremely tough job she did of keeping some of them alive in the crash instead of ""oh, great babe! ya really screwed us over with that pro landing!""  And Riddick was still a nasty guy at the end, he was just starting to change and soften a little.  Kurt Russell overcame 35+ years of ironclad conditioning and mind control in just a few weeks in Soldier!  So everyone out there that keeps complaining about unreal this, and shallow that, save your money and watch ""The Real World"" on MTV.  Those of you that can open your mind and just enjoy the great fiction, put Pitch Black at the top of your must see scifi!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

New contender for booooooooring film of the century...,"Wow. Where to begin?Awful. Terrible. Abominable. Deplorable. Depressing. Atrocious. Dire. Makes-you-want-to-gouge-out-your-own-eyes.None of these describe how bad this film was. Actually, that last one isn't far off. It also makes you want to eat the fecal matter of a dog, purely in the hope that you'll pass out and miss the remainder of the film. But that's not important right now.What is important is that anyone who has so far survived the horror that is watching Pitch Black needs to be warned of its terribleness, just in case someone tries to rope them into giving it a try. Be warned, this film is on a par with suicide.Okay, my first gripe with this 'film' - for lack of a better word - was Vin Diesel's 'acting' - for lack of a better word. Diesel played Riddick, your average meathead/murderer/rebel/loose cannon/outlaw character. A generic Hollywood schmoe, Riddick was a convict, whom the crew of a crashed ship had agreed to free on the condition that he helped them escape the strange, hostile planet. He sulks around like a bitch on her period, acting tough and spinning cheesy one-liners. Yawn.So, how much did this film want to be Alien? I score it 7/10 on the trying-to-be-like-Alien scale. I would give it full points, but the other three points were spent trying to be like Sphere. Man, this film just wanted to be every good sci-fi film, and instead just ended up recycling typical science fiction B-S. The writing was just lazy. I can only imagine the plot was conceived by people that still use crayons and think it's okay to bite people that steal play-time snacks.To writer/director David Twohy I say this...welcome to Yawnsville, population: You. Seriously, well done on making quite possibly the most boring and crap film I have ever seen. It takes real stupidity to make a film this bad, and boy, do you have stupidity in abundance.

A perfect sci-fi movie,"If you're a science fiction fan, and you've only seen this movie once, please, PLEASE go and treat yourself to a second viewing. I just did, and I was AMAZED about how good I thought the movie was, as opposed to when I first saw it three years ago. The first time around I was certainly impressed by the astronomical vistas we're treated to in this movie, but by and large I didn't think that much of the movie as a whole. It was an Alien rip-off, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light was something I found especially ridiculous. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie a 5.However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way, and the movie poster for that one looks amazing, I thought I'd better brush up on Pitch Black once more, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I am so glad I did. There's so much of what I thought I remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. This was not so. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. This was not so. I thought Riddick was the sole survivor. This was not so.I see now that the movie works *extremely* well. There isn't an excessive, tiresome focus on the monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and believable, such as the shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on, and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet, and so they turn on each other.And I have to mention the astronomical vistas again. I mean, we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a comet's tail, with bits of spacedust zapping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwrecked people think it's about to get dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the huge, neighboring, ringed gas giant rise across the sky, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship skid closely above one of these very rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movie that really made such a point out of including these things. I hope we see much more of it in the sequel.Pitch Black now gets from me a rating of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You bet!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"This movie had so much potential, but it wound up being just another boring bad guy hero movie with cheesy special effects.","There was just too much corny tough guy stuff in this movie for it to be regarded as anything more than something to keep your eyes busy for a couple hours (""He didn't know who he was f**kin' with""). Way to go Vin, you sure showed that alien who is boss. But who cares? The special effects in this movie were a terrible attempt to make up for lousy acting, and they weren't even very good. The best effect they probably had was the extremely high-key lighting to give the effect of multiple suns. But the acting and even the story were definitely mediocre.If you find yourself sitting in the theater and Pitch Black is about to start, you might as well sit through it. It's worth that much.

Are you afraid of the dark?,"A group of colonists become stranded on a world lit by three suns after a meteor storm strikes their ship.  One of the passengers is a multiple murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his captor, Johns (Cole Hauser).Your first instinct on seeing this scenario is that Riddick is going to escape and there'll be a desperate attempt to recapture him, the other survivors being picked off one by one.  But Riddick and the heat aren't the worst of the crash survivors problems.The film is beautifully shot, the lighting produced by the three suns is fantastic.  The cast, a lot of them first time in a big film are great and the script does them justice.The absolute star, aside from the planets inhabitants, is Diesel.  He has an absolute hold on the camera; it seems to gravitate to him at every opportunity.  He also doesn't let Riddick's basic character go.  Riddick is evil, and right up until the end you never feel he's changed.As a sci-fi movie the effects are another key part.  These enhance the story without being overly intrusive.  The monsters are also well produced and seem alive.The editing is tight and allows the movie to linger when it needs to and zoom out of hand at other moments.  The only slight concern is the shakey camera work.  Those with a sensitive stomach may want to look away.A very good film indeed.  Comparisons with Alien and its sequels will be made, but Pitch Black is a film in its own right and deserves consideration.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pitch Black is lean and mean. It doesn't waste time being anything other than a horror/thriller.,"Pitch Black is surprisingly good for such an obvious b-movie. Usually in this type of movie, producers, trying to sell an extra scene of gore, sex, or fright, will allow some bad writing or trite cliche to spoil the story. But Pitch Black is relentless in its integrity; it's lean and mean and it doesn't waste time being anything other than a horror/thriller.Pitch Black takes place on an alien planet where the bones of land leviathans lay in the desert. Passengers on a wrecked spaceship must survive the planet's heat, an escaped violent prisoner, and whatever terrors might be found on the planet's surface.In everything it does, Pitch Black is successful. For example, it opens with a crash scene, and the ""special effects"" are very well done. The effects were clearly not expensive, but they were effective, melding editing, acting, and sound into a tense, plausible scene. The cinematography of the film is an interesting cross between Saving Private Ryan (with strobe-like footage from a fast-shutter camera) and Three Kings (giving the alien planet a bleached, sun-baked look). Finally, some very good sound editing makes the film seem just otherworldly enough to remind you the setting is not Earth -- like the simple sound of a gunshot sweetened with an eerie bird-shriek.Pitch Black quietly opened in early 2000, then quietly faded away. Now that it's on video, perhaps it will get the audience it deserves. Unless you're squeamish, give this horror/thriller a look.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Slow Action, Mindless Sci-Fi","Pitch Black can't decide what it wants to be: an intriguing, smart sci-fi film or a fun, relentless action flick.  It tries to too little to be both and fails to be either.When a spaceship carrying dangerous criminal Diesel crash lands on three-sunned, desolate planet, the crew attempts to find a way off. However, they discover the seemingly-lifeless planet is inhabited by vicious, deadly, nocturnal creatures, and they have unluckily landed in time for a total eclipse.The story has promise, since we expect the crew of misfits will band together and try to fend off the aliens in a hugely exciting way.  Instead, what we get is a film that plods along for half of its way with bantering, lame dialogue, unappealing characters and long, stretched out pointless conversations about planning and gathering supplies.  We are also introduced to the crew of the ship, all one-dimensional characters who we could care less about.  Just for the heck of it, we also see children in danger.Director by David Twohy, Pitch Black could have benefited from more chaotic, gripping scenes of the crew attempting to survive the hideous, stealthy beasts.  Instead, he tries to make the film brainy and it fails miserably. We are treated to excruciatingly dull dialogue interspersed with long pauses, outbursts of profanity, and gore aplenty.  Vin Diesel, the only actor amongst the sun-bleached cast, is the only one who comes off as somewhat intriguing and appealing, but it's mostly because of his physical attributes.  The special effects also fall curiously flat, with the aliens coming off as cartoons.Pitch Black could have been a wild, thrilling, even scary movie if Twohy had decided to make the dialogue terse, added more action sequences, or given the characterizations more weight. Instead, the film decides to plod along, falling prey to the Hamlet syndrome: that is, thinking too much and not doing anything.3 out of 10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rock on with your badness!!,"I am a big fan of movies all together and and I especially like those cheesy action/sci-fi movies full of errors and bad acting. And that is exactly what I had in mind for Pitch Black when i bought it at Best Buy. I had never seen but I figured that i knew what i was in for when I saw that it only cost $9.99. So I picked up a copy, dragged it home, and thoroughly enjoyed the next hour and forty minutes. The beginning is a little thin and extremely circumstantial, but it is easy to get past that because with out it there would be no movie.

"Hollywood - Get over Aliens, Please!","Pitch Black - Hollywood, Get Over Aliens Already!Aliens was a great movie, probably the best sequel ever and on its own one of the best action movies ever made. Having said that, I think its time that Hollywood moves on and gets over it. There will never be another movie in this genre that is as good as Aliens, so any derivative of Aliens is a pointless waste of time and money. I'd rather watch a good movie again than see a bad remake of that movie, so the next time a film like Pitch Black comes along I'll simply pull out my dusty copy of Aliens and save myself the 8 bucks.This is more a criticism of Hollywood than anything else, I'm sure it must be hard to come up with a premise that involves aliens on a distant planet that does not in some way pay homage to a movie like Aliens or Alien. For me it was hard not to draw parallels between this film and the movies I grew up with, and it was impossible for me to see it as an original plot concept. Do the aliens in these shows ever do anything besides eat people? I mean, is that their sole function in life? Lets think of something more interesting for the monsters to do in the next Aliens rip-off. Maybe the aliens aren't hungry at all, or if they are hungry, maybe all they eat is people's shoes and socks. Now we're getting somewhere.The premise.Humans in the future without enough navigational sense to stay clear of solar systems when traveling at near light speed, crash on an unnamed, unknown planet in a strange solar system that for some bizarre reason has 3 suns. I don't know why the producers went with 3 suns as opposed to 2 suns, especially considering the fact that most solar systems are in fact binary, except to maybe make the little ones in the audience say ""Aw cool, 3 suns!"" The survivors, who are not very bright to begin with, are then presented with the extra little problem of having an escaped murder loose amongst them. His name is Riddick and for the first ½ hour of the movie they look around for him instead of looking for food or water! Lets get our priorities straight shall we? First thing you do after crashing on an alien planet is look for food we all know that, then you see how much Diet Dr. Pepper survived the crash of course, then you look for the escaped murders.. Sheesh. Where did these people learn to forage?Let the clichés begin!Of course the planet is totally dead with no water and no apparent life or ecosystem, and yet low and behold there is a breathable atmosphere! What a shock. Also with 3 suns it's only just a little hotter than Earth in summer, how convenient! I'd think that 3 suns might make for some interesting plot twists about the crew fighting over the shady spot, but sadly nothing that interesting occurs in the film. At one point the survivors come across a vast field of bones, presumably from the herds of animals that once roamed this planet with 3 suns and no water. Exactly how vast herds of giant herbivores would evolve in a desert is not as interesting to the crew as how the skeletons are all lined up, as if they died at the same time standing up. Foreshadowing, what a concept! The high school English teacher of the movies writer must be so proud. Later on we find out that there is a whole species of underground carnivores who are just waiting for the lights to go out so they can feast upon the multitude of juicy humans who crash land on their nasty little planet every so often. Oh yes, I can see how 6 or 7 dehydrated humans every few years could sustain a huge group of meat eating, shade loving monsters for years to come. Humans would have to be pretty filling for that to be true, especially when you consider that these voracious creatures have seemingly eaten all other life on the planet. Wouldn't they have eaten themselves into extinction? Apparently not. The monsters are also afraid of light, or are harmed by it or something, the bottom line is they just don't like light ok? So our humans are safe as long as there is a lot of light, and in a 3-sun solar system that doesn't seem to be a problem.But luckily for us the crash happens just hours before a once-every-22-year eclipse that the beasties have been waiting for so they can get out of their shady holes and eat all the starving, dehydrated, hapless, defenseless humans that have crash landed on their dusty little planet. This eclipse does not cover just one sun, or even 2 suns. Astoundingly it covers a remarkable 3 suns, go figure. That coincidence is not as great as them crashing only a few yards from an abandoned mining camp, where they learn all about the impending eclipse from a home made model of the solar system made by the previous owners of the camp. The miners were also in the process of leaving the camp in a spaceship they had, but didn't quite make it. These people had a spaceship, A Spaceship! And they had to build a little mock solar system out of foam balls and coat hangers? Isn't this supposed to be the future, couldn't they have figured out the alignment of the planets from the computer on their.. Spaceship??? Did I mention they had a spaceship? If I had a spaceship I don't think I'd go be a miner on some weird planet with no water and lots of monsters. I'd keep looking till I found a planet with lots of water, and no monsters. Then I'd relax and get a job making web pages, or their future equivalent. This is supposed to be the future right?So the crew is then eaten one by one in various gory but uninteresting ways, and since the characters are so profoundly un-heroic and uninteresting, we really don't care. In fact we want them to get eaten so we can see the creatures do their thing some more. At one point you start rooting for the monsters so you can hear the gory body breaking noises.Here comes another criticism of Hollywood, can't they think of something more frightening than being eaten? People just aren't as scared of being chewed on as they were back in the 70's when Jaws came out, and they have been getting gradually less and less terrified of it for the last 30 years. I personally am not very worried about being swallowed whole or ripped apart by a huge beast in my every day life. Maybe if I was a Lion tamer or a Crocodile wrangler this movie might scare the pants off me! But as I am a graphic designer by trade I'd be much more scared of a movie about computers that come to life and start making artistic designs on their own, putting me out of work. Well its more likely than anything that happens in Pitch Black.How could this movie have been made better?I'm glad you asked. Well for starter lets stop making the bad guy in movies look like a wrestler. I know wrestling is very popular right now and all that, but in reality no one looks like these people. And people who look like the bad guy in this movie are generally speaking not very tough, they just work out with weights a lot. The toughest people I have even seen are bikers, and if you have seen what they look like you know they don't spend too much time in a gym. Or conversely you could make him look like a totally normal person, that way when he does turn out to be an exceptionally talented murder the audience would be forced to say, ""Gee, he looks like a totally normal person. How could he be such an exceptionally talented murderer?""Too much foreshadowing!They spent so much time at the beginning of the movie trying to make the planet look scary that by the time the scary stuff happened, it wasn't a surprise. It would have been better if there were hints of something bad that had happened in the past, but making it obvious that something bad had occurred made it very anti-climactic when it all came down. I would have liked to see the ecosystem in some state of recovery from the last time there was an eclipse. That would have given the nasty critters something else to do besides harass our hapless crash victims, they could have chased around the other animals and wreaked a little havoc on the environment rather than just play chase the humans. That might have made the creatures seem more real rather than just 2 dimensional hapless human harassers. Also, I think the creatures should have been in hibernation waiting for the next eclipse, rather than skittering around in the tunnels. How would they findenough food between eclipses with all the animals that did live on the surface being dead and all?Live humans are more interesting than dead ones.For example the people from the mining camp would have been more interesting if they were alive, like walking around and doing stuff. Maybe they would have seen the crash and gone out to rescue any survivors, now that sounds like something live humans would do. This would have been better than the cliché of ""we crash landed only feet or inches from a settlement, lucky us.""We crash-landed, we have no way home.sob, sob.This is such a tired premise, especially when 30 minutes into the film they do find a way to get home and it becomes a plot device. (i.e. we have to drag the power cells from the crashed ship to the new ship, etc. etc. etc.) Come on! Make it a scientific mission that's there to study the eclipse or something, that would have defused the cliché of ""Hey cool, we arrived here just in the nick of time to witness a once in a thousand year cosmic event"".How are the Special Effects?I have no idea, I couldn't see them. Basically the plot revolves around the fact that these nasty critters only come out when its pitch black... need I say more? Literally there is not one shot of a full monster in the light, so all you ever see is them in silhouette.In closing I'll just say this, its not a scary or entertaining movie but if you can get into a matinee for $3.00 I say go for it. You'll have fun at least trying to comprehend how anyone as stupid as the people in this movie ever learned how to fly spaceships in the first place.Lobo69",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty surprising big studio horror/scifi,"Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy, who has worked as a screenwriter on several films, like G.I. Jane and the new Below. He directed this and I must say I'm pleased to see the film is this effective. The story begins weirdly as we don't know what's going on. It is better to know as little as possible about this film before watching it, so I won't tell you too much. The spaceship crashes into a strange planet in which there seems to be sunny all the time and no nights at all. Soon the darkness begins to threaten and the real hellish nature of the planet starts to reveal and the nightmare begins.There are many great scenes in Pitch Black and especially the use of camera is marvelous. The fast edits are stylish and they are not used too much and they don't irritate. The use of light, shadow and darkness is so effective that the viewer will be on the edge of the seat. It is great to see that Hollywood still manages to release something this interesting and ""marginal."" As we learn what the real threat in the planet is, the tension just raises as the enemy is too strong (and hungry) for the crew members..Also, the sound effects are very creepy and sometimes reminded me of the power of Japanese film Ringu by Hideo Nakata. Technically this film should please demanding fans of horror cinema, too, and don't be turned off about the big studio status of the film.The atmosphere in the planet is VERY scary and the feeling of Hell is touchable. There is a real terror and horror present, and in fact, I hadn't seen anything this effective for some time, at least from Hollywood. There are few stupid cliches that should have been left away, but it seems to be always the case with these kind of films. The film is not too clever or intelligent, and it works mainly in the level of cinematic power and pure terror experience. The effects are great and gore is stylish and not too over the top or laughable. At least the ""head bite"" scene is inventive and memorable. Couple of scenes are very disturbing and scary and they only add to the power of the whole movie.8/10 rating is deserved and this should be seen in big screen (or at least in Widescreen) as that way Pitch Black would be even more effective experience. More this kind of films from Hollywood!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Vin Diesel, as we all remember him, Tough, hard and without mercy, the bad guy you hate to love or was it the other way around?","This is no ordinary movie, not one bit. In fact, it is  one of the most exiting movies I have ever seen in quite some time. It starts when a ship filled with convicted criminals and tourists crashes on a lifeless planet with three suns. They are forced to adapt to the harsh planet fast, or they will die. Even after they adapted themselves, their continuance of life is not a fact. When darkness falls the monsters appear. When mysterious deaths and the use of every possible help they can get, they release the chains of convicted murderer Richard B Riddick ; Whos eyes was surgically enhanced when told he was never to see light again so long as he lived ; Played superbly by actor Vin Diesel which made a real breakthrough with this movie. This saga contains everything, betrayal, plotting, and the uncertainty of which really the bad guy is. This movie is borne by the magnificent work by the director David N. Twothy. It never grow dull or predictable. Techincally the film is very good, the three suns shining bright, the pitch darkness and the monsters that overwhelm the planet with their horrific sounding ultra-sound they use to 'see'. It fits under the genre Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller which in other words mean that it is extremely thrilling and entertaining. The elaborate special effects,amazing story and great acting makes this movie a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Incredible, Cinematic Sci-Fi","I've read comments from others on this movie, and it really frustrates me that so many of the IMDB users just don't get it.This is an incredible film: intelligent, funny, scary, touching, tense and thought-provoking, all in no particular order.These characters are real characters, not just stock, by-the-book regular characters that you only care about because the actors who play them are on the cover of Entertainment Weekly.The thought put into these characters, as well as the ecological structure of the planet (not to mention the opening crash landing), is clearly more in-depth than some viewers (both at the box office and on the IMDB) are giving it credit for.  Anyone who paid attention in school can hopefully interpret what they see on the screen, and see how much thought David Twohy and the other writers put in to how these creatures would evolve in such an environment, and how the rest of the planet-- visiting humans, or otherwise-- would react.So the premise isn't 100% believable, but that's a nitpicky excuse from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.  Humans can't travel between solar systems, EITHER, but no one thought to comment on THAT.  It's a freakin' movie folks, certain things have to be accepted.  This ship is going from Planet A to Planet B, and they crashed on a planet that has comparable gravity and atmosphere to Earth, and it's got 3 suns.  Stranger things happen on Star Trek and I don't see a single negative comment THERE... heck, it's even more improbable that an Alien (1979) could have acid for blood, but everyone bought that without batting an eyelash.Ignore the Nitpicky comments you see on this site.  This is a well-thought out, character-driven sci-fi story that I was riveted too, both by the characters, and the amazing visual images that Twohy has brought to the screen.  If ""The Arrival"" was only a glimmer of his writing/directing talent, this is a full-on assault on the nerves of any self-respecting movie-goer... I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.Oh, and the moral lesson at the end.  It succeeded where Saving Private Ryan failed completely.  And if you don't know what that means, you're one of the people I'm taking a shot at.9/10.  Sure it's not making money, but neither did Fight Club.  History will decide.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a horror, but a great thriller","I was very excited to watch this film as it had excellent reviews and all my friends said it was great however I must point out something. For all the reviews saying this film is a horror is incorrect, it isn't. What it is, is a fantastic sci-fi thriller. I feel that Riddick is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a movie he's very interesting to learn about and I can't wait for Riddick: Pitch Black 2, hopefully it will give me more information about him. I was a little annoyed with the lighting at first but when it all goes dark the film is great",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Effective B-movie,"PITCH BLACK delivers on several levels. Imaginative FXs, thrilling concept, excellent cinematography and good actors. But this is a B-movie nonetheless, not that there's anything wrong with that. The thing that keeps this from being a grade A movie is the constant use of cheesy excuses for stretching the story, the lack of focus on certain aspects of the story, the director's attempts to make the movie look groovy (distortion in images, etc) and the sometimes cheap looking sets (for instance, some seats looked like they were bought at Office Depot). But the whole movie still works, thanks mainly to the director's respect for sci-fi genre, but more importantly, because of the presence of Vin Diesel, who literally became a star after playing Riddick. Vin steals the movie and his excellent performance elevates what could have been a standard sci-fi B-movie into an above average sci-fi B-movie. Juxtaposing the menacing flying aliens with the dangerous character of Riddick was a brilliant idea. As Riddick keeps saying, ""it ain't me you should be worrying about.""The actors were mostly all good, certainly the top trio, Vin, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser. All three actors made a good impression, even though the movie clearly belongs to Vin.As for the flying aliens, they basically look like THE BIRDS on steroids. They're effective but not 100% menacing. The main problem with them is they're rarely the same size throughout the movie. For instance, at the beginning, the alien creatures look very small when they killed the woman but later on during the film, the creatures suddenly look bigger and more ALIEN-like.But this is just some minor details to be expected from a B-movie. All in all, PITCH BLACK is a nifty little sci-fi movie that mostly deliver and is worth watching. I even bought the DVD after renting it a couple of years ago.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tour de Force - Heart stopping action,"The one thing you'll have to remember when seeing any kind of film, is just what kind of film you are seeing!This is a Science fiction / Horror movie, and my review is based on it being this genre. So Expect some of the characters to be a little one dimensional, and the script to contain a contradiction or two.All that aside ""Pitch Black"" is a very good movie!If you liked Alien (the first) you'll love Pitch Black. A cargo ship carrying 40 passengers crashes to a desert planet. In the crash a killer in the same weight class as Hannibal (if not in sophistication then certainly in blood lust) escapes. We soon see that he is the least of the survivors concern.The characters work well together. Our heroine seems a fragile little woman, but her dark side is exposed in the beginning of the movie. The killer is frightening, but his polished roughness brings to mind a feline, or almost feminine quality.The most refreshing about the movie is the lack of heroes. All characters have their heroic moments, but at the end there is not one individual who saved the day (and goes to sleep to awake in Alien # ?).All survivors are flawed and have failed in critical moments, which makes you love them even more!The script does lack a little originality, (you can't help to think about alien) and there are some Discrepancies which are just a little to big to swallow, so all in all I'll give it a 9/10My recommendation is : Rent it, steal, or go see it in a movie theater, if you like science fiction/horror movies!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
a kickass formula movie,"sure we've all seen this type of film before. The formula is A group of persons are stranded or trapped in place full of monsters/aliens/zombies. But this film does a great job of executing that formula and thus it kicks ass.  It is certainly better than alien resurrection.  Vin Diesel shines in this movie as the murderous anti-hero.   He has great lines and most importantly does a great job playing his character Riddick. Go see this one, certainly not the greatest Sci-Fi film, but definitely a good one.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense action with a straightforward story,"I've been looking forward to this movie for many months, and I must say I was not disappointed.  Overall, the movie is an intense experience -- from the opening crash scene to the final surprise.  Listed below are a few of my favorite scenes:1)  Riddick ""dancing"" directly in the face of the creature to keep inside its ""blindspot."" Very well done, as was the whole special effect of the creatures' sonar ""vision.""2) The washed-out colors during the daylight sequence -- definitely gave you the feeling of being in a glaring, sun-baked desert.3) Of course, the great eclipse scene.4)  Riddick killing one of the creatures, and his retort ""Didn't know who he was F**KING with!""5) And of course, the white-knuckled crash-landing scene -- I was digging my heels into the floor trying to get that ship to stop!The only two nitpicks I have are (1) the ecology of the creature -- there are far too many of those large predators to be sustainable in that barren area, and (2) the double sets of rings around the large planet -- should not have been parallel, should have been concentric. I'm sure someone out there will be happy to go on about all the ""obvious"" scientific shortcomings of the film, but these were the only two that occurred to me while watching it.I saw it at a bargain matinee, with DTS on a decent-sized screen, and I think that makes a big difference.

Alright, it has some tense moments, I agree, and the screenwriting too, for the most part, remains well-paced, but the low-grade visual effects and the weird editing spoil the fun.At least, in my case, they did!Besides, there is not any variety in creature designs; they all look and behave the same.

You want to see Pitch Black? Just turn your TV off.,"Right from the opening I knew I was going to end up hating ""Pitch Black"" just because I have a unfair lack of interest for the sci-fi genre. So we're in a space shuttle and everything seems all futuristic and weird, the camera's making a lot of use out of the hand-held, shake to create a feeling of panic and we crash land on this deserted planet with three suns, creating an extremely off-putting filter, you'll be wishing it would just hurry up and turn pitch black!The filters are really awful and in bad taste, the range from an over exposed goldy filter to a strange black and white looking blue filter which doesn't really make sense, it's as if the directors just putting them there because he can. We are then introduced to far too many characters that we lose track of and therefore don't particularly care about! The least one being the ""hero"" Riddick, played by the lack-luster Vin Diesal who thinks that he looks cool by wearing swimming goggles in the middle of the desert! I thought he was about to jump into a pool or something! Anyway, he's annoying and egotistical there's no way we can like him especially as the other characters make out he's the bad guy anyway!After a long wait (about an hour) the film eventually revs up a bit, the planet plunges into darkness so we can get rid of the blinding filters and we're treated to poorly animated aliens and the film then plays out as one big rip-off of ""Aliens"" in the dark! This swarm of creatures attack the group as we egg them on to, however Imust admit there were times of excitement and some parts were well-paced.But when all is said and done ""Pitch Black"" is ""Aliens"" with a clunky screenplay and just plain weird directing! It's full of unlikable characters and an empty ending. Although there are times of suspense and exciting action, there needs to be more substance to find it engaging.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

The plot has more holes than the hull of Fry's spaceship.,"A deep-space passenger ship is hit by meteorites that breach the hull, forcing pilot Fry (Radha Mitchell) to crash-land on a nearby planet capable of sustaining human life. Incredibly, Fry and a handful of her passengers survive the impact, including mercenary Johns (Cole Hauser) and his extremely dangerous prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel).After investigating their new surroundings, the survivors come to the conclusion that they are on a dead world, all indigenous life having long been wiped out. In fact, there is one species still very much alive: flesh-eating, light-sensitive creatures that live below ground, away from the deadly glare of the planet's three suns. Unfortunately for Fry and company, they are about to be plunged into darkness by an eclipse that occurs once every 22 years, and which signals the emergence of the aliens from beneath the surface.The survivors only chance of making it off the planet alive involves transferring energy cells from their downed craft to a functioning ship discovered at a nearby deserted mining colony, a task that requires putting trust in Riddick, whose surgically enhanced eyes enable him to see in the dark.I'm willing to forgive the whole convenient 'breathable atmosphere' issue (as I do for one of of my favourite sci-fi films, Enemy Mine), but sci-fi horror Pitch Black throws up one unbelievable plot contrivance after another, completely ignoring logic in favour of thrills, thereby making it hard for me to rate it very highly despite some well handled action from director David Twohy, a memorable turn from gruff star Vin Diesel, and sexy Radha Mitchell in tight clothing.The silly plot simply leaves too many awkward questions: if the aliens have long eradicated all animal life on the surface, what the hell have they been eating ever since? How do creatures that burn up in daylight but which must come to the surface to feed evolve on a planet with three suns? Why do they even bother to come to the surface if they've already eaten everything? Just a few of the head scratchers that this poorly scripted flick fails to answer.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Riddick 2(or part 3 of the Pitch Black trilogy if you will) was about to start in the cinema and I only had watched the first one over a decade ago. The film still holds up! It's the character portrayed by Vin Diesel that makes the movie more than worthwhile. It's actually the mystery surrounding the character, not knowing what he's really up to and if he has moral values or where they lie.While Riddick does takes stabs at religion, the director and the movie itself do not really show any indication they have anything against it. A science fiction movie that tries to please a part of the audience. But don't be fooled, this is as raw as it can be. You won't and shouldn't get too comfortable.

Shine a Light!,"Nearly 20 years on, Pitch Black still shines as a compelling, original piece of science-fiction film-making, which ended up spawning 2 and a bit sequels. Of real interest is seeing the introduction and early positioning of our favourite Furyan, Richard P Riddick, as very much an anti-hero for much of the movie's length. In the sequels, the spotlight positions him more as a traditional hero. Pitch Black is also notable for both a fine performance from Radha Mitchell as Pilot Carolyn Fry and the contribution of the desolate terrain around the South Australian desert town of Coober Pedy, very effectively passing itself off as the three-sunned barren planet.Indeed though Pitch Black is ostensibly an American production, it has a very significant Australian element, besides the locations. Radha Mitchell and many of the cast members are Australian, as is musical director Graeme Revell, not forgetting the very talented cinematographer David Eggby. Mention of the cast members reminds me that Pitch Black is much more of an ensemble piece than subsequent Riddick episodes. As such the various characters are given differing back stories which do pique our interest. No one, least of all Riddick, is totally heroic. Even Mitchell's Fry (her best screen role IMHO), contemplates ditching her passengers, to better ensure her personal survival chances, in the film's harrowing opening scenes.The story, though reminiscent of parts of Alien, confidently treads its own survivalist narrative path, once the damaged space ship crash lands unexpectedly mid-journey. Good to see, the creatures when they appear aren't Alien inspired clones, like so many other examples from creature features over the past few decades, such as the very recent, disappointing Life. The spine-tingling night time odyssey back to the repaired drop ship in the film's second half is a mini-masterpiece of suspense, pitting the disparate, rag tag humans (+Riddick) against their horrendous extra terrestrial hosts.Vin Diesel arguably has achieved greater fame and financial success through his involvement in the Fast and Furious franchise. But for me, up till the present, the most interesting character he has brought to the screen is the always enigmatic Riddick, as first seen in Pitch Black.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"sorry, folks, but it's distinctly mediocre sci-fi","I love ""B"" science fiction...but I don't love ""Pitch Black."" The first half of the film is turgid junk, and the second half - while exciting - feels like a sub-sub-sub-standard version of ""Jaws 2."" In other words, you've seen this kind of scary movie a million times before, and it was done better 900,007 of those times.I must confess that Vin Diesel is an arresting screen presence, and Radha Mitchell is as lovely and compelling as ever. They often carry the movie when the expletive-ridden script falls completely flat.Aside from their performances, though, there's not too much to recommend this movie. The villainous creatures look like exactly what they are - modest special effects - and fail to generate sufficient tension.Really, the most intriguing aspect of the film (to me) is that it features several religious Muslim characters, which is practically unheard of for Hollywood. But, as you can tell, I'm really stretching to find points of interest if I'm reduced to remarking on that.Amazingly, this bog-standard movie was followed by two sequels - one animated, and the other a shiny CGI spectacle. Together, they form the so-called ""Riddick Trilogy"" - which will, unless I miss my guess, never become the ""Riddick Tetralogy."" We must be thankful for small mercies.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great movie.,"This is one of my favorite movies. David Twohy does a great job of setting the environment to make you FEEL like you're on an alien planet. The plot is, a spaceship carrying cargo and a few passengers goes off course and get into an asteroid belt, and then crash land on a desert planet. Vin Diesel does a great job acting as Richard B. Riddick, the cold, ruthless, heartless killer. Cole Hauser makes a great performance as Johns, the black-hearted Bountyhunter, along with Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Fry, who's stuck in the middle between Riddick and John's fighting. My favorite, though, was Kieth David (Imam). Kieth David has played in ""John Carpenter's: The Thing"", he appeared in ""There's Something About Mary"", and has narrated a few things as well. I think he delivers the best performance, followed by Cole Hauser.There's a lot of speculation that this is a rehash of ""Alien"", but IN FACT, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was a novel written by Alan Dean Foster in the early 1970's, BEFORE he wrote ""Aliens"". ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" novel had an opening like this (it wasn't an entire separate book called ""Pitch Black"", but it had a prologue like this.) This is a great movie, and has great performances, and all the actors/actresses fit their characters. This is a great movie to watch the the lights off, and while snuggling something. It's very scary, but it has those parts that WILL make you jump. I very much suggest this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stop making movies like this one.,"Ok, so Vin Diesel was ok in `Saving Private Ryan', but that is about it. Everything else he has been in has sucked big time. So I didn't have high hopes for this movie and I am glad I didn't. This movie is bad; in fact it is very bad. The story is lame, there aren't any actors in this movie, only people and it is very predictable. Vin Diesel is of course pretty silent during the entire movie. He is also a bad ass of course. Seems to me that this is the only role Vin Diesel can play. Bad ass silent type hero. I don't really know what else to say about this movie. I guess there are people out there who love this movie but I really can't understand why. This isn't a good movie, this is a bad movie. Now all say it with me now. THIS MOVIE SUCKS! I rate this movie 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A well developed sci-fi horror film,"Sometimes being known for only a few things can benefit an individual greatly. Vin Diesel has the luxury of this phenomena. Most of time, when actors become known for doing the same roles, they become forgotten and non-existent. So in order to break free of that, the actor takes on new and different roles to either round out their skills or grab their fans attention. Jim Carrey was like this early on in his career. Originally, he was the funnyman with hits like Dumb & Dumber (1994), Ace Venture: Pet Detective (1994) and The Mask (1994). But then he went on to do The Truman Show (1998) which was a totally different step for him. Again, Vin Diesel hasn't had any problems sticking to what he's good at. This franchise and The Fast and the Furious (2001) series continue to cement him in Hollywood fame without having to take on completely different roles. He has tried but they never took off.Here, Vin Diesel plays his second best known character to that of Dominic Toretto - Richard B. Riddick, a convicted killer who's got nothing to lose. While being transported, the ship ends up crash landing on a foreign planet with flying Dracula hammerhead shark like creatures. The catch is that they only come out at night. And the crew that is stranded is just in luck because a full eclipse is on its way. Ahh,...gotta love how convenient these situations happen. But for writing, convenience is the only problem. The rest is a well-written script that develops its main cast to the point of where they must come to grips with certain events that possibly audiences may not see coming. I know I wasn't, the actions of certain individuals continued to keep me guessing. This is important because that means it can keep the attention of its audience with ease. Plus, with the element of the unknown and high tension continuously keeps viewers on their toes.Diesel as Riddick is convincing enough. He has snarky dialog and definitely has a presence that's hard to find boring. In charge of the rest of the crew is Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) and although at times she's not sure of herself, she does become strong over time. Then there's her second in command William Johns (Cole Hauser) who has a grudge to settle with Riddick. His interactions with Diesel are comical at times because of how much they resent each other. Adding to the story is Abu 'Imam' al-Walid played by Keith David who adds a bit of a religious agenda into the mix. For him at least, he too as a character is tested, not only by the creatures but also by his peers. It is these kinds of moments that are critical in defining characters and not making them feel all the same.The special effects for 2000 are good at points. The alien creatures don't look recycled but visually, they do look fake at times when it came to CGI. There are physical props but most of it is CGI, which makes it less frightening. The action and gore are commendable. Vin Diesel has the chops for such requirements. The cinematography by David Eggby looks great. For the planets terrain, it looked and felt very dry. I do question the color scheme at times. It would swap between yellow and blue. Both looked great but just one should've been picked. Graeme Revell's score to the film is interesting. It incorporates tribal drums to match Diesel's prologue of animal instincts but other than that, it feels light. No theme or tune was memorable. Come on Revell, you're better than this. Altogether still a very satisfying franchise entry.The writing contains highly developed characters that will keep its audience guessing until the very end, along with its unique creatures. The only parts that feel weak are some of the visuals and Graeme Revell's musical score.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why I love Pitch Black...,"I saw Pitch Black in the theaters when it first came out. I didn't know Vin Diesel then, I just thought I was going to see another sci-fi ""Alien"" type movie with no-name actors. I enjoyed it at the time, thinking it was cool how the movie was so dramatically different having the beginning so light and the last so dark. The character of Riddick was cool...about as cool as a bad-ass tough-guy can get.Now, having seen the movie countless times, preferring the director's cut I enjoy the movie for three primary reasons: 1. Dialogue - Not many Sci-Fi movies have good duologue. Pitch Black has very good duologue with some moments of pure brilliance, in my opinion. 2. Character Development - Sure, the movie has its share of flat background characters...meat for the monsters if you will. But a few are developed nicely. Riddick, Carolyn, Johns, Imam and even Jack are all developed with some depth. You might even argue Paris but he was just an idiot. hehe 3. Story - It's just a cool story! With a great anti-hero...Riddick!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Strobos wrecked a great film,"I just cannot understand why so, so many films still have and in that era especially had strobo lights. Sure, it was cool new tech, but it's WAY overused here. Even simply making it fade smoothly in and out in 2-3 seconds, with less sudden brightness and a more level scene brightness that could still have obscured details with darkness.I got a terrible aural migraine attack from the very first minutes because of that constant flashing; there was no warning and now my right eye is getting blinded by that migraine and the pain is growing worse. Yes, I could've googled whether it might have them but with such a high rating and no reviews I saw mentioning this, I just didn't expect it, not in the least, I was just excited for some good space action.Smoothing the light effects out or combining that with only partial slower motion light on alarms or the like, would've fixed this even for many with epilepsy, for whom effects like this can be deadly. And for us with photosensitive issues like migraine or other such conditions it ""only"" causes momentary discomfort as some like to call this pain and the other symptoms, from hours to days, for example.But alas, now the only possibility is to have a device read the plot out for me as the meds start working. I'm just so sad I can't enjoy yet another lauded sci-fi film because of these simple to fix things. Big thanks for creating this piece of art anyway-stills and the story sound and look interesting, and it's great most people get to watch it.No offense meant to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Pitch Black is, by far the most detailed and mind blowing movie seen in years.","Pitch Black as proved to be the best movie i've seen for a while by far, ranking up there with the top SciFi movies made in forever. The Aliens movies (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, ect. ), The preditor movies even possibly ones that have made a large impact on the way movies are made, ( Star Wars). The Twists and the action dragged through out the whole thing pulls you to the edge of your seat every time you watch it, wether it be the first or the tenth. And Vin is just awesome to say the least the way he portrays the escaped murder ""Riddick"" and in away the characters evolution. As expressed in other comments about the small flaws conserning the suns  it proves that some people don't think with an open mind. the wonders of space are still developing so that the human mind can grasp it. Just because our solar system is postioned around a sun doesn't mean that the one in the movie had to. Our sun is the biggest piece of matter in the area making it have the biggest gravitational pull, rotating the other planets around it. Its possible that the suns in the movie weren't the biggest piece of matter in the area and the sun, as well as the planet they had crashed on rotated around a very large planet that held a bigger gravitational pull then any of the others. Well, thats just my view on this wonderful movie and if my, uh, ""Theories"" prove to be wrong and my spelling/grammer aren't the best you'll have to look past it as i'm simply in the 8th grade. heh.. Thats all I have to say...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pitch Hopeless,"Topline is that if you are a Vin Diesel fan, don't bother reading this review; just go and watch the movie. If not, read why you shouldn't waste your time on this.This is a slipshod action/adventure science fiction movie that does neither science nor fiction right. Get this straight through you before you sit down to watch it: This movie was made for one and one reason only, which is to massage the larger-than-life survivalist persona of Richard B. Riddick (the comic character) and the bossy persona of Vin Diesel (the actor). Everything else is in deference. Fan worshippers of Riddick and Diesel will doubtlessly be enthused--even fascinated--as other things probably won't matter to them, while the rest will be disappointed.Plot: A spaceship carrying the prisoner Riddick crash-lands on an unknown planet where survivors face-off with herds of alien creatures who hunt only at night. Guess what, a solar eclipse is just around the corner.Needless to say, Riddick does the lion's work of fighting the aliens and dispatches them to their deaths with corny disdain and one-liners while others end up being meal. Invincibility is always forced upon the lead role whenever it becomes larger than the whole movie.Visual effects aren't much with first half significantly better than the second. Alien design is nothing to moon over either. For most part, the feeling that I was staring at a cardboard set and not an exoplanet hung heavy on my mind. Poor job by camera department.Most characters are boring and have nothing useful to contribute to the story. Dialog is average with few one-liner comebacks allocated to Riddick.Movie's plot is nothing fresh; entire Alien franchise was built upon it. Problem is it has too many holes. Rules are set in the beginning for planet's environment and alien creatures but are subsequently flouted with impunity. Writing is banal and barren.Worst part of the movie is its action sequences which suffer from shaky camera and too many cut scenes, making it impossible to make sense of anything on screen until the flurry of movements stops. This is a deceptive tactic that many filmmakers use to conceal their lack of skills and imagination. When you don't know how to choreograph a scene, bury the action with fast moving visuals. Easy.VERDICT: 4/10 (DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!)(Watched on Netflix in HD and 5.1 surround on 01.09.2019)",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable film with interesting characters,"Pitch black tells the story of a group of 12 people who survive a forced landing on a deserted planet. It's about survival and trying to escape a hostile environment. This plot has been used often before, and one could compare this film to The Thing or the Alien quadrilogy. What makes this film work are well written characters and great casting.This particular group of people consists of individuals with widely varying backgrounds and mentality, which makes trust a big issue. Not only do they have to deal with the situation being stranded on a strange planet but the biggest threat could be their fellow survivors. You can really feel the anxiety building up during the movie which is augmented with a number of highly tensional scenes between characters.As mentioned earlier the characters are what makes this a good film. Early in the movie the audience gets to know the characters enough to have feelings for them. Vin Diesel plays one of the main roles as Riddick, the physically strong, bad ass, prisoner, anti-hero, who still seems to have some leftovers of humanity. Cole Hauser plays Johns, a mercenary with a medical drug habit, who is responsible for Riddick, and the tension between those two is exciting to follow. Then we have Radha Mitchell playing the vice-captain of the ship who has to step up as a kind of a leader and keep the group together, while struggling with her own conscience. Other characters get less attention but are important, the most memorable ones are three Islamists who believe god is responsible for every happening but have to admit that god isn't always nice even if you pray; Jack, a boy with a secret and a rare items collector who is not exactly the kind of person you would pick in your survival team.The cast fits very well into the characters; they look believable in their roles. Especially Riddick, who comes off as a bad person but still you oddly start to care for him. You get really drawn into the storyline and can easily picture yourself there with the survivals. It has a nice build up where you get to know the characters as they try to understand the planet they find themselves stuck on, followed by some faster-paced, exhilarating scenes where you don't want to look away. There are no scenes in particular that stand out, but you can find some clever dialogues.The visual display is nice, with nice looking scenes ranging from intensive scenes happening in complete darkness to very bright POV's. The editing is very tight, including no scenes that don't matter or last way too long. Sometimes you need to do something else while watching, but this is not the case with this filmTo summarize this review: This is a film that no fan of Sci-fi movies should miss, or anyone who enjoys action thrillers in general. Not the most memorable of movies but who was expecting that? A good movie with a great cast and interesting characters.In one word: ""verymuchenjoyable"". - 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good movie...,"Pitch Black isn't supposed to be believable. I mean, honestly, what do people make movies *about*? Not boring, ordinary everyday events, that's for sure. If the ship had crashed far from anything, what would there have been to make a movie about? Nothing. There wouldn't have been one. And it *is* possible to have a system with three suns. Only problem is, it's impossible to predict the movement of the bodies in that system. The only other gripe I had is that Riddick's eyesight didn't seem to be constant...and there was an awful lot of light around at times for a total eclipse. But let's ignore all that.Problem: Not scary enough. Too few genuine scares.Problem: Riddick isn't frightening enough, and is too obviously the 'good' guy.Problem: We don't get enough information on the characters - I didn't get attached to anyone other than Riddick. And Fry, a little. Aliens was much better in this department.Good: Character *development*, even though we have nothing really to start with. We see Johns sink from the good guy to the merc, Riddick almost redeem himself, and Fry face up to who she really is and try to do something about it. Not to mention Imam's faith.Good: The aliens. They're cool, and even fight each other like they should.Good: Riddick is not a superhuman indestructible superhero. He gets hurt like everyone else. He just has certain...advantages.Good: The ending. See that for yourself.Good: There are no clichéd 'I'm gonna die! We're all gonna die!' characters. I'm sick of them. Even the scared guy is kinda like Purvis from Alien: Resurrection.Well, that's about all.Recommendation: Go see this if you want to spend a couple of hours thinking about nothing in particular, and you can suspend your disbelief enough to overcome the problems I mentioned and the rather improbable starting point for the plot. If you can do all that, you'll like this movie.7½/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie was great!,"Overall I really liked this movie. Peter Chiang did a great job on the graphics of the creatures. He did a great job of turning a drawing of a monster into a 3d virtual moving creature that starves for blood.I think Vin Diesel did a great job of being his character, Richard B. Riddick. I also liked how Radha Mitchel really got into the film.The lighting on this movie was excellent! They put in just enough light so you could see the outline of each object or character. I really enjoyed all the slow motion action that was inserted into the film. The monsters looked very realistic. They didn't look as if they were added in, but as if they were really there attacking the small tribe of survivors.The only bad thing was I had no idea what slam city was until I looked it up on pitchblack.com but if I watched the movie again I probably would have figured it out. I think everyone did a very good job of acting their character. The casting was great. Even though I didn't know the cast, I'm sure this film will make them well known.

"Good directing and a great anti-hero keeps ""Pitch Black"" out of sci-fi cellar","Science-fiction films can be some of the most entertaining and intelligent films ever made and they can also be the cheesiest. ""Pitch Black"" falls somewhere in between, caught between the desire for alien horror flick entertainment and an intriguing concept for suspense and drama.Basically a group of space travelers awake from hypersleep to find their ship crashing. Their captain, Fry (Mitchell) manages to land them without killing them all on an unknown planet with perpetual sunlight. Man-eating aliens inhabit the underground though they are afraid of light, which isn't a problem until the travelers realize they will witness a total eclipse before they can repair a ship to escape on. They've also got a convict named Riddick (Diesel) as cargo.Riddick makes this film, in honesty. Everyone loves a good anti-hero, a guy with a bad rep that lays a beating on everyone and uses others' prejudices about him against them to look really clever. Oh, and a dude with night vision. Diesel gives Riddick the on-screen command his character requires. He comes off as brutish, but somewhat trustworthy. It's strange, but it really works.The rest of the characters aren't so great. Mitchell is a pretty good protagonist, but Cole Hauser, who plays Johns, the arrogant cop, acts like he's intentionally trying to be a poor man's Josh Lucas or Matthew McCoughnahey. It also doesn't help that the characters are under-developed, including Riddick, though that adds to his character in ways despite us wanting to know his past.The concept for this movie is cool, the way it goes from light in the first half to complete darkness in the second and the way that transition corresponds with our thoughts about Riddick is interesting. The plot, in general, is pretty lousy. For some reason, the writers opted to go with the disaster/horror movies formula of the 90s--kill off one person from the group at a time so only the characters that are well-received survive. Yes, there's that and the ""get the fuel back to the ship on time and don't leave anyone behind so we can escape"" cliché.David Twohy really saves the plot in those regards by keeping things interesting. He does some interesting shots that involve a lot of quick, simultaneous cuts and close ups--a more radical style that definitely works for sci-fi. In general, the color palette is very carefully chosen with the light and dark contrast and overall the special effects were very satisfactory for 2000""Pitch Black"" is not a consummate suspense or sci-fi thriller, but it does keep you interested enough to want to know more about Riddick or what else the imagination of ""Pitch Black"" has drafted. Basically, what could have ended up really ""b-movie-esque"" and terribly cliché and awful ends up solid thanks to some good decisions by Twohy.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
a type of film we haven't seen in a long while,"Have we all slipped so far that we fail to acknowledge actual meanings in movies? Have we forgotten that not all movies (specifically sci-fi movies) are restricted simply to tell a story? I think we have had too many films that are simply that-just a story (be it simple kid stuff like Independence Day or even ""adult"" stuff as .say, The Boiler Room).no actual theme. We thought that meanings and ideas are only conveyed in silly pseudo-intellectual [inmho, anyway] spike lee type movies. Well, I for one applaud Point Black for being that different-a deeper film with monster-action visuals that seems to distract most. Watching story-only movies has caused us to forget to actually even realize that there is a deeper meaning in a movie we watch.especially a ""silly"" science fiction movie.Well, simply put, I believe this is one of the best science fiction movies (if not movie period) to come along in a while. I simply love the characterizations that were shown...how we see actual growth. The characters are not all that they were or what they were portrayed to be in the beginning. The central characters are all vividly depicted, and with exception to the obvious monster-fodder, we actually feel content with how they mature. I guess what I liked is how the archetypal roles (the leader, the gun-toting hero, the bad guy, the idiot, et al) of like monster movies weren't always who you pegged them to be in Pitch Black. Anyway.I really like THE major growth of Fry and Riddick. I like how it all came full circle for her especially.And again, while there were the obvious monster-fodder, the film completely lends itself as an ensemble movie that instills the idea that each castaway was important. Because of this, I think the casting of relative unknowns was in fact justified. A review I read referenced John Carpenter's Thing remake as correlating to this idea of the characters not being expendable, as they most often are in like movies.There were comparisons to Mimic and Leviathan.but I don't believe those comparisons were justified. Again, I believe those comparisons are an example how the setting and the visuals were in fact distracting. I'm not saying the visuals weren't bad in the least, or even anything less of great. but I'm thinking people focused on that and only saw that alone. In my humble opinion, they could have taken away the spaceships, the monsters, the aliens, the surgically enhanced night vision eyes.and it still would have been the same movie to me. It could have easily been set on Mt. Everest with a modern-day plane crash, instead of a wayward spaceship, and it wouldn't have been a different movie. I resent the invalidation of this film as being just an Alien-type movie.Well, basically, Pitch Black had the old idea of survival, with an incredible, interesting  and refreshing portrayal. Despite others' ignorance of the long lost art of character development in a special effects movie, I whole heatedly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

NO FLAMETHROWERS!,"By now, everyone knows this is part of the Alien ""Puny Human"" genre, where a group of people are forced to face an alien threat of the like never seen before. The difference here is that the director worked hard to get everything he could out of the limited budget. The nerve-wrackingly desolate landscapes are effectively turned into purely claustrophobic corridors of dark by what has to be the most spectacular eclipse scene ever in cinema. The special effects are either subtle or over the top, but they always achieve the effect on the audience the director wanted. Despite limited dialogue, the actors throw themselves right into character, explaining nothing that they can't demonstrate with their performance. Vin Diesel, in particular, makes himself an irresistably fascinating amoral predator, who deals with everyone at face value.What really impressed me, however, is that there were no flamethrowers. In his illustrations for Species, H.R. Giger kept scribling notes saying ""no flamethrowers"", which were ignored. In fact, the flamethrower has become the worst cliche of the whole Alien genre, appearing everywhere from undersea mining facilities to L.A. sewers. Pitch Black avoids this crutch, impressive since flamethrowers would be doubly useful for the night-blind survivors fighting albino predators. The whole crew worked hard on this film, avoiding cheap tricks like this, and it shows.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The scariest scene in this movie wouldn't have made it past the Alien' cutting room floor.  There was very little in the way of character development and none of the characters were likeable.  In fact, the cast of characters is quite ridiculous and the dialogue is even worse.  The way in which Riddick, convict turned nice guy, confronts these aliens is an absolute farce.  The effects were alright, but I regret having paid money to see this film.  All this movie did was help me appreciate the 'Alien' series all the more.

"When in doubt, borrow from ""Aliens""...","I sat down in 2022 to watch the 2000 sci-fi action horror movie ""Pitch Black"" from writers Jim Wheat, Ken Wheat and David Twohy again for the second time. I remember watching it back in 2000 when it was just released and remember it to be an entertaining movie.And now having sat through it for a second time, I will say that yeah ""Pitch Black"" is entertaining enough for what it is, but it is by no means a grand cinematic experience. The writers borrows a bit too heavily from the 1986 action sci-fi movie ""Aliens"" in my opinion. And it makes ""Pitch Black"" feel like a rather unoriginal movie. Sure, it was adequate enough in terms of entertainment, but it was not an innovative movie.The movie is somewhat weighed down by a pseudo low budget feel that permeates the entire movie. I mean the sets and the props feel inferior and like something you would find on a low budget sci-fi movie. So that wasn't something that spoke in favor of ""Pitch Black"".I am not particularly much a fan of Vin Diesel, never have been, never will be. And his performance in ""Pitch Black"" is the usual macho guy taking on the entire galaxy and everything thrown his way and laughing about it. And truth be told, I found it difficult to take him serious with those welding goggles he was wearing. The movie does, however, have Keith David on the cast list, and that was something I had entirely forgotten all about.This is a rather simplistic sci-fi action horror movie, where you just lean back in the seat and munch on the snacks.My rating of director David Twohy's 2000 movie ""Pitch Black"" lands on a bland five out of ten stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best sci-fi's I've ever seen. Cole Hauser is brilliant.,"I thought this was a great movie. It had everything but the cheesy romance (thank you!). Cole Hauser is a wonderful actor and in this role, he makes me believe it even more. He makes his character so real and intriguing, you barely even notice anyone else (only as to how well they compliment him). Vin Deisel was a great anti-hero. He even pulled off the ever elusive one-liners, without sounding too practised. The aliens were breathtakingly horrific. The computer graphics were seamless. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes sci-fi, killer effects and good acting.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Will Action have a new king?,"I saw ""Into Pitch Black"" on t.v. and so I had to see this.  I must say, I was very impressed.Not only has David Twohy's style improved since he wrote ""Critters 2"", this film brought to my attention Vin Diesel.  Sure, he was there in ""Into Pitch Black"", but here he was ferocious, scary, and intense.  I haven't seen charisma like that since Schwarzenegger in the 80's.The story is simple enough, but it is the characters that make this film interesting.  Then there was what happens with the female lead. Unexpected. The dark humor helps the film move along, the effects aren't grand, but when Riddick fights the alien... it blew all of my complaints out.Diesel hasn't done a whole lot since this film that I would care about, but I am eagerly looking forward to the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic,"The first time that I saw this picture I thought that I had found a contender for my favorite.of all time to compete against PREDATOR. Well, it isn't THAT good...but it definitely is one of the better pictures to come along. And it certainly made a superstar out of Vin Diesel. I also think that this is the first place that I ever noticed Cole Hauser.Everything about this film is right on the money. The cast is awesome. The script is great. The story is excellent.

"HERE WE GO, AGAIN!!","Why do so many writers insist on taking a fairly good sci-fi story and screwing it up by creating an air-headed, dizzy, incapable female lead character, then casting a female actor who can't act? Then, to make matters worse, they create some sub-characters who are not only ridicules, but actually detract from the main story. I guess they need victims (food) for the monsters. This is a good sci-fi story with all the right elements and a strong male lead. However, it falls short in the female lead and in the minor characters.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most innovative sci-fi I've seen so far,"The second I first saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it and when I finally saw it, I was not disappointed.  Unlike other sci-fi's released around the same time, Pitch Black strays from any set formula, which in my opinion, makes it the most innovative film in the sci-fi/horror genre since Alien and Aliens. The acting is also top notch, the cast was well chosen and does not disappoint. The camera work was refreshingly different and highly energetic and adds to the breakneck pace of the movie. The plot twists are unexpected. Discard any preconceived judgements you've made on the sci-fi/horror genre because Pitch Black will shatter them all. Trust me, go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pitch Black Review,"I was a little skeptical of this movie at first. Since I associate Vin Diesel with modern schlock, such as The Fast and The Furious movies. But very similar to The Rock in early movies like Rundown, Vin Diesel gave a career-defining performance as Riddick. A murderous convict who, through forced eye surgery, can see perfectly in complete darkness and needs to wear goggles during the day.However, despite being detained in the custody of a mercenary, the ship crashes on a mysteriously abandoned planet with three suns. Slowly, it's revealed that 22 years ago, there was a solar eclipse that led to the bloodthirsty underground monsters eating the original inhabitants. Now the few survivors from the crash are forced to ally with the dangerous prisoner Riddick. Because in the darkness, you need a monster to kill another monster.As far as the survivors go, they're your standard horror movie tripe, a rude atheist, an opulent British merchant, a strange boy with a fascination with Riddick, a hardened female badass, and a group of Muslim pilgrims. The head priest of which was played by Keith David. Besides Riddick, I liked the pilot Carolyn Fry, played by Radha Mitchell, and the bounty hunter William J. Johns, played by Cole Hauser. Since both characters are morally flawed. Carolyn intended to drop the other survivors to their deaths during the crash to ensure her survival. While William is a drug-addled merc, who pretends to be a cop.Generally, this is what I enjoyed the most. This is a sci-fi horror movie about morally gray people trying to survive eight feet tall nocturnal predators. While relying on an uneasy alliance with a convicted murderer. With great performances from Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, and Keith David. I watched it on recommendation from my cousin, so I recommend it in turn.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The opening is amazing, but overall this movie is really slow and it gets too much time to finally see some action.","I had high hopes for ""Pitch Black"", the opening was tense and very well realized, it really kept on the verge. After that scene, the film loses itself in useless and way too long dialogues that do not deepen the different characters. Johns was so clichè, even for a first 2000s flick, he was absolutely insufferable and I hated every single moment that he was on screen. Carolyn Fry in my opinion was very badly written, she is supposed to be one of the main characters, but she is so flat and uninteresting. The rest of the crew was composed of unmemorable elements that thankfully disappear quickly from the picture. I did not like the cast at all, probably they were just at the beginning of their careers, some of them were later on in successful films, but here they did an awful job. Vin Diesel was the only one that managed to do a somewhat decent job. The plot is average, but entertaining enough to keep me going until the end, even though I started to feel the weight of the runtime by the end of the second act.CGI was low budget, but they did the best they could do with the technology that they had at the times. The cinematography on the other hand is at times very weird. There are a few strange color grading choices. I get that we are on an alien planet, but overexposing the picture or applying a blue or orange filter, without any reason should not happen in a professional product. This has nothing to do with the dated tools, this is something that could be avoided by being more diligent during the editing phase. It is a mystery to me how Riddick got two other films after this mess.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thought Provoking,"Behind the Facade of an ordinary Sci-Fi/Monster Movie lies a thought provoking piece of filmmaking by David Twohy! After Crashlanding on a seemingly deserted Planet,the Survivors soon realize that they are not alone. A total eclipse,which appears every 22 yrs. brings out creatures that remorseless hunt down their prey. The Movie shows that Humans are not very different from the creatures,which prey on their own kind in order to survive! Also no Character in this Movie is what he/she first appears to be,and the Creature-design is very original!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Movie,"The movie starts with a bang, the crash of the space ship. The scene is about 7 minutes long and it is totally amazing. You see the crew wake up confused and not knowing what had happened. Then, when they open the window-cover, instead of the anticipated dark space they find out that they are surrounded by flames and that they are on a crash course with some planet. When they finally land, there is confusion everywhere. It is kind of realistic (as far as you can say that about a science fiction movie).The planet is scorched by three suns. The cinematography is quite impressive, the colors are totally bleached so you get a good impression on the intensity of the light. Also the points of view of the aliens and of Riddick are really wonderful.I find it fascinating how the group of survivors is composed. You don't very often see Moslems or Arabs in movies who are not portrayed as evil but just as normal people. Also I like the changes the characters undergo during the movie. Or maybe they don't change but only our perception of the characters changes. So at first you think ""well, these are the good guys, and that is the bad guy"", whereas after a while you start to reconsider your opinion.The main character is of course Riddick, played very convincingly by Vin Diesel. In the beginning of the movie he is really scary, for example when he and Fry (Radha Mitchell) are together in the emergency ship they find on the planet, talking about Johns. They are alone in the ship, no Johns can come to help her, because they are undergoing some hull integrity check and the door has to remain closed during that test, and you find yourself thinking ""what will he do to her?"" You never get to know what Riddick is thinking because you can't read his eyes due to the ""shine job"" and due to the goggles he is wearing. So you don't know why he is helping the other survivors to get to the emergency ship. Is it out of pure necessity to get there somehow, or is it because he actually cares for the others? I like it that in the end of the movie he is still willing to let the others die on the planet just to save his own life. Only Fry's willingness to risk her life to save the others impresses him enough to go back with her. But does that really mean that he has changed?I also like the relationship between Johns (Cole Hauser) and Fry as to who is the leader of the group. In the beginning, it is Johns who they go to, but during the course of the film, Fry is more and more accepted as the leader. Of course that leads to some nice conflicts between the two characters.I like the ending of the movie.The acting is really good, better than you would expect of such a movie. Everybody plays his/her character totally believable and although some of the characters remain bland and are only in the film to get eaten by the aliens, the characters are well developed.The aliens are quite impressive too. You never see much of them which makes them all the more scarier. Unfortunately they are not as scary as for example the one in ""Alien"" but as the film is more a character based movie than a horror film, it doesn't really matter that much.There are of course some big holes in the plot, for example that they happen to crash land on the planet exactly when the next eclipse is due, that such a planetary system as depicted in the model cannot exist, and that they land within walking distance to an abandoned geologist's camp, but hell, nobody is perfect. You just have to ignore those things, and actually, they really don't matter. Great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scene Stealer,"I loved the movie.  In all it's visual glory it made room for people in the plot.  The creatures were well done ( I especially liked the little bit of biological study done by Riddick ).  There were some things about the movie that are borrowed from other movies and stories.  I can't fault anyone for being displeased about that.  But I found the plot to be stimulating anyway. I had vaguely known about Vin Diesel from other work he had done, but I was impressed by his performance in the film in that he literally made the character line every crack and seam of the movie.  I found myself waiting for him to give me a little more of the character.  I will be looking forward to him in other films and I will make it a point to watch what he has written and directed.   I really did appreciate this movie from beginning to end as a Sci-fi fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Its absolutely brilliant!,"Its one of the best sci-fi flicks I've seen for a good while & Vin Diesel as Riddick played an excellent part, as did Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Fry. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Alien films or Red Planet, as it is a kind of cross between the two. David Twohy has definitely won back me as a fan after Waterworld!

Not only are the effects good, but the plot holds up, the characters are pretty well developed, and the acting is much better than expected. Director David Twohy does an excellent job with the subtleties of this film and adding elements that can be open to interpretation. Overall Pitch Black is a great movie!

Taut Action Thriller,"I was right to make a point to catch ""Pitch Black"" on a big screen before it goes to cable and video.What a taut action thriller!

Cool use of electronic music.Vin Diesel is as captivating here as he was in ""Boiler Room.""And there's a couple of my faves from obscure TV shows -- the actress who plays ""Aeryn Son"" on ""Farscape"" was basically playing the same role (and she's not even the only strong woman character) and one of the cops, Colin Hauser, from the late ""High Incident.""Very unpredictable and surprising with no racial, gender, cultural or sci fi stereotypes.(originally written 5/12/2000)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Best Brain Out Sci-Fi For Decades,"Occasionally along comes a film which is not hyped to the maximum and generally comes recommended by a friend, my favourite Sci-Fi film of all time came to me this way, that film was The Hidden. Now it has been surpassed by Pitch Black, received the US DVD last week and so far watched it 5 or 6 times and the film just gets better and better.So where to begin, the start is excellent full of action not the usual eerie pan around the spaceship interior. The bodycount also starts pretty quickly. This leads into a very fast pace for the whole film all the way to the end.The sound (on DVD) is excellent and the visuals (although not scientifically accurate) are a wonder to behold, with lots of freeze framing going on. Characters are well in two camps ( those who survive most of the time and those who don't ), Riddick, Fry, Jack, Imam, Johns and to a lesser degree Paris all have some development throughout the film and add some interesting plots.The acting on the whole is very good and Vin Diesel deserves to increase his Hollywood profile following this film. The DVD offers a lot of information with the commentaries sections and would recommend checking these out. I look forward to 10th November when Pitch Black is in UK cinemas ( yes that is 9 months since the US release and some one should face criminal charges of cruelty for that ) as it will be a visceral feast to enjoy on the big screen.If you liked Predator, Aliens, The Hidden, Independence Day, The Thing or any other leave your brain at home and enjoy the ride movie then you MUST see Pitch Black.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Where do I start ?,"The most difficult part of writing a review of this contrived and poorly acted film is trying to squeeze ten lines into this posting from a film so totally lacking in substance.

As might be expected when creativity falls short in developing a new ( and potentially interesting ) idea , an extremely long night as one planet eclipses another , the producers/writers resort to conflicts and weaknesses among the cast of characters to provide some substance . It doesn't work , and there's nothing you haven't seen before .

Wow! This is a great movie!,"I loved this movie because it was more than just an action flick. Sure, the action and sci-fi and horror were great. But the interesting thing to me was the character study. No one was quite what the audience was led to believe they were at the beginning of the movie. You had to watch and listen to really understand who each person was. Johns, Caroline, Riddick, and Jack each had a side that wasn't what the other characters said or assumed of them. Of course, I should add that I had no problem watching Vin Diesel. I'm not certain he's that good an actor, but he plays the Riddick character very well and he's easy on the eyes.Action great, but that's on the surface. The characters gave a great depth to this movie. Hope you enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An exceptional science-fiction movie.,"This movie came as a nice surprise. I thought I had just about sampled everything: Strange worlds, beastly aliens, and the almost obligatory morphing. What else was left? Well, with 'Pitch Black' its more of the same. But the flavour and the texture are refreshingly original.The opening moments are formulaic enough, but they're neat and accomplished. A spaceship in space - yes. Even the director didn't care for that, which is a good sign. But it's all okay, and the camera doesn't linger. There is a very well chosen music-score that has a satisfying metallic quality about it suggestive of catwalks and airlocks that bodes well for the rest of the movie. It immediately feels like a complete package - you're there, right with them, out in space. Excellent.Vin Deisel has a rare and remarkable voice, it compares with that of James Mason or Richard Burton, and his silky, cynical narration at the outset carries a chill.Things begin to happen very quickly. There are interesting angles on old effects. Tension and conflicts arise and develop well.And that's how the movie proceeds. It's the old formula again: a group of people go somewhere remote and find something nasty they don't know how to deal with. But every take has a sly, new angle that keeps you guessing.Some very clever work is done with light - there being a world in a planetary system with three suns. And the special effects, although by now almost certainly CGI, offer plenty to admire. A developing eclipse is extremely well-observed and fascinating to watch. Check-out the contra-rotating rings around the planet, and the aurorae in its high atmosphere. Someone put an awful lot of thought into this. It's one of the most visually beautiful events I have seen in a sci-fi movie. And I do assure you, I have watched it a lot of times.The sudden appearance of the aliens is another surprise and spectacle. They go on to be suitably hideous and badly-behaved.One of the other real treats is the disparity of characters and the quality of their acting. I am only slightly familiar with two of them, but they all give a sterling performance. They are the best case yet for using cheap, hungry unknowns rather than squandering megabucks on big-name stars who can ultimately do no better. The slick, terse script brings conviction to each player. You are moved to care for all of them, despite their obvious vices. And you come away wondering what you would do in their shoes.On the surface of the planet, the incidental music changes to a kind of aboriginal percussion riff. It's simple, even minimalist, yet once again it suits the circumstances perfectly well.The whole thing hangs together as a piece so well that movie-making looks easy. It's only when you see some of the other pigs that you realise it's not. This one isn't perfect, but I don't intend to nit-pick; I like it too much.Excellent directing, good story, well-chosen music, solid script, believable acting, beautiful special-effects, sound and lighting. Just add popcorn.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

They learn that the creatures can only survive in darkness and figure that as long as they stay out in the eternal day of this planet their safe. Well they thought wrong. Soon they discover a mining facility that is deserted. They find out that everybody in this place was killed by those underground things. To make matters worse they also find out that an eclipse is coming and is going to cover the planet in complete darkness. Well, it does, and thousands, yes, thousands of these very scary and violent creatures take to the sky and start to hunt them down. Do they survive or do they perish?

"Amazing, original film, amazingly executed for the time it was released.","The movie has great moments where you're on the edge or your seat, waiting to see what happens next.

Most of the actors were brilliant, but most importantly, Vin Diesel pulls off Riddick SO well. I don't think they could someone to do a better job at this role than him. He makes Riddick bad ass evil and good at the same time.

Last one out turn off the lights,"I watched this because I wanted to watch The Chronicles Of Riddick and I thought it best to understand some back story. I wish I hadn't bothered.The odd thing is, a lot of people really like this movie. They think it's a low-key, suspense-filled sci-fi classic, in the mold of Alien. They're idiots, mind you. This is just dull.The idea is that a ship crash lands on a strange planet, killing most of the crew. Among the survivors is Riddick, a murderer being transported back to justice. The planet in question has a strange arrangement of suns, such that there is perpetual daylight. The place is a constant desert. The survivors discover a ruined settlement where the previous inhabitants were all eaten. It seems there are aliens that live in the dark beneath the surface of the planet. And that's when the eclipse comes...What follows is a story where the small band of scared humans tries to harness what little light they can while trying to repair a small spaceship to get them off the planet. And what about Riddick? Is he friend or foe? Well, I'll tell you what he's not: a very good actor. Vin Diesel grunts and rasps his way through this film with little or no effort at all. Sometimes he does a sort of evil chuckle which is really quite rubbish. And, for a film called Pitch Black, there is really quite a lot of light about, despite the supposed eclipse. While frantic extras are trying to huddle around a small flame from a Jack Daniels bottle, there's loads of light illuminating the hills behind them. Where's all that coming from?Unscary CGI aliens, identikit cannon-fodder humans, poor one-liners. This is the sort of action movie I thought we had left behind. All of which makes the prospect of the Chronicles of Riddick even less tempting.5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Everyone knows that an eclipse of the moon is when the sun goes between the moon and the earth, and you get the ring of fire, and other places. Her, the planet does an extended figure of eight - an extra loop- around the third sun, therefore a figure of twelve (loop*2=(figure of) 8 \ loop*1 = 4 \ loop*3 = 12). Perfect.

Pretty good,"One of the best sci-fi films lately. This one has a good story with many interesting and unexpected twists and turns in the plot. The cast are also doing good performances, and it's very nice to see new faces doing good performances. It's also nice to see that a film with all new faces isn't completely ignored by the movie-goers.The special effects are also great. So, I liked this film in many ways. The story, acting and special effects were good enough to minimize the damage director David Twohy was doing to the film. The camera work and/or cutting of the film is terrible. In some of the action scenes it's impossible to understand what's happening because the camera focuses on anything but the action and only make you dizzy...Anyway, this film is well worth the while, and I recommend it to any sci-fi fan. 7/10!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good establishment of mood, effective shocks, involving (though not deep) plot","I approached this film with uncertainty, having heard good and bad about it. But I kept thinking, as I watched it, ""This is a good flick!""By ""good"" I don't mean meaningful, terribly thought-provoking, or uplifting. By ""good"" I mean cleverly crafted, well-executed, entertaining, and involving.The violence is pretty intense, the language is rough, and ""God"" (this time from a Muslim perspective) gets an obligatory Hollywood slam.  In the plus column, I loved a dozen subtle directorial touches.  When you see it, you'll know what I mean when I say ""tap-tap-tap"" and ""Don't you dare,"" plus another dozen or so quick and interesting visual cuts.All in all it's a diverting tale and a good flick, if you can handle dark science fiction.

Looked Stupid,"I watched this movie simply because of nonstop positive reviews in IMDb about this movie. I have seen a pretty good amount of movies (including B grades) with this sort scenario where a group of travelers who get deserted somewhere due to a crash or something. I have enjoyed most of them. But here, since the beginning, it looked quite stupid. Characters does not fit together well. They seemed quite distant. Specially, the Muslim father and his sons who run around every where after the crash as if nothing has ever happened yelling ""Allah u Akbar"" looked really dumb and an insult to a certain religion. Other characters too (except for Riddik and Carolyn) were very uninteresting. Kid's character is so irritating. In short, most characters failed to get an impression on me. Only positive fact is the last 40mins or so which was somewhat thrilling compared to very dull 1st half. Once in a while, there is a movie which makes you relieved when it finally ends.

Really good science fiction film made better by the character Riddick.,"""Pitch Black"" is the perfect example of a film that clones most of its elements from a previous classic (in this case it's ""Aliens"") and yet still manages to be entertaining and amazingly appear somewhat fresh. Both movies involve a group of people stuck on a distant planet being hunted by an extremely dangerous species. After the initial onslaught, both movies then see the remaining characters attempting to survive while desperately working to get off the planet as soon as possible. So how can ""Pitch Black"" possibly seem fresh despite all these similarities? Well, the difference is in the details.When a spaceship is critically damaged by some sort of asteroid storm, the pilot is forced to crash-land on a desert planet that has three suns. Due to at least one of the suns being above the horizon at all times it at first appears as if the planet exists in constant sunlight. Soon after they arrive it becomes apparent that the survivors are not alone. A species of creature takes a few of them out before they have a chance to figure out what's happening. This reptilian looking animal appears to have a severe reaction to light of any sort and so the climate seems to be ideal for the marooned travelers to avoid contact. But when the three suns and a planet all align in a massive scale eclipse, the creatures are free to roam the planet, attacking any life-forms that they come into contact with. The crew will soon come to realize that they need to rely heavily on a convicted killer they were previously transporting if they are to have any chance of survival.The setup is a good one. The suspense builds dramatically as the light begins to fade away. But the thing that takes the movie to another level completely is the cast and the special effects. The effects are awesome, particularly when you consider that ""Pitch Black"" did not have a huge budget. In particular the initial crash scene is grippingly intense and kicks proceedings off with one heck of a bang. The creatures look real and frightening and the use of light and shadows works well for both the story and the budgetary constraints. The movie was filmed in Australia yet the planet appears alien due to the strange overexposed lighting used throughout the daytime scenes as well as the alien looking skeletal remains that dot the surface. Each member of the cast has a distinct persona as well as their own story to tell. Carolyn (Radha Mitchell) is an attractive young woman that comes awfully close to intentionally killing most of the crew during the crash landing in an attempt to save her own life, only to be considered a hero when they all live to see another day. She struggles throughout the movie with this cowardice and the undue praise that followed. William (Cole Hauser) is a morphine addicted mercenary intent on making sure a convicted criminal comes to justice. But the star of ""Pitch Black"" is undoubtedly Vin Diesel as Riddick, an escaped prisoner that the rest of the crash survivors rightfully fear. Diesel doesn't say an awful lot during the movie, yet every time he is on screen, he simply demands attention. I do feel that the creators tried perhaps a little too hard to make Riddick appear insanely dangerous, yet it's a credit to Diesel's performance that the audience still finds themselves in awe of him as well as hopeful to see more of him in action. The character was so successful that there is now a sequel called Riddick as well as a computer game based on him alone.""Pitch Black"" is most definitely ripping off previous films as stated above, but it does what it does tremendously well. Considering the amount of dreadful monster films that have come out in recent times, the grittiness, setting and Riddick make this movie a complete success. I highly recommend it to any fan of science fiction and horror.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
